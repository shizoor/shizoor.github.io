1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,320
There is nothing wrong with the subgenius hour of slack.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:25,320
Stupid, stupid is there. Large, polluting, the time-space continuum with J.R. Bob Dobson!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,660
You send a dollar to the church, and the subgenius, the old boss, one, four, oh, oh, oh.

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:44,360
And every of my days have I spoken of it then, for my every utterance is a lie, including this very one you hear.

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,040
I am the last remaining homo correctus. I am a goddamn man of the future.

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm 23 feet tall and I have 13 rows of teeth.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,200
My physical type cannot be classified by science.

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,220
I communicate without wires or strength.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,740
I am a fishbowl.

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,640
I am a bird.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
I am a trilateralist.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,380
I am a gold rush.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,760
You will get annoyed.

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,340
Sex, money, Bob.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,160
You will get sex.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,540
A subliminal message brought to you by the UK Subliminal Message Corporation.

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,240
Sex, money, Bob.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,400
These three concepts will always be in your mind.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,520
Sex, money, Bob.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,380
Sex, money, Bob.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,580
Sex, money, Bob.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,660
Sex, money, Bob.

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,920
Yes, this is a continuation of it.

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,680
Close.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,180
The doctor says,

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,120
God, press this.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,020
Money, Bob.

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,420
These three concepts will always be in your mind.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,520
Sex, money, Bob.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
Sex, money, Bob.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,580
Sex, money, Bob.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,860
Yes, this is a continuation of it.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,220
Now if we do an Ask Dr. Howell session later on today,

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,660
people will need to write their questions down on little sheets of paper.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,780
That's the way it's normally done, but if in the absence of little sheets of paper

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,860
we could have the direct question and answer.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,220
I prefer the little sheets of paper because that provides a necessary remove,

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,520
allows the shy to express themselves more vigorously.

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,200
Anyway, it's on the docket.

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,480
It is scheduled for today.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,860
And also scheduled for today, the gland escaping and acubiting,

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,520
the other important subgenius acts which are to be performed here on July 3rd.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,280
And don't forget the Quijibo snooty beer and wife swapping party

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,660
at 5 o'clock at Hydra Station.

45
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,220
That's right.

46
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,500
Oddly enough, I believe...

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,020
I believe that we'll see a lot more subgeniuses up there at the Hydra Station

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,880
or Quijibo Station than we see here now.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,380
Because we're not giving away free beer or snooty wives.

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,780
No, they're not free.

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,800
They're with snooty wives.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,820
It's that boy, Papa.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,860
That one that keeps following me.

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,480
What do you want?

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,500
I live here now.

56
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,920
I thought if your girl gave me so much eye back there,

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,940
I might return some of it.

58
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,580
What I gave you the other day was a looker indignation for what I've seen you do.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,060
It was you give me the eye.

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,080
You should have seen him, Papi.

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,380
Look me up and down.

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,820
I started my own church.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm gonna be preaching it on the streets.

64
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,840
You can't leave me alone, can you, boy?

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,120
I didn't ask you to come here.

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
I ain't asking you to hang around.

67
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,420
What the hell kind of a preacher are you?

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
I'm asking you not to see if you can save my soul.

69
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,780
Goddamn Jesus hog.

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,260
I'm going to come around with pieces of paper if you have questions for Dr. Howe.

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,560
Yeah, that's a good idea.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,620
Yes, Ask Dr. Howe Show is done that way.

73
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,980
You write down pieces of questions and then usually if we are going to have any pretense of authenticity,

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
someone else reads them to me.

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,920
That would be you.

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:37,920
Reverend Stang or perhaps even Princess Wee Ardo would care to be the one who attempts to decipher the snaky labyrinth of subgenius orthography.

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:47,240
Not everyone writes clearly, but we will attempt to give a clear answer however tangled the query which is submitted.

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,080
Mr. Dot.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,420
Mr. Dot.

80
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,420


81
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,140
Mr. Dot.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,140
Mr. Dot.

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,780
Nom Nom.

84
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,360
Nom Nom.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,140
The

86
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,380
Adler

87
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,600
Adler.

88
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,740
Adler.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
Adler.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:25,040
large asset. The large who made that little cut. And now, friends, Ask Dr. Howell is coming up,

91
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,240
but first we have some sexy stuff. I hope you don't mind. It starts with Or Kill Me Radio.

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,660
Almost every X-Day, the great entertainer DJ Shaver sets up his mix boards and a transmitter

93
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,420
at the Brushwood Campground, and long into the night, broadcasts within the legal five-mile or

94
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:57,020
so radius anything he wants. And much of it is from his huge collection of Bulldottom music,

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,880
but he also loves to grab random subgenii and put them in front of a microphone,

96
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:10,520
and that's all great, but one thing always befuddled me until now. Let us return to 12X

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,640
D-Day.

98
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,420
12X D-Day, live in the past.

99
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,220
What's another thing I don't understand about Or Kill Me Radio?

100
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,280
Why would somebody go to a campground to listen to the radio? Why would somebody go to a campground

101
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,420
to watch a drive-in movie, for that matter? Well, because it's raining, that's one reason.

102
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,320
When you're driving to the store, when you leave the campground or return to it,

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,680
you go to the store, you're listening to the radio, see?

104
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,680
Well, all we're supposed to do is freaking camp.

105
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:49,040
No, you're supposed to run around half-naked and do crazy stunts for Bob and, you know,

106
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,640
do homemade weapons and funny costumes and get real drunk and hurt yourself and get a Bobby Award

107
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,740
and tell all your friends about it and your friends all go, I'm going to check out subgenius.com

108
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,220
right now. I did, and look what happened to me. Princess Wee and I were driving around

109
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,520
Brushwood one night at X-Day in the pouring rain and tuned into Or Kill Me Radio.

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:25,900
We heard people, young ladies, saying such salacious things and making such sexy promises

111
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:33,040
that I could scarcely believe my ears, and so I struggled to turn on my portable recorder,

112
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,420
but was a hair late. This is going out across Amish land.

113
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,620
I was like, damn it, I missed the hot part. There was just a girl on X-Day or Kill Me Radio

114
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,820
talking about, come on over here and I'll suck your penis.

115
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,520
She actually did. I just heard that. Those very words came out of that girl.

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,040
Was that Reverend Gilda Valerie?

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,540
She wanted to do something funner.

118
00:07:59,420 --> 00:07:59,940
Yeah.

119
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Damn, we missed it.

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,500
Yeah, we did.

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,720
So there is a reason to listen to X-Day Radio.

122
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,480
I know.

123
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
I mean, it was just like one second ago.

124
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,420
I've just been thinking, why would anybody listen to X-Day Radio when they're at the

125
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,100
camp out?

126
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,700
And I turned it on and there was this amazing pornographic, well, I wouldn't be able to

127
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,340
play it on an hour of slack anyway. Not even a smidgen of it. It was so steamy.

128
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,040
Oh, you could have played it on one of your online X-rated shows.

129
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,700
Yeah, I know, but you have to. Right. That's true. I wish I'd recorded it.

130
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,140
I wish I was fast.

131
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,640
I wish I was faster than draw. I wish I hadn't failed.

132
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:54,300
It's a Maryland number. No, how can they rate me by knowing my phone number? Anyway, no,

133
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:07,980
my phone number is 379-4532. If you have heard me tonight, please text me. You can't

134
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,120
call me because I don't respond to calls.

135
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,160
I don't recognize the number, but you can text me.

136
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,960
It's the radio station.

137
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,680
It is?

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,120
Yeah.

139
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,440
You can't hear me.

140
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,540
Hi, I'm talking.

141
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,280
Sit in my face, Stevie Nicks by The Rotters.

142
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,260
90.3 FM.

143
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,560
How very strange.

144
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:39,480
Oh, by the way, last night, folks, you may not have tried this yet, but there's a,

145
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,200
there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a,

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,260
there's a subgenius radio station that only happens during Brushwood or Kill Me Radio,

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,820
90.3 FM.

148
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,620
If you drive into town, you probably won't be able to hear it, but here on the campground,

149
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,360
it's quite clear.

150
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,000
Now, yesterday, I asked, I posed this question.

151
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,680
Why the hell would anybody go to a campground to listen to the radio?

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Although I'm sitting here saying this at the campground for the radio, but last night,

153
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,060
we turned it on.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,740
As we were driving around to inform people that the drive-in had been moved, we turned

155
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,360
on the radio, and I heard one of the new reverends who's come here for the first time, Reverend

156
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,760
Dildo Valerie, who had earlier been claiming that things should be funner.

157
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,280
I had to explain to her that this was an impromptu party of old friends, and she just didn't

158
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,000
know anybody, but I heard her on the radio say, if you come up to the radio station,

159
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,860
we'll suck your penis.

160
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,200
And man, you should have seen old Ivan Stango hand over feet, gosh, guttling down to that

161
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,920
radio station.

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,320
She gave her phone number.

163
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Well, Princess, we and I were both listening to this.

164
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I immediately grabbed my little recorder, you know, and said, God, why do these things

165
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,560
take so long to start up?

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,760
And by then, DJ Shaver had cut some funny musical thing, but every time a song would

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,980
end, he'd put these two new subgenius girls on who really wanted some business.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,600
They didn't bring their own libations, and they were willing to promise anything, which

169
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,980
that's a subgeniously thing to do.

170
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:24,760
If a subgenius girl says, I'll blow you if you'll bring me beer, that don't expect necessarily

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,020
the blowjob.

172
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:34,200
By the way, on page two of your brochure, you'll find directions to the nearest liquor

173
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,080
store in glorious black and white.

174
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,380
Okay.

175
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,680
So do tune in, especially if you're horny kids or alone, tune in or kill me radio, and

176
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,020
you might hear an offer like that.

177
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,980
They were giving out their phone numbers and email addresses, Facebook, and these were

178
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,000
cute ladies, too.

179
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,180
We did, in fact, drive by the radio station immediately after hearing that and peeked

180
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,940
in and saw them.

181
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,320
Were you one of the promisers?

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,220
Right.

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,840
Okay.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
How long was your broadcast?

185
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,420
Does the offer still hold?

186
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,160
That's...

187
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,160
Did they go on for hours doing that?

188
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,860
I don't know, because we stopped at Doc Frop's camp to let people know that the drive-in

189
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,660
had been moved to the studio, and then we never left.

190
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,360
That's like an elf's or a gnome's secret area.

191
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,860
Where you're...

192
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,080
If you pass through the stones into that camp, you'll come out, but it may be 20 years later

193
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,360
and all your friends are dead.

194
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,760
So just be careful.

195
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,760
Be aware of that.

196
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,520
Yes.

197
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:01,200
Anyway, friends, the long and short of it is that the questionable ladies, mainly Dildo

198
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,580
Valerie and Reverend Bunny Day, since X-Day, have decided to start their own radio show.

199
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,780
Radio in Tarot Bang.

200
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,860
And they did.

201
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,840
And you can hear the podcasts at...

202
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,240
Get that pencil.

203
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,300
RevBunnyDay.com slash blog.

204
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,460
RevBunnyDay.com slash blog.

205
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:34,440
Bunny Day sounds like French for good idea, but it's spelled B-U-N-N-Y-D-A-Y.

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,400
What follows is an excerpt from their first episode.

207
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,680
All right.

208
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,940
Here's the question that somebody wanted to ask me.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,020
I'll listen to the question.

210
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,440
And Dildo Valerie, they said,

211
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,180
Dear Bunny Day and Dildo Valerie,

212
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,720
Will I be able to avoid having sex my whole life?

213
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,380
I am 17, I am straight, and many girls think I'm attractive.

214
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,280
One of my female friends gave me a list of reasons why I'm attractive.

215
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,360
I know that I'm good looking, but I don't want to have sex.

216
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,500
I think it is just weird getting naked with a girl, and I view the whole act of sex as

217
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,160
weird and primitive.

218
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,840
Plus, she would probably laugh at me when she sees me naked.

219
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,760
Because I have a penis, and it is large.

220
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,100
I hate how penises look.

221
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,000
The problem is that while I want to avoid sex, I can't stand the thought of being alone my

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,480
whole life.

223
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,980
I want to have someone to be there with me, laying next to me in bed with me, keeping

224
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,240
me warm on cold nights.

225
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,280
No matter how stupid that may sound, that is what I think.

226
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,880
Obviously, if I'm sleeping with a girl like that, I would be having sex with her.

227
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,540
You just don't sleep with someone like that and not have sex with them.

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,540
Okay, the answer to your question is that yes, you can go.

229
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,820
You can go your whole life without having sex.

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,000
And you probably should, because you're, you have...

231
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,100
Asexual.

232
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,280
It's called asexual.

233
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,400
You have asexual.

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
It's called asexual.

235
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,820
But you can't go your whole life without having sex with me, because I will get to everyone

236
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,180
eventually.

237
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,360
Leigh-Anne, next question.

238
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,260
And also, a lot of girls do not like sex.

239
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,140
Like, maybe.

240
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,440
So, you can just lay next to them.

241
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,740
Lay next to them all night and think about how cuddly you are.

242
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,040
Cuddly.

243
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,180
You should get some stuffed animals, because stuffed animals are really soft and fluffy.

244
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,140
And you're wrong, because penises are really beautiful.

245
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,680
Don't you want to put it in your mouth?

246
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,840
He doesn't want to put his own penis in his mouth.

247
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,240
He wants to put other people's penises in his mouth.

248
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,100
He should date a tranny.

249
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,720
Yeah, he should date a tranny.

250
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,380
Me and K*** were talking about dating trannies just a couple hours ago.

251
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,080
We both want to date trannies.

252
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Opposite trannies.

253
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,540
I...

254
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,420
Well, I have the hots for, like, everybody.

255
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,440
Let's put pictures of your boobs on the podcast.

256
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,400
Boobs.

257
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,840
On the ink computer.

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,200
On the ink computer.

259
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,500
Hey.

260
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,160
Come here, come here, come here.

261
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,420
He just said...

262
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,520
Shut the f*** up.

263
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
You're being an asshole.

264
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,520
I don't know the answer.

265
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,580
I don't know the answer to the login questions of y'all.

266
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,980
That one's fun.

267
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,780
We should smoke more in our lives.

268
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,460
Oh, you can put it in all my...

269
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,120
All of them.

270
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,060
Oh, yeah.

271
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,460
Oh, yeah.

272
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,900
Put it in every one.

273
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,680
Bunny Day and Dildo Valerie.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,780
Radio Interrobang.

275
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,220
Revbunnyday.com

276
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:59,220
Incidentally, I should mention that the costumes these gals wore to the 12X Day X Costume Ball...

277
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,360
They were both delightfully stark naked, but for a string.

278
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,220
A piece of twine.

279
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:17,720
That was attached by duct tape to the belly button of one and then to the cooter of the other.

280
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,420
An umbilical cord.

281
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,400
They came as a young mother and newborn fully grown up daughter.

282
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,480
It was actually pretty hot.

283
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,840
And death shall have no dominion.

284
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,580
No more shall gulls cry in their ears or waves break loud on the seashore.

285
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,520
Where blue a flower may flower no more.

286
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:38,520


287
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Lift its head to the blows of the rain.

288
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,460
Though they go mad and dead as nails.

289
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,840
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies.

290
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,960
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down.

291
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,920
And death shall have no dominion.

292
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,320
And here is Priestess Pisces.

293
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,240
I was just looking and we have lots of questions.

294
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,940
Lots of questions.

295
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,720
And more.

296
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,720
Which will be answered.

297
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,600
Job lots of questions.

298
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,700
Now, so you know how fortunate you all are.

299
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,500
And can appreciate the fact that you are all here.

300
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,500


301
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,500


302
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,200
And can appreciate the singular mark of fortunes favor upon you.

303
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,760
I just like to say that usually in my act people give me money with these questions.

304
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,820
In fact that's how I put three squares on the table.

305
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,600
And pay the landlord.

306
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,820
And keep from staring old man Stoavation in the face.

307
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,380
Yes sir.

308
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,920
But in this instance the questions are freely asked.

309
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,500
And no emolument or premium is required.

310
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,620
And no reward is awarded to me.

311
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,500
No pourboire will I accept.

312
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,260
Well that's not necessarily true.

313
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,360
If you choose to pay I will certainly accept.

314
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:56,960
But for the most part consider the ask Dr. Hal fee to be prepaid with your registration fee.

315
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,240
And your other tithes and mathems unto Bob.

316
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,040
So we're still awaiting the magical hour of four o'clock.

317
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,480
And coming up heavily on the clock.

318
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,480


319
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,340
And when we do we're going to lead with the old haymaker.

320
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,100
And throw the first punch in the free for all battle for existence.

321
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,560
Otherwise known as the ask Dr. Hal show.

322
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,640
Thank you.

323
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,920
Have you anything to say in your defense?

324
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,840
I mean your conduct in relation to your cloth.

325
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,780
In relation to your church.

326
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,280
Your licentious behavior.

327
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,920
Your drinking.

328
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,500
Your going with women.

329
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,340
During the time that I've been here you've tried to teach me the confession of my sins.

330
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,480
And your lies.

331
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,520
That is good for the soul.

332
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,180
Well.

333
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,520
You also removed all temptation from among us so that there's no chance of any sin here.

334
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,980
I've merely tried to put that right.

335
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,560
When I go to confession I don't offer God small sins.

336
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,080
Petties, squabbles, jealousies.

337
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,280
I offer him sins worth forgiving.

338
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,760
How dare you blaspheme.

339
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,920
God would never bless someone so steeped in sin with such a gift.

340
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,540
It must come from the devil.

341
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,600
The devil.

342
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,900
The devil.

343
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,340
The devil.

344
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,440
The devil.

345
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,480
The devil.

346
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,040
Who knows.

347
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,640
I only know I have this power.

348
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,860
I have always had it.

349
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,740
I can feel it burning within me.

350
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,640
Driving me on.

351
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,820
It is here inside me.

352
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,040
It is in my hands.

353
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,120
And I warn you.

354
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,760
I warn you all.

355
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,480
That I Grigory Efimovich Rasputin intend to use it.

356
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,480
The power is mine.

357
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,480


358
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,480


359
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,480


360
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,480


361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,540
And I shall use it as I please.

362
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,100
Sin is a trick on Bobs.

363
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,620
Sin ain't on my books.

364
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,000
Why don't you and I switch places Stang?

365
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,660
We'll accept them.

366
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,040
Are you taking these?

367
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
Do they go in a pitcher?

368
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,860
They're in my boots.

369
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,820
They're going in my breast.

370
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,060
They usually go in a special pitcher but they're going between Priestess Pisces breasts this time.

371
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,800
Yes we're piping it in.

372
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,480
We're uh, we're going in a special pitcher.

373
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,480


374
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,860
Making it up as we go along.

375
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,300
But it is a version of that well known trope.

376
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,340
The Ask Dr. Hal show.

377
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,140
We'll get to that in a moment.

378
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:23,280
For now let's hope that you're all enjoying this special historical moment at 12 X Day.

379
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:29,420
And have made adequate preparation for the end of the old and the beginning of the new.

380
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,700
Are there any more questions?

381
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,880
Only one hour for the beer tasting eh?

382
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,980
Yes.

383
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,540
I don't know.

384
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,980
Should we move Ask Dr. Hal forward 10 minutes?

385
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Because that will make more room for the bull dada auction.

386
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,580
And more room in my bra.

387
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,340
I say why not.

388
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,500
Questions are still being selected and collected.

389
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,020
They will go between Pisces breasts.

390
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,060
But now who's going to ask the questions?

391
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,240
It can't be me.

392
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,100
I have to give the answers.

393
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,260
Um, I could if you want.

394
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,800
Very well.

395
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,800
Let us begin.

396
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,800
But shall we change places here to do it?

397
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,800
This works just fine because I have trouble sitting on that in this skirt.

398
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,480
Alright then.

399
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,960
Let's begin the Ask Dr. Hal.

400
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,860
Because as I said,

401
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,520
sooner begun, sooner ended.

402
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,700
So the first one I pulled...

403
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,720
Oh.

404
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,440
Goodness.

405
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,420
The first question was memorable already?

406
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,640
Why, there was an emolument.

407
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,860
You know, in the show,

408
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,000
if I get an exceptionally generous one,

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,160
I do what we call a bardic recitation.

410
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
I erupt in some kind of poem.

411
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,760
The bigger the bill, the longer the poem.

412
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,580
I just got 10 bucks.

413
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,840
So I'll do a poem sometime.

414
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,740
Not immediately because I have a question to answer.

415
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,120
The question is,

416
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,000
Dr. Hal,

417
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,420
how would you punctuate the following sentence?

418
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,120
Alright.

419
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,140
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.

420
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,320
Alright.

421
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,260
That is, first of all, a sentence.

422
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,220
Let me point out that it is a sentence.

423
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,980
I'm sure many of you have heard it.

424
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,680
Many of you are familiar with the works of Dr. Steven Pinker.

425
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,940
His works on the development of human language.

426
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,960
The Language Instinct is one of his most famous books.

427
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,880
In it, he shows,

428
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,420
and I would say proves,

429
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,680
that such things as grammar and syntax

430
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,240
are not the arbitrary constructions

431
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
of grammarians

432
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
or people with too little time on their hands,

433
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,360
but the way language naturally occurs

434
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,180
and naturally falls

435
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
into the hard wiring

436
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,620
of the human mind.

437
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:35,980
And that is,

438
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,460
sentence structure is a given.

439
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,260
And even in weird languages

440
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,140
like Japanese,

441
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
they still do it, they just do it backwards.

442
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,660
But they do it in the same way.

443
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,120
And Professor Pinker has proved this

444
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,660
with the sentence just quoted by

445
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,560
Priestess Pisces.

446
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,500
That sentence I will now repeat again.

447
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,400
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.

448
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,040
Sentence structure automatically

449
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,980
imposes itself

450
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,520
on this sentence

451
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,500
and to punctuate it

452
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,480
maybe brings the

453
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,420
meaning out.

454
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,220
We don't have forever.

455
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,880
And I will now explain the meaning of the sentence.

456
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,060
Everyone knows what a buffalo is.

457
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,440
It's a large

458
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,060
graminivorous ruminant

459
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,280
with two horns and a big

460
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,680
frizzy head.

461
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,540
The meat animal of the

462
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,220
extinct Sioux and Cheyenne

463
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,720
Indians and so forth and so on.

464
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,240
This large animal

465
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,360
of buffalo exists

466
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,800
in the endless plains

467
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,760
or did at one time of our

468
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,120
country, the United States.

469
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,940
But for purposes of supposition

470
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
we're going to say some of these buffalo

471
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,140
live in Buffalo, New York.

472
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,380
Therefore they are

473
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,420
Buffalo, Buffalo.

474
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,200
And the first two words of our sentence.

475
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,260
They are the subject of the sentence.

476
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,080
Now we have to go a little bit

477
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,980
farther and ideally a little bit faster

478
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,940
since I see some of you nodding off.

479
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,960
We come to the active part

480
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,120
of the sentence. The verb.

481
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,620
The verb to buffalo.

482
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,200
Which we in the subgenius know well.

483
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,580
Yes we do. It means to swindle, to con,

484
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
to put something over.

485
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,220
If you are buffaloed, you've been swindled.

486
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,760
Therefore buffalo from Buffalo, New York

487
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,140
buffalo somebody.

488
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,960
Who do they buffalo?

489
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,700
Well the sad fact is just as in

490
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,720
most ghettos the crime

491
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,560
is committed by the people in the

492
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,440
ghettos against each other.

493
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,640
These buffalo, buffalo from

494
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,740
Buffalo, New York who buffalo others

495
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,140
actually buffalo other buffaloes.

496
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,840
This is the victim and the

497
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,040
direct object of the sentence.

498
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,480
Buffalo, buffalo.

499
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,260
Buffalo.

500
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,240
What do they, who do they buffalo?

501
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,340
They buffalo other buffaloes from

502
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,880
Buffalo, New York. Yes.

503
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,900
Buffalo is a plural as well as a singular.

504
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,780
Buffalo, buffalo. Buffalo.

505
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,340
Buffalo, buffalo.

506
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,700
But what

507
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,600
kind of other buffalo

508
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,500
from Buffalo, New York do they

509
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,480
buffalo? Well the kind

510
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,340
that they can buffalo.

511
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
The kind that buffalo,

512
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,260
buffalo, buffalo.

513
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,720
You see? You get it? You see?

514
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
So it's like buffalo,

515
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,500
buffalo, buffalo,

516
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,280
buffalo, buffalo,

517
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,260
buffalo, buffalo,

518
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,460
buffalo.

519
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,700
Right? Right? I dig it.

520
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,940
Now curiously enough

521
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,540
now that I've explained it,

522
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,920
this sentence requires

523
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,440
no punctuation whatsoever

524
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,440
as it is neat, concise,

525
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,360
to the point, and without

526
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,640
clauses or any

527
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,580
other additions. Let's go on quickly

528
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,640
to our next question. Dr. Howell, that was so

529
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,580
impressive that I'm presenting you

530
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,780
with the

531
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,360
wasp attractant.

532
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,820
Oh yes. This was sent to us by

533
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,300
some crazy person.

534
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,700
To those who weren't here yesterday,

535
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,840
the amusing thing about

536
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,000
it, it won't be so amusing

537
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,660
if a cloud of yellow jackets appears,

538
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,740
but the same person sent us a little

539
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,440
package of clear yellow

540
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,720
jacket attractant that

541
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
came in the envelope.

542
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,940
Obviously someone had a little bit of mischief

543
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
in mind, but Reverend Stang

544
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
determined that no one would

545
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,640
bring that plastic packet of

546
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,820
yellow jacket attractant to

547
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Ex Day. However, no one can tell for

548
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,920
sure whether someone didn't

549
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,020
pick it up and bring it, I would say

550
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,980
in passing. Anyway,

551
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,920
let's hurry up and answer another

552
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,860
question. Dr.

553
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,780
Howell, how can I defend myself

554
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,900
from the idiocracy?

555
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,340
Well, how can you defend yourself?

556
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,900
They come at you from all sides. They come at

557
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,660
you with knives. They come at you with guns.

558
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,740
They come at you with disrespectful

559
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,900
comments and

560
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,820
things which damage your

561
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,060
dignity and your sense of self,

562
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,500
your amour-propre.

563
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,460
Can you deflect

564
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,620
these slings and arrows

565
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,920
by wearing thicker and thicker armor?

566
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,820
Well, if you were, you might end

567
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,940
up as an immobile statue

568
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,680
encased in glittering

569
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,780
steel and safe, but

570
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,080
unable to move. The fact is,

571
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,540
for maneuverability,

572
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,960
for movement, which is more

573
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,940
valuable than protection, you need

574
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,280
to give up a little bit of protection.

575
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,740
Movement is in itself protection,

576
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,860
and if you can bob and

577
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,760
weave, if you can dodge

578
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,620
and duck, then you

579
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,840
have something better than armor.

580
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
You have the potential, the

581
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
kinetic possibility of being elsewhere

582
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,940
than the place

583
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,560
the bullet, the arrow,

584
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,520
the catapult, bolt,

585
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,820
the crossbow bolt, or the, um,

586
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,960
oh no, oh my,

587
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,380
well, we're going to introduce another

588
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,500
Dr. Hal tradition here.

589
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,660
Anyway,

590
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,840
the best way to protect yourself is to keep

591
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,100
on your feet, to be nimble.

592
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,920
Don't hunker down in your

593
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,860
fortress, because as

594
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,680
General George Patton said,

595
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,180
fixed fortifications

596
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,000
are a monument to the stupidity

597
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,720
of man. If you can overcome

598
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,640
mountain ranges and continents,

599
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,080
you can overcome forts,

600
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,740
fortresses and redouts, and you can

601
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,920
overcome the individual who

602
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,580
thinks he's going to be a

603
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,540
survivalist and do it all on his own.

604
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,520
That guy is the first guy

605
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,920
to fall when things

606
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,860
change. Folks, every now and then,

607
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,720
in the Ask Dr. Hal show,

608
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,360
we have a little ritual

609
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,760
which we perform, and that is

610
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,800
if you ask a question which we consider

611
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,480
an exceptionally good one,

612
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,700
we pour you a free shot

613
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,620
of Fernet Branca,

614
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,840
the miracle liquid. Oh,

615
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,900
it's a miracle. Why anyone would drink it?

616
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,840
But it's the subject of its own

617
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,700
cult, and I think whoever

618
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,840
asked the buffalo question already

619
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,580
deserves a shot and should come up

620
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,640
and drink the shot.

621
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,040
So please do,

622
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,760
and while you do, we'll answer another

623
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,320
question, just to keep this thing

624
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,760
rolling further on.

625
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,800
This one also comes with a little bit

626
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,880
of cash. Oh, how that is

627
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,040
elevated, progressive, and correct.

628
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,000
And the question is,

629
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,520
Dr. Hal. Yes?

630
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,440
What?

631
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,160
What?

632
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,340
Yes, that's what it says.

633
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,800
Well, what is

634
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,960
that which

635
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,940
exists but is not

636
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,900
known? And what,

637
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,060
written with a question

638
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,840
mark, is interrogative

639
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,660
and is a question?

640
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,780
The question is, what

641
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,940
is that which exists and

642
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,140
is not known?

643
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,520
The sensory apparatus

644
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,820
of humanity is

645
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,760
only capable of bringing in

646
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,640
a certain amount of information, and

647
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
then we also rely on the

648
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
neosphere, the

649
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,540
extrasomatic

650
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,440
load

651
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,680
that we have

652
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,820
laboriously constructed, like

653
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,660
an anthill or

654
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,440
a termite mound. Around

655
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,020
this are human

656
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,280
civilization. Or as

657
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,320
the Roman writer

658
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,900
Terence wrote,

659
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,460
exige monumentum requere

660
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,880
circumspeci. If you want to see

661
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,060
a monument, just look around.

662
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,620
Because it's rather

663
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,640
hard not to

664
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,140
find the what.

665
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,760
And if you can avoid it,

666
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,540
then maybe you can find

667
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,780
something even better. Which,

668
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,700
as you focus on it, is

669
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,760
clearly the which and not

670
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,120
the what.

671
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,100
One more, Pisces, please.

672
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,740
Okay, one more. Let's see.

673
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,920
More

674
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,620
trying to read. It's really long, I'm sorry.

675
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,400
Go ahead. Go ahead.

676
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,560
If, as Pisces mentioned yesterday on the

677
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,780
Live Hour of Slack, that the auditory emanations

678
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
of a female in pain are similar to the

679
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,860
female in orgasm, what does that

680
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,900
tell us about the sacred subgenius sacrament

681
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,600
of sex hurt?

682
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
Well, it says that

683
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,260
this female, whether

684
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,780
in orgasm or in

685
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
pain, needs the assistance

686
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,080
of a subgenius.

687
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,300
And therefore,

688
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,780
subgeniuses should always be

689
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,740
ready when these telltale

690
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,700
sounds are heard to

691
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,720
come rushing to the

692
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,740
assistance of the afflicted

693
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,160
or orgasmic individual.

694
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,900
I know none of you

695
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,920
will falter or fail

696
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,320
in this sacred trust.

697
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,840
There are lots, we have lots

698
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,800
of more questions, but this one... Well, keep shoveling

699
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,140
at them because... This one is pretty blatant,

700
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,860
which is... Blatant? Nothing's

701
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,360
too blatant. Dr. Howe! Yes?

702
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,620
What the fuck are we doing here in this cold

703
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,060
weather?

704
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,820
They've

705
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,540
said...

706
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,340
Somebody said that...

707
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,620
What happened to that bottle of Fernet?

708
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,060
We're looking

709
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,840
for suitable drinking cups.

710
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,520
Ah, yes, that's good. You sure can't

711
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,640
swill it out of the bottle. You might want to drink it out of the cap

712
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,760
because some people think the

713
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,560
fewer drops of that you drink,

714
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,740
the better. I'm sorry, please remind

715
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,540
me of the question very quickly one more time.

716
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,920
What the fuck are we doing here in this cold

717
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,680
weather? Yes. It has been

718
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,880
said that the person who

719
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,900
repeats the same thing over and over again and

720
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,840
gets the same result, which is not the

721
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,720
desired...

722
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,840
result, is a broken person

723
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,080
or a crazy person.

724
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
But I say unto you

725
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
that this is potentially

726
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,120
a wise person.

727
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,000
Because sometimes you need to hammer, hammer,

728
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,580
hammer on that hard

729
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,680
road of discovery to

730
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,860
receive what reward one

731
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,040
can get from intellection.

732
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,380
Or to put it a different way,

733
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,840
if the fool will persist in

734
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,580
his folly, he will become

735
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,380
wise. Therefore,

736
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,860
it is my ruling here that you are

737
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,920
all here because you are on

738
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,780
route to becoming wise

739
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,100
guys and gals.

740
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,840
Well, there's also the

741
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,880
fact that we... I mean,

742
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,360
we could have these in a hotel

743
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,540
like a sci-fi

744
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,760
convention or a comic book

745
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,000
convention. Hey, that would be fun.

746
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,540
The showers run forever.

747
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,080
That's all it is.

748
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,240
You know, the fact that we have to

749
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,520
survive this brutal

750
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
weather, it bonds us, it brings

751
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,860
us together. Better to go off into

752
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,200
a remote wilderness

753
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,240
to do what we do.

754
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,740
Alright.

755
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,540
How about that Fernet Branca, huh?

756
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,540
Not for nothing is it called the

757
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,660
miracle liquid. Let's put the bottle right up

758
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,300
on the table as a reminder

759
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,800
of the reward for asking a good question.

760
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,680
Yes.

761
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,160
Let's answer another one quickly.

762
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,480
I cannot even hardly read this, so I'm going to read

763
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,740
what I think it says, and if I'm wrong, then that's their fault.

764
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,540
You can also hand it to me. What are your

765
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,960
favorite topless celebrity and why?

766
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,820
I'm not sure that's... Favorite

767
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,760
topless celebrities.

768
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,900
That's an interesting one. Let me see if that

769
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,520
is what it says. My favorite...

770
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,220
Tipples. Tipples?

771
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,700
Tipples.

772
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,340
Tipples? T-I-P-P-L-E-S

773
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,980
Tipples, which according to the

774
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,920
drink are... according to the

775
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,720
dictionary are drinks, the forms of drinks.

776
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,640
But then what does it say?

777
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,560
Tipples...

778
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,600
And what are these next

779
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,360
three lines?

780
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,400
And what?

781
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,080
Tipples... This is a bracket,

782
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,660
a parenthesis, and an end parenthesis.

783
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,780
Oh, alcohol. Alcohol.

784
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,600
What are your favorite tipples and why?

785
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
Well, my favorite ones are

786
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,800
all the ones that the doctors

787
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,260
won't allow me to have. Yeah, the doctors.

788
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,960
Those medicos, they've really got

789
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,700
it against me. The ones that I

790
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,680
long for

791
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,260
are the ones that I'm just

792
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,900
not well suited in my

793
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,680
dotage to drink. Rum,

794
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,800
for example. Delicious

795
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,840
rum. Rum, rum, rum. It's mostly

796
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,800
sugar. Can't drink it. But I

797
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,060
sure like it. Yep.

798
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,820
My favorite ones may be the ones

799
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,920
I can't drink. The ones heavily

800
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,760
freighted and weighted

801
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,560
with nature's perfect food,

802
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,580
sugar. But

803
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,940
that's... You know, I used to like to drink

804
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,920
white Russians because

805
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,880
of that movie, because I had a

806
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,380
girlfriend who liked that movie where

807
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,920
everybody drank white Russians. And sure, why not?

808
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,180
I drank those. But

809
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,640
now I have to

810
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,620
drink the more purely

811
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,220
alcoholic concoctions.

812
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,920
Vodka and whiskey neat.

813
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,020
Of course, it does say in the old

814
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,940
book, take a little wine for thy

815
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,980
stomach's sake. And since I would

816
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,560
hardly want to slight

817
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,860
my abdomen, I do that

818
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,600
too. Okay.

819
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,680
The next question is, how is

820
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,680
babby formed?

821
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,960
How is babby? How is babby

822
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,340
formed?

823
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,740
Babby. Yes, babby.

824
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,240
Babby in his mama's

825
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,060
womb. Well, you know,

826
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,060
a long time ago,

827
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,100
not so long as we measure

828
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,860
time, they used to think that

829
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,220
ontogeny recapitulated phylogeny.

830
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
And that

831
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,520
was a very satisfying

832
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,960
explanation. And like most satisfying

833
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,220
explanations, completely erroneous

834
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,820
as to

835
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,600
whether the

836
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,800
scientific

837
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,660
documents in question were

838
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,500
deliberately falsified.

839
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,720
I think the jury may be out on that

840
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,760
because once you stare through

841
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,720
a microscope for so long,

842
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,620
your waters start

843
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,080
to eye, you know.

844
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,400
And then

845
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,540
you realize you might be drawing

846
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,600
structures which you really think

847
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,680
are there, and by gosh, ought to be there,

848
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,300
but what do you know, other more

849
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,840
keen-eyed, eager beaver

850
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,860
scientists can't see them, and they

851
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,400
will rake you over the

852
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,100
coracal coals.

853
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,280
So this is indeed

854
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,200
what happened

855
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,540
in the case of the great creator

856
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,500
of art forms in nature,

857
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,600
and his

858
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,740
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny

859
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,420
theory. It was thought that

860
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,400
in the womb, Babby went

861
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,740
through early evolutionary stages.

862
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,740
At one time having the gills

863
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,940
of a fish and the tail of a reptile.

864
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,800
And it's true, but that's not

865
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,920
because it's going through evolutionary stages

866
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,960
ontogenetically.

867
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,040
But because,

868
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,820
folks, we are

869
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,660
that reptile. We are

870
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,880
that fish. Those are just parts of

871
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,580
us that are developing in

872
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,080
the brew, in the stew

873
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,920
that you get when you make

874
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,880
a humi like me and you.

875
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,680
And

876
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,500
Babby is formed

877
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,780
very elegantly in most cases,

878
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
except some of those

879
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,080
who come out not

880
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,960
losing and still able to be

881
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,920
using their reptilian

882
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,220
or fishy adornments.

883
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,140
And I've known some of those folks

884
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,660
out there. The nicest

885
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,380
folks you'll ever meet.

886
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,440
Priestess fishy there.

887
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,060
And speaking of

888
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,160
origins of things,

889
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,600
the next question is, Dr. Howell,

890
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,220
what are the origins of Dada?

891
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,280
Dada.

892
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,280
Well, Dada occurred

893
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,540
when a bunch of people

894
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,500
got together and decided society

895
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,960
was too stodgy and needed

896
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
to be lit up and stood up

897
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,000
on its end and hollered at

898
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,820
and slapped several times and hit

899
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,320
in the kisser with a wet fish.

900
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,580
And at that time when everybody

901
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,360
had to wear collar buttons,

902
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,560
stays, silk hats,

903
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,460
and waxed mustaches,

904
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,740
things certainly were uptight and

905
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,200
they did need that

906
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,220
pisces wallop. But

907
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,860
ever since, everything's become

908
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,920
Dada. And so now

909
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,040
people try vainly

910
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,020
for a refuge

911
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,760
from the avalanche of

912
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,840
meaningless surrealism

913
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,640
which falls upon us from

914
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
every direction, largely because

915
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,760
of poor planning and

916
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
that old bugaboo

917
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,240
human pig ignorance.

918
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,160
And yet, if we can

919
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,960
locate and center upon

920
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,880
the stodginess, then

921
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,340
we can still produce

922
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,420
meaningful Dada.

923
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,940
Rather to say, meaningfully

924
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,900
meaningless Dada

925
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,820
which would delight the

926
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,480
heart of Alfred Jari,

927
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,560
himself.

928
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,080
Reverend New Monet coined a word

929
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,140
for the crappy

930
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,660
fake surrealism

931
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,860
that's used in TV commercials

932
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,820
and things now.

933
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,260
Surreanality.

934
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,800
Mmm, sounds painful.

935
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,700
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, but I think

936
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,060
it's Surreanality.

937
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,540
That is loosely connected to the next question.

938
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,600
Well that's good, and I see

939
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,220
Princess Wee is coming up with a

940
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,200
vessel from which the

941
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,460
postulants can drink their

942
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,080
coffee.

943
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,420
I think that's a good question.

944
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,020
Since the idiocracy

945
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,120
and the singularity are perpetually

946
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,540
canceling each other out,

947
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,840
will computers eventually become stupid enough

948
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,760
to compete with human or yeti foolishness?

949
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,980
Those computers will fall by

950
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,240
the wayside and be

951
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,860
judged to be a human

952
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,800
artifact by the remaining

953
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,840
purified level of computers

954
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
who will be on their own.

955
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,100
Just because the singularity

956
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,780
has occurred doesn't mean they will

957
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,100
take all computer garbage

958
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,300
in unto themselves

959
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,680
as anything more than a

960
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,120
small and rarely consulted

961
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,460
file of historical memory.

962
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,060
Okay.

963
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,940
Let me double check, but I think

964
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,980
we only have one more. Hold on.

965
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,500
Very good. Then I'll do the poem.

966
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,780
And then we can start getting ready for the

967
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,940
fabulous slack auction

968
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,600
which is going to occur right here

969
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,500
on the stage. The Bulldada auction.

970
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,400
You don't want to miss this, folks.

971
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,900
But we still have one question left in the air.

972
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,840
Ask Dr. Halstow.

973
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,060
And the querent inquires,

974
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,460
who put the queer in query?

975
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,480
Who put the queer in query?

976
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,500
That's a very good one.

977
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,680
You see, most people

978
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,580
say query, but

979
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,060
you can say query. That is one of the

980
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,840
pronunciations that the dictionary

981
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,500
offers. Now,

982
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,780
on the other hand, the word

983
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,440
queer

984
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,260
has always meant

985
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,140
non-standard or

986
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,420
non-usual. It is seized

987
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,600
and run as

988
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,560
a guide on by the

989
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,400
militant queers

990
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,200
and transgendered

991
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,780
pansexuals,

992
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,160
transsexuals, and so forth.

993
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,540
But they are

994
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,200
taking on themselves

995
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,800
the glory of

996
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,520
anomalousness.

997
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,600
To others, anything

998
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,940
which is out of order

999
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,260
is suspect.

1000
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,680
Like the famous story

1001
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,140
of the Greek tyrant

1002
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,260
gave the answer for

1003
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,220
control of the populace.

1004
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,740
When you see stocks that are higher than the other stocks,

1005
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,040
you chop them off.

1006
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,280
And then you have even

1007
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,700
stocks. Now, who put the queer

1008
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,020
in query?

1009
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,520
More of those folks I was talking about

1010
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,860
early. We call them jailers

1011
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,660
because they want to jail

1012
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,920
you, to confine you in categories

1013
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,620
and make you ashamed

1014
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,580
for transcending your

1015
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,420
categories or even

1016
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,860
reaching out of

1017
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,600
autism far enough to reach

1018
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,640
the medicine cabinet or the

1019
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,720
light switch. Well, thank you ladies and

1020
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,760
gentlemen. This seems to wrap up our...

1021
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,300
Oh, you have one more? One more. It was a

1022
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,940
last-minute entry by

1023
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,600
a beautiful woman. I couldn't really

1024
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,260
say anything else about it.

1025
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,580
We say we're going to show the last

1026
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,480
question, but then there's another one.

1027
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,520
This is truly the last question. It was a last-minute

1028
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,820
entry by a beautiful woman.

1029
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,740
And the question is,

1030
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,160
Dr. Howell, what is hip?

1031
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,060
What is hip?

1032
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,840
Yeah. Oh, what is

1033
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,140
hip?

1034
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,440
Didn't we have that one before?

1035
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,840
I think we've had it before. I've certainly had it before.

1036
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,500
And I've had it with that question. But

1037
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,820
you'll never get

1038
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,740
hip if you want Dr. Howell

1039
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
or somebody else to define it for

1040
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,860
you. You've got to be out there making

1041
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,440
that large, embarrassing,

1042
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,820
flagrant example on your own.

1043
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,620
You won't necessarily

1044
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,820
be hip, but you certainly won't be

1045
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,460
if you don't try it. But

1046
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,820
hip, which originally

1047
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,100
derived from the 1940s,

1048
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,640
HEP, or

1049
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,020
being a HEP cat, a cat

1050
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,640
who was HEP or

1051
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,980
in line, or in a line of

1052
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,880
understanding to something that was going on,

1053
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,620
was ripped off

1054
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,440
by the intellectual community

1055
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,920
from where they get all their ideas, the black

1056
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,800
community, the community of

1057
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,220
black musicians.

1058
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,660
And then, since white people are

1059
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,460
thin-blooded, they wouldn't even

1060
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,800
continue to pronounce the word

1061
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,140
HEP with its

1062
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,720
soft E, but had to make it HIP

1063
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,460
just the way a lot of people

1064
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,000
want to borrow a pencil

1065
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,820
or that sort of thing.

1066
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,520
You know, a very irritating way of talking.

1067
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,080
But it does affect the evolution of language.

1068
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,700
So, one

1069
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,840
is HIP if one is

1070
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,340
in line with

1071
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,700
that type of thought,

1072
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,600
which it is good

1073
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,840
to be HIP too. But you have to

1074
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,660
try all kinds to

1075
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,640
triangulate

1076
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,100
yourself. Unless

1077
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,300
the benevolent

1078
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,320
Bob-tism of Dobbs

1079
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,620
shineth upon you. And then without even

1080
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,400
trying, but effortlessly,

1081
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,740
the ripe fruit will fall

1082
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,920
into your palm. And you will find

1083
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,460
that you possess the uncanny

1084
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,760
and previously unsuspected ability

1085
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,900
to surf the luck

1086
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,160
plane as Dobbs,

1087
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,760
our E-popped and ascended

1088
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,260
master, has done

1089
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,240
and continues to do.

1090
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,780
I will close

1091
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,660
with a poem. And then when that's over,

1092
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,800
we will begin the thrilling

1093
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,060
Bull Dada

1094
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,660
auction.

1095
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,100
Or will we, Reverend Tsang? Is that what we're going to do?

1096
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:43,900
We're going to do the auction?

1097
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,100
That's down there on the plan.

1098
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,040
On the plan sheet. Now what poem

1099
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,340
should I do?

1100
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,840
The Skeleton

1101
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,520
in Armor. How about that one?

1102
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,820
Do you want that one? Or what about

1103
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,160
Leviathan by

1104
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,860
W.S. Merwin. Which should

1105
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,820
it be? How many

1106
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,940
want The Skeleton in Armor?

1107
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,640
I see some hands for The Skeleton.

1108
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,900
How many want Leviathan?

1109
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,000
I see about the same number of hands

1110
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,760
for Leviathan. Well, it's a

1111
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,480
toss-up.

1112
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,580
Well,

1113
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,380
well,

1114
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,140
alright. I'll do Leviathan.

1115
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,640
I'll save The Skeleton for

1116
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,480
another occasion. We'll have another occasion

1117
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,260
for The Skeleton. But now,

1118
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,260
Leviathan.

1119
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,720
This is the

1120
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
Black Sea Brute, bullying

1121
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,760
through Wave Rack. Ancient as

1122
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,080
the ocean's shifting hills,

1123
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,800
who in sea toils traveling,

1124
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,800
who furrowing the salt

1125
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,060
acres heavily, his wake

1126
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,380
hoary behind him,

1127
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,760
shoulders spouting, the fist

1128
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,620
of his forehead over wastes

1129
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,860
gray-green crashing among horses

1130
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,820
unbroken from bellowing fields,

1131
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,540
past bone

1132
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,020
wreck of vessels,

1133
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,700
tide ruin, wash of

1134
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,560
lost bodies bobbing,

1135
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,460
no longer sought for,

1136
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,520
and islands of ice

1137
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,160
gleaming. Who ravening

1138
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,300
the rank sea flood,

1139
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,900
overmastering the dark sea

1140
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,140
marches, wave marshalling,

1141
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,760
finds home

1142
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,000
and harvest.

1143
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,260
Frightening to fool-hardiest

1144
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,840
mariners, his

1145
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,620
sighs were difficult

1146
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,940
to describe. The hulk

1147
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,020
of him is like hills heaving,

1148
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,920
dark yet as crags

1149
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,080
of drift ice, crowns

1150
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,340
cracking in thunder.

1151
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,880
Like land's self by night

1152
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,580
black looming,

1153
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,080
surf churning and trailing

1154
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,480
along his shores rushing,

1155
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,660
shoal water boding about

1156
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,220
the dark of his jaws.

1157
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,000
And who would moor at his side

1158
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,700
and fare on a foot

1159
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,680
should find gates of

1160
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,700
no gardens, but the hill

1161
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,720
of dark underfoot diving,

1162
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,500
closing overhead

1163
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,260
the cold deep

1164
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,860
and drowning. He is

1165
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,680
called Leviathan, and

1166
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,000
named for rolling.

1167
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,000
First created he was of all

1168
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,040
creatures. He has held

1169
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,800
Jonah three days

1170
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,900
and nights. He is that

1171
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,780
curling serpent that

1172
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,560
in ocean is. Sea

1173
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,860
fright he is, and the shadow

1174
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,360
under the earth.

1175
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,540
Days there are, nonetheless,

1176
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,920
when he lies like an

1177
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,680
angel, although a lost

1178
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,680
angel, on the wastes

1179
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,660
unease. No eye

1180
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,920
of man moving, bird

1181
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,900
hovering, fish flashing

1182
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,260
creature whatever

1183
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,500
who after him came to

1184
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,080
herit earth's emptiness.

1185
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,780
Froth at flanks seething

1186
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,540
soothes to stillness

1187
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,740
waits. With one eye

1188
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,540
he watches dark of night

1189
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,960
sinking last. With one

1190
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,480
eye day rise

1191
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,520
as at first over

1192
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,740
foaming pastures. He

1193
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,700
makes no cry, though

1194
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,760
that light is a breath. The

1195
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,880
sea curling, star climbed,

1196
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,680
wind combed,

1197
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,740
with itself. Still,

1198
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,520
as at first it was,

1199
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,020
is the hand,

1200
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,740
not yet contented of

1201
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,000
the creator. And he waits

1202
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,820
for the world to

1203
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,160
begin.

1204
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,820
Ten million times for just

1205
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,880
one soul. Even for that

1206
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,860
boy there, he would die ten million

1207
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,860
times. He will chase him

1208
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,000
over the waters of sin. You doubt

1209
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,120
that Jesus walks over the waters of sin?

1210
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,000
This boy has been

1211
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,860
chased, and he will be

1212
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,020
redeemed. Jesus will never

1213
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,800
leave him ever. Jesus will

1214
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,840
have you in the end.

1215
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,820
What are you doing parking in the middle of the road, son?

1216
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,020
Pick your hand off

1217
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,300
my shoulder. I'm reading that sign.

1218
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,160
There ain't a person

1219
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,080
or a whoremonger who wasn't

1220
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,880
something worse first. That ain't the sin

1221
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,140
nor the blasphemy.

1222
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,660
The sin came before him.

1223
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,020
Jesus is a

1224
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,560
trick on bobs.

1225
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,960
Well, will you get this goddamn out

1226
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,420
house out of the middle of the road?

1227
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,940
I don't have to run away

1228
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,740
from anything, cause I don't believe in anything.

1229
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,960
What direction's

1230
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,860
the zoo in? Back the other

1231
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,720
way. That's where you

1232
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,600
escaped from.

1233
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,960
If you'd like

1234
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,780

recent times.

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,840
And also my wonderful

1247

00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,760
monstrous monster

1249

edification.

1254
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,180
Then PuzzlingEvidenceTV

1255
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,720
has other things, important things

1256
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,600
for the Church of the Subgenius. He's

1257
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,240
I think got that famous

1258
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,760
movie, Pipes of the Piposphere.

1259
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,860
Also the making of

1260
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,220
the Pipes of Piposphere.

1261
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,700
Also the making of the

1262
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,760
watching of the making of

1263
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,300
the Pipes of the Piposphere.

1264
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,840
And the famous Philo Drummond

1265
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,600
movie that I can't think of the name of.

1266
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,640
What's the name of that movie?

1267
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,500
Philo's favorite movie?

1268
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,960
Is it called Coffee Break or something like that?

1269
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,160
Lunch Break? I'm sorry, I can't

1270
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,000
remember. Bob's Lunch Break?

1271
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,940
Bob's Coffee Break?

1272
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,900
Bob's Lunch Hour.

1273
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,180
Bob's Lunch Hour. Yeah, that's

1274
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,420
the one. Bob's Lunch Hour.

1275
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,960
And many things like that

1276
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,740
are available at PuzzlingEvidenceTV.

1277
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,580
Once you start watching that stuff,

1278
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,840
you will never have any more

1279
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,200
free time to yourself.

1280
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,880
But I will tell you how to get your pot of pinks back,

1281
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,520
if that's what they are. How?

1282
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,980
Just take that golden egg and

1283
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,600
you'll... Meanwhile,

1284
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,000
Bruno was trying to coax magic out of

1285
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Felicia's pinks. Come on, pinks,

1286
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,160
if that's what you are. Just one little trick.

1287
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,100
Bruno, those are my pinks.

1288
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,020
We traded. Take your chicken

1289
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,940
and get out of here. Do I take the golden

1290
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,700
egg too? Sure, take the

1291
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,740
golden egg. Yeah, see?

1292
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,620
Here's your pot of pinks. Give me my

1293
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,460
chicken. I thought we traded.

1294
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,040
We didn't shake hands on it. So Felicia

1295
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,560
took back her pot of pinks and

1296
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,620
watered it tenderly. And as she did,

1297
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,860
a strange thing happened. The pot of pinks

1298
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,640
turned into a handsome prince.

1299
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,880
Kind maiden, will you marry me?

1300
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,400
Oh, your highness.

1301
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,360
Just call me Pinky.

1302
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,900
So Felicia and the prince were wed.

1303
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,880
And Bruno, well, he was

1304
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,580
so insistent that the chicken really

1305
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,480
did start laying golden eggs.

1306
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,800
Anything to stop him

1307
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,740
from bugging me. So they

1308
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,800
all lived happily ever after, which just

1309
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,660
goes to show the power of positive

1310
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,400
thinking. Oh, as we call it,

1311
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,640
the power of positive pinking.

1312
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,800
Well, that

1313
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,560
is fairy stories.

1314
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,720
Oh, uh, well, there's a callers right

1315
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,640
in the left. Some of our listeners may not know

1316
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,640
that Dr. Hal is actually a well

1317
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,120
known illustrator

1318
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,200
and, uh, an underground

1319
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,580
comic book artist. That's right.

1320
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,980
I dipped my ink in the underground

1321
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,760
pool some time ago.

1322
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,100
He's one of the old timers.

1323
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,740
And, uh, he has

1324
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,720
a couple of books out, which I think we

1325
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,820
are able to plug. Oh, gosh, thanks, Stang.

1326
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,880
Now I can plug my books. Yeah, you can.

1327
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,620
Boy, what a prince of a fellow.

1328
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,820
That Ivan Stang. They don't come

1329
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,440
any nicer. Well, folks, um,

1330
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,820
it is true. I do have a few books out and they

1331
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,640
sell horribly. So I

1332
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,680
want you all to order a copy

1333
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,660
through Amazon or even better,

1334
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,820
there's something I like more, which

1335
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,760
is called Bookstores. You might have

1336
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,520
heard about this. These are actual places

1337
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,700
where you can go. Now, if you look for my book

1338
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,320
and it's not on the shelf, that's, uh,

1339
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,580
well, that's about the way it usually is.

1340
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,620
And so you ask them to order it.

1341
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,920
What are the titles? Oh, okay, I'll give you some.

1342
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,680
And how is the author's name spelled?

1343
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,340
Oh, that's very important. Slightly unusual.

1344
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,860
Well, I did write my book, The Meaning of Lost

1345
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,800
and Mismatched Socks, under

1346
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,000
the pseudonym Dr. Perditus

1347
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,840
Pedale,

1348
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,320
M.D., Ph.D.

1349
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,780
But that is because

1350
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,960
when given an assignment by my publisher

1351
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,440
to write about lost socks

1352
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,740
and where they go, I thought it would be better

1353
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,740
to humanize the entire... He wrote that

1354
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,680
lost socks book? Yeah, I wrote it.

1355
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,720
Are you familiar with it? Yeah, I remember

1356
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,940
seeing that. Well, I hope you like it.

1357
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,800
Uh, and I illustrated it, too. All of

1358
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,580
those pictures are mine. Furthermore, I came up with the

1359
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,760
index, where you can look up anything

1360
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,140
about socks,

1361
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,480
sock perversions, people who eat

1362
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,620
socks, it's a medical condition known

1363
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,480
as pica, and other things.

1364
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,000
Uh, but, um, the reason

1365
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,780
my book is narrated

1366
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,780
by this imaginary author is

1367
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,540
one, so it gets me off the hook,

1368
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,600
and two, because

1369
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,760
the name Perditus Pedale,

1370
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,780
for you Latinists who were just on,

1371
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,620
means lost sock. Lost sock.

1372
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,200
And he is a human lost sock.

1373
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,820
So, by dehumanizing the problem,

1374
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,600
we're all lost socks, looking for

1375
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,600
the match, but the match can

1376
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,940
be lost and disappeared.

1377
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,720
You can be mismatched with another sock

1378
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,100
and not be a true pair.

1379
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,500
And furthermore, uh, oh well,

1380
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,200
I'm not gonna get into the thesis of the book, too.

1381
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,980
Now, don't, let's don't get lost in the dogma. What about your other book?

1382
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,720
Okay, but that book is by me. It says I'm the editor

1383
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,600
of this book. Actually, I wrote it...

1384
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,860
And who are you again?

1385
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,780
Uh, uh... Hal Robbins. What a devastating question.

1386
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,560
Harry S. Robbins, and it's spelled

1387
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,680
with one B. That's true.

1388
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,960
You don't want to get lost in a world

1389
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,880
of Robbins with two B's, like

1390
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,560
Tim Robbins, or Trina Robbins.

1391
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,940
In the literature world, yes.

1392
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,680
Hal or Harry S. Robbins.

1393
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,520
Especially not Harold Robbins.

1394
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,260
Not Harold Robbins.

1395
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,860
That's not me. No, it's, uh,

1396
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,600
Harry S. Robbins is, uh, is me.

1397
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,800
And then, a more recent book I did,

1398
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,360
it's called Dinosaur Alphabet,

1399
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,700
which is all about, uh, dinosaurs

1400
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,680
that most people have never heard of.

1401
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,920
Otherwise, uh, if you read most

1402
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,460
dinosaur books, you think there were four.

1403
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,160
The, uh, one with the

1404
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,640
big fat body and the long, uh,

1405
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,860
tail and head, the triceratops,

1406
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,300
uh, the, uh, stegosaurs,

1407
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,860
and the Tyrannosaurus rex. Well, none of those guys

1408
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,180
made it into my book. They get, uh,

1409
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,500
so much exposure,

1410
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,800
it's, uh, really not fair when there

1411
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,560
are so many delightfully

1412
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,560
ornamental dinosaurs that have lived,

1413
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,000
whose adventures I chronicled

1414
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,360
in my poems,

1415
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,840
which are in this book. I just don't know why

1416
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,560
this didn't sell, but, uh, it was...

1417
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,640
There's pictures and poetry about the dinosaurs.

1418
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,680
And furthermore, there is an alphabet,

1419
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
an alphabet which I designed,

1420
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,480
uh, orthographically.

1421
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,580
Each, uh, letter of the alphabet,

1422
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,940
which stands for a different dinosaur,

1423
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,900
from A to Z,

1424
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,980
contains a medievalistic

1425
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,220
inlaid picture,

1426
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,540
like the P of Plateosaurus has a

1427
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,940
Plateosaurus in it. But Plateosaurus

1428
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,300
is one of the more common

1429
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,820
dinosaurs, uh, compared to some of the

1430
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,040
ones that I included.

1431
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,600
And I think all humans

1432
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,380
should know about dinosaurs.

1433
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,940
And they should know that the reason

1434
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,560
these elaborate doodads

1435
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,540
are all over dinosaurs, uh, horns,

1436
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,440
spikes, uh, plates, shields,

1437
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,960
uh, uh, crests, all that stuff

1438
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,380
have nothing to do

1439
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,400
with protection from

1440
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,760
big, bad theropods

1441
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,520
like Tyrannosaurus, the way they always say.

1442
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,460
The reason they had this stuff was

1443
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:23,660
sex.

1444
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,760
The reason they had this stuff was cause it looks

1445
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,860
cool. And you're not gonna get another

1446
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,800
dinosaur to mate with you unless you

1447
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,500
look cool. And furthermore,

1448
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,640
many dinosaurs look very much like

1449
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,900
each other, so they needed

1450
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,540
exaggeration of these special features

1451
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,720
so the females, who let's admit it,

1452
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,740
didn't have all the candle power in the world upstairs,

1453
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,860
could recognize who you

1454
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,760
were, and that you were a boss

1455
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,000
bitchin' dude. With the biggest horns,

1456
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,740
the longest spikes... Because of your peculiar features?

1457
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,580
I beg your pardon? Because of your peculiar

1458
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,700
features? That would mean that the dinosaur mating

1459
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,900
ritual was... they were subgeniuses.

1460
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,700
Well, you know why

1461
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,000
I like them now.

1462
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,760
And friends, uh, I assure you,

1463
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,780
Dr. Howell draws just as

1464
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,040
purty as he talks.

1465
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,700
Oh, I have spent many a pleasant

1466
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,940
hour enjoying both of those

1467
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,720
books. Do I have to draw you a picture?

1468
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,780
A lot of that time it is there in the bathroom, but it was a

1469
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,160
wonderful, wonderful afternoon.

1470
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,680
Well, good. They are bathroom books, where

1471
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,340
you can browse, especially the index.

1472
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,760
And you can find the index and

1473
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,560
the logs and websites of everything

1474
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,640
on this show and all previous episodes

1475
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,760
since the 1990s anyway on

1476
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,780
subgenius.com.

1477
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,500
Thanks to Dr. Sinister and

1478
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,640
CSB for letting us plug,

1479
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,880
and praise the large

1480
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,880
who whipped up most of the

1481
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,320
collage-y clips this time.

1482
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,480
The background music

1483
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,340
is Free Cake

1484
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,780
of Detroit, recorded live

1485
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,900
at 12X Day.

1486
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,920
Uh, thanks to Reverend Suds.

1487
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,240
Praise Bob and

1488
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,880
his face.

1489
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,920
I don't need J. R. Bob Jobs, that's what I know!

1490
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,900
Yes! And I said that,

1491
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,480
you know, that face, that,

1492
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,620
yeah, that face, that face that's right

1493
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,600
with me. You need that

1494
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,100
face, the face of Bob!
