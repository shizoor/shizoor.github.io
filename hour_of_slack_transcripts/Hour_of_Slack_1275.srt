1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,100
You realize, of course, Miss Tyler, why these rules are in effect.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,920
Each of us is afforded as much opportunity as possible to fit in with society.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,300
In your case, think of the time and money and the effort expended to make you look...

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,280
Look like what, Doctor?

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,380
Normal, the way you'd like to look.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,480
What about all the historical figures who didn't give a fuck about anything?

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,780
Thank you.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,380
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,800
Eating, Meditation, Listening to a Radio.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,360
Please, please take this off me, please.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,300
Please take this off me.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,180
Please take this off me.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,680
Oh, please take this off me!

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,160
Take it off me!

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,220
Take it off me!

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,140
Help!

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,300
Somebody!

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,920
It can't get back in. It's too late.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,780
The exit hole has now closed.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,180
It's too late.

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,400
Open sesame won't work.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,660
Brainy now. It's too late.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,260
Passage is too small.

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,800
I can't wedge it in there. I can't lever it in there.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,480
Squeeze it in or squirt it in with a siphon.

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,700
Or spoon it in through the sinuses.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,660
Alright, now we've got full microphone coverage.

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,060
Sneeze into the microphone, Philo.

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,760
The sound height.

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,500
The sound height.

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,220
It's at that appropriate height.

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,940
Miss Tyler.

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,580
Miss Tyler, don't be afraid.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,440
He's only a representative from the group you're going to live with.

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,940
Now come on now.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
Don't be afraid.

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
He's not going to hurt you.

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,200
He won't hurt you.

39
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,800
Don't be afraid.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,080
He's not going to hurt you.

41
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,160
It's alright.

42
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,320
It's alright, Miss Tyler.

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,080
Now this is Mr. Smith.

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,760
I don't know who I am.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,500
I don't know who I am.

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,060
I don't know who I am.

47
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,160
Yes, I'm Mr. Smith.

48
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,040
Just a representative from the group you're going to live with.

49
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,580
And we're preparing you for your new life with this hour of slack.

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,180
Which will be mostly recordings from 13X Day at the place where you'll be living.

51
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,460
Which will be mostly recordings from 13X Day at the place where you'll be living.

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:40,960
Yes, most of this show, besides the collages, will be songs from 13X Day and a live hour of slack from the stage with Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond, Pope David Lee Black and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

53
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:53,080
But first, a very special recording from the parking lot of the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland outside the 2010 Devotional the last August.

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,460
A brand new subgenius hymn by Reverend Samantha and Reverend Robert.

55
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,460


56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,460


57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,960
Robert Renne of The Mutant Mountain Boys.

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,900
The Dobs is watching us.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,880
He's following you.

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,100
His Holy Highness knows everything you do.

61
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,040
Dobs heads are all around.

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,800
Trust me, I know.

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,460
His third eye will track you down.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,300
Wherever you go.

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,840
If all slack is what he's found, pink you shall blow.

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,200
Bob Dobs is watching you.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,980
Bob Dobs is watching us.

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,260
He's following you.

69
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:56,400
His Holy Highness knows everything you do.

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,420
Don't look now, don't try to stop.

71
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,000
He's right behind.

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,860
Smoking his heavenly frog.

73
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,680
Breeding your mind.

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,320
Cracking his every thought.

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,140
Truth he shall find.

76
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,360
Bob Dobs is watching you.

77
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,200
Bob Dobs is watching us.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,480
He's following you.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:32,600
His Holy Highness knows everything you do.

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,480
Bob Dobs is watching us.

81
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,720
He's following you.

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,840
His Holy Highness knows everything you do.

83
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,320
Bob dobs is watching us.

84
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,260
Pop his bright potatoes.

85
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,500
He's following me.

86
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,240
Bob dobs is watching us.

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,220
You're wasting time with us.

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,360
TC

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,120
Now look at this.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,720
Now look at this.

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
This is a great contest.

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,060
You are watching this.

93
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,740
They were uncharitable.

94
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,600
I could see our license plate was California.

95
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,540
Just because they did not exhibit the behavior of advanced beings does not mean one should slip to their level.

96
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,760
They said, oh, look, they're just from California.

97
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,760
They're assholes.

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Californicators.

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,940
They're used to being that way.

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,980
Yeah, people hate those who are fleeing California.

101
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,780
Here, back to you, Dr. Howell.

102
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,620
I'm trying to make everything like California.

103
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,200
Preserve the flyover territory.

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:06,340
All I know is that in just about every state we passed through, there was massive, giant fireworks superstores and whole galaxies of fireworks selling arenas.

105
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,440
Massive fireworks displays with the most fireworks I'd ever seen.

106
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,180
And that was just like one of them.

107
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,200
And then we went on down the road and there were hundreds.

108
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,720
Every state we went in, they sold fireworks.

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,760
Even the Walmart.

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:34,240
I went into a Walmart and the Walmart had, you know, children's fireworks areas where the kids could get their favorite explosive devices for like 19 bucks, you know?

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
That sound is coming from the video.

112
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,460
I just want to light the whole thing, you know?

113
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,740
Which I'm controlling.

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,000
They got to learn this now.

115
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,500
But they don't have that.

116
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,360
See, they've taken that.

117
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,220
You don't have to worry about that.

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,580
Okay, shut up.

119
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:48,960
Listen.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,740
Enough of this boring old fart at traveling across the U.S. in their van crap.

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,340
The world ends tomorrow and you probably will not actually die.

122
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,040
Because I'm assuming everybody here has their name listed in the book of life.

123
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,040
And so, therefore, we should all, yeah, you know, the drill.

124
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,500
And this is not a drill.

125
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,120
This is not.

126
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,880
A drill.

127
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,980
Needle, please.

128
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,680
Needle, please.

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:49,100
So we've been reading out of the collection of wonderful, wonderful fucked up fairy tales that have been created by this.

130
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,160
This absolutely wonderful, wonderful uber femme.

131
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:01,180
But in the many fairy tale varieties that we've had, we've never actually had one read by the author herself.

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,420
And that is what we are doing right now.

133
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,260
So please welcome Reverend Beckett on up.

134
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,800
Woo!

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,340
Woo!

136
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,080
Woo!

137
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,100
Woo!

138
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,620
Woo!

139
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,020
Woo!

140
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,560
Woo!

141
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:18,620


142
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:18,860


143
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:18,960


144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:18,960


145
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:18,960


146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Woo!

147
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,280
Woo!

148
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,140
Woo!

149
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,640
Woo!

150
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:23,660
Woo!

151
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,660


152
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,660


153
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,660


154
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,680
Woo!

155
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:23,880
Woo!

156
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:23,880


157
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,060
Woo!

158
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,580
Woo!

159
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,580


160
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:25,940
Woo!

161
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:25,940


162
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,320
Woo!

163
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,320


164
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,320


165
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,340
Woo!

166
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


167
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


168
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


170
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


171
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


172
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


173
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


174
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


175
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


176
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,340


177
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,780
This one in the flyer.

178
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,300
Oops, should I start over?

179
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,640
Now do it!

180
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:35,940
Okay.

181
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,500
The boss is coming for dinner.

182
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,140
It was very short notice, but if you got that big new account, it would mean more hats and

183
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,620
aprons and clamps and speculums and pie birds and leather hoods for everyone, so dinner

184
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,540
would have to be perfect.

185
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:47,980
Yeah.

186
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,400
everything was going fine but upon scraping some entrails into the garbage disposal a geyser of

187
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,560
spongy tubes and bloody snappers erupted from the drain and clung to the ceiling dripping gore

188
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,940
oh dear said mrs johnson that's going to be a bitch to clean up

189
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,220
in a panic she hurried upstairs for a quick bowel movement she flushed repeatedly but her steaming

190
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:16,300
loaf would not budge and when she employed the plunger an unexpected force grasped from within

191
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,100
and held fast now she had guts all over the kitchen ceiling and a splintering wooden probe

192
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,400
jutting out of the toilet my goodness she sighed what the fuck can go wrong next

193
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,800
then she tried to wash her hands and the sink ran coarsely chopped fish heads they collected in the

194
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,820
basin oozing a thick fishy aroma and blinking their shiny vapid eyes heavens to betsy she moaned

195
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,200
i guess i'd better call the plumber before the boss gets a whiff of this shit the plumber came

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
and his findings were upsetting there was a rampant

197
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,300
historical jesus infestation in her kitchen plumbing buddhist stuffed the pipes behind the

198
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,100
toilet a slender ala was snaked around the u-pipe under the bathroom sink and an angry blue krishna

199
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,220
lay coiled just beneath the drain in her bathtub with a film of soap scum and pubic shavings all

200
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,240
over his face there's something wrong with me

201
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,240
oh my she declared what can i do about all these fucking plumbing deities i don't know he said but

202
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,220
i'm not gonna lie to you i'm gonna say it's the only thing i think you need is an exterminator

203
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,360
now you don't get to be the wife of a junior executive supervising account logistics manager at

204
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,140
important co by giving up the first sign of trouble so mrs johnson set to work with only an hour left

205
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,340
before dinner she stewed up a pot of entrails and tubers put on a fresh coat of lipstick and a clean

206
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,420
harness scraped the tentacles off the ceiling powdered her gills and lubed up thoroughly when

207
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,320
the doorbell rang she looked fresh as a rose and the house smelled invitingly of chum but it was not

208
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,100
her husband and the boss on the doorstep

209
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,940
It was Bob who said, Hello, Mrs. Johnson.

210
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,760
You've got a problem.

211
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,600
You've got gods in your pipes.

212
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,800
She felt her loins warm slightly and nodded.

213
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Wouldn't you rather have pipes in your gods?

214
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,380
She drooled just a little and calmly agreed.

215
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,520
So they fropped together for a while.

216
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,220
Time slowed.

217
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,220
When the doorbell rang again, Mrs. Johnson panicked.

218
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,020
Oh, no, Bob.

219
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,300
What about the boss?

220
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,420
Fuck the boss, declared Bob.

221
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,180
So she did.

222
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,340
And Johnson got that big new account.

223
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,400
And they lived happily ever after amid a house full of brand new shit

224
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,180
that they could afford with the promotion money,

225
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,380
thanks to Bob and his heavenly wisdom.

226
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,980
And now after a violent spree, when the bodies pile up in the basement,

227
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,380
they chop them up and feed them to drain Jesus,

228
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,340
whose thirst for blood is matched only by his love for the flavor of eggshells

229
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,740
and potato peelings and the cool, damp habitat of kitchen plumbing.

230
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,940
The end.

231
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,340
Hope you enjoyed watching this The

233
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,840

And thanks for watching.

235

on

241
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,260
To take my mother away

242
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,200
To take my mother away

243
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,380
To take my mother away

244
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:04,140
To take my mother away

245
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,240
To take my mother away

246
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:48,400
To take my mother away

247
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
To take my mother away

248
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,820
To take my mother away

249
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:21,960
To take my mother away

250
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,080
Tonight's brain cells.

251
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,120
Doesn't that make you hate the person that made you forget it?

252
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,340
Reverend Stang, doesn't that make you hate the person that made you forget it?

253
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
It forced you out of your brain.

254
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,340
It wouldn't make me hate everybody, but it's almost like I've got too much slack now.

255
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,080
But Bob makes you forget.

256
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,020
I had slack poisoning last night.

257
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,140
If only Bob could let me forget.

258
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,060
I actually had, I can't say that it was too much.

259
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,560
You can't have too much, but I definitely had a little slack poisoning.

260
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,380
I could feel it.

261
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,120
There's no such thing as too much slack.

262
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,660
There is slack poisoning, slack abuse, false slack, which G. Gordon Gordon said,

263
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,460
false slack is still better than no slack at all.

264
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,720
But Reverend Carter LeBlanc added, false slack is no slack at all.

265
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,800
And as Dr.

266
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,500
Legume said, pass me that joint.

267
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,100
I think we suffered from slack poisoning.

268
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,260
As Harry Dean Stanton said, people come up to me and ask me what I believe.

269
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,920
They go, preacher, what do you really believe?

270
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,580
I'll tell you what I really believe, son.

271
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,360
I believe I'm going to go have me another beer.

272
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,660
I've got a character, you know.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,820
It's this mix between Keith Richards, Johnny Depp, and threw in a little Bob.

274
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,940
You know, he's got this.

275
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,780
He's got a little band.

276
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,680
When it's just two, Dr.

277
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,080
Howell.

278
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,040
The Minoan pinheads or something like that, the casket basket.

279
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,580
Variance of two doesn't qualify to be described as way, way two.

280
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,280
What are you talking about?

281
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,300
I wasn't paying any attention to you.

282
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,020
We weren't paying any attention to you either.

283
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,620
I didn't know that.

284
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:28,600
We were just having a sidebar discussion about what constitutes a sizable variance in a normal distribution.

285
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
When approximated.

286
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,920
When approximated.

287
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,760
When it is a casual conversation between gentlemen.

288
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,620
You actually...

289
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,500
Right.

290
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,920
We wondered where two fit into that.

291
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,320
The number two...

292
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,440
That's where you get things that are vague, and yet when you consider them specific, like a couple is always two.

293
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:46,800
Right.

294
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,880
Then it's a few, three, you know.

295
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,900
I don't think a few can be more than four.

296
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,860
How much is a bunch?

297
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
A bunch can't be more than five.

298
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,120
A bunch, I think...

299
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
Oh, it can be a dozen.

300
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,700
Nine.

301
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
Nine could be a bunch.

302
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,980
Then a dozen is six.

303
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,900
Oh, a dozen is a dozen.

304
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,220
How much is too much?

305
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,540
Not enough.

306
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,040
Not enough.

307
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,600
There's only one answer to that.

308
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,320
How much is too much?

309
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,360
There is no answer.

310
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,260
Bob is not even the answer.

311
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,180
And neither is anything else.

312
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,900
Too much is not enough.

313
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,080
For some individuals.

314
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,520
For some individuals.

315
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:17,540
For some individuals.

316
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:51,060
For some individuals.

317
00:18:51,080 --> 00:19:21,060
For some individuals.

318
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,280
shows Eye of the Beholder, written by St. Rod Silling, with music by St. Bernard Herman.

319
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,920
You may have noticed that I'm on a slight Twilight Zone care. Before that clip, besides

320
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,460
live X-Day Hours of Slack, we had a collage by Heart Ignition, and before that, several

321
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,980
by The Large. This would be a good place to mention that many of the X-Day preachers and

322
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,140
bands will be at the big sub-genius show in New York City, Pastoria actually, on October

323
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,860
9th. I'll be there to sermonize, meet and greet, and accept ticking, smoking gifts,

324
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,380
only to find out...

325
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,080
That's a damnable blog hemp!

326
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,300
That's what happened to the show yesterday.

327
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,300
The blog started.

328
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,640
I'm glad you did mix the tech in there, that makes me feel more at home.

329
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,940
Yeah, it makes you feel like you're bopping in the black room.

330
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:22,640
Rock desert, no water, no food, no shade, a horrible headache, a slight overdose.

331
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,200
Well, I'm ready for that.

332
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,940
Or just imagine at night...

333
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,160
I'd rather be ready.

334
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,340
No thanks, Dr. Howell.

335
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,000
There's sound coming toward you from all directions.

336
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,840
You're stuck.

337
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,440
Melding into a verbal of electronic beble babble.

338
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,220
He who smelt it dealt it.

339
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,720
Susie the floozy donated this to our enterprise.

340
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,380
I know.

341
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,020
By not accepting it, you reject...

342
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,360
Her corrupting element.

343
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,960
By not accepting it, you reject the inculcated principles of dogs.

344
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,560
Oh, well, I guess if somebody offered me a chance to jump off a cliff, then I wouldn't

345
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,560
want to make them feel insulted by not jumping off the cliff.

346
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,180
Is that right?

347
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,880
That's right.

348
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,080
Your leadership skills would make us come right behind you.

349
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,800
You're the first lemur who jumps.

350
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,120
They arranged the bottom of the cliff with those soft mattresses and large chocolate

351
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,880
eclairs.

352
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,140
Right.

353
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,540
Because the...

354
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,440
Because at least the first 10 or 15 people make it softer for the next 10 or 15, right?

355
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,200
I was shipwrecked in the desert in a land ship.

356
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,740
And I was thrown off the pool deck when we crunched.

357
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,360
I thought I was going to die as I was hurtling through the air.

358
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,220
I actually thought, well, this is the way I die on this weird land ship out in the desert.

359
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,400
But, of course, I did not die because I landed on somebody nice and soft.

360
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,140
I had a...

361
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,480
They died, but he didn't.

362
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,520
I had at least one near death.

363
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:51,000
Princess, we and I were pretty certain we were faced with near death out at Burning

364
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,660
Man when the Argentinians who had the anti-Pope mobile, had a flamethrower mounted on the

365
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,960
front.

366
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,160
It was like...

367
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,040
Try to envision two or three station wagons stacked atop each other and welded together.

368
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,500
And what we're sitting on as a passenger seat is the propane tank that is fueling...

369
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,500
the damn flamethrower.

370
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,660
And you're supposed to pump it.

371
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,880
And it's like you're sitting on a bomb.

372
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,720
And why did we find ourselves sitting on a bomb?

373
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,260
Because it's fun.

374
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,760
Because it's praised Argentinians.

375
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,300
Fun.

376
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,000
Because they wanted to trade us something for LSD.

377
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah.

378
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,380
We didn't even know what it was.

379
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,740
So on the way back, we're riding on a bomb being driven by guys tripping their asses

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,020
off.

381
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,820
On LSD.

382
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,040
And, oh, and they let us work the flamethrower.

383
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,500
You know what?

384
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


385
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


386
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


387
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


388
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


389
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


390
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


391
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,500


392
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,840
You can't imagine how much fun it is.

393
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,640
The burners are even dumber than the Bobs of X-Day.

394
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,080
You pull up behind this couple who are like in your way of your flame-throwing, huge,

395
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,860
noisy, army tank-like vehicle, and they don't hear you.

396
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,660
So you go...

397
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,680
The Argentinians, go ahead, run the flamethrower.

398
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,820
Get those assholes out of the way.

399
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:05,960
It's a flame-powered horn.

400
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,860
So you blast them in the butt with this gout of flame.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,480
And like cattle, they slowly turn around and notice, oh, there's a flamethrower.

402
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,480


403
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,480


404
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,480


405
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,480


406
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,500
Oh, there's a flamethrower.

407
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,700
Are we in your way?

408
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,860
We're blocking this giant, deadly vehicle.

409
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,660
Of course, don't forget that it was on a playa that's about two miles wide.

410
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,780
And if somebody happens to be in your way, it's only because they were in your sights.

411
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,720
Well, yeah.

412
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,140
No, this is like driving down those primitive streets like an old Western movie lined with

413
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,540
tents.

414
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
And naked people.

415
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,580
How come more people come to Burning Man than X-Day, Dr. Drummond?

416
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,680
Yes, Dr. Drummond.

417
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,000
It's closer.

418
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,760
Closer to what?

419
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,900
It's about in the middle of the damn desert.

420
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,260
I don't know.

421
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,640
I mean, we can join Sherman seven minutes from here.

422
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,480
Folks, it's easy in X-Day.

423
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,480
You've got vegetation.

424
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,700
You've got life.

425
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,720
You've got shade.

426
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,760
You've got water.

427
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,500
How come Dragon Con is bigger than X-Day?

428
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,320
That's all indoors and air conditioned.

429
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,020
Well, there's your answer right there.

430
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
It has air conditioning.

431
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,860
How come X-Day is bigger than X-Day Europe when it's in Amsterdam?

432
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah.

433
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,660
I never got that one.

434
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:13,860
I never got that one either.

435
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,960
Maybe because the Europeans are better educated than we are.

436
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,060
Instead of getting high, I get with Jesus.

437
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,140
He turned the water into wine, but I turn the wine back into water.

438
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
If you want to get high, then that's a big lie.

439
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,580
You can get with God.

440
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,880
Don't be a fraud.

441
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,640
Jesus is king, so ding-a-ling.

442
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,320
If you don't like my song, then you are wrong because it's about staying straight.

443
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,620
So don't be late.

444
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,640
You don't need crack to be a king.

445
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,340
You don't need to be on the right track.

446
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,440
You just need fun and be number one.

447
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,640
Don't do drugs.

448
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,960
Don't do drugs.

449
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,640
Don't do drugs.

450
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,260
Enough of this bullsh-t.

451
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,060
Let's go get high.

452
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm taking the threats seriously.

453
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,620
The United Nations has been a source of the threat for the past decade.

454
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:24,720
The United Nations says it will continue to provide explosive devices for terror attacks against Canadian flood victims in Pakistan despite violent threats from the pivot points in Texas if it were to go ahead.

455
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,840
U.N. spokesman P.J. Crowley said the U.S. and other countries could resort to violence because of the presence of some of its jets.

456
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,660
You're listening to PR.

457
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,600
PR News.

458
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,600
When President Obama delivers an address next week, he will make the point that U.S. efforts will be moving to the war off the coast of Gaza.

459
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:43,600


460
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:43,600


461
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:43,960
Greenland.

462
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,280
Greenland's minister in charge of Britain's prime minister says Greenland is huge, offering no explanation.

463
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,140
Obama spokesman Bill Burton says the president also wants to thank abroad.

464
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,960
If he can prove he is indigent.

465
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:07,760
American Airlines says it will find a $22 fine levied by the Federal Routine Maintenance Administration in connection with charges the carrier failed to conduct necessary routine maintenance on PR News in Washington.

466
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,860
There are many others who share your misfortune.

467
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,660
people who look

468
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,520
much as you do

469
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,280
they're called

470
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,560
subgeniuses

471
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,720
there's a place

472
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,120
where we send them

473
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,860
they can enjoy the sorts of things

474
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
suitable for

475
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,900
those like you

476
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,620
where they can

477
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,020
improvise in their own way

478
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,280
it's a place called

479
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,440
X Day Trill

480
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,940
and there's a band called

481
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,640
Six Fisted Tales of Connie

482
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,860
also heard in the background

483
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,780
Jenny girl

484
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,480
Jenny boy

485
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,620
Jenny girl

486
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,340
all the good times they had

487
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
Jenny girl

488
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,940
meets

489
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,080
Jenny boy

490
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,300
and they're both

491
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,520
feeling awfully bad

492
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,960
it's a summer of

493
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,680
Jenny love

494
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,040
you can smell it in the air

495
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,800
watch as the laser beams

496
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,160
illuminate her hair

497
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,460
and he looks mighty strong and tough

498
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,420
standing on the ore earth scorched out must

499
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,920
summer of Jenny love

500
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
there's her

501
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,480
there's him

502
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,260
I think they're gonna go do it again

503
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,620
the energy of the summer of that love is here to stay

504
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:12,620


505
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,000
They create causes

506
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,280
Tsunamis and earthquakes

507
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,420
It's Getty Love

508
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,260
Getty Love

509
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,500
Summer of Getty Love

510
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,600
Summer of Getty Love

511
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh, oh, oh, yes, oh

512
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,220
Oh, oh, oh, yes, oh

513
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,020
Cause it's Getty Love

514
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,000
Getty Love

515
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,860
Getty Love

516
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,800
It's the Summer of Getty Love

517
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,780
Now I'll tell you the reason you came

518
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,460
I'll tell you the reason

519
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,240
Though you won't admit it

520
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,520
To yourself

521
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,020
Now it's my turn to ask

522
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,320
What might that be?

523
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,720
I don't fit your formulae

524
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,720
Somewhere along the line

525
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,900
There's been a deviation from the norm

526
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,760
Your state has everything categorized

527
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,060
Indexed, tagged

528
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,380
You are the strength

529
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,140
People like me are the weakness

530
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,800
You control and order and dictate

531
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,040
And my kind merely follow and obey

532
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,640
But something's gone wrong, hasn't it?

533
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,740
I don't fit, do I?

534
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,620
Yes, you fit, Mr. Wordsworth

535
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,600
In a few moments

536
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,020
You'll be cringing and pleading

537
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Just like they all do

538
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,480
Oh, yes, indeed, you fit

539
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,300
Guess we all have our little secrets

540
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,920
Down with that

541
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,560
Yeah, we sure do

542
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,520
Of course, I read about yours

543
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,260
On the internet

544
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,100
What?

545
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,260
Oh, I know all about the cocks

546
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,120
In your in-house

547
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,880
Oh, God

548
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,540
Bobby, you're thinking about

549
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,400
How to make a girl blush

550
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,240
Yeah, well, I gotta

551
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,520
The subgenius power of

552
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,460
Splashing

553
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
Now you know you can't expect

554
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,580
To live any kind of life

555
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,820
Among normal people

556
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,720
Friends, let's face it

557
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,400
Not everybody has what it takes

558
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,900
To be a subgenius

559
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,520
Well, we met the Euro

560
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,420
For one thing, not everybody

561
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,160
Can actually read anymore

562
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,660
So that cuts out a certain number of them

563
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,460
At least four of us today

564
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,000
For example, I met

565
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,080
Reverend Plastic Mediator

566
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,480
A wonderful European

567
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,940
Or rather, British subgenius

568
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
We'll show this lunatic

569
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,560
Who's born and raised

570
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:12,940
In the world of the pro-profit

571
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,580
We met an interesting group

572
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Of subs in that Amsterdam tour

573
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
This is a brochure

574
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,900
From the Amsterdam tour

575
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,840
Right here, I believe

576
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh, from the French line

577
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,540
You want to take the French line

578
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,420
I hear screams

579
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,400
Through Poseidon's playground

580
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Nothing's new like Chevy's new

581
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I see some pyres burning

582
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,640
In the horizon, Stank

583
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,500
Pyres of fires

584
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,600
Oh, they're necklacing

585
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,580
Another disbeliever over there

586
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,540
Well, I don't know

587
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


588
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


589
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


590
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:42,540


591
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,820
There's some horrid hostiles here

592
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,480
That get a little bit too carried away

593
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,640
It's kind of like

594
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,480
Well, if you don't

595
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,420
We must save you or kill you

596
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,280
They take that real seriously

597
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,200
And when they try to get somebody

598
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,500
To praise Bob

599
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,580
And pay their 30 bucks

600
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,060
The guy goes

601
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,880
Oh, that's real funny

602
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
But no, I don't think

603
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm going to spend my 30 bucks

604
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,120
They really do kill the person

605
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,400
Now, how are we going to get

606
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,780
30 bucks out of him anytime?

607
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,900
And once they do that

608
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,460
That just doesn't make any sense

609
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,340
Case in point

610
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,080
A minister

611
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,440
A minister would tell us

612
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,340
That his function is that of preaching

613
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,280
The word of God

614
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,720
And of course it follows

615
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,280
That since the state has proven

616
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,620
That there is no God

617
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,880
That would make the function of a minister

618
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Somewhat academic as well

619
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,980
There is a God

620
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
You are in error

621
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,560
Mr. Wordsworth

622
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,340
There is no God

623
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,260
The state

624
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,040
Has proven

625
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,540
That there is no God

626
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,400
You cannot erase God

627
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,180
With an edict

628
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,720
You are obsolete

629
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,900
Mr. Wordsworth

630
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,680
A lie

631
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,740
No man is obsolete

632
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,060
You have no function

633
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,040
Mr. Wordsworth

634
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,140
You're an anachronism

635
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,980
Like a ghost

636
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,940
From another time

637
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,040
I am nothing more

638
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,220
Than a reminder to you

639
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,000
That you cannot destroy truth

640
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,240
By burning pages

641
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,300
You're a bug

642
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,360
Mr. Wordsworth

643
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,460
A crawling insect

644
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,540
An ugly

645
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,240
Misfortune

646
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,880
A little creature

647
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,340
Who has no purpose here

648
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,000
No meaning

649
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,620
I am a human being

650
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,940
You're a librarian

651
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,580
Mr. Wordsworth

652
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,360
You're a dealer in books

653
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,440
And two-cent fines

654
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,360
And pamphlets

655
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,280
And closed stacks

656
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
And the musty insides

657
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,580
Of a language factory

658
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,600
That spews out meaningless words

659
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,660
On an assembly line

660
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,160
Words, Mr. Wordsworth

661
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,040
That have no substance

662
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
And no dimension

663
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,240
Like air

664
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,020
Like the wind

665
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,340
Like a vacuum

666
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,140
That you may believe

667
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,940
Has an existence

668
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,740
By scribbling index numbers

669
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,620
On little cards

670
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,920
I don't care

671
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,380
I tell you, I don't care

672
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,780
I'm a human being

673
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,500
I exist

674
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,120
And if I speak one thought aloud

675
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,760
That thought lives

676
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Even after I'm shoveled

677
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,300
Into my grave

678
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,400
Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth

679
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
Delusions

680
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,180
That you inject

681
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,100
Into your veins

682
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,260
With printer's ink

683
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,520
The narcotics

684
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,820
That you call literature

685
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,240
The Bible

686
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,520
Poetry

687
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,300
Essays of all kind

688
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,980
All of it

689
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,560
An opiate

690
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,720
To make you think

691
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,580
You have a strength

692
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,680
When you have no strength at all

693
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,740
You have nothing but

694
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,440
Spindly limbs and a dream

695
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,380
And the state has no use for your kind

696
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,300
You are a lie

697
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
No man is a

698
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,680
Who are you people anyway?

699
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,940
What is this state?

700
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,920
Who makes all these rules

701
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,180
And traditions

702
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,440
And statutes

703
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,620
The people who are different

704
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,900
Have to stay away from the people

705
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,700
Who are normal

706
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
This state isn't God, Doctor

707
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,000
This state is not God

708
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,760
It hasn't the right to penalize somebody

709
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,880
For an accident of birth

710
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,340
It hasn't the right to make ugliness a crime

711
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,720
Miss Tyler, stop this immediately

712
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,760
Friends, have you been singled out due to your mutation?

713
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,340
The conspiracy plunging its filthy claws deep into your soul

714
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,800
Wrecking from it the vestige of any individuality

715
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,880
Any potential spark of abnormality

716
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,680
Have you sold your soul to the nine to five demon money handlers?

717
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,640
Suffering epiwems of sadistic,

718
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:11,700
The

719
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


720
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


721
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


722
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


723
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


724
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


725
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


726
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


727
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


728
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


729
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


730
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


731
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


732
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,700


733
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,500
Jack holes giving undeserved authority over your mind and pocketbook

734
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,700
Taking all the credit for your hard work

735
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,500
You feel yourself being drugged down into the depths of the conspiracy machine

736
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,640
Feeling yourself being pulverized into a quivering pile of pink shit

737
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,600
Friends, we have suffered this torment

738
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,240
Yes friends, we too are slowly being lulled into the glazed eyes block of sheeple

739
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,560
Blissfully bleeding away

740
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Being led to the slaughterhouse

741
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,680
If you are not a human being, you are not a human being

742
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,260
Not for Bob!

743
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Grave Bob!

744
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,780
Friends, do you have what it takes to follow the path of least resistance?

745
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,140
To bring the salt of the scales into your mind, body and wallet?

746
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,300
Do you have the perfect hate coursing through your veins?

747
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,320
That perfect hatred that knows no color, creed, ideology, sex or sexual orientation?

748
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,340
That verdict contempt for the plague of pink eyed fist lovers dragging you down in the bowels of their self-made position

749
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:18,240
There is only one way to cleanse the palate of the wretched taste from dealing with the legion of slack-jawed dopey dipshits

750
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,760
Only one path to divine slack in the incautiable death of species waste and the destruction of this planet

751
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,640
And that's J.R. Bob Dove

752
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,960
Grave Bob!

753
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,940
For it was Bob who sold his dollar into God and convinced him it was heaven

754
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,020
For it was Bob who fucked Mother Teresa just because she answered the door

755
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,600
For it was Bob who told Sarah Palin to get that first abortion

756
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,080
Embrace your teachings of Bob

757
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,940
Embrace your abnormality

758
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,340
And never again sell out for a piece of that pink pie my friends

759
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,780
And I ain't talking about the Roman media's wishy-tiny diva

760
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,320
Now let's see if this fucker will work

761
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,780
Keep your fingers crossed!

762
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,140
And your cocks laid!

763
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,400
Baby!

764
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,340
Hey look at the monkey boy with his swagger as he staggers and stumbles his way through the pages of history

765
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,660
Flinging the feces that collect the species of beasties breaking their back for a little false slack

766
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,100
How they made it this far is a mystery

767
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,180
It's even worse than you think

768
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,080
Just a little too deep

769
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,380
Come on let me hear you hate people and your screen!

770
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,000
You wish you'd like to be free

771
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,900
Just a little too deep

772
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,020
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

773
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,840
You're so cool that you dream

774
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,760
Just a little too deep

775
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,140
Oh come on the saucers can't fucking hear you people

776
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,460
Come on!

777
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,640
It's even worse than you think

778
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,580
Just a little too deep

779
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,260
Still not loud enough

780
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,620
You're so cool that you dream

781
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:08,760
Just a little too deep

782
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,180
Don't you ever trust me yet

783
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,720
They're trying

784
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,100
Does the monkey enjoy

785
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,020
All the battles, the bloodies, the bodies of brothers and buddies, barely above the voting age

786
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,720
Humors and attitudes smothered in platitudes

787
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,620
Given just a bit too much latitude

788
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,840
To show you gratitude while throwing you in a cage

789
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,600
It's even worse than you think

790
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,540
Just a little too deep

791
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,160
Turn all the pigs fucking down!

792
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,380
You touch the sides of the drink, you're just a little too mean

793
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,900
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

794
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,180
You taste the bullet you drink, you're just a little too mean

795
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,620
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

796
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,020
You see the person you think, you're just a little too mean

797
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,500
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

798
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:12,940
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

799
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,920
I still ain't convinced you guys are full of hate yet

800
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,560
I still can't fucking hear it, come on man

801
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,040
I wanna feel your hate!

802
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,940
What's wrong with you monkey boy?

803
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Did they fool you once?

804
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,300
They fooled you twice!

805
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,020
I'm sorry, looks like you got fooled again there pal

806
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,260
We smile at your pain and your vein

807
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,640
Who explained the insane campaign to soak your domain in acid rain

808
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,220
And laugh as it all goes straight down the drain

809
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,260
Team First!

810
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,000
You think you're just a little too mean

811
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,860
You're just a little too mean

812
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,180
You let a pest all over the planet, they can have it anyway

813
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,760
You touch the sides of the drink, you're just a little too mean

814
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,080
We'll stop them around a little bit and use them for target practice too, ain't that right man?

815
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,540
You taste the bullet you drink, you're just a little too mean

816
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,800
This is uh, three package warfare, it's the special of the day friend

817
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Team First!

818
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,360
You think you're just a little too mean

819
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,100
Let's hope the X's come to blow all them fuckers away!

820
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,520
Team First!

821
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,520
Oh and with all due respect

822
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,660
They can all kiss my fucking ass

823
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,420
Team First!

824
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,980
You're just a little too mean

825
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,680
Team First!

826
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
You're just a little too mean

827
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,280
Team First!

828
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,600
You're just a little too mean

829
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,840
Team First!

830
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,400
You're just a little too mean

831
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,960
I still ain't convinced y'all are full of hatred but the night is still good

832
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,340
Team First!

833
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,340
You're just a little too mean

834
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,760
Team First!

835
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,420
How'd you know uh...

836
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,580
Tell them who we are man

837
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,640
We are Dr. Knob and the Polishers!

838
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,300
Team First!

839
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,740
Now they're lyin' friends, that was Monkey Hive!

840
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,300
Live at 13X Day

841
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,640
And Monkey Hive being Reverend Suds Pasha and Reverend Gag Hole

842
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,620
They did a truly amazing set

843
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,620
I guess we've had a theme this show

844
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,000
Weirdos vs. Normals

845
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,280
Although really that's our theme every show

846
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,580
Unless you're a complete jerk friend

847
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
You shouldn't be ashamed of your weirdness

848
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,780
But should exploit it for fun and profit

849
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,460
Or at least for slack

850
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,460
Here's a good lesson

851
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,720
Uh, there was a reporter for the

852
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,560
Cleveland Scene

853
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,480
He was gonna come over and interview

854
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,860
Actually he was gonna interview Princess Wee

855
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,440
About Starwood

856
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,460
They'd already covered Subgenius

857
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,440
Starwood indeed

858
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,060
Princess Wee was terribly upset

859
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,880
Because our house was a mess

860
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
And this reporter, Michael Gill

861
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,180
Was gonna come over

862
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,820
And uh, you know our house is like every other

863
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,280
Subgenius house probably

864
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,960
Used

865
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,640
Now every now and then you'll run into one who's

866
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,140
Like perfectly meticulously neat

867
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,760
Poor bastards

868
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,140
We caught up with Mrs. Stang in her somewhat

869
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,260
Casually decorated house

870
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,740
We never got a chance to clean it up as much as we wanted to

871
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,320
That guy walked in

872
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,340
He was so envious of our house

873
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,020
They've got not one but two bigfoot statues in there

874
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,560
I wish my house was totally full of weird crap like this

875
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,720
Original Zap Comics covers

876
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,220
He didn't notice the dust build up

877
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,600
Or the piles of mayflies under the windows

878
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:33,720
And the dust was just like

879
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,100
A

880
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,300
A

881
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,100
A

882
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,400
A

883
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,780
A

884
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,160
A

885
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,200
A

886
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,520
A Legal tiger

887
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,200
Thank God

888
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,820
He just بkeys the meat Shawkl

889
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,920
He just hekeys the meat Shawkl

890
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:48,840
Um

891
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:48,840


892
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:48,900
It's a Fu

893
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,260
Oh I did see all that

894
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:51,520
This is

895
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,640
I will not**

896
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,260
African driver ants.

897
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,640
Beautiful array of

898
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,240
tchotchkes and

899
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,320
gewgaws. Under the

900
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,500
spell of your subgenius germ

901
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,060
plasm. Jack Chick tracks.

902
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,020
You will accumulate. Yeah, Jack

903
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,320
Chick tracks. They count, certainly.

904
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,240
It's mostly for tiny

905
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,280
little figurines. At least in my

906
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,600
subgenius altar. Yeah, that's it. The tiny little figurines.

907
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,300
They're the ones that get you. The plastic

908
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,180
Shoney's big boy. The pipe

909
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,260
that's this long that costs

910
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,440
$2,500. I actually

911
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,700
have one. It's this long.

912
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,060
Here's a spoiler. It's the perfect

913
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,060
part. The tiny spaceship that Wellman

914
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,320
bought a bunch of and gave to a bunch of people.

915
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,740
If a booger picker.

916
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,120
If the subgenius movie

917
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,980
gets made

918
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,240
and isn't a puppet show

919
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,100
but actually a real movie

920
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,040
with a bunch of humans in it. One of the

921
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,580
last images

922
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,160
will be

923
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,000
all the cool

924
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,200
junk of the

925
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,960
subgenius world being

926
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,880
lifted up off of the earth and

927
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,600
sucked into the saucer in this

928
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,580
endless whirlpool of

929
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,540
comic books, video games,

930
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,840
cheap paperbacks, old play

931
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,620
boys, toy

932
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,340
dinosaurs.

933
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,600
Everything in the

934
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,140
Bulldada auction. Bonanza.

935
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,700
The greatest garage sale orgy.

936
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,360
Last Supper

937
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,200
black

938
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,540
light posters.

939
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,520
Black velvet

940
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,860
Elvis paintings. All of that.

941
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,500
Somehow turned into one giant

942
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,620
CGI vortex of

943
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,040
genius.

944
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,200
Think about the poor son of a bitch

945
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,320
will have to scan all of those

946
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,900
images and

947
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,280
Photoshop the background

948
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,740
out so they can be

949
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,260
all after effected up into a huge

950
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,200
mess. You just get the string fairly

951
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,440
tight. Go around it about five times

952
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,060
and then pull it tighter again

953
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,020
and then over. Can you see that?

954
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,900
Over on itself

955
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,740
and Bob's your uncle. There's no

956
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,520
knots there until you get rid of it.

957
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,040
You just pull it again. Slides off.

958
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,480
No knots. Nothing to worry about.

959
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:18,960
Man.

960
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,260
The planet. Man. The planet.

961
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,120
When we left our friends

962
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,140
Pat, Billy and Jane

963
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,980
we find Billy, Pat and Jane discussing

964
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,160
their honor. Brother, you said it.

965
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,980
But what possible danger

966
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,660
may face Pat, Billy and Jane?

967
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,180
Particularly you two, Billy

968
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,840
and Jane. I'm sorry, Pat.

969
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,920
You do it deliberately.

970
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,660
It's just that I've got a lot on my mind.

971
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,500
Oh, here's the story.

972
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,380
When we left Pat and the two kids, Billy and Jane

973
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:45,960
I

974
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,060
wanted to talk to you about Billy and Jane.

975
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,380
I think you ought to be aware that they'll stop

976
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,460
at nothing. I didn't want to frighten

977
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,980
you so I pretended it was sabotage.

978
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,180
What happened? I'm afraid we're stuck.

979
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,700
Hello, man planet.

980
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,160
Man planet. Hello,

981
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,180
man planet. Gosh, can't you

982
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,300
think of something pleasant? I wouldn't

983
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,140
be a bit surprised.

984
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,520
Well,

985
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,960
will, or

986
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:14,740
what?

987
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,420
But first, here is a message man the planet

988
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,040
wants you to hear.

989
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,240
Wherever man the planet threatens the universe

990
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,420
you will find man the planet.

991
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,220
I was, well, I guess

992
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,160
driven by jets along the tops of the dust

993
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,480
the way a sled goes over the dust.

994
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,300
Look at those young children playing catch

995
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,480
with that brain. I would be remiss

996
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,160
if I did not say that. So sweet.

997
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,120
Did not flog this mention. Somebody take a picture of that.

998
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,320
It's my brain.

999
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,260
But we

1000
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,580
shall never repent. That's one thing.

1001
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,420
We subgeniuses will never

1002
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,060
repent. Don't get any dirt on it.

1003
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,440
It might not take later

1004
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,600
when they replant it.

1005
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,540
You want to make sure you can still

1006
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,340
wipe off the roots and

1007
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,620
you might have to put a little root tone on it

1008
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,060
to get it to take again.

1009
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,820
Back balm and root tone.

1010
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,120
That brain is

1011
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,440
not in the condition in which they are

1012
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,300
perfused. The guy that left it

1013
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,640
tried to put it back but he couldn't make it.

1014
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
It was already too late.

1015
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,160
The wound had closed.

1016
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,720
I think we...

1017
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,960
The exit wound. We're on this topic

1018
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,640
back in our show in

1019
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,720
Berkeley a few shows ago

1020
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,060
talking about how Frankenstein

1021
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,960
removed the brain

1022
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,300
and put it in his

1023
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,880
creation. His stem.

1024
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,620
I mean, where did he cut the stem at?

1025
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,740
Well, that's the thing. You cut as far away

1026
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,860
as possible because that brain

1027
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,260
is not suitable for perfusion.

1028
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,080
It's been cut too soon.

1029
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,840
There must be a length

1030
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,100
of each of the major

1031
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,440
motor nerves of the brain

1032
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,000
as well as the

1033
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
chief ganglion

1034
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,880
spinal accessory nerve and the spine

1035
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,580
itself. In fact,

1036
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,700
as Frankenstein knew well

1037
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,640
but nobody hardly ever considers

1038
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,220
anymore, the brain

1039
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,240
so-called only has its

1040
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,320
natural organizing mass

1041
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,440
there in that familiar organ.

1042
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,320
The brain is also

1043
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,120
all the rest of the nerves extending

1044
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,320
into the body. Anything that can

1045
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,820
feel and send back

1046
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,140
a signal is a piece of this

1047
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,360
complicated neural mechanism

1048
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,380
called the brain.

1049
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,300
Your brain extends into your fingertips

1050
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,500
and your brain

1051
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,840
has other parts in your body.

1052
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,260
Secret

1053
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,420
places that are generally not

1054
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,600
known. Like that hidden appendage

1055
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,300
you just discovered last week.

1056
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,380
I didn't know that was there.

1057
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,400
A painful episode.

1058
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,860
No wonder they've been laughing

1059
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,180
at me behind my back.

1060
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,560
Had something to do with that

1061
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,400
appendage.

1062
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,600
So when you lift out the brain,

1063
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,600
you've got to keep it alive during

1064
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,500
transit. Also remember they're very

1065
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,960
fragile. They're like a meringue.

1066
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,620
You can't drop them or

1067
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,580
bang them around.

1068
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,740
Kicking it will probably

1069
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,600
have a negative effect.

1070
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,360
Well that one's been street toughened.

1071
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,460
The story you have just

1072
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,520
heard has changed.

1073
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,240
Paul and Myra were tried and convicted

1074
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,280
on seven separate counts of receiving

1075
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,300
property. In most cases

1076
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,900
they were found to be basically good

1077
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,980
and they were returned to their homes.

1078
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,660
You have just heard the 13th

1079
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,300
in a new series of Authentic Files

1080
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,920
from Los Angeles.

1081
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,500
And now, an important announcement.

1082
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,500
And now, speaking in

1083
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,420
behalf of the producers, consult your

1084
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,540
local newspaper for the new listening time.

1085
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,360
We would like to take this opportunity

1086
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,240
to thank you for your many kind

1087
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,840
letters of encouragement and approval.

1088
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,820
Los Angeles Police Department.

1089
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,340
The Lone

1090
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,160
Incorporated.

1091
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,420
The Lone

1092
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,080
Incorporated is from the

1093
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,540
Lemur Incorporated.

1094
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,260
We'll be going now in six or seven minutes.

1095
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,600
First I should say that Dragnest,

1096
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,960
Man the Planet and our titles are also

1097
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,920
by the Lemur Incorporated.

1098
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,080
I should also say that on that song

1099
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,840
Summer of Yeti Love, the singing was

1100
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,100
Pisces, the guitar Reverend Angry Larry

1101
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,380
and Reverend Suds, the sax was Philo.

1102
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,800
And I thank Reverend Phil on drums.

1103
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,380
Another subgenius event is coming up for which I'm going to talk about.

1104
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,400
Another subgenius event is coming up for which I'm going to talk about.

1105
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:07,540
This is a great opportunity to get

1106
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:07,540


1107
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,860
you don't have to leave your house,

1108
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,720
which is good because it's six weeks,

1109
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,580
online.

1110
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,020
The subgenius cult biz and history online class

1111
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,580
at Maybe Logic Academy.

1112
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,900
Details on that, X Day and other subgenius radio shows

1113
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,640
and books, etcetera, and downloads of all our previous shows

1114
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,520
are at our huge website at subgenius.com.

1115
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,920
There are also a couple of official Facebook pages

1116
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,940
and secret forums and chat rooms.

1117
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,340
Well, they were secret.

1118
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,800
We'll end with a little more X Day Live

1119
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,340
and then finally a song by filmmaker Zandy Smith.

1120
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,500
Another Mr. Smith.

1121
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,300
And yes, he has a very close relation.

1122
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,420
Thanks, Dad.

1123
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:53,500
But first, I have a point of doctrine that hasn't been addressed.

1124
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,900
Well, let's get to it.

1125
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,440
It's new.

1126
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,780
It's new.

1127
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:04,080
You know, we, the evangelicals and so forth talk about faith healing.

1128
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,160
Mm-hmm.

1129
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,660
And of course, President Bush, former Emperor Bush,

1130
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,480
wanted faith-based companies.

1131
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,960
And we had figured out that we had a face-based religion.

1132
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:16,960


1133
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,740
A face-based religion.

1134
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,180
Well, one concept that went right over our heads for a long time

1135
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:31,260
until Reverend E. Vade discovered it was the power of face healing.

1136
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,280
It can be done.

1137
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,140
By which it's not your face.

1138
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,140


1139
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,140


1140
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,160


1141
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:35,560


1142
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:35,560


1143
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:35,560


1144
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:35,560


1145
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,460
It's not the faith in Bob that heals you, but the application of a physical printed

1146
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,840
Dobbs head to the afflicted area.

1147
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,720
You put Bob's head on the part that hurts, like your nut or your brain.

1148
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:54,720
Apply the Dobbs head to the brain, and that was the idea behind the healing.

1149
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,480
Personally, I'm one of those.

1150
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:04,220
Well, you know, if you don't believe in faith healing, you're cut out of an awful lot of

1151
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,140
population.

1152
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:30,400
And that's what we нее, in the medical Adding, I mean, the proper application a

1153
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,020
person

1154
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,220
to faith healing allows you to get the most count out of something instead of building

1155
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,220


1156
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,300
Okay.

1157
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,120
Well, it got outside the borders of health practitioners to help improve the overall

1158
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,120


1159
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,120


1160
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,120


1161
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:42,340
If they can show me the machine that goes ding and the price tag on it, that's going to make me get well faster.

1162
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,360
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,740
If you get a million-dollar bill, you know you're going to get well.

1164
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,840
The backside of that is you can still get hooked on placebos.

1165
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,720
Also, the hospital is a great place to get sick.

1166
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,740
Homeopathic medicine is a testimony to that, Doctor.

1167
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,920
You endanger yourself.

1168
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,280
In the hospital, you can be subjected to disease vectors.

1169
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,240
Eatrogenic destruction can be yours in the hospital.

1170
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,340
But my dad used to say, if you get sick, don't go to the hospital.

1171
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,900
Go to the best hotel in town and check in.

1172
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,980
It'll be so much cheaper than the hospital, and you'll get much better service.

1173
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,280
A lot of people that go to hospitals die.

1174
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,600
That's a known fact, that they go to the hospital, and the next thing you know, they're dead.

1175
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,160
Patients check in.

1176
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,760
They don't check out.

1177
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,180
That's right.

1178
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:28,660
Friends.

1179
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:28,900
Here's a question.

1180
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,780
You don't need any of that crap, because Bob is the perfect placebo,

1181
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,800
and the conspiracy is the imaginary disease.

1182
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,000
Regular placebo.

1183
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,660
You think about that.

1184
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,740
But now it doesn't make any difference, because it's just a few hours left.

1185
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,120
A few sad hours.

1186
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:47,940
Right now.

1187
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,900
To shed some final drops.

1188
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,680
Probably like only about 11 or 12.

1189
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,560
Humanity sins.

1190
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,160
We have to reach out to the youth.

1191
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,260
It's so hard to reach to the youth.

1192
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,700
They move so fast.

1193
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:58,980
Yes.

1194
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,460
It's so terribly easy to reach old age.

1195
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,400
That's true.

1196
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,820
They don't move that fast.

1197
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,300
You have been removed from office to feel investigators have declared you obsolete.

1198
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,740
Obsolete?

1199
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,740
You have disgraced the state.

1200
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,240
You have proven yourself a coward.

1201
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,140
You have therefore no function.

1202
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,060
You are obsolete.

1203
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,800
But I'm not.

1204
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,800
I'm not obsolete.

1205
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,140
You are obsolete.

1206
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,880
Obsolete.

1207
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,480
Obsolete.

1208
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,820
You are obsolete.

1209
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,580
Obsolete.

1210
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:28,680
You are obsolete.

1211
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


1212
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


1213
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


1214
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,380
I'll make you a terrible state, a tragic tertiary.

1215
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,960
I'm not obsolete.

1216
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,080
I work for the state.

1217
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,000
I help the state.

1218
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,620
I help give the state strength.

1219
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,640
How can you call me obsolete?

1220
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,600
How can you?

1221
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,920
I managed to feel investigators have declared you excerpt from explanatory video on the

1222
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,180
Glenn Coogan era YouTube video.

1223
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:58,660
It's time to because I've hadmax.

1224
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,960
It's dark and it's dreary.

1225
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,360
My mom said this to show pass.

1226
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:16,240
And that all sounds cliche, but I don't give a rat's ass.

1227
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,480
Who lost you?

1228
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,640
We're all on that timeline.

1229
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,320
I guess it's a strange thing to hope for.

1230
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,420
Oh boy, I hope this one's mine.

1231
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,180
Can't look in the mirror.

1232
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,840
Gotta pretend I can't hear her.

1233
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,720
Kicked a hole in the wall.

1234
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,180
Got the things I could do in a bathroom stall.

1235
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,840
The worst year.

1236
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,920
We're all on that timeline.

1237
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,700
It's a strange thing to hope for.

1238
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:12,620
Oh boy, I hope this one's mine.

1239
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,220
Feeling pathetic.

1240
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,260
Feeling good.

1241
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,500
Feeling sad.

1242
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,800
Feeling sad.

1243
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,220
Alexander.

1244
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:34,100
And his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad.

1245
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,860
Psych, this is great.

1246
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,060
I'm moving to Australia.

1247
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,880
With a loaded .38.

1248
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,200
No seriously, this sucks.

1249
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,240
I get pretty tired.

1250
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,500
Of all of the fucks.

1251
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,600
That are trying to tell me.

1252
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,680
It'll all be okay.

1253
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,000
It's a bad fucking year.

1254
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,220
Not a bad fucking day.

1255
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,720
The worst year.

1256
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,720
We're all on that timeline.

1257
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,540
It's a strange thing to hope for.

1258
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,400
But boy, I hope this one is mine.

1259
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,660
Thank you for watching!

1260
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:28,660


1261
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:28,660


1262
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,560
Get us here soon!

1263
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:46,760
нос

1264
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:46,760


1265
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:46,760


1266
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,140

1267
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:53,440
I wanna belong

1268

Please help me.
