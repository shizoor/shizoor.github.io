1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,400
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,240
The subgenius, the power of...

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,060
SWAG!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,260
Now I know all about everything.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,320
What? Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah, yeah!

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,880
I named man the bad story, but Stoomson didn't get it

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,240
Mermin found a kept his fern in their mountain

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,620
And then some dad cute he wish they won food

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,260
And Groobin the love bugle grabbed the groom of two

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,240
Thank-ly-mer!

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,740
Oh yes dear friends, we're going to 23X Day

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,780
Right in our own homes!

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,960
And much of this episode is the first hour of the first day

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,540
Of the first X Day that was held entirely online

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,600
By teleconferencing

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,240
And it started this way

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,020
On July 5th, 1998, 7 AM

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,320
When we all have hangovers

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,300
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,280
The advent of the angelic host

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,420
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,200
Only his predictions are just a little different

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
July 5th, 1998

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,160
At 7 AM to be exact

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,040
The men from Planet X, as the news media will call them

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,000
The true believer subgeniuses

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,660
Up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

29
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,920
And believe it or not, plenty of people

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,800
4,000 of them so far and more every day have already joined up

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,040
Suddenly the joke has become serious

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,360
And profitable

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,720
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,320
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,620
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,680
Remember now

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,940
It's no surprise

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,000
If I should be found dead someday

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
I'll think that you were in the way

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,460
Oh, gimme Bob

41
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,360
Confusing that face

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,440
With my own

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,940
Can't remember my place

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,100
Bob's role on this planet

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,260
Is to see that the Earth is not sold

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,580
On that glorious or terrible day

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,540
We call X-Day in 1990

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
What year?

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,340
I didn't say what year it is!

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,060
Oh no

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,100
Nineteen something

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,580
I haven't had my hearing aids on all day

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,160
So you forgot what he said?

54
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,580
Yeah, I actually, I'm gonna run get them in a second

55
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,520
They're nearby, next to my bed, but

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,980
I had to go to the, get a CAT scan this morning

57
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,600
In the next town over

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,380
And I got there, I realized I don't have my

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,120
Ear bones

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
And everybody's wearing masks

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,940
So everything sounds like

62
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,320
Vrrr, vrrr, vrrr, vrrr

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,360
That can be rather disconcerting

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,460
Yeah, I'm gonna go get my hearing aids, you guys

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,580
Reverend John Shirley has his hand up

66
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,320
Let me pull John in for you

67
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,740
So's Modemac, actually for all we know everybody is

68
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,560
But this is the very thing

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,960
This is the first show

70
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,680
So we have to stick with professionals for the first 20 minutes

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,200
Oh, well, that's, that's

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,880
Man, I should, I should step back

73
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,100
You're the only one who really knows what he's doing

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,660
Hey John Shirley

75
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,760
Let me see if I can assist you here

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,320
He's down there

77
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,420
I asked him to start his video

78
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,200
There we go

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,860
And I'm going to ask him to unmute

80
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,340
It's funny to ask a mutant

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,720
To unmute

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,560
Unmute

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,160
I never thought of it that way

84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,360
You're a mutate kink

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,520
I can't unmute

86
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,300
I'm mutated, I'm a mutated

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,480
How am I gonna unmute?

88
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,500
Mutate kink

89
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,920
If you want that raise, son

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
You're gonna have to unmute

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,400
I tried, I tried

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,560
I really did too, man

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,240
There was a period in my life when I tried to unmute several times

94
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,920
Yeah, me too

95
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:30,020
When I was 12, I burned all the comic books that I had drawn in elementary school

96
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,820
To prove to myself that I wasn't gonna be a weirdo anymore

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,700
Did it work?

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,360
One time I quit smoking pot to prove I could quit smoking pot

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,880
And once that happened, I started smoking pot again

100
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,160
I proved I could do it, you know?

101
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
That was my only point

102
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,100
After a certain point, you know, you realize you can't unmute

103
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,080
But you can wear the masks of insanity

104
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,760
Which was Philo's way of saying you have to act normal

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
Or you have to act like a dumb

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,680
There's also the asks of insanity

107
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,620
Where you just go up to people and you ask them the question that will set them off

108
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,260
So then they can do all the talking and

109
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,560
They'll think you're a good listener and you're real clever and sympathetic

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,580
That has worked for me

111
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,000
That would be insane

112
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,140
I've got standing invitations to several famous people's houses because

113
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,520
I listen to their wives without opening my mouth once for a whole hour

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,100
So that they didn't have to listen to her?

115
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,660
Well, it was that the wife wasn't used to anybody listening

116
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:44,960
Listening

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,460
While they jabbered

118
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,100
And I didn't have anything better to do

119
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,760
I was trapped

120
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,200
I put these crystals on my PowerPoints

121
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,240
It's a messenger, hold on

122
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,300
I was going, where'd Motomac go?

123
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,220
And then I realized, oh, he's on the page

124
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,040
I wasn't expecting that he made it

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,380
Phil say hi

126
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
Well, you can teach us how to cook if it gets really boring

127
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,000
People can learn stuff on a seminar like this

128
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,960
What kind of things can they learn, Dr. Drummond?

129
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,380
That's one of those asks

130
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,920
There's a long tradition of the straight man in a comedy troupe

131
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,480
But we're not limited to just the straight man

132
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,800
We can have a whole troupe of just straight men

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,180
Also hate men

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,060
I think it's good to have the straight man be

135
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,720
Just everyone on the street that you happen to encounter

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,260
That's your straight man

137
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,440
Yeah, or your boss

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,140
Or your boss

139
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,320
Your boss is literally

140
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,920
Actually the butt of your humor

141
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,880
Can you be a straight man if you're gay?

142
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,840
Reverend, there's a stigmata

143
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,900
Hi, Philo

144
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,820
Hi

145
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Hi, Mickey

146
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,900
Hi, Sting

147
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,540
Hey

148
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,500
We're Facebook friends

149
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,320
We are Facebook friends

150
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,140
Well, I don't have that many

151
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,080
I've only got about 200 or so friends

152
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm real careful about that

153
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,880
I only will put on people that I either know face to face

154
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
Or maybe if I've known them on the internet for 25 years

155
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,160
Right

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,860
Oh, there's Hal

157
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,080
It's Hal

158
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,180
You had to be swimming in a canoe with him

159
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,720
Before you put him on there

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,760
Hal, here is the reverend

161
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,800
Hello, Hal

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,760
Dominique Stigmata

163
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,200
And this raw eggplant to everyone

164
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,620
Raw eggplant?

165
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,060
A man I feel special

166
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,020
Raw, says raw eggplant

167
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,400
And there's Hal with his

168
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,000
With his sacred Ask Dr. Hal

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes

170
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,980
Ascot

171
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,660
Fez

172
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,880
The Ascot Dr. Hal

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,240
It's a Fez

174
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,620
The Ascot

175
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,780
The Ascot Fez of Dr. Hal

176
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,740
The Fez what says

177
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,440
The Fez what says

178
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,580
Can you hear us, Dr. Hal?

179
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,120
Yes

180
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
How about me?

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,000
Can you hear me?

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
We can hear you exquisitely

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,700
You sound wonderful

184
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,760
Well, opinions vary

185
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,020
Well, it's funny how the blue screens work

186
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,720
They work fine for some of us

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,300
Philo is a floating head about half the time

188
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,620
Because he's a green shirt

189
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,400
You mean in life or do you mean on Zoom?

190
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,200
Both

191
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,680
John Shirley looks like the invisible man

192
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,240
About halfway through the process

193
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,000
With his paint wearing off

194
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,120
This is the secret

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
I'll show you

196
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,800
There, you see my green screen behind me?

197
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,460
That's the secret

198
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,980
That's everything you need

199
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,700
Just a sheet

200
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,660
Any color really

201
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,900
Because you can match the color

202
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm kind of liking my solarization effect

203
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,980
Even though I didn't intend it

204
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,480
I kind of like how it works

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,700
There's a lot of

206
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,520
It's like a 1970s special effect

207
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,300
Since I have a green screen

208
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,980
Lighting all my lights

209
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,540
And all my cool stuff

210
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,140
I have a picture of what's behind it

211
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,820
On the green screen

212
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,500
Ah

213
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,480
Well, Onan has something like that too

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,760
I saw the picture of Onan's little special set

215
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,740
Yesterday

216
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,100
And Philo's just wearing his green screen

217
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,140
So his head ends up on these other characters' shoulders

218
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,280
He's on a statue right now

219
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,060
There we go

220
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,520
That's uncanny the way that works

221
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,040
Well, once again we're talking to the viewing audience

222
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,960
And not any kind of audience

223
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,100
Not any kind of radio audience

224
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,380
So screw you radio listeners

225
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,900
You can't see any of this green screen stuff

226
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,040
That's what you get for not spending your 35 bucks

227
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,120
And joining the church

228
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
You're missing out on the mind-breaking special effects

229
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,880
Well, the other thing they're thinking is

230
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,060
Well, I don't hear any ladies' voices

231
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,780
I thought X-Day was supposed to be a bunch of topless babes

232
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,660
I thought I heard a ladies' voice

233
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,220
There's babes here

234
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,400
But they're, you know

235
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,320
They're topless

236
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,380
I could take my shirt off

237
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,060
I've got pretty good tits nowadays

238
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,720
Well, I'm gonna leave it up to Joyce

239
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,940
But I've got five bucks that say she doesn't take her shirt off

240
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The Smart Girls

241
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,320
Now watch out for the Smart Girls

242
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
You better watch out for the Smart Girls

243
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
They're on a smart check

244
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,980
Watch out

245
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,060
They're on a smart check

246
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,640
They're on a smart check

247
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,440
They're smart guys

248
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,020
They're smart girls

249
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,700
They're smart guys

250
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,760
Watch out

251
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,180
Always tripping the girls

252
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,880
Watch out

253
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,340
The Smart Girls

254
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,020
Watch out

255
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,520
They know the world more than most

256
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,760
Watch out

257
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,980
The Smart Girls

258
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
Watch out

259
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,000
They know the world more than most

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000


261
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,140
They're the guys that learn more

262
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,140


263
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,120
To learn more

264
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,360
That's right

265
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,640
Learn from the Smart Girls

266
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,100
They're the guys that learn more

267
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,860
They're the guys that learn more

268
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,040
It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl

269
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,860
Why don't you just learn from that smart girl

270
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,920
Or that smart guy

271
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,600
The subgenius kids

272
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,340
did that song, Smart Chicks.

273
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,440
And they were at

274
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,760
X Day but not singing.

275
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,300
Although I think they sang that

276
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,520
during a Zoom subgenius

277
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:20,840
meeting.

278
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,260
Those happen every week for members.

279
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,640
More of the subgenius

280
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,660
kids will be coming up.

281
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,760
But now, back to 23XDay

282
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,600
Day 1, Hour 1.

283
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm wearing a Dallas

284
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,080
Paleontological Society

285
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,440
shirt. I had to go into town

286
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,460
today. That has much good

287
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,260
magic. Yeah, you don't

288
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,380
want to wear your Bob

289
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,180
shirt into town because

290
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,460
the profile people come after you.

291
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,300
I wore a shirt today

292
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,360
that at first glance looks

293
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,140
astoundingly

294
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,780
offensive.

295
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,100
It's John Carpenter's.

296
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,500
See?

297
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,000
And it's...

298
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,240
Oh, John Carpenter, but it's like

299
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,060
the Carpenter.

300
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,740
It's the They Live character.

301
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,300
Right, I get it.

302
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,380
That is pretty cool.

303
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,360
I didn't realize it was the They Live

304
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,940
characters. That's pretty cool.

305
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,580
See, when I first saw the t-shirt, I thought

306
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,080
they were making some bust on

307
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,780
Karen Carpenter

308
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,960
and her anorexia.

309
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,920
She starved herself.

310
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,700
I thought they were busting on that and I thought it was funny for that level.

311
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,420
But then I realized it was John Carpenter.

312
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,640
No, then I really got...

313
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,820
Why not both?

314
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,120
Sure.

315
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,380
Why not both?

316
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,780
Sure.

317
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,680
But it was, for a second there, it was the darkest bit of humor I'd seen in a long time.

318
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,780
Go figure.

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,580
Then they remade They Live on a budget of about 20 times greater than that and called it The Matrix.

320
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,080
They Live was a great documentary.

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,800
Haley said yes, indeed.

322
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,460
Expose of the

323
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,440
Reagan administration.

324
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,100
I told my kids it was a documentary.

325
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,600
Stan, did we get in?

326
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,180
Yeah, where's Princess Wee?

327
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,360
I don't know.

328
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,760
She's heard off screen

329
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
tuning in comments.

330
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,700
She was carried off by a pterodactyl.

331
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,380
Again?

332
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,620
But a fossilized one.

333
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,440
So it's like all bones as it flies through the sky.

334
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,480
Yeah, it won't get far.

335
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,880
Yeah, they're just...

336
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,520
It's too heavy.

337
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,920
Awesome.

338
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,140
It's a magical question.

339
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,440
It's a magical question.

340
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,440


341
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,980
If there's a dinosaur and then the dinosaur turns into a fossil dinosaur, so there you

342
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,100
have the question of, was there a zombie dinosaur in between those phases?

343
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,360
Do robots also, do robots have ghosts when they expire?

344
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,900
I'll turn that over to the panel.

345
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Do robots have ghosts?

346
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,440
I can tell you about the dinosaurs.

347
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,100
I don't know about dinosaur zombies, but they definitely turn into ghosts.

348
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
And it's a good question.

349
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,880
I think that as ghosts, they're still heavy enough to leave footprints.

350
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,240
Because along with the clear live dinosaur tracks, I suppose could be zombie dinosaurs

351
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,640
as degraded as they are.

352
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,560
We also really do have ghost dinosaur tracks.

353
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,020
Are you referring to the article in the Prehistoric Times which said that dinosaur tracks aren't

354
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,800
deep enough?

355
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,700
Did you see that particular article?

356
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,720
No.

357
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
What were they claiming about?

358
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,660
Well they're the ghosts that only leave a shallow track.

359
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,720
Right.

360
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,500
Well, we have tracks made by ghost dinosaurs.

361
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,480
They're blurry.

362
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,960
And I used to just joke that they were ghost dinosaur tracks.

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:53,240
Until I saw, I started noticing in photographs that were taken during certain periods of

364
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,700
dryness versus wetness in the creek, the little depressions would become more apparent.

365
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:58,700


366
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,340
And I realized they probably were dinosaur tracks.

367
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,580
They've just been exposed for a thousand years and now they're just smudges.

368
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,220
Yes, they weather.

369
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,360
A thousand years?

370
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,020
Only a thousand years?

371
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
Only a thousand years of exposure.

372
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,880
And millions of years preserved before the time of exposure.

373
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,120
Right.

374
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,940
The tracks at the state park.

375
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,680
Some of the oldest ones are still there.

376
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:28,680


377
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,080
Some of the older ones are gone now, but new ones are exposed every time there's a flood.

378
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,160
Do you think that the dinosaur ghosts actually felt pain?

379
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,580
I don't know about that, but they definitely left smudge-like tracks.

380
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,220
They might have felt existential pain.

381
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,520
What if they were like, you know, if it was winter time and it's cold outside and they're

382
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,580
having a walk, leaving their tracks, they might be tiptoeing more, you know?

383
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,640
The dinosaur ghosts were quoting Sartre.

384
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,600
These dinosaurs that were over here.

385
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,460
They're now over there.

386
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,620
Yeah, that's the whole thing.

387
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,480
That they go around, they float around like on giant icebergs and they visit their friends

388
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,080
that way.

389
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:14,260
Stang, do you remember where the Chilophysis specimens from the Triassic were extracted?

390
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,740
The location, the name of the location?

391
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,140
You'll have to refresh my memory.

392
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,640
Ghost Ranch.

393
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
Wow.

394
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,780
Do you recall that?

395
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,580
Where all the major fossils...

396
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,320
Coincidence?

397
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,520
Coincidence?

398
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,460
I think not.

399
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,160
There's no coincidence.

400
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,840
There's no money to be made.

401
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,460
May I say.

402
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,400
Other dinosaurs of famous reputation come from hell too.

403
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:52,240
There were many dinosaurs that had gas bags of lighter than air gas on their head or down

404
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,860
their spine.

405
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
In their bones.

406
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520
That helped them stand up more erect, you know?

407
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,020
They were...

408
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,580
They were...

409
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:58,580


410
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,720
They would just kind of tiptoe across the ancient world leaving these little dainty

411
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,540
footprints even though they were sometimes like a mile high.

412
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,760
And sometimes it was just their toes, you know?

413
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,620
And they would just eat and eat and eat and float away.

414
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,540
They didn't leave as many fossils but if you can get to the moon, that's where you'll

415
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:19,760
see...

416
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,240
They wanted to.

417
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,880
They do want to get fossil footprints, don't we?

418
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,380
You can see that kind of stuff.

419
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,580
That's how they filmed the moon landing with a dove.

420
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:28,580


421
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,480
And the dinosaurs did it.

422
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,080
The dinosaur fossils.

423
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,420
Yeah.

424
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,380
If you read Dr. Doolittle's adventures, you may remember that there were dinosaurs

425
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,280
on the moon when he visited it.

426
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,220
I rest my case.

427
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,700
Inevitably.

428
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,240
First Dr. Doolittle's garden, then the sequel Dr. Doolittle on the moon where a giant moon

429
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,660
moth comes and carries Dr. Doolittle and some of his friends to the moon inhabited by human

430
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,720
giants and dinosaurs.

431
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,380
Left over from an earlier era.

432
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:09,580
Would the fact of the moon being a giant abandoned skull explain the hollow ringing

433
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,700
sound when you strike it?

434
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,260
The bell-like sound?

435
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,360
Well, it's hollow.

436
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,220
It's definitely hollow and it reverberates when struck as a special experiment showed.

437
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:19,940
The moon does?

438
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,800
Yes.

439
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,400
Yes.

440
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
Well, that would be of interest to H.G. Wells.

441
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,040
Well.

442
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,520
Uh.

443
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,300
I remember reading a comic book years ago standing in the drugstore next to my house,

444
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,440
which suggested the moon was a giant egg that was about to hatch.

445
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,580
And it does in the comic book.

446
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,300
What comes out?

447
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,320
Some large griffin-like thing.

448
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,020
That wasn't a comic book.

449
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,960
That was an episode of Super Friends from Saturday morning.

450
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,540
Well, you've got to feed the monster.

451
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,320
They'll put in an idea from anywhere.

452
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,860
Yes.

453
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,480
X-Day in 1998.

454
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,960
When the men from Planet X arrived.

455
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,420
Yeah.

456
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,320
Now, it may sound ludicrous.

457
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,820
It may sound ridiculous to many of the believers out there.

458
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,100
It may sound impossible.

459
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,540
Are you saying they're all nuts, all those people?

460
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,220
Maybe.

461
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,340
Yeah, maybe.

462
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,980
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbant.

463
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,000
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

464
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,560
Evil stalks them.

465
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,760
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

466
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,300
Do they come to you?

467
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


468
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


469
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


470
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


471
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


472
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


473
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


474
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


475
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


476
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


477
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


478
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


479
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


480
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,300


481
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,180
What's the point of waiting for them to come down in Flying Southers?

482
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,740
Flying Southers are bearing on us.

483
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,640
We don't know what to do.

484
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,740
We're here all alone.

485
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,820
The planets are fading.

486
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
The blood is running.

487
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,080
The lights were fading.

488
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,820
And they stalked us one by one.

489
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,820
The very...

490
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,940
This is the Man in Black here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

491
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,280
Are we controlled by Satan?

492
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,280


493
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,280


494
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,280


495
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,280


496
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,280


497
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,120
Secret forces.

498
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,720
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

499
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,280
Do people think you're strange?

500
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,600
Do you?

501
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,760
Then you may be on the right track.

502
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,080
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me!

503
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,620
That was when Super Friends actually was going downhill.

504
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,120
I mean, it reached its peak with Challenge of the Super Friends,

505
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,120
and then it had a couple of seasons that were, well, less than mediocre.

506
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,440
What kind of a challenge can there be if you're super?

507
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,180
It's like Challenge of the GoBots.

508
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,680
The whole thing is rigged from the beginning to end.

509
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,660
It puts the media in mediocrity.

510
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,700
Yes.

511
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,820
There are many with tattoos on this.

512
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,780
Oh, I'm so sorry the radio audience can't see the cool backgrounds that many of us have.

513
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,260
Yes, you can see into subgenius sights here.

514
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,700
The radio audience can send away for a series of magic lantern slides

515
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,040
to hold directly in front of the face and then shine a Klieg light directly into the eyes,

516
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,940
one per eye.

517
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,160
And burn those images in, then they can see them at any time.

518
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,940
In fact, they will never.

519
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,300
Whether they want to or not, because they'll be there forever.

520
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,140
Yes.

521
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,740
Also, it's available at no extra cost in the Church of the Subgenius.

522
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:42,200
If you would care to see the green energy demons, simply look at the sun and wait.

523
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,040
You'll see them.

524
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,580
Well, our president does that.

525
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,180
Yeah.

526
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,580
We can make some branding irons for the eyes.

527
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,340
Little branding irons for the eyes.

528
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,540
We can make some images that we like on them, you know, and sear them forever with those images.

529
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,560
Oh, I mean, a lot of the younger subgeniuses did that already.

530
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,400
They have tiny bobs tattooed on their eyes backwards.

531
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,600
You know, so it looks right to them.

532
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,460
Eyeball tattoos is a thing in prisons.

533
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,320
That's for real.

534
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,260
Well, is there any chance we are going to get Xanthia Octo-Torona on to discuss the

535
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,800
totalities?

536
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:22,800


537
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,820
Is that all you can think about?

538
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,720
Did you see the picture she posted yesterday?

539
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,560
How do you like my bob?

540
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
She posted a picture of how do you like my bob?

541
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,180
Well, she was posed about like this.

542
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,760
Yes.

543
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,720
She was climbing out of a swimming pool, stark nude.

544
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,180
She has a really good bob on the inside of her arm.

545
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,780
And you could see the top and bottom of her boobs, or her boobs.

546
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,180
Her bobs, shall we say.

547
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:02,300
She's the one who's offered to move X Day to a nudist camp in Florida where she resides.

548
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:11,020
Yeah, she and her dad own a resort in Land of the Lakes, Florida, that is also a nudist

549
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:16,460
place and would be perfect for X Day, except you can't make noise all night.

550
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,500
The neighbors are a little too nearby.

551
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,900
That's okay with me, personally.

552
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,540
I'm usually in bed up the hill by the time that happens.

553
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,360
By the time we get there, the newer generation of subgeniuses will have earbuds and their

554
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
own noise.

555
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,140
Is it true that good fortune comes to those who join the Church of the Subgenius?

556
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,980
Yes.

557
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,840
It actually is.

558
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,460
Absolutely.

559
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,280
Yeah, I got a visit from good fortune, for instance, because I joined the Church of the

560
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,560
Subgenius, Xanthea Octo-Shroom came to visit me.

561
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,520
And I found out that...

562
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,880
Yeah.

563
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:59,540
Much to my surprise, she's really intelligent, fun, nice, subgeniusy lady, and get this,

564
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,380
she's a fossil hunter.

565
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,700
She knows her geological periods.

566
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah, she does.

567
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,780
How long do we have on here?

568
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,320
Every month.

569
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,040
I don't know, you want to take a roll call?

570
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,040
Who is fit for the Hall of Heroes?

571
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,220
The Hall of Heroes.

572
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,000
Dougoth has arrived in the attendee.

573
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,100
Oh, yeah.

574
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
I'm going to pull him in.

575
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,620
I got him.

576
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,300
I got him.

577
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,680
I got him.

578
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,680
I got him away.

579
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,320
You know, I asked him if he wanted me to pull him into the panel, and I never waited for

580
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,760
an answer.

581
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,660
I just said, come on in.

582
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,820
He has a presence here.

583
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,820
Yeah, come on.

584
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,340
A lettered presence.

585
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,860
Mono-bro.

586
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
I just remembered a dinosaur joke.

587
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,120
Yeah?

588
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Please.

589
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:50,980
I just remembered a dinosaur joke.

590
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:50,980


591
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:50,980


592
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,000
that would be an old one

593
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,740
why do you

594
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,640
never hear

595
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,200
pterodactyls urinating

596
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
because the P is silent

597
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,460
oh

598
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,100
oh

599
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,640
that makes perfect sense

600
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,560
do the dinosaurs all speak a common

601
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,520
dinosaur language

602
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,000
or was it

603
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,280
broken up by the different

604
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,680
geological eras or

605
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,540
different species

606
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,220
one species of dinosaur

607
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,240
considered all the other dinosaurs to be

608
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,900
just animals

609
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,020
they spoke Esperanto

610
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,320
their speech was mostly motion

611
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,160
and color

612
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,300
it was like movements and colors with a little

613
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,480
bit of sounds and snores

614
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,920
we know this from the

615
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,180
what are those historical dinosaur

616
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,760
novels

617
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,220
Harry

618
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,580
Harrison

619
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,600
oh

620
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,520
the

621
00:26:49,520 --> 00:27:19,520


622
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,420
the

623
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,600
the

624
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,600


625
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,600


626
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,600


627
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,080
they can't have sex with normal looking cave women

628
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,560
but only a hair-lip girl

629
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,060
he meets a girl with a severe

630
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,220
cleft palate

631
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,180
and

632
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,280
she's sort of like

633
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,040
she kinda reminds him of the

634
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,640
dinosaur queen that

635
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,020
introduced him to sex

636
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,260
the mergu

637
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,200
but

638
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,000
they

639
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,640
are

640
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,340
quite advanced in their genetic

641
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,180
science and can

642
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,560
adapt other dinosaurs into vehicles and submarines and boats and things like that.

643
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah, all their tools are actually other animals that have been genetically modified.

644
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:08,140
Their guns are lizards that shoot pellets out of their, poison pellets out of their butts.

645
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,940
Paralyzed lizards.

646
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,440
Quite deadly.

647
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,420
Yeah.

648
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,660
Yeah, it's amazing.

649
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:19,500
And they speak with each other by motions and ducking.

650
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:19,720
Postures.

651
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,380
Their tails come in real handy.

652
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:21,860
Right.

653
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:29,440
It makes it frustrating for a human who doesn't have a tail to try to do the postures that signal certain tenses and frames.

654
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,260
I'm just telling Mickey that I've learned to do bee dances to tell bees where things are.

655
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
You can do the waggle dance?

656
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,660
So I do these dances and I get them to come to our flowers.

657
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:42,980
But.

658
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,340
You have to do it right and make a noise and it can be learned.

659
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,440
You can't learn a waggle dance.

660
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,620
What happens if you give them the wrong directions though?

661
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,120
Well, actually once I did something wrong and they followed me instead of going to the flowers.

662
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,320
And then we had a hundred bees in the house.

663
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,420
And, you know, I had to run from them.

664
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,580
And these things can go wrong.

665
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,760
But it's, you know, just don't.

666
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,520
I'm sure it was not you.

667
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
Don't get the dance wrong.

668
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,660
Don't get the dance wrong.

669
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,320
Otherwise they'll be eating the queen.

670
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,920
You can't run from them anyway.

671
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,900
They'll catch you.

672
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,140
You ever been bit by a dead bee?

673
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,400
Ever had a beard of bees decide to sting you all at once?

674
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,740
When one stings, they all sting.

675
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:36,360
Regarding the dinosaurs, there is this comment by a creationist that he once asked, how come man survived the asteroid and the dinosaurs didn't?

676
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,120
And somebody replied to them, social distancing.

677
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,000
They were 65 million years apart.

678
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,280
That was the proof.

679
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,100
You don't need that microphone.

680
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,100
You don't need the microphone too close to your mouth.

681
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
It's kind of too.

682
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,820
Sorry about that.

683
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,520
Yeah.

684
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,120
Work on that.

685
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,560
Okay.

686
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,480
Our dinosaur ancestors are still judging us for our proximity to the microphone.

687
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:09,380
Ryan Aldiss wrote a story where one insane person said that humans were derived from the theropod line of dinosaurs.

688
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,100
There is some kind of line.

689
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,360
There is a line of procession from dinosaurs to the early primates.

690
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,880
They're out.

691
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,180
Yeah.

692
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,180
They had two eyes.

693
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,880
That's what we call imperative anatomy.

694
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,000
Everybody has the same skeleton.

695
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,140
Humans and dinosaurs have the same skeleton.

696
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
The same body plan.

697
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,460
Coincidence?

698
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,400
Coincidence?

699
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,040
I think not.

700
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,080
You're either on the insect side, the invertebrate side, or you're on the vertebrate side.

701
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,080


702
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,080


703
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:49,940
If you're on the vertebrate side, you've got a pelvis, ribs, skull, two eyes, four limbs.

704
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:58,420
There was never any exception to this, except back in the weird Burgess shale where all sorts

705
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,480
of alien creatures tried to get started and did not.

706
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,900
Except for the ones that did and became yeti, which became subgeniuses.

707
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,560
They resembled the great race that...

708
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,720
That H.P. Lovecraft described, in fact.

709
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,240
Good lord.

710
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,300
The cone beings with the long stalk with the head on the end with multiple eyes are actually

711
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,400
represented by a Burgess shale creature called Anomalocaris.

712
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,600
Burgess shale.

713
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,880
Yes.

714
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,260
The Burgess shale is in Canada.

715
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:31,820
What is that one?

716
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,340
Story ideas.

717
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,640
It was about the...

718
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,820
Stephen Jay Gould wrote a book about it.

719
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,820
If evolution had gone slightly different, you know.

720
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:47,220
We wouldn't have this division into insects and vertebrates that we have now, but we'd

721
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,740
have these exotic, strange, utterly alien things.

722
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,120
When we were admiring the lady, we might be admiring her mandibles.

723
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,620
It's like a different reality.

724
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,700
From a safe distance.

725
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Her sexy mandibles.

726
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,620
Yeah, from a safe distance.

727
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,540
Because in the mating process, she will bite off your head.

728
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,840
The passion is there.

729
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,700
Well, that does describe my second and third marriages, but never mind.

730
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,340
Never mind.

731
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,440
Let us not dwell on the horrors.

732
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,300
Unspeakable horrors.

733
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,160
.

734
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,160


735
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,580
.

736
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:29,800
.

737
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


738
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


739
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


740
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


741
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


742
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


743
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


744
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


745
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:29,800


746
00:32:40,820 --> 00:33:10,820


747
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:40,820


748
00:33:40,820 --> 00:34:10,820


749
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:40,820


750
00:34:40,820 --> 00:35:10,820


751
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:40,820


752
00:35:40,820 --> 00:36:10,820


753
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:40,820


754
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:49,820
. . .

755
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,900
Hi, Open.

756
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,420
Because let's face it, this summer has been the summer of revolution.

757
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,280
In fact, it really seems like the end times.

758
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,080
There's a worldwide plague ravaging the population.

759
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,860
There's more police brutality than ever before.

760
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,200
And we see it over and over again on TV with instant replay.

761
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,120
And of course, all the riots and protests.

762
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Clashing with the man, looting various stores and tearing down various statues and yada yada yada.

763
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,540
Now, more than a faithful few have asked yours truly,

764
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,080
Papa Joe, you're a bomb thrower.

765
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,640
You're always preaching about hate this and hate that.

766
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
Rise up and burn it all down.

767
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,000
You do approve of the riots, don't you?

768
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,160
Or at very least, the peaceful protests.

769
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,220
Well, let me answer the second question first.

770
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,840
I don't do peaceful protests.

771
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,080
I don't believe in no justice, no peace.

772
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,300
I just believe in no peace.

773
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,380
We've already had thousands of years of their so-called peace.

774
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,600
And what has it gotten us?

775
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,160
A conspiracy, that's what.

776
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,460
So don't expect me to chill out and let up just because the conspiracy throws us a bone.

777
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,640
They can keep their bones.

778
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,700
In fact, I'm all for throwing their bones right back at them.

779
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:33,720
Starting with their skull and working our way right on down their weak little spines to the tips of their tiny little toes.

780
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,180
But now for the answer to the first question.

781
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Do I believe in a...

782
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,040
Do I approve in the angry riots?

783
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,420
The answer, dear friends, is both yes and no.

784
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,520
I do approve of rising up and taking back that which is rightfully ours.

785
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,880
And to use extreme prejudice in order to destroy extreme prejudice.

786
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,560
But when I look out and see all the violence, all the destruction, and all the marching,

787
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,460
I have to ask myself, why?

788
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
Why didn't any of these...

789
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,140
Why didn't any of these people stand up and protest or fight the system in the name of Bob?

790
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,420
Oh sure, social justice is a good cause.

791
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,220
Like the media says, social justice is more important than social distance.

792
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,520
So long as your justice agrees with my justice.

793
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,960
And your distance is at least an arm swing away from my fists.

794
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,820
But there is a bigger issue than social justice, dear friends.

795
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,180
There's an issue...

796
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,780
There's an issue bigger than winning in November.

797
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,980
And there's an issue bigger than curing the COVID pandemic.

798
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,380
And that issue is J.R. Bob Dobbs!

799
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,460
For 23 years, he's been waiting for us to rise up and show the conspiracy bosses who the real boss really is.

800
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:03,400
He spent his entire life lining up an alien armada to rocket all the way to the sneaking globule of dirt

801
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,160
located in the armpit of the universe just to rescue us from this hell on Earth.

802
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,840
Was he expecting too much for us to demonstrate just a little faith that he would return

803
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,140
and provide some fifth column resistance or outright guerrilla warfare

804
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,440
to make his X-Day invasion a tiny bit easier for the X's overlords?

805
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,640
Jesus H!

806
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,060
No wonder he keeps putting off the final evacuation year after year.

807
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,460
It's bad enough that most of the sub-Gs are drunk, passed out, or asleep during the 7-day egg cattle call.

808
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,140
But this year?

809
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,740
Oh, this year.

810
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,900
It's even.

811
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,720
Worse.

812
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,900
We're finally revolting against this system and claiming that we're destroying the chains of oppression

813
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,720
and tearing down statues of colonial slave owners and Civil War slave masters.

814
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,780
But what about our slave owners?

815
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:04,740
Why, there's no mention at all about them or their modern-day 9-to-5 rent-a-slave conspiracy

816
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,040
or the daily denial of Dobbsian liberty.

817
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,600
In fact, there's no mention of Bob Dobbs in the slightest.

818
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,620
It's as if he doesn't even exist.

819
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,880
Oh, it makes me sad.

820
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,840
Sad to think that on July 5th, just before 7am,

821
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:29,120
Bob's gonna fly down in the first Reconno-Saucer to enter our sub-orbit since this time last year.

822
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,620
And he'll see all the crowds.

823
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,980
He'll see all the smoke.

824
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,620
And he'll see all the tear gas and debris and toppled statues.

825
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,420
And he'll think,

826
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,340
Finally!

827
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,200
Finally!

828
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,040
I can land this ship and let my people go to the Pleasure Planet I promised all those years ago!

829
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,260
And finally, I can release the shock troops to put this planet out of its misery!

830
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,360
But then...

831
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,020
Then, as he enters NORAD's radar range, he'll start receiving TV and radio broadcasts

832
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,960
and he'll realize this is not about him.

833
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,320
It's about us and the normals and the cops.

834
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,720
Alack!

835
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,280
Alas!

836
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,600
Imagine his pain and disappointment!

837
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,580
We were so close to salvation, so very close!

838
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,400
But we stopped just short of the goal line.

839
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:28,400
If these puny pinks wanted to save themselves, they'd spend less time debating whether to take a knee for the national anthem

840
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,700
and instead would take two knees for Bob!

841
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,960
But, but, but, Papa Joe!

842
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,600
This is a good cause!

843
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,300
Don't you think?

844
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,880
Don't you think Bob will approve of us fighting to make Earth a better place for everyone?

845
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,780
No, I do not!

846
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,120
Because Bob is not coming to Earth to make it a better place!

847
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,700
He's coming here to take us, his chosen, TO a better place!

848
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,780
A better planet where none of these problems occur!

849
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,440
Where none of this pinkness exists!

850
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,400
And then, just to make sure no pinkness infects anywhere else in the universe,

851
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,320
he's going to make Earth a better place by utterly destroying it!

852
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,760
Yes, it's a dirty, dobsian duty, but someone's got to do it!

853
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,280
And whatever you do, don't get nostalgic about it because Earth is dying anyway!

854
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,940
Even the conspiracy scientists admit we only have a few years left regardless.

855
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,980
At least with Bob, not everyone is neutralized, and the billions who are are put out of their misery quickly

856
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,780
without all the long, drawn-out, pomp and circumstance.

857
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,640
That's showing a lot more compassion than the conspiracy ever showed us!

858
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,620
When the boot was on the other foot,

859
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,540
they always piled on the pain and suffering in slow motion!

860
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,440
So they're getting much better treatment than they deserve.

861
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Of course, now the Bobbies and conspiracy collaborators are getting a little nervous

862
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,540
and starting to murmur and fidget.

863
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,360
But Papa Joe, that's all supposed to be a big joke, man!

864
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,420
You're sounding kind of serious! You're sounding like a religious fanatic!

865
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,240
News flash! I am a religious fanatic, and proudly so, because I know what's at stake!

866
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,640
You think it's a joke because we told you it's a joke,

867
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,340
because that's the only way we were able to pull this thing off with any element of surprise

868
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,960
and to stay out of prison in the meantime.

869
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Fine! It's a joke. Keep telling yourself that.

870
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,420
And stop listening to my sermons, because it's not for you.

871
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,000
It's for the faithful.

872
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,380
Those truly dedicated to Bob.

873
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,680
Those truly dedicated and willing to die for Dobbs!

874
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,780
Because nothing, nothing is more important than he is!

875
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,460
Not you. Not me.

876
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,780
And certainly not them.

877
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,100
So don't start getting soft on the humans, because pink lives don't matter.

878
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,060
Now, I'm not saying don't attend the protests.

879
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,140
And I'm not saying don't riot.

880
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,760
But I am saying, if you want real, everlasting change,

881
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,180
these little demonstrations simply won't do.

882
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,040
The only riots and protests that can achieve something that dramatic are for Dobbs.

883
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,040
And they ain't peaceful nor pretty.

884
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,280
Because there's no negotiating or changing the minds of the conspiracy.

885
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,420
It's against their nature to compromise.

886
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,080
The only way you change them is to destroy them.

887
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,480
They not only have the cops, they have the military.

888
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,180
And the only way to destroy that is with help from Heaven.

889
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,380
Or should I say, the Heavens.

890
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:29,140
Because that's where Bob and his alien overlords will drop out of lightspeed and light this candle!

891
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,500
It's not too late to fix our fate.

892
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,520
We have up until 6.59 AM, July 5th, to change the future course of planet Earth.

893
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,920
We can either keep slamming our heads against the wall, trying to improve a planet dying of diseases,

894
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,440
climate change and social chaos,

895
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:53,260
or we can jettison this bitch and move on to greener, not pinker, pastures.

896
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,740
I suggest you put that proposition in your pipe and smoke it.

897
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,160
And!

898
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,800
If you do attend any protests or riots, do it for Bob's sake.

899
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,540
At least buy and wear a Bob's face chin bandana,

900
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,720
so maybe, just maybe, it will at least look like you're fighting for a cause worthy of his divine intervention.

901
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,240
And we'll find out soon enough if he falls for it or not.

902
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,400
And I'll be cheering you on all the way.

903
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,120
Because I, for one, am tired of waiting.

904
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,320
Here in the wood of Bob, breathe!

905
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,600
Bob!

906
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,320
Amen.
