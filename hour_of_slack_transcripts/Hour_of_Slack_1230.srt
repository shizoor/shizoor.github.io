1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
I got to thinking about something.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,420
Yes, dear?

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,260
A new and wondrous thing.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,700
The finest dignity and elegance.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,560
What is it?

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,160
The self-genius.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,500
Power of Slack.

8
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,720
What a wonderful idea.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,300
Oh.

10
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,760
Oh.

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,520
Uh, Bob.

12
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,300
Oh, yes.

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,880
Right.

14
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,940
Thank you again, Fernanda Nandi-Lemur.

15
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,720
And welcome, friends, to another great Hour of Slack rerun.

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:36,580
This one from episode number 374 from early 1993 when we were still in Dallas 16 years ago.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,520
We have lots of recordings on hand from the successful revival in Portland,

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,160
but I'm in the middle of a somewhat larger subgenius project,

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,140
and rather than edit those new cuss-filled rantings down,

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,380
I'm saving time with this superb rerun.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,480
Incidentally, there is now...

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,660
an archive of MP3s of hundreds of old, uncut hours of Slack from the 1990s,

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,180
free for downloading.

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,560
And if you want to check those out,

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,800
go to csubgenius.com and click on the radio button in the upper left.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,240
That'll show you links to the old shows and hundreds of newer shows

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,920
and text logs of every track on every show.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,000
You can even subscribe.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,700
I should also...

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,500
mention that there is a Church D-Vival in Detroit coming up on November 28th,

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,300
and the Amino Acids will be playing there along with many other people.

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,200
And there are weekly sub-rants by Pope Mike Flores in Chicago

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,860
every week of December at the Liars Club.

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,120
For information, see the Events button at subgenius.com.

35
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,320
And now, Hour of Slack number 374 from 1993.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,040
What?

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,440
Bob said to party!

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,160
Party!

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:00,860
Party!

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,120
Bob said you had to party.

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,500
You had to party.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
You better party.

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,760
You didn't say you might if you felt like it.

44
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,140
In and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.

45
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,540
And I want you to take a deep breath.

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,000
One, two, three, hold it.

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,320
Ready?

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,840
One, two, three, four.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,300
And now...

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,740
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,100
Airplane and regulation there.

52
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,440
You know, it's the crowded elevator of the show.

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,040
We all have to make room for each other and try not to, well,

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,980
make matters so unpleasant that we get off before reaching our stop.

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,820
I kind of think of our subgenius family as one big,

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,420
happy,

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,120
happy bunch of gibbering idiots.

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,720
How do you know?

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
I had to sterilize my toes.

60
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,440
They sucked my toes.

61
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,420
Oh, yeah, those poor, horrible, scuzzy guys.

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,580
They married your toes, though.

63
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,440
It was sanctified.

64
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,180
Did they really?

65
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,840
They really sucked my foot.

66
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,660
It's precisely what did happen, but of course,

67
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,700
we were terribly sorry that we had to nail her into the mummy case

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,560
and close the iron door.

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,680
And we have the videotape.

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
We have the video version of this show.

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,720
You can see the video version of this show,

72
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,820
even more stultifying and magnificent than the audio version.

73
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,600
This is us, up on the rooftop cafe,

74
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,180
while Bob Nelson does the dirty work downstairs.

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,960
We're swilling our hot buttered rum martinis and our feet are up on the table

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,540
as we're having a spitball session,

77
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,380
figuring out just how we're going to put together a script for the next subgenius.

78
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,660
Praise Bob!

79
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,700
Yeah, no kidding.

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,400
Praise Bob!

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,860
Praise Bob, dear friends.

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,200
And you know, Dijkstra's law states that everybody is someone else's weirdo.

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,200
Bob, because he seems somehow so normal to everyone,

84
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,940
is the only one who is truly weird.

85
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,860
And they said,

86
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,100
as ye hath the pipe, so shall ye smoke it.

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
And lo, it was smoked.

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,520
And it was good and pure.

89
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,960
And all the world smoked with him.

90
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,700
For let he who hath wisdom know,

91
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,360
it is the wallet of a man.

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,460
Economicon 614.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,480
And dear friends, as we begin our show,

94
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,020
let's also reflect on the words of Magistra Beatrix,

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,740
who said that Bob,

96
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
speaking of our guru Bob Dobbs,

97
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,700
Bob is the spiritual fractal,

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,700
for he is made up of uncountable dots.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,220
But each of these dots in turn comprises, yea,

100
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
uncountable Dobbs heads,

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,580
each of which in its turn is also composed of unending dots.

102
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,560
And so it goeth from lasting unto everlasting.

103
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,780
And you know, friends,

104
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,440
if you could see the universe from outside,

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,620
at just the right angle, the best seat, so to speak,

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,500
why all the stars would make up a huge Dobbs head,

107
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,480
a huge portrait of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

108
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,340
But I think most of us,

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,000
most telling and most pertinent of all of these,

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,360
is this statement by the great German philosopher Goethe.

111
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,960
Goethe said,

112
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,320
I believed that I discovered in nature,

113
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,500
animate and inanimate, intelligent and brute,

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,340
something which manifested itself only in contradiction

115
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,560
and therefore could not be grasped by a conception,

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,820
much less by a word.

117
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,800
It was not godlike, since it seemed reasonable,

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,880
not human, since it had no understanding,

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
he's talking about Bob, friends,

120
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,800
not devilish, for it was beneficent,

121
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,800
not angelic, since it often evinces schadenfreude,

122
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,260
it resembled chance, since it showed no sequence,

123
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,240
it resembled providence, since it pointed at connection.

124
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,380
It could surpass all that limits us.

125
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,780
It seemed to deal at pleasure with the basic categories

126
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,900
of our existence.

127
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,900
It contracted time and extended space.

128
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,160
Only in the impossible it seemed to delight

129
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,800
and to repel the possible with contempt.

130
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,580
This essence, this show,

131
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,980
which seemed to insert itself between all things,

132
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,000
to sever them, to bind them,

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,480
I named the demoniacal,

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,300
after the example of the ancients

135
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,780
and of those who had observed the Dobbs.

136
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,540
Ah, yes, dear friends, and you know,

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,620
we enjoyed a simply fantabulous New Year's subgenius

138
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,120
devival last Thursday night here in Dallas,

139
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,440
just simply fantabulous.

140
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,360
That Club No in Deep Ellum,

141
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,500
and the preachers were in top form,

142
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,980
half of them were babes in bondage get-up, practically.

143
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,020
Praise Sister Mary Squared.

144
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,600
The video projections looked good,

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,660
the band of ones was truly subgenius

146
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,280
in that they played anti-music for the first ten minutes

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,940
so that those who were sissy enough

148
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,520
to be driven away by that would miss

149
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,900
the great Doctors for Bob lyrical ballads that followed.

150
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
But more importantly,

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,240
the most important thing was,

152
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,900
as Charlie Gilder there at Club No told me,

153
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,260
they'd never had such a good crowd ever,

154
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,880
and we were able to pay all the preachers

155
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,440
and musicians, which to me,

156
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,940
is the most critical part of any religiopus event

157
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,180
produced by our ministry.

158
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,580
Oh, yes, dear friends, and you know,

159
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
normally the week after such a devival,

160
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,380
we play the tapes from that on the radio,

161
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,500
but I can't do that this time.

162
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,200
I can't.

163
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,620
And we're going to have to play those best of,

164
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,660
mixed with the new Jane or Hyperclete's album,

165
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,760
by the way, and Sister Susie the Floozy's

166
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,100
Atlanta radio ministry next week.

167
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,200
But tonight's show instead,

168
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,460
well, we discovered the most amazing thing

169
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
at the devival.

170
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,240
A number of people told Willa Dobbs,

171
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,160
who was manning the sacred sales table,

172
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,360
that until they got the postcard or saw the poster,

173
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,140
they didn't know there was a subgenius radio show in Dallas.

174
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,020
And many of these were subgenius ministers.

175
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,040
I guess they hadn't read all of their Stark Fist magazine,

176
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,680
church newsletter.

177
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,640
Anyway, so I imagine we have some new listeners tonight

178
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,580
who are yet subgenie-y.

179
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,340
So for them, I've rather hurriedly actually put together

180
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,400
a quote, typical, unquote hour of slack.

181
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,260
That is some of our best oldies mixed in with new stuff

182
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,100
from our old standby contributors,

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,740
plus some live ranting.

184
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,360
It's an introductory show again, you might say.

185
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,560
So let's get to it.

186
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,560
But first, I've wanted to say that the devival,

187
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,800
the videotapes of the devival looked great,

188
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,480
especially the ones shot by Honest Joe Riley

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,680
and the selfless Bobby Self.

190
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,600
He's no Bobby, which are the only ones I've seen yet.

191
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,640
Aunt Susie, the floozy's bump and grind looks riveting.

192
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,080
And the lascivious video projection behind her, oh well.

193
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,160
And by the way, anybody who's listening

194
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,900
who was shooting videotapes there,

195
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,960
please call us and arrange for us to get copies from you

196
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,540
in exchange for whatever you want.

197
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,260
Whatever you might want from our collection,

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,900
because you can't imagine what visual delights might await you

199
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,160
if, like a true subgenius, you share your media coverage

200
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,920
by throwing it into the big mix.

201
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,360
And this show is dedicated to the girl whose four friends hated our club devival.

202
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,600
And yet she staunchly and dobsfully defended it

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
like a true warrior of the faith.

204
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
And Will overheard this conversation.

205
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,960
The four other girls were going,

206
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,900
you know, how could you do this to us?

207
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,960
You made us waste our new year.

208
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,820
Oh, it's just all so ew, stupid.

209
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,400
And the hero girl was saying,

210
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,980
my God, you were there?

211
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,840
You were there and yet you didn't see it.

212
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,120
It was a fantastic show and it happened right before your eyes.

213
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,200
And yet you were blind to it.

214
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,160
Well, I don't know if she said it that way,

215
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,640
but honey, if you're out there,

216
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,020
you are truly of the book.

217
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
And I'll address the Satan guys later.

218
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,140
But let's go ahead and get on with it, shall we?

219
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,020
This is Bob, and we'll be orbiting your area for the next hour,

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,580
carrying the message, the seed word of the faith of Bob,

221
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,160
the faith in Bob, FIB we call it.

222
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,040
Can you keep up the FIB, friend?

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,140
You want to dump the main shunts?

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,780
Thank you.

225
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,620
All right.

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,140
Show is on.

227
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,340
Show is right up on the green lines, doctor.

228
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,880
Show is fully on the line.

229
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,420
We will be landing on another show.

230
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,540
We will be docking with another show tonight.

231
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,140
Pardon me.

232
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,460
You can't land on another show.

233
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,860
We'd cause a nuclear explosion.

234
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,220
We'll be docking with show four from San Francisco tonight.

235
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,260
And hold onto your seats and...

236
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,860
Oh!

237
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Oh, my God!

238
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,220
It's time to be manipulated.

239
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,480
Brother, I want to tell you something.

240
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,120
The world is tired of dead priests.

241
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,820
They're tired of dead preachers preaching dead preachers,

242
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,280
dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,920
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

244
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,240
This world is hungry for reality.

245
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,940
They've had enough of Hollywood.

246
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,780
They've had enough of Nashville.

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,840
They've had enough of show business.

248
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,280
You can't hide from God.

249
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,560
You can't hide from God.

250
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,040
You can't hide from God.

251
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,160
He's bigger than you.

252
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,920
He's bigger than all infinity.

253
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,900
He's bigger than all reality.

254
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,220
He's bigger than somebody.

255
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,440
He's bigger than half of God.

256
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,680
He's bigger than all life.

257
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,400
He's bigger than all life.

258
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,680
He's bigger than all time.

259
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:46,680


260
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,280
He's bigger than all infinity.

261
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,420
He's bigger than all reality.

262
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,460
He's bigger than many,

263
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,560
He's bigger than many,

264
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,280
He's bigger than him.

265
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,960
He's bigger than everybody else.

266
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,480
He's got more hair in black and white dots than you've got in from the real world.

267
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,540
The sound itself, it, it has a stink to it.

268
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,200
You find no mention, no mention what wherever in there to God.

269
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,940
Well, that's kind of strange.

270
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,740
Are you saying that the Bible isn't, like, which Bible is credible as far as you're concerned?

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,360
None of them.

272
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,320
They've all been tampered with.

273
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,540
You're saying, George, portions of the Bible are.

274
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,340
So are you saying that at one time the Bible was correct?

275
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,200
No.

276
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,780
Was it ever?

277
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,860
No, ever.

278
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,120
It says in these documents that Jesus went through the crucifixion, but he didn't die.

279
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,960
It's Bob!

280
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,900
Church of the Subgenius, eternal salvation, I'll triple your money back.

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,820
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely because of your ministry.

282
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,020
They said your mind is in this.

283
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,420
They said your mind is in this jar, and then they poured it down the sink.

284
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,960
No, really, we're a fun crowd.

285
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,900
You'd like us to move in next door to you.

286
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,760
You, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

287
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,820
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye, a smile or a leer on our lips,

288
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,860
but otherwise we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale,

289
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,220
a good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man,

290
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,380
ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring.

291
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
How about it, America?

292
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,560
Get in step.

293
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, let's try it out, huh?

294
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,940
We shield ourselves from discomfort.

295
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,320
We shield ourselves from the comforts of everyday, every week, every year, every life.

296
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,780
Luxuriate in cooperation.

297
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,180
No goal but minimizing work, minimizing contact with the universe.

298
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,200
Thus, we do not fulfill the potential in our genes.

299
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,520
Cometh the Visigoth, Vandal, Hun, Pancho Villa, Conan,

300
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,860
to reap what is still goodly in his God-given sight.

301
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,600
By sight shall you be known to the reppers, who will replicate that which is God,

302
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,760
and discardedly non-rep rest for the bit bucket.

303
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,180
Hell?

304
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
Be not deceived.

305
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,080
Dobbs is not mocked,

306
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,600
for whosoever a man soweth,

307
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,400
him also shall he reap.

308
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,100
Lord is my shepherd, I shall not whine.

309
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,680
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

310
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,080
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon,

311
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,420
which?

312
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,280
In a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change,

313
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,520
and carnage, insanity, and destruction,

314
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,420
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

315
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,760
Dobbs brings a new destiny for America.

316
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,940
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power

317
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,600
to those in the know,

318
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,540
while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes

319
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,980
fry in hell on earth.

320
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,000
You probably already knew that the U.S. government

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,840
is a sham.

322
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,140
Something popped up there for you to blame.

323
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,980
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

324
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
That they are actually shambling,

325
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,900
unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

326
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,520
They may say, we're here to wake you up to what the truth is.

327
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll also tell you another thing.

328
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,160
They say, it's our, we made the mess.

329
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,480
Look around at the planet.

330
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,560
I mean, you got the air is polluted, the water is polluted, everything else polluted.

331
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,840
We made the mess.

332
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,980
We will transmit instructions for you.

333
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,140
We will tell you how AIDS was created.

334
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,300
We'll tell you what its purpose was and how you can cure it.

335
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,640
But you got to do it.

336
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,720
We're not going to do it for you.

337
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,840
This is your job.

338
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,400
You clean up your own room.

339
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
So you're, they're doing this through you though, George, right?

340
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,060
Well, not just me, but I mean, you and these people that you're communicating with.

341
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,540
That's correct.

342
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,180
And you're going to talk about this in the seminar.

343
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,160
That's exactly right.

344
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,580
I'll go into all of these areas.

345
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,060
How, why, in other words, they said before you can cure a problem, you better know what

346
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,940
the problems are.

347
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,960
And they're so vast.

348
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,960


349
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,960


350
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,960


351
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,960


352
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:58,960


353
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,940
They say, we are here to awaken you to the massive lies.

354
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,420
And it's everything.

355
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,540
Now, you see it.

356
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,560
Now you don't.

357
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,320
First you feel it, but you don't really know

358
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,680
If it's over you, there's something in the air

359
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,100
What's come over you, there's something in the air

360
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,460
Just check the sensors for invisibility

361
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,260
Become a duck that's helping stalking

362
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,140
I've got my UFO detector on

363
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,920
Engine signals flash the warning that it's over you

364
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,360
There's something in the air and they're watching you

365
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,580
There's something in the air

366
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,060
The cloaking device, the cloaking device

367
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,320
The cloaking device, the cloaking device

368
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,040
I'm just getting real superstitious, I'm looking for signs everywhere

369
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,480
I've got a feeling in my bones, there's something in the air

370
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,260
There's something in the air

371
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,500
Something in the air

372
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,160
Something in the air

373
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Something in the air

374
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,860
Stay awake, new age

375
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,340
Take control

376
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,040
Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack

377
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,040
Hey, hey, now wait

378
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,660
Shot your soul

379
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,360
With Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Lol

380
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,780
Hey-ho, hip-ho, boba-ray

381
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,440
Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack

382
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,960
Yo-hey, rocking dachte

383
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,040
Anything the Hell, anything the Hell

384
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,700
20 years ago

385
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,040
Radio You're playing rock but I'm better than rock

386
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,040


387
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,040


388
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,040


389
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,040


390
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,800
coca colisiosom, coca colais,ibb, all of that and every little dungly, sing and do it.

391
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,920
It is only natural that such things would occur considering the segregation of the sexes enforced by the papacy.

392
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,420
Such a thing would have never been permitted when the ways of Odin held sway across Europe.

393
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,760
A simple day's study of nature would have shown the blasphemy of locking man with man and woman with woman.

394
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,740
At this point, we must deal with the troublesome question of demons.

395
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:57,540
Many right-thinking Christians scoff at the idea of demonic existence even as they acknowledge the devil's power.

396
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:06,660
Closed biblical study shows that demons are, in fact, electrical manifestations and properties in the service of evil.

397
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,720
Just as stray electrons create unstable elements, isotopes, and deadly nuclear reaction,

398
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,240
so demons represent malignant forms of energy.

399
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,560
Play.

400
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,160
Hell?

401
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,220
And whither, whither we?

402
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,420
Blame it on the Quasanova?

403
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,700
Don't take individual responsibility.

404
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,640
Let Congress do it.

405
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,740
To us?

406
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,000
If we don't grab this little local mother, it's gonna fall over.

407
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,280
The multiple stages, as resolved into words by Bob Wilson in Luminatus, are real.

408
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,520
If 2012, exact date, exact time,

409
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,800
is the culmination.

410
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,280
If Rebus Canebus gets the bus.

411
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,160
If we aren't ready, will there be another bus?

412
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,080
Is that rapture?

413
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,900
What is tribulation, twixt now and then?

414
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:11,840
Is God standing with all the soul bits of self, of her himself, here and there now, seeing all time, and this possible leap of evolution?

415
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,780
Will we leap only by cooperative competition?

416
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,720
What does the historic figure Jesus, son of God, and the Holy Spirit, have to say?

417
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,960
What does the human signify?

418
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:31,340
Is the holy, ghostly, undermined mind, subconscious, racial, racial, memory, mythos, a communication link?

419
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,300
With precarnate being, not past or future, but both from here and all along from there.

420
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,580
Can we remember?

421
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,700
In his standing day, I see the light of the world.

422
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,700


423
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,700


424
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,700


425
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,020
And the dreaded eyes like smoking.

426
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,080
And his great, teasing cheers.

427
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,440
And the dreaded eyes like smoking.

428
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,220
Piss your money away.

429
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,540
There won't be no rainy day.

430
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,920
And Bob will sell you all the sun.

431
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,560
He's unlined with Jehovah.

432
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,820
But he ain't no man.

433
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,480
He ain't no God.

434
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,700
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

435
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,420
He ain't no man.

436
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,060
He ain't no God.

437
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,920
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

438
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,300
At his desk in Dallas, the dreaded eyes like smoking.

439
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,000
Behind his mirrored windows, the dreaded eyes like smoking.

440
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,940
Lent up your pot, let go the smoke.

441
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,260
This is slack, it ain't no joke.

442
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,580
Respeed to Bob, lift up your chain.

443
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,900
And you will pay, to know what you think.

444
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,580
But he ain't no man.

445
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,300
He ain't no God.

446
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,560
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

447
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,280
He ain't no man.

448
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,940
He ain't no God.

449
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,840
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.

450
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:15,980
Bob tried.

451
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:15,980


452
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,620
Now to continue with the tape recording.

453
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,680
We're going to see. Get ready.

454
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
What I'm talking to you about today is the most up-to-date thing that I could talk to you about.

455
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,160
We're meeting in the closing moments of this dispensation.

456
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,360
An old man finds it, touches it, and this is the shocking result.

457
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,220
From then on, there's no stopping the mob as it spreads from town to town.

458
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,240
It's indestructible. It's indescribable. Nothing can stop it.

459
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,420
This town is in danger.

460
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,720
How can it be stopped?

461
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,660
Mob hysteria sweeps one city.

462
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,180
They've all wronged the nation, and then the world can lean flat on the mob.

463
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,380
Barring speeding and a cast of exciting people.

464
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,740
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

465
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,600
Oh, yes, good friends.

466
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,420
Oh, and what a prophet he is.

467
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,640
That crazy old Bob.

468
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,120
Well, I guess it's time for me to dig in on what you've been listening to here.

469
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,820
Wow, listen, I want to listen to this for a second.

470
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,400
Wow.

471
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:58,900
Wow.

472
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,640
It's cool.

473
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,420
It's hot.

474
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,900
And yet it's so sinister, dear friends.

475
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,820
Now I can switch my little tapes out and tell you what you've been listening to.

476
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,160
Um.

477
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,240
A collage, going backwards in time.

478
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,160
Okay, a collage from old subgenius media barrage tapes.

479
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,560
The song Dread Dobs, that reggae song, is by Lost Souls Incorporated from Arlington, Texas.

480
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:37,920
The rant with flute and Robert Anton Wilson quotes was by Reverend Ficus Strangulensis.

481
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,040
I think from West Virginia, I may be wrong.

482
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,160
I don't know.

483
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,760
Uh, some demon clips sent by...

484
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Reverend Lou Minotti.

485
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh yes, up in Nashville.

486
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:57,880
And the song Cloaking Device, the one about the UFOs, was by the Ultimate Klingons.

487
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,480
That's Reverend Nancy Darnell of Berlin, Germany on vocals.

488
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:12,120
And a lot of best of hour of slack bits with much Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence from

489
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,180
the KPFA subgenius show.

490
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,080
And some, a little bit of G. Gordon Gordon heard there.

491
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,440
G. Gordon Gordon was here this last weekend at the show, but he was strictly doing security

492
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,240
and uh, refused to come up on stage.

493
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,620
I'm really blaming him.

494
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:36,760
Uh, and some, quite a few clips interspersed with that by Reverend Nick Nolan.

495
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,220
Oh dear friend.

496
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,340
So what do we do next?

497
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,080
Heck.

498
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,240
I've got a...

499
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,800
I'm at an awkward point.

500
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,560
A taped flipping point.

501
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,200
But, well heck, why don't I tell you?

502
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
Who is Bob?

503
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,380
Who, what, what indeed is Bob?

504
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,820
Bob is tomorrow with a smile on his face.

505
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,120
He's progress with a pipe in his mouth.

506
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,900
His enthusiasm, his sexuality, makes the world go around.

507
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,100
His friendly handshake meets the payroll.

508
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,220


509
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,220


510
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,220


511
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,880
He's one heck of a salesman.

512
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,560
Bob Dobbs is retailer, wholesaler, jobber to the world.

513
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,260
He is courage with an open mind, hope in a pair of shined shoes, pride in a gray suit.

514
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,640
He has the strongest pair of feet in America.

515
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,520
He's a merchant of ideas, a dealer in dreams.

516
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,200
He's part magician, part actor, part magician.

517
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,200


518
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,200


519
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,200


520
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,200


521
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,760
He's part missionary.

522
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,360
He's peddler, huckster, pitchman.

523
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,240
He's the carnival barker of the world's biggest sideshow.

524
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,720
The world is his store.

525
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,220
He's one hell of a salesman, friends.

526
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh, let's just pause and listen to this lovely music here from Reverend Arnold Mathis.

527
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm going to be in the middle of a

528
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,200


529
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,200


530
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,200


531
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,200


532
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,200


533
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,440

The conduct of the Second

The Somers climber

589
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,620
Which, to me, was the must to fight today with God,

590
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:21,120
which năm It is the city of H Derek

591
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,220
The path to change this is that of the present

592
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:24,280
We indeed are dog

593
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,060
We are reservist

594
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,060


595
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,920
I think that No

596
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,200
We're our

597
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,100
Incom Army

598
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:43,820
spent his life exhorting people to pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your

599
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:49,500
own delusions as he puts it. Yet his parables often have just the opposite effect. People line

600
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:55,900
up, dollar in hand, hoping to relax in the safety of his delusions, proving to themselves by giving

601
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:03,420
him money that they too are truly stupid. Many who donate are lawyers, doctors, computer scientists,

602
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,640
religious leaders, and famous artists. They intuitively know that as the years progress,

603
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,780
their incomes and peace of mind will be increasingly dependent not on their cleverness,

604
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:21,560
their critical sense, but on their lack thereof. You see, Bob's plan has succeeded financially

605
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,120
simply by predicating itself upon the deteriorating intellectual environment.

606
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:32,820
It appeals ultimately to those who have recognized that environment for what it is

607
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,400
and who are not.

608
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:41,560
Now try to profit from its very ineffectuality. This church of the subgenius is composed of

609
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,480
people who have learned the classic textbook definition of sanity and who can mimic its

610
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,820
legal appearance, but enjoy the exact opposite in the privacy of their own homes and in the

611
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:02,840
invisible secret workings of their careers. We call this practice schizophreniatrics and we call

612
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,400
this show the show of the subgenius.

613
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:08,900
So friends, the subgenius radio ministry hour at slack and why it looks like it's time,

614
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:18,900
oh so sad, but it's time for us to move on and vacate the airwaves for something no doubt a great

615
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:30,260
deal nicer and prettier. But I will leave you with this heavenly music composed by the great

616
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,300
saint Jay Condom on his, uh,

617
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,080
album Zombo Fropland available only from subgenius records and tapes as far as I know.

618
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,720
Oh no it's not. It's not available from subgenius records and tapes. It's only available from

619
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,380
from Jay but his address has changed from the one that... oh well...

620
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:56,660
Hey friends, it's just a fun little family we have here, just a family of friends, and

621
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:03,400
we did have a great New Year's celebration. a wonderful time and...

622
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:03,400


623
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,760
and it even made money.

624
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,420
The most important part of this

625
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:14,180
and really the survival of any viable world religion.

626
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,540
A praise, Bob, and a thank you so much.

627
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,060
What for, I'm not sure.

628
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,760
Thank you.

629
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,560
Thank you.
