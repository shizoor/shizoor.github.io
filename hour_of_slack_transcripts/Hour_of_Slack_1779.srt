1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to announce the next attraction.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,840
I refer to the subgenius, Cowboy Dave.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,340
What?

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:27,560
Oh, yes, dear friends, and thanks for the donations to help Lonesome Cowboy Dave last week that so many people sent in.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:40,300
Now, please don't hate me for this, but this hour of Slack, number 1,779, is going to be all me talking and, to some extent, ranting from last year's Starwood Festival.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,160
And Princess Wee sings near the beginning.

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:55,920
In the old days, I would have broken this up into sections and interspersed it with thematically connected songs or other clips, but I must not spend too much time on one show.

8
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,060
No.

9
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,940
I really need my time for more book creation, or at least book reprints, something.

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:10,060
Besides, this particular Starwood rant was especially rambling and didn't really have any kind of sane sections.

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,980
I was working from some notes, but not any kind of prepared speech.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Also, and this is true, Vermin Supreme's pony had just dropped a big load of horse hockey on the stage next to my pulpit.

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,960
As we were getting set up.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,780
Yes, presidential candidate Vermin Supreme was a guest also, and we made friends and hung out, and he gave me a tie.

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,040
It wasn't really his pony.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,100
Some locals brought him a pony and a goat so he could illustrate his campaign promise of a pony for everyone.

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,820
And we just adopted three stray kittens, and I want to get back to staring at them playing.

18
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,040
So here's my last year.

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,780
Here's Starwood rant, uninterrupted except where old news has been removed.

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,800
Price bother.

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,300
Here we go.

22
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:14,600
We can't promise you a pony in Church of the Subgenius, but you might get one of these if you're lucky.

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,280
And look, it works for all kinds of ways.

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,500
Boys, girls, things.

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,540
Things.

26
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,540
Things.

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,500
Do you dare to see the thing called it?

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,900
Well then stand by for the subgenius devival.

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,240
Okay, friends, first off, thanks for sticking around.

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,840
I know the pony is kind of a draw.

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,900
But as I was saying, stick with the Church of the Subgenius long enough.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,440
You won't get a pony.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
You'll get one of these.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
Only it won't be the stuffed one.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,540
A prairie squid, we call them.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,580
They're endangered.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,700
Thanks to people like me.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:23,460
But before we get going here, I'd like you all to join me in a traditional moment, a somber, sober moment of a quiet moment of sacred noise.

39
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,840
Price Bob!

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,000
Price Bob!

41
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,040
Price Dad!

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
I am God Bob!

43
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,860
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,180
Oh yes, oh, the power.

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,320
The power.

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,000
I love the peep tough.

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,140
Yeah.

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,380
And I need it, man.

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,280
I need the power.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,640
But first, Princess We Are Doe and I have a little song for you that's about Starwood

51
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,120
and X Day.

52
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,020
Or rather, the X Day drills, which are the festival just preceding Starwood.

53
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,640
All right.

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll be Mr. Douglas and you be Lisa.

55
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,560
Okay.

56
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,760
That actually matches.

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,900
Head acres is no place to be.

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,580
Conspiracy is not for me.

59
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,260
Bad jobs that like to break my back.

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm going to X day and letting Bob give me slack.

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,700
Starwood is where I'd rather frock.

62
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,160
All night drumming, let it never stop.

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,880
I just adore the pagans best.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,000
Stang, I love you, but X day is a sausage fest.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,500
The slack.

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,480
Kick back.

67
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,640
The weed.

68
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,840
The mead.

69
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,760
Why not do both?

70
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,280
And take off all our clothes.

71
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,780
Geek acres.

72
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,920
We are.

73
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,400
There.

74
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,520
Isn't that?

75
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,940
Isn't that?

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,200


77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank you.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:13,500
We're going to spare you our two-hour version of the Who's Rock Pop Rock Rock Opera, Tommy,

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,200
which we've changed to be about our dog, Buddy.

80
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,300
You won't get to hear that this year.

81
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,280
It's not quite ready.

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,200
I missed last year's Starwood.

83
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,380
For personal.

84
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,660
For personal reasons.

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,460
We're glad you're back.

86
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:41,820
By the way, if they ever decide to do a workshop in how not to assist in a suicide, I can help with that.

87
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,540
Anyway, yeah, it's been two years since I've been here and there's all these big changes in me.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,760
And this is where I'm going to, I'm going to talk about what really concerns people of my age and generation.

89
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,840
My health.

90
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,660
Medicaid got mentioned.

91
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,140
Yeah, I turned 65 last summer.

92
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,480
And suddenly, I was on Medicaid.

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,540
Suddenly, I went from Hercules to weak and doddering.

94
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,800
An endless snowball of pain.

95
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:26,220
It's, uh, it's as if all the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.

96
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,540
Hit every single cell in my body at once.

97
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,400
All thousand of them.

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,400
And there's a hundred billion cells.

99
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,520
So that's like a hundred billion pangs of a hundred billion pains.

100
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,440
Including Alzheimer's, arthritis and allergies.

101
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,460
And that's just in the A's.

102
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,380
So I could use a prescription for some VIM.

103
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,460
But I have faith.

104
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,520
That X Day will come.

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,620
Yes, X Day.

106
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,460
The promised solution to all our problems.

107
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,540
Where do we go from here?

108
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,660
Well, when X Day comes, my friends, the down home for real people will still have jobs.

109
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,640
But it'll be the jobs they wanted.

110
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:25,440
When X Day comes, if you have a secret wish, that secret wish will come.

111
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,440


112
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,440


113
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,560
When X Day comes, there'll be peace on Earth.

114
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,260
And goodwill among the remaining men and ladies and such.

115
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,820
Because only the peace ones will remain.

116
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,740
When X Day comes, the warlock will be wiped out by the peaceniks.

117
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:51,300
When X Day comes, class division will be based only on tastes in bands, art, fashion, tattoos.

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,420
And everybody will know it's all just a bunch of vain bull-hats.

119
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,700
And when X Day comes, medical care will be better than on Star Trek.

120
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,920
And completely free and automatic.

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,420
Unless you want to be sick.

122
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,060
And when X Day comes, love will permeate the universe.

123
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:16,540
And everyone will put up with each other's irritating habits with fantastic patience and equanimity.

124
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,680
The mind your own business police will make sure everybody lets bygones be bygones and just stays off of your lawn.

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:39,140
But, until X Day comes, the subgeniuses will party and bullshit and party and bullshit and party and bullshit.

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:54,500
All apologies due to the last poets who originally brought that up, made those statements about a less understood minority.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,340
And I do have actual serious things to say about the problems of the world.

128
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:17,940
But first, I want to share with you a funny little, well I'm going to let you have a peek inside a secret subgenius forum called the Mature Gentlemen's Club.

129
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,440
It only exists on a, like a non-Facebook.

130
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,300
Non-Google.

131
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,360
One of those secret, like Telegram or Mastodon or something.

132
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,340
We have a bunch of those.

133
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,700
And this one is such an august and limited secret society.

134
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:46,560
Not the only people in it are me, Philo Drummond, my partner, and Onan Canterbyte, Philo's brother, the Mature Gentlemen's Club.

135
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:54,480
Anyway, the other day, Onan said that he had changed a line from our classic old subgenius pamphlet.

136
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,620
Pamphlet number two.

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,000
Only a buck over there.

138
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,720
I'll let him go for what's printed on it.

139
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,460
Just because we love you.

140
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,340
We don't really, but we like you.

141
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:20,140
Anyway, Onan said that he had to change the line about more, this was advertising for us, more hate and intolerance than even the moral majority newsletter.

142
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
And Onan had changed that to.

143
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,480
More hate.

144
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,160
More hate and intolerance than even the internet.

145
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,760
Philo said, yeah, that's a lot more relevant because the moral majority is defunct.

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,220
Onan said, the moral majority hated as hard as they could, so I won't slight them.

147
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,300
It's just that the internet hates more in a modern sense.

148
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
And we hate even more than the internet.

149
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,080
We hate the internet and ourselves.

150
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,620
And we hate the hatred of ourselves.

151
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,640
So it's complete and all encompassing.

152
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,780
Cleans the slate.

153
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Philo said, I agree, but I no longer hate myself.

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Onan said, well, the hatred of yourself, hatred won out.

155
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,100
Philo said, yes, I love myself.

156
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,400
But for all the right reasons this time.

157
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,520
His brother Sphinx Drummond said, I used to love hating myself.

158
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,340
Onan then suggested a new pamphlet.

159
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,780
I forgot to hate.

160
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,380
Sales pamphlet number 345A.

161
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:40,000
And then he mentioned that Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz project, a few of you might be familiar with him, used to live in Portland.

162
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,940
He hated about as hard as anyone I've met.

163
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,320
He had to move to Canada to hate less.

164
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,500
That's not hard to imagine.

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,500


166
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,500


167
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,500


168
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,080
Because he lived in Texas.

169
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,420
Philo said, I tried loving myself for all the wrong reasons.

170
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,300
But that was ultimately unfulfilling.

171
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,800
Onan asked, who then is the hater?

172
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,420
And who is the hated in a dance of self-hatred?

173
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,260
He made that sound like it was a Nietzsche quote.

174
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,080
But it's not.

175
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,900
He made it up.

176
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,600
Philo said,

177
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,620
It's the kids parade.

178
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,800
They always step on my slack.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,560
No they don't.

180
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,760
They're part of the slack.

181
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
Go kids.

182
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,740
Reproduce.

183
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,500
You gotta fill in the empty blanks.

184
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,520
There's been a lot of holes left in our population lately, friends.

185
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,580
And we need them kids up there to get to work reproducing and making more little pagans and yetis and subjeans.

186
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,600
Philo said,

187
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,400
I think my hate levels were strongly correlated to my testosterone level.

188
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,680
I think that is also true of my formerly famous stinky feet.

189
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,900
And Onan said,

190
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,540
Hatred alone kept your feet from stinking worse.

191
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
And so.

192
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,360
And I said,

193
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,560
All that earlier hate talk is just a joke.

194
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,700
And Philo said,

195
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,380
I'm dancing with a hate on.

196
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,160
And Philo said,

197
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm filled with too much love.

198
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,800
Too much tough love to hate.

199
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,040
I say don't hate those you berate.

200
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,760
And I said that my problem was,

201
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,560
I have too much kinder,

202
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,320
gentler hate to feel tough love.

203
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,740
This is such a ball busting routine.

204
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,660
Philo came back with,

205
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,540
My love is as tough as a clock.

206
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:46,640
And I said,

207
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:46,640


208
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,020
I'm a crusty old cowboy boot.

209
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,100
His brother said,

210
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,740
My love is sweeter than turds.

211
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,040
Onan said,

212
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,340
It was so very important to me to hate well.

213
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,820
When I was a younger subgenius,

214
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,560
I made sure to keep the flames alive for today's younger subgenii.

215
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,120
They need to know about the conspiracy,

216
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
especially the conspiracy inside your mind.

217
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,800
To which,

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,860
Sphinx Drummond said,

219
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,440
My hate is prettier than heaven.

220
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,100
And Philo said,

221
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,040
My love is stinkier than a pair of four week old gym socks.

222
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,880
And now that those kids are mostly gone,

223
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,600
I can go ahead and finish this up.

224
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,920
This will be censored for the radio version.

225
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,280
My love is so stinky,

226
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,960
it has its own butthole.

227
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,580
Said Philo.

228
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,500
His brother said,

229
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,760
My love is so hungry,

230
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,760
it eats its own butthole.

231
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,680
That's why my love's butthole is so stinky.

232
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,680
Philo said,

233
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,960
Because it only eats other buttholes.

234
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,580
And I said,

235
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,440
I'm going to steal this whole spouting session and deliver it as a rant at Starwood.

236
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,040
Prophecy fulfilled.

237
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,920
To which Philo threw in one last,

238
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,320
Question.

239
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,000
If you were Keanu Reeves and you accidentally married an orangutan,

240
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,100
would you let it watch you take a dump?

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,480
So there's some questions to ask yourself, friends,

242
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,020
as you move forward through life.

243
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,220
I do have some immediate actual news

244
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,460
about the church and subgenius.

245
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,020
Number one,

246
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,620
somebody made a movie about us,

247
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,680
and it came out really good.

248
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,220
We were,

249
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,240
some,

250
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,380
most of us were surprised.

251
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,260
I wasn't.

252
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,900
I had,

253
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,960
I really had faith.

254
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,420
And the director,

255
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,900
Sandy Boone,

256
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Sandy is the widow of an ancient subgenius who died a long time ago,

257
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,640
but she never forgot.

258
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,920
And,

259
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,140
she started,

260
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,620
well,

261
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,660
she was smart because the true story behind it all is actually really interesting.

262
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,640
And,

263
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,700
we're not all going to be around to tell them stories forever.

264
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:35,040
There's a lot of people making movies about old weirdos and underground cartoonists and artists and such

265
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,180
for that very reason.

266
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,660
And,

267
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,040
that's a good idea.

268
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,820
Furman's got a movie about him,

269
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,400
and we can't show this,

270
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
of the subgenius movie,

271
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,440
which by the way has the very creative title of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

272
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,020
We can't show it because it's still in film festivals.

273
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,060
It was shown in,

274
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,620
at South by Southwest.

275
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,400
The audience loved it.

276
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,880
I loved it.

277
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,840
Well,

278
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,040
of course,

279
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,900
I meant it a lot,

280
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,460
so I would,

281
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,380
but I mean,

282
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,000
the other,

283
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,760
the other subgeniuses did too.

284
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,740
And,

285
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,880
it was at the Dallas Film Festival,

286
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,840
then the San Francisco Indie Film Fest,

287
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,160
and it just showed in Galway, Ireland,

288
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,560
I think Melbourne, Australia is coming up,

289
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,780
and then Montreal, Canada.

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,800
So some people think it's good.

291
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,740
And I believe that it will probably be on Netflix or something

292
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,540
before the end of the year.

293
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,780
They still don't have a distributor.

294
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
I don't even have a copy.

295
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,300
But,

296
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,660
I think it's a better recruitment film

297
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
than the one we did called Arise,

298
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,640
available over there.

299
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,920
Arise is kind of preaching to the saved.

300
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,400
Only somebody who's already a subgenius

301
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,360
could even bear the first 15 minutes of it.

302
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,100
And that's before it even starts.

303
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,920
That's just the instructions and warnings

304
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
and caution labels.

305
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,340
So that,

306
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,880
that is really good news,

307
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,340
and we're hoping to get a,

308
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,880
lots of new blood.

309
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,140
We need that.

310
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,480
Meanwhile,

311
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
Dr. Drummond has,

312
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,180
a subgenius television,

313
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,840
channel.

314
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a part of the,

315
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,460
OSI 74 network on Roku.

316
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,440
So,

317
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,280
you kind of either have to have one of those little Roku sticks,

318
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,420
they're about 30 bucks,

319
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,420
or,

320
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,820
look at the same stuff on Vimeo.com for free.

321
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,120
He's playing,

322
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,660
not only our older films and shorts,

323
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,560
which are available at the sales table over there,

324
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,420
but several different types of collections.

325
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,920
But also,

326
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,520
weird lost underground collections of clips

327
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,820
by weird collectors of weird clips.

328
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,920
Including the hypnotic eye,

329
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,600
Joe Riley,

330
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,820
the late Joe Riley show,

331
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,060
and a bunch of other stuff.

332
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,240
It's really eye melting,

333
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,820
and if you aren't on drugs when you see it,

334
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,640
you might as well be,

335
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,540
because of what this stuff does to you.

336
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,660
So be careful.

337
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,120
Other news,

338
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,460
we started publishing books again.

339
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,360
We didn't start with a subgenius book,

340
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,340
we started with a fiction,

341
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,500
science fiction book by Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

342
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,140
the great radio spouter of,

343
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,360
kind of like my spouting buddy on Hour of Slack.

344
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,520
And,

345
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,580
you know,

346
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,520
he has a very original way of talking,

347
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,480
that I usually don't really understand

348
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,340
until I'm listening to the playback.

349
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm faking it during the shows.

350
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,680
In fact,

351
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm faking everything,

352
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,120
because I'm almost totally stoned deaf.

353
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,120
So,

354
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,160
whenever I act like I'm replying to something a person says,

355
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,520
it's just a lucky guess usually.

356
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,140
But they don't expect sense,

357
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,680
so that doesn't matter.

358
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,540
Oh, and the last of all,

359
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,260
anyway, yeah,

360
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,780
Neighbor World is for sale over there.

361
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,280
It's paperback.

362
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,400
See,

363
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,240
you know,

364
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,320
you can hide it on your page,

365
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,680
and it's a good person,

366
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,100
even if you're in prison,

367
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,700
because it'll roll up that tight.

368
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,040
I've had to learn a lot more about that kind of thing lately.

369
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,000
But as Bob once said to me while worshiping Moloch,

370
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,320
I only believe in two things,

371
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,400
Santa Claus,

372
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,720
and the fact that he doesn't exist.

373
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,620
That's,

374
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,820
that's the kind of wisdom you can expect from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

375
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,640
He also said,

376
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,500
oh wait,

377
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,860
you know what I really should do,

378
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,500
there may be a few people here,

379
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,140
who don't really know,

380
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,180
exactly what Church as a subgenius is.

381
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,200
Well,

382
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,380
it took Sandy Boone an entire 90 minute movie to explain it,

383
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,580
and she did a really good job.

384
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,860
And I think that it,

385
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,500
a lot of people here will like the ending of it,

386
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,060
because it,

387
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,240
it actually tackles that whole,

388
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,780
where do we go from here thing,

389
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,680
quite well.

390
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,760
If you're a MAGA hat wearing Trumpaloompa,

391
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,600
you probably won't like the end of it.

392
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,500
I have friends,

393
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,480
who are Trumpaloompas,

394
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,200
and relatives,

395
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,780
and I actually understand where they're coming from.

396
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,260
They're coming from cartoon land,

397
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,040
but,

398
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,100
yeah.

399
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,520
This,

400
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,180
this book,

401
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm gonna read a little bit,

402
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,560
normally I don't read from our books,

403
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,840
but this one's been out of print,

404
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,720
since right after it was first printed.

405
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,300
It was our new,

406
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,680
most,

407
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,620
our latest one,

408
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,440
put together in 2006,

409
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,380
the subgenius cycle,

410
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,460
the encyclopedia of slack,

411
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,000
the Bobliagraphon,

412
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,600
new revelations from Bob Dobbs,

413
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,480
the church of the subgenius,

414
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,060
slack with a vengeance.

415
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,640
After the book of the subgenius,

416
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
and Revelation X,

417
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,920
finally comes the third testament,

418
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,820
of the living avatar of slack,

419
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

420
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,860
As Robert Anton Wilson said,

421
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,100
this is one of the best of all the one true religions.

422
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,780
R. Crumb said,

423
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,400
finally a religion,

424
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040
even I can believe in.

425
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,560
And Mark Mothersbaugh said,

426
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,780
Bob is the enema for a constipated society.

427
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,640
A masterpiece for those who can still laugh at the fact that nothing is funny anymore.

428
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,360
Now what that one guy in the previous panel said,

429
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,480
from the audience,

430
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,500
basically going,

431
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,340
you guys are just jacking off up here and selling your books,

432
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,500
which I didn't quite get,

433
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,600
because nobody had mentioned anything about that.

434
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,160
I was jacking off,

435
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,260
because I knew that I'd get to do it,

436
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,300
and I'd have another hour's worth.

437
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,440
But as Voltaire said,

438
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,120
don't go telling everybody else how to plant their garden,

439
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,020
until you've mowed your own damn lawn.

440
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,080
So, you know,

441
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,840
we're kind of teaching by example,

442
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,520
and really my job,

443
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,400
is to keep a few geniuses from committing suicide.

444
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,820
Honestly,

445
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,620
I really do believe that that's a lot of my job,

446
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,880
is to just cut them some slack at a point in their lives,

447
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,760
when they need it at the worst,

448
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,820
and the reason I think that it's a good job,

449
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,080
is because I get a lot of letters saying that,

450
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,080
not just to me,

451
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,160
but to the general sub-genius group in general.

452
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,380
We have been able to somehow hit people at just the right time.

453
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,300
Sometimes it didn't have anything to do with our books,

454
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,520
they just walk into a public restroom,

455
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,740
intending to overdose themselves or something out of despair,

456
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,660
and there'd be one of those stupid dobbs heads,

457
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,240
stuck on the understeer,

458
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,400
on the other side of the toilet seat,

459
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,780
just when they're about to drown themselves in there.

460
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,460
And the absurdity of that,

461
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,820
was enough to make them go,

462
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
okay, that's a sign,

463
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,340
God or Bob's gonna kill me anyway,

464
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,860
I might as well wait and let them do it,

465
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,600
they're professionals.

466
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm an amateur by definition,

467
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,460
I'll probably screw it up.

468
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,940
There are times,

469
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,480
when it probably would be the best idea to kill yourself.

470
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,640
But check with me first,

471
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,680
there's right ways and wrong ways.

472
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,760
I missed last Starwood because of a wrong way.

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,780
Anyway, the publisher's advisory on this book says,

474
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,480
be careful who sees you holding this book.

475
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,940
The divine program from a source not of this world

476
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,100
can yet be known to mortals,

477
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,500
if they have enough money.

478
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,400
The bibliography on liturgies and gospels of the church of the sub-genius,

479
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,600
the perfect self-validating philosophy.

480
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,040
That's actually a joke because it pulls the rug out from under its own philosophies constantly.

481
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,940
There are self-validating philosophies,

482
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,200
and that's my friends the Trumpaloompas.

483
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,160
They've got a perfect,

484
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,240
and it's not Trump's fault,

485
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,520
Trump's just a symptom.

486
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,880
It's been going on for a long, long time,

487
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,500
and very surprisingly well planned.

488
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,420
And of course the easiest thing to say is Fox News,

489
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,020
and fake internet news,

490
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,020
and yeah, thanks to the internet,

491
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,720
you can validate anything you want to believe.

492
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,860
You can find 10,000 other maniacs out there

493
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,720
that think that same wrong thought

494
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,660
that makes you feel so good.

495
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,120
And that's the problem, if you ask me, part of it.

496
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,700
This is real.

497
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,640
Everything you know is true.

498
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,300
Bob is the proof.

499
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,500
And down in very small print it says,

500
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,520
some animals were harmed in the making of this ecosystem.

501
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,100
So yeah.

502
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,440
I.e. the conspiracy thinks it can own everything.

503
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,220
We must stop them,

504
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,080
even if it means owning everything else.

505
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,440
To this end, the followering zombobs

506
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,680
toiled day and night to implement

507
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,240
this dobbshead online system,

508
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,860
repentertainment,

509
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,100
a valiant attempt by dozens of subgenius artists and writers

510
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,720
to save those last few hundred thousand souls

511
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,260
from condage before the advance of X-Day.

512
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,300
God, I don't even remember most of this stuff.

513
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,560
I'll have to read this someday.

514
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,820
So there, if you're down in the Trumps,

515
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,660
about President Cartman,

516
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,760
and his fans,

517
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,140
you know, I had a horrible vision of Trump fans,

518
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,120
they're kind of like Howard Stern fans.

519
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,020
He is their testicles.

520
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,240
The loud man on the radio

521
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,580
is their nuts.

522
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,400
Well, no, testicles.

523
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
They are nuts.

524
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,700
They have no nuts.

525
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,400
They follow this nut

526
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,780
because he is

527
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,040
the only way they can get their nuts.

528
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,720
Korea and Russia

529
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,420
can do whatever they want.

530
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,560
They can just walk up

531
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,540
and grab our country

532
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,180
by the pussy.

533
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,440
And they grabbed the pussy.

534
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,940
One thing that came up

535
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,880
towards the end of that panel discussion

536
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,900
was the fact that

537
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,660
not just the internet,

538
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,080
but all electronics could be shut down

539
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,980
almost instantaneously,

540
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,680
either by magnetic pulse from nuclear exoplanets,

541
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,580
or by the power of the internet.

542
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,540
Or Mother Nature could do it.

543
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,700
Solar storms have happened

544
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,600
in the distant past

545
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,040
that were strong enough to

546
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,440
pretty much disable all electronics.

547
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,780
You'd have to remake everything from scratch,

548
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,980
which would take a long time.

549
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,680
We were talking about that.

550
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,000
Actually, that happens at the end of a wonderful movie

551
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,580
called Escape from L.A.

552
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,260
He pushes the button

553
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,300
and shuts down

554
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,300
all the electronics

555
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,460
and even all the...

556
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,440
Then that vape pipe would go out, Fat Mandy.

557
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
Your vape pipe would go out.

558
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,800
The movie ends with him

559
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,120
lighting a wooden match.

560
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,020
You know, old-style paper match.

561
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,680
When was the last time you saw one of those?

562
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,880
When that day comes,

563
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,900
25 years later,

564
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,660
there won't be anyone left in America

565
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,760
but bikers and Amish.

566
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,460
Because they're the only ones

567
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,280
who know how to live without all this crap.

568
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,240
And 25 years after that,

569
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,100
the entire population could be described

570
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,600
as Amish bikers.

571
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,300
And if that's the way it goes,

572
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,720
we had more power to them.

573
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,280
I've ended up with an odd

574
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,780
little big man kind of life.

575
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,780
I was raised a fairly pampered

576
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,400
little white boy in the 50s

577
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,500
with not a rich family,

578
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,520
but a middle-class family.

579
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,920
My dad was a lawyer.

580
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,260
But then after 25 years,

581
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,680
after I left home,

582
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,180
I ended up living on Lakota Reservation

583
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,300
in South Dakota for two years.

584
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,100
First as a documentary guy,

585
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,160
but then as a school teacher.

586
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,300
We hung around because

587
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,900
I kind of liked it there.

588
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,380
Although I didn't,

589
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,580
we didn't know until we got back to Dallas

590
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,660
just how twin peaks

591
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,100
we had gotten living in that tiny rural community.

592
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,380
And Indian reservations,

593
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,260
or in this case, the CQB,

594
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,180
the Chang'e Oyanke Reservation, Rosebud.

595
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,320
It was extra weird and creepy.

596
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,540
That was where I learned that

597
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,080
I can't see a UFO when everybody else can.

598
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,980
I can't see a ghost when everybody else can.

599
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,280
The damn UFOs and ghosts came in

600
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,100
and abducted me and hypnotized me,

601
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,080
so I'd always think that that kind of thing

602
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
was just a dream, a night-hack dream.

603
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,780
Or, you know, sure there's

604
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,520
unexplained things going on,

605
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,400
I don't question that.

606
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,360
I just question the explanation people have for them.

607
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,920
Why do we have to know?

608
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,460
Who said we have to know

609
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,300
what the purpose of life is?

610
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,060
It didn't come with an instruction book

611
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,380
until the book of the subgenius!

612
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,260
Available right over there for I think 22 bucks now.

613
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,500
Act fast.

614
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,700
Yeah, okay, I lived in an Indian reservation.

615
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,480
I lived in a mostly Hispanic,

616
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,360
Mexican neighborhood in Dallas,

617
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,780
real low income, for 20 years.

618
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,420
And then I lived in a really poor black neighborhood

619
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,880
in Cleveland for a long time.

620
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,000
Now I live in a middle class,

621
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,680
really mixed neighborhood.

622
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,620
That house is still for sale, by the way.

623
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,620
It's really nice.

624
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,500
It's of historical significance.

625
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,160
Subgenius Foundation operated out of there

626
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,000
for 25 years.

627
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,400
And of course it's got to be haunted.

628
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,440
But that doesn't do me any good.

629
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,680
I can't see them.

630
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,760
Anyway, my dad died and his big house

631
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,160
on this ranch,

632
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,380
it's not really that big of a house,

633
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,720
but it's a big ranch,

634
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,560
suddenly became mine.

635
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,620
And I never thought

636
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
that I could live in rural Texas,

637
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,660
especially not my wife and her mom,

638
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,040
who are much bigger libtards than me.

639
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,760
She's really a peace activist.

640
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,180
Although I've tried to teach her about human nature.

641
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,960
I kind of regret it for her, I think.

642
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,140
But the horrible political news from Texas,

643
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,680
I mean, I would sit there in Cleveland every morning

644
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,740
and read the stuff from Texas that was going on.

645
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,540
It's just, I thought I could never go back there.

646
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I mean, it's just too primitive.

647
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,280
Well, when your feet are on the ground

648
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,600
and you've actually been there a while,

649
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,140
it's totally different than the city monger,

650
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,940
Facebook reader's view of rural Texas.

651
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,140
It's just, it's just too primitive.

652
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,240
And I think that's the problem with rural America.

653
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,080
We sophisticates like to laugh at stuff

654
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,980
like the creationist museum in Kentucky.

655
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,800
The one that's designed to be an exact replica of Noah's Ark,

656
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,360
but they can't get flood insurance for it.

657
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,660
And they've already had it wrecked by flooding.

658
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,740
And it was paid for by the taxpayers.

659
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,720
Church of the Subgenius

660
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,280
isn't even a nonprofit group,

661
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,460
because we don't think that your taxes should go to a religion

662
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,640
that you might not support.

663
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,840
Plus, we wouldn't be able to get away with it.

664
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,380
But we have a creationist museum in my little small town,

665
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,800
Glen Rose, Texas.

666
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,820
There's a creationist museum that is so fantastically stupid.

667
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,340
It's wonderful.

668
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,980
Oh, God, you feel so, so,

669
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,600
so superior walking through there

670
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,420
and looking at these very obviously fake dinosaur tracks

671
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,500
with a fake human track in the middle of it.

672
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, that's where the pre-Adamic man was fleeing the deluge.

673
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,360
And the dinosaur was faster.

674
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,380
It went through there first.

675
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,380
Then the humans landed in there afterwards.

676
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,500
Then, of course, the deluge came and turned all the sand into rock

677
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,240
and made the Grand Canyon just to trick them science peoples.

678
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,340
Well, we're fighting back.

679
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:22,180
I don't have bumper stickers on my car in rural Texas or in urban Cleveland.

680
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,700
But we fight back quietly.

681
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm designing a rival for the creationist museum.

682
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,200
It's called the Destructionist Museum,

683
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,380
Destructionist Evidence Museum and Sanitarium in Glen Rose, Texas.

684
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,520
And we already have unearthed and have on display fossil skeletons

685
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,320
from the Cretaceous period.

686
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,080
Of prehistoric devils.

687
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,800
We have a fossil skeleton of a robot from 100 million years ago.

688
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,580
We have a gray alien skeleton.

689
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,500
We think he's responsible for the robot.

690
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,560
And two cave subgeniuses that we're calling Adam and Eve

691
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,980
because, you know, that's what people want.

692
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,680
But it's really Adam and Steve.

693
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,300
And the wreck of NASA.

694
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,860
And the wreck of Noah's Ark,

695
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,200
which actually did sink at the site of what's now the Paluxy River.

696
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,660
There's not much left of it, but that's it.

697
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,340
Only a superstitious gullible idiot would think it was in Turkey on Mount Ararat.

698
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,120
We have ghost dinosaur tracks.

699
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,920
The tracks of ghost dinosaurs,

700
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,440
which by definition are blurry.

701
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,660
We also have solid live dinosaur tracks.

702
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,320
They're a little blurry too.

703
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,100
But the ghost dinosaur tracks are really clear as such.

704
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,500
And of course we'll have road signs all up and down the road.

705
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,620
Burma-shaped style.

706
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,940
You know, turn around, you missed the thing.

707
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,280
Only five dollars, do you dare.

708
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Man eating chicken. All that.

709
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,900
Oh, and we have a, we even have a little novelty.

710
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,500
Ejaculope.

711
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,560
Those are real creatures, by the way.

712
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,840
People think that's some rural legend.

713
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,000
Ejaculopes.

714
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,020
But this one has, it's like you pull its little mounted stuffed penis

715
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,800
and it dispenses fortunes.

716
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,580
And they are real fortunes.

717
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,460
So far they've been uncannily Twilight Zone like.

718
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,720
So anyway, if I lived entirely in the internet,

719
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,020
I would think that rural America was composed of caveman choglodytes.

720
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,580
And of course, about half of rural America is just as,

721
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,720
as urban America is.

722
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,900
Heck, I'm, I've got a lot more Neanderthal blood in me than most people.

723
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,780
My DNA test showed, so I'm not proud.

724
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,020
I'm real proud actually of that very fact.

725
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:05,100
But you start seeing this, this, well the polarization has been worse

726
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,700
than I've ever seen it.

727
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,400
And I actually have been a news hound since I was a kid practically.

728
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,380
And I've never seen it this bad.

729
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,060
And it's like rural versus urban.

730
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,060
City people think the country people are just all dumbasses.

731
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:28,540
And the, believe me, the country people think that city people live in hell holes of crime.

732
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,460
You can't go out anywhere at night without somebody trying to mug you.

733
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,320
And there's morphodites everywhere just to humping on each other in the streets.

734
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,440
Actually, that's true in both places.

735
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,780
It always has been.

736
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,020
You know, they just, yeah, yeah, there's been cow fuckers of all kinds out in the woods.

737
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:56,780
You know, the Baptists just don't brag about it as much as the city people do.

738
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,720
But I've, you know, I've really ended up, I know why they voted for Trump.

739
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,420
And it is because they lived in a cartoon world composed of, you know,

740
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,760
Fox News and the Internet and just everything they know is what their friends say to them.

741
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,720
That's just as true of a libtard such as myself, except for the fact that I'm aware of that.

742
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:31,000
And I really try hard to, number one, I will not watch news on television of any kind.

743
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,000
I've never watched The Daily Show or The Rachel Maddow Show.

744
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,860
I've seen clips of whenever subgenius was mentioned.

745
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,240
But I deliberately just read everything.

746
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,240
Consequently, I can't pronounce the names of half the new presidential candidates correctly.

747
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,040
But I remember more details about why I would want to.

748
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,120
The country people get really tired of being depicted as Cletus or, you know,

749
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,500
some buck-toothed yokel in cartoons and movies.

750
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,360
And that happens.

751
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,860
And city people, of course, laugh at their cartoons.

752
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,240
But they don't like cartoon-like ideas of what liberals cite each other.

753
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,380
You turn on the radio or the TV, and for some reason,

754
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:25,260
the most popular shows are full of lies, and yet their fans call everything else the

755
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,480
lamestream news or mainstream news.

756
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,980
Now, I thought Rush Limbaugh was like the most popular radio personality

757
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,980
and Fox is the most watched news network.

758
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:37,960
But he's not.

759
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,220
He's the mainstream.

760
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,860
Suckers.

761
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,680
You know, good God.

762
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,300
Get your head out of your...

763
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,640
That's like the people calling each other sheeple or, you know,

764
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,580
oh, that person's just not woke.

765
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,160
I hate crap like that.

766
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,620
They're just put-downs for somebody who's just practically saying,

767
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,740
you just don't like their approach.

768
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,140
You know, woke.

769
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,000
What does that mean?

770
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh, awakened, enlightened.

771
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,600
According to me and my friends.

772
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:14,440
Who sit around reminding each other all the time that we believe all the right things.

773
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,260
There's nothing wrong with that, unless that's all you ever do.

774
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:25,100
You know, I mean, go ahead and light a candle for those poor people in the concentration camps on the border.

775
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,680
But are you sure that's the best place to light that candle?

776
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:37,580
Isn't there a little more than just, you know, saying, look, I'm on the good guy's side.

777
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,100
No, no, not unless you actually get off your ass.

778
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,860
But first, Bob's first rule of magic.

779
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,060
Get off your ass.

780
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,960
Absolutely the basic.

781
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,140
Magic is real if you follow Bob's rules.

782
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,140
Get off your ass.

783
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,220
Watch your ass.

784
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,440
Wash your ass.

785
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,880
I actually got that one from Red Fox.

786
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,000
Anyway, you know what I'm saying.

787
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,520
It's not all face fucking buzz.

788
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:07,580


789
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,060
It's all the buzzards and feral rednecks in the rural lands.

790
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:25,060
And the things that they keep telling me that liberals say, I've actually almost never heard anyone say, except those right wingers saying what liberals say.

791
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:31,180
Don't believe anything you see or hear or read.

792
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,980
Wait a minute.

793
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,980
That's not very hopeful.

794
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,320
Here's what is hopeful.

795
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,580
Stereotypes are evil.

796
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,540
Stereotypes are the dumbest thing in the world.

797
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,640
And that whole thing about duality, it's a lie.

798
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,040
Why not both?

799
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,680
Why not all three, four, five or six?

800
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,080
You know, I mean, there's room for everything, obviously.

801
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,460
And except for, you know, taking away other folks' slack.

802
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,840
There's not really room for that.

803
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,320
But that's the, you know, we're not PC either.

804
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,140
By either definition.

805
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,380
If we think something's stupid, we'll just come out and say it's stupid.

806
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,700
As Bob said, though, but we're only hurting the feelings of idiots.

807
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,780
That could include, I mean, idiots?

808
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,880
Isn't that, I mean, that's an ugly term.

809
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,340
Morons.

810
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,520
We prefer subgenius.

811
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,520
It's much more politically correct and empowering, you know.

812
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,540
But yeah.

813
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,800
Sheeple is what sheeple call sheep.

814
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,860
Hipster is what hipsters call hipsters they don't like.

815
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,160
And woke is what sleepwalkers call themselves.

816
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,240
Otherwise they would know better than to brag like that.

817
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:00,480
If you have to tell the world that you're a stable genius, you're probably an unstable moron.

818
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
And I've heard that.

819
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:02,500


820
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,860
I've heard this said so many times.

821
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Trump is a weak man's idea of a strong man, a dumb man's idea of a smart man, and a poor man's idea of a rich man.

822
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,740
And that all kind of sums it up.

823
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,240
For me, it's kind of a cartoon, as he said, but I'm president and you're not.

824
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,200
People take things at face value.

825
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,920
But they pick the wrong face.

826
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,460
They're supposed to be the right face.

827
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,440
It's supposed to be up there, but it's too broad.

828
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,860
The fish face.

829
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,880
It's a face-based religion, my friends.

830
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,880
We are here to, well, anyway.

831
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,260
I'll get to a real rant now.

832
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,300
It's hard for me to write a proper pissed-off rant because I actually did achieve slack.

833
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,780
Relatively.

834
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,660
I've got it pretty good.

835
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,740
I started out this rant complaining about my rheumatism and everything.

836
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,040
But actually, I'm still alive.

837
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,740
And I got old, but not bitter.

838
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,560
I'm not really that crotchety about things.

839
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,260
Unless, you know, my back hurts.

840
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,560
But the younger kids still have that fire in their bellies.

841
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,600
And this is a rant.

842
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,700
I'm going to end this with this rant by Reverend Baby Bear, who is a young woman.

843
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,180
I think she's still in Columbus, Ohio somewhere.

844
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:39,480
And she was going to deliver this at that Winter Star Ball that our friend A.J. died at.

845
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,540
And she got there ready to deliver a comedy thing.

846
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,800
And man, it was not the place to do a comedy thing.

847
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,980
But A.J. always wanted to hear that rant, too.

848
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,520
So hopefully he is listening in.

849
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,980
And maybe Dr.

850
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,760
My friend Dr. Leguim is.

851
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,720
And Dr. Dark and Heath.

852
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,120
This has been a really bad year.

853
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,060
The men from Planet X have been coming every year.

854
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,500
But they just take a few of us.

855
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,940
Or they take pieces of us.

856
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,640
Like my immune system.

857
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,500
My morals.

858
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,440
My energy.

859
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,880
Okay, anyway.

860
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,940
Baby Bear rant.

861
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,200
Listen up, you yetis.

862
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,280
I've got a subgenius bone to pick with you.

863
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,320
How many of you are paying attention?

864
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,460
How many of you can actually put down the fork?

865
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,520
Or the controller?

866
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,280
Or the remote?

867
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,360
Or the computer mouse?

868
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,460
For five dobs-forsaken minutes?

869
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,060
And listen.

870
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,500
How many of you can scream?

871
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,780
Can you hear me scream?

872
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,240
If not, you certainly aren't paying enough attention.

873
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,420
You couldn't possibly be paying enough attention to your surroundings.

874
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,960
If you aren't on the verge of screaming every second spent in this modern blast-fueling world.

875
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,160
You're just a blasphemous cacophony of anti-slack.

876
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,740
We are trapped in the goddamn bizarro subgenius world.

877
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,460
Isn't it obvious?

878
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,480
Doesn't it seem a little too perfectly aligned against us?

879
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,340
As if it was all created to be the oil to our water?

880
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,400
The kryptonite to our Superman?

881
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,280
The stiletto heel to our waterbed?

882
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,240
If it doesn't seem that way, then you haven't been paying any attention.

883
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,240
But you're in luck.

884
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,940
Because Bob doesn't care that you pay attention.

885
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,380
He only cares that you pay your money.

886
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,800
But is that really enough?

887
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,440
Thirty-five dollars once to the foundation?

888
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,660
Subgenius Foundation for a lifetime's worth of art and music and bulldata?

889
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,200
Like any good salesman, Bob included some fine print in his contract.

890
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,220
Sure, thirty-five will get you a seat in the nosebleeds of the saltwater.

891
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,820
And your own little rinky-dink planet.

892
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,040
No pick-up service included. Supplies are limited.

893
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,800
Act now, then wait for X day.

894
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,860
But is that really all you want out of life?

895
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,600
To be a spectator? To be a looky-loo?

896
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,500
To rubber-knit the bounties of life from the comfort of your armchair?

897
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,980
To soak up the effort and creativity of other yetis like a sponge?

898
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,220
Like I'm doing now.

899
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,640
Is that really going to bring you slack?

900
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,480
Ain't no one ever died wishing they'd have tried less.

901
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,620
No one ever died regretting how much fun they had.

902
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,080
Unless maybe that fun killed them, and if so, Bob speed to them.

903
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:41,600
There's no shame in living yourself to death, but in order to do that, you have to get up and live.

904
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:47,780
This ain't no Sunday church picnic, and it ain't the goddamn buffet line.

905
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,600
We don't want to get your asses in the pews, we want them jumping out of the pews.

906
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,200
There's certainly a chance.

907
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:00,620
There ain't no stadium seating, cushioned chairs, and no damn VIP section.

908
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:07,200
This is the religious pit, and we don't need permission to mosh our asses off.

909
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,380
We are the demonstrably monstrous.

910
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,240
We are the incredibly incredulous.

911
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,420
We are a pack of vehement behemoths.

912
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,700
Our fervor leaves them out in the cold,

913
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,200
but only until X day, when we put you in the pit.

914
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,620
We want you out of your seat.

915
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,820
We want to see you live and die on your feet.

916
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,380
So you know the drill.

917
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,520
X days are coming.

918
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,560
So get off your ass and show your worth something.

919
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,500
Praise Bob, praise Reverend Baby Bear for saying that wonderful rant.

920
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,020
Or writing it.

921
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,480
And I guess now it's a Q&A.

922
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,680
I skipped over the part that I usually do where I read from the...

923
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:03,660
the Starwood Guidebook and make fun of all the corny or interesting or funny workshop names out of context.

924
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,500
But they weren't really all that outrageous this time.

925
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,240
There were some pretty funny ones, but I left them in my briefcase.

926
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:19,580
Well, I think another dead subgenius, Professor Chaz, started saying,

927
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,820
you know, are we really going to sit around and wait for aliens

928
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,940
to give us a whole new planet?

929
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,800
No, not really.

930
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,520
We're already on a spaceship.

931
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,860
Let's just swab the decks of the one we're on.

932
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,740
Keep it ship-shaped.

933
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,280
Build your own ship.

934
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,640
Mow your goddamn lawn before you tell somebody else what to plant in their garden.

935
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,720
You know, and praise Bob.

936
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,180
And mind your own business or we'll kill you.

937
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,760
And we all get to go to that bonfire tonight.

938
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,440
So that's pretty slackful.

939
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,520
I no longer carry those torches.

940
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,800
I don't.

941
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,580
I used to be part of the parade.

942
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,400
The one time they let me and Princess Weed lead it, we went the wrong way.

943
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,020
But it turned out to be the right way because the original right way was so muddy,

944
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,960
everybody would have died.

945
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:17,100
So, yeah, our accident, as often happens, turned out to be good luck for everybody.

946
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,340
But we won't be around to save you this time.

947
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,020
I won't.

948
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,320
She will.

949
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,340
No, there's got to be questions.

950
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,800
Of some kind.

951
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,220
Maybe not.

952
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:38,640
Okay, now, I really am deaf, so somebody's going to have to translate that down.

953
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,020
How far north is Florida from the secret power?

954
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,160
Oh, oh, that's right.

955
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,940
Oh, you must have read the program book.

956
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,040
That's right.

957
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,320
How did I get that?

958
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,000
I skipped over that.

959
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,040
That's odd.

960
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,980
Oh, yeah, there it is.

961
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:04,380
Yeah, the conspiracy, the normal, say, they try to put you down because of your superpowers.

962
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,900
But, you know, some of us know how the X-Men feel.

963
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,160
We may not have very valuable powers.

964
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:21,300
You know, they may be pretty half-assed powers, like the power to send a fax just using your

965
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:21,480
voice.

966
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,500
My daughter could do that.

967
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,580
Or the power to go, I, I, I, I, I.

968
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,040
I have obsessive-compulsive talent, I think.

969
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,480
I mean, it certainly has helped my job situation over the years.

970
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,180
I actually kind of like doing mindless, either manual or mental labor, as long as it's tedious

971
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,320
and repetitive enough.

972
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,420
Thank goodness.

973
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,100
Some people go crazy from having to do that.

974
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,300
I don't know.

975
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:51,680
I don't know.

976
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,560
Well, it's my, my, it's, yeah, you can, the conspiracy could say I'm on a spectrum or

977
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,780
something, some spectrum or another.

978
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,460
Yeah, it's my superpower.

979
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,900
I can concentrate better than the rest of the dumbasses.

980
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,660
I can keep working when there's a baby squalling.

981
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,520
Oh, no, that's my baby.

982
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,060
Shit.

983
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,460
I never should have left it on the oven.

984
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,280
We have a friend who's on some, I don't know, some, I don't know, some, I don't know, some

985
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,800
spectrum, and he can't talk, really.

986
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:31,460
He can, he can get his, his needs across with certain grunts that we can translate.

987
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:37,660
And he spends a lot of time moving his head like this, which is his way of getting high,

988
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,160
I think.

989
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,320
I don't know what his power is good for, but it's got to be good for something.

990
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:51,280
He can arrange remote controls in certain specific orders that, you know, he can't control.

991
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,280


992
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,760
No one understands.

993
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,640
It's not by size or color, but they have to be exactly that way.

994
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:05,120
Sooner or later, we're going to get some message from aliens in crop circles or I don't know what, you know.

995
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,040
He'll be able to translate it.

996
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:07,940
Maybe.

997
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,020
Maybe that's his, that's the only thing he can do.

998
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,620
That and fold boxes.

999
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:20,160
You know, it's all, don't let him tell you that it's a, it's a mental illness.

1000
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,660
There are such things, but you'll know those when you see them.

1001
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,200
They're not fun.

1002
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,540
They're not funny at all.

1003
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,180
Crazy isn't just eccentric.

1004
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,460
And yeah.

1005
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,120
What are any other questions?

1006
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,580
Well, come on.

1007
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,320
Something about Santa Claus?

1008
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,120
Ghosts?

1009
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,500
What color are your underwears?

1010
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,140
Yeah.

1011
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,060
What color are my underwear?

1012
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:52,600
Yes.

1013
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,800
Which one?

1014
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,180
I've got three.

1015
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,480
The one closest to your man flesh.

1016
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,080
I think it's green.

1017
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,240
But it didn't start out that way.

1018
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,840
Earlier this week, I think it was white.

1019
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,240
So, you know, that's it.

1020
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,800
Why not both?

1021
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,260
It's green and white.

1022
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,440
It's this duality thing.

1023
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,220
It's just stupid.

1024
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,140
So, are you saying that subvenience is a thing?

1025
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:25,580
Do we all need the outer, the inner, and the inquee?

1026
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:33,220
No one cares about any subgenius's underwear except the subgenius who has to sleep with

1027
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,700
that one.

1028
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:41,860
So, in closing, when will the subgenius foundation be releasing a line of lingerie?

1029
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,800
Oh, when we get a little bit more successful.

1030
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,060
Actually, we do have underwear.

1031
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,120
If you look at our Cafe Press store, we have underwear.

1032
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,120


1033
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,120
Which is different from the store there.

1034
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:03,640
There are, in fact, dainties and lingerie that are either for the Bob or the Connie

1035
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,660
of the family.

1036
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,300
Or both.

1037
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,080
Why not both?

1038
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,680
Bob can wear a Connie.

1039
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,920
Connie can wear a Bob.

1040
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,800
A lot of them do it that way.

1041
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,760
I quit trying to understand other subgenius's a long time ago.

1042
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,980
I just had got to accept them the way they are.

1043
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,100
I just had got to accept them the way they are.

1044
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,960
Now, I may dislike them and avoid them, but still, I'm not going to try to understand

1045
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,180
them.

1046
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,300
That's pointless.

1047
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,660
It's actually a fun little club to be in.

1048
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:39,880
A lot of us met our true Yeti mate, either in subgenius or because I was coming to Starwood.

1049
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:48,320
There's been a lot of miscegenations and matings between pagans and subgeniuses at Crossover.

1050
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,200
And the children, oh my god, they're so weird.

1051
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,340
Their eyes glow and they can make you do anything they want you to do.

1052
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:58,960
Yeah.

1053
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,020
I've got three grandsons now.

1054
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,240
So, there'll be more.

1055
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,600
There will be more of them.

1056
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,200
We had to replace some stangs.

1057
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,120
But the kids are doing a good job at that.

1058
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,300
So, friends, we'll see you at the Crossover.

1059
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,300


1060
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,300


1061
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,040
We'll see you at the bonfire.

1062
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,060
Whatever happened to that pony?

1063
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,000
Are they giving free rides on that poor?

1064
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,320
The pony's gone.

1065
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,180
Oh, good.

1066
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,320
I feel so sorry for those beasts of burden.

1067
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,480
All I want to do is get back to my dogs.

1068
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,420
I haven't seen my dogs in two weeks.

1069
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,060
That's all I can really think about.

1070
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,060
Tomorrow.

1071
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,640
Tomorrow night.

1072
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,680
Friends, thank you very much for coming.

1073
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,940
And, uh, uh,

1074
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,960
what's the band tonight?

1075
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,240
Daddy Long Legs?

1076
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,340
Gypsy Funk Squad.

1077
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,040
Gypsy Funk Squad.

1078
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,900
Oh, they were here last year, right?

1079
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,120
I missed them.

1080
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,260
No?

1081
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,780
Well, I don't know.

1082
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,220
Anyway.

1083
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,480
Yeah, last year was a crappy Star Wars.

1084
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,300
Stan wasn't here.

1085
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,000
And a magic show by Will Bradshaw.

1086
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,020
So, yeah, I've got to clear off of here.

1087
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh, by the way, even though, you know,

1088
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,620
we're permanently moving to that little ranch in Texas with goats.

1089
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,620
A lot of goats.

1090
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:30,400
Despite that, I'm storing this pulpit right here at Wisteria.

1091
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,400
And our other decorations are all being stored permanently for the first year here,

1092
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,660
because I'm not planning to use this damn thing anywhere else.

1093
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,840
But we'll be here every X day in every Star Wars, I'm sure.

1094
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,640
One way or another.

1095
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,140
So, thank you.

1096
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,680
Well, we don't have any choice with Star Wars,

1097
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,000
because you and Joe swore to Jeff Rosenbaum that it would keep going.

1098
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,320
So, you don't have any choice.

1099
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,840
I just hope it doesn't keep losing money.

1100
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,480
Because now I'm financially liable.

1101
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,000
How did that happen?

1102
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,840
I'm the skeptic.

1103
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,700
I'm the one who doesn't believe in magic or ESP or any of that crap.

1104
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,680
And I'm married to him.

1105
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,280
How did Bob trick me that way?

1106
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,800
Why didn't my friends warn me?

1107
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,440
Okay.

1108
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,040
Enough is enough.

1109
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,240
Praise Bob.

1110
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,860
Let there be slag.

1111
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:40,620
Slag.

1112
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,320
Thank you.

1113
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,160
Thank you, Starwood.

1114
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,320
This July, it'll be a virtual Starwood,

1115
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,380
with performances and workshops streamed on video.

1116
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,380
And X Day 23 will be like that, too.

1117
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,640
Stay tuned using the subgenius.com events page.

1118
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,260
Oh, and the box of hundreds of T-shirts and bandanas should be here soon.

1119
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,200
And then, boy howdy, do I have my slack work cut out for me.

1120
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,760
Praise Bob.

1121
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,780
I'm going to be a

1122
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,740
from PR News in Washington.

1123
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,920
I'm, quote, very, very nervous.

1124
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,160
I'm so nervous that local health officials are recommending people evacuate.

1125
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:32,120
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs plans to fire four missiles over Japan and into waters around Guam.

1126
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:38,240
Japan says it's the first test of a VA's nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile.

1127
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,420
Congress has been trying for years to make it easier to fire.

1128
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,560
Now, the county health department says it's seeing the highest air quality readings it's ever recorded.

1129
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,980
For people who are vulnerable.

1130
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,920
Vulnerable people include pregnant children and anyone over age five.

1131
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,040
A Denver court has heard from the turkey.

1132
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:01,080
She testified that she groped a former turkey, grabbing her and lifting her turkey skirt.

1133
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:08,040
This turkey says it is unclear whether German turkeys are strained, and Germany has warned its citizens about turkey.

1134
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,900
After a German turkey was arrested last month in Berlin.

1135
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,920
The Dow is 2198, 25, 22, 2126.

1136
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,240
The turkey says this is PR News.
