1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Test, test, test. Maybe it had to save. Okay, now we can be funny again.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,360
Okay, three, two, one, be funny!

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,240
That never worked.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,900
Yes, that laugh in the dark.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,560
Before you leap.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,980
The laugh before you jump.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,640
Might as well laugh.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,360
Okay, so this is the beginning, the murky beginning of a new hour of Slack.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,420
Murkier and newer.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,780
At the Wisteria campground stage of the cafe at Caffeina's.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Still with the call of birth over its eyes, licking the moisture from its new-fledged skin.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,860
The embryo of this show freshly decanted, because today is another tomorrow.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So let's go.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,020
We've already established that there is some silly story about a so-called monster stalking the campground,

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,180
which is simply...

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:08,040
A cover story, in my opinion, for the fact that someone is not capable of taking care of small animals correctly.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,280
Well, what about all the air mattress sniffing that's going on?

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,140
Well, that's common among subgeniuses, according to most accounts.

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,960
After all, some air mattresses must be inflated, let us not forget.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,400
And thus, it is necessary to place not only the lips, but the entire face near the...

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,400


23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,400


24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,400


25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,600
The valve.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,460
At this time, such sniffage, as you describe, may inadvertently occur.

27
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,300
Case closed.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,440
Yes, but I have heard some major complaints of excessive mattress sniffing going on around this particular X-Day.

29
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,900
Well, people like to talk about something, so they complain against...

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,380
I mean, about others who may be perfectly blameless.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,300
Should be considered exonerated.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
And all of that.

33
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,860
Yes, it's human to make these complaints.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,140
You know, I never heard of this mattress sniffers until this campout.

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,880
I suppose you haven't.

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,520
I suppose you haven't.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,440
And suddenly I was seeing all these warnings about mattress sniffers.

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,060
But, uh, yes, I noticed this...

39
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,260
Do we have a warning here?

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,000
This day, yes.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,940
Oh, yeah, right.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,880
Now, this wasn't read out to the right...

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
Warning to all campers.

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,120
This is some sort of state public service thing.

45
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,640
Oh, hell.

46
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,520
While you're busy getting trashed and grooving to that music all the kids like,

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,280
you're...

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,420
Your air mattress may be under attack.

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,320
It is not safe to leave your air mattress unlocked,

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,340
as perverts and drug fiends have been scouting out potential mattresses to sniff.

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,300
Sniffing mattresses that aren't yours,

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,660
whether you're trying to snort up old booze fumes,

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,660
froth dust,

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,300
or the bodily fluids of that yeti you want to stalk,

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,760
is stealing.

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,920
Don't steal smells that aren't yours.

57
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,180
Steal...

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,780
Smell stealing.

59
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,820
Stealing is a pink activity.

60
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,620
Don't be a pink.

61
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,880
Pay for your stink.

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
You know, I honestly have no idea where this came from.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,200
The preceding was an announcement from the subgenius...

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,280
Bureau of Unreported Announcements.

65
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,660
And there's also those warnings about the candiru toad.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes, those are very alarming.

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,600
That shows what it does.

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,080
You just have to look where you relieve yourself.

69
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,760
In the woods...

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,780
And that toad will probably not harm you at all.

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Well, uh, yeah, there's a trail near the stage called the Yellow Trail.

72
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,080
That doesn't mean you're supposed to go there to urinate.

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,820
Although I know it has been done

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:53,080
because we've had to do some candiru toad operations to remove that toad.

75
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,200
Those are expensive and painful.

76
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,700
The toad is tiny when it climbs up your urethra

77
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,320
but it then swells up real fast

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,280
and all its barbs go out once it's in your bladder.

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,820
And the pain is just...

80
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,220
You can tell that it's horrifying.

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,480
Terrible pain.

82
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,960
Yes, like its Amazonian namesake.

83
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,100
The candiru fish.

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,780
People tried to tell us that there was no such thing as the candiru fish.

85
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,300
I have a photograph of one.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,100
There is.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,900
You can't fake a photograph.

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,020
Beware the debunkers.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,760
It's strangely enough in a book I have called Killers of the Seas,

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,820
although it's not in the sea,

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,400
but he's talking about the Cypranoid fish and makes that little side trip.

92
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,760
But it was discovered as far back as before the First World War

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,320
that these vampire catfish did exist.

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,020
Hmm.

95
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,280
When I first heard about the vampire squid, I thought it was a joke.

96
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,000
I thought it was a joke.

97
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,740
I thought it was like a silly hoax or something.

98
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,260
Nay.

99
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,680
They really are vampire squid.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:02,860
Nay, nay.

101
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,120
It's all too real.

102
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:12,900
No, the thing that we have in our bathroom that squirts water that's a tub toy is an

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,740
actual replica of a real vampire squid.

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,860
Vampyro-toothish.

105
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,780
When we got that toy, I thought it was a cute, funny joke, but then I found out there really

106
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,220
are...

107
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,200
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

108
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,100
...funny-looking purple squid that...

109
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,220
I guess they turn into bats and fly around and suck people's blood or something.

110
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,200
I don't know why else they'd be called that.

111
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,500
All this flinching and squeamishness about animal life harming humans is amusing in the

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,520
context of the fact that humans are relentlessly exterminating all the other animals.

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,900
No animal is as bad as a human.

114
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,520
Humans are the worst of all.

115
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,100
And meanwhile, they're tittering about spiders and snakes and other things, which, given

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
the harmfulness of humans...

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,620
Humans are nothing at all in the equation.

118
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,920
Yes, every animal, when it sees even the silhouette of a distant human, will freeze up and try

119
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,740
to hide, because they've learned to do that.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,280
Everything falls under the scythe of the Holocene.

121
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:22,000
And yet, even the terrifying humans, all of the humans could be wiped out by the smallest

122
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,920
members of God's kingdom.

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,380
As ye sow, so shall ye sow and sow.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,620
The Tyrannosaurus virus.

125
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,700
But there at least is one creature which the humans have saved.

126
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,920
Not that we want to spend much time talking about him, but of course you know I'm speaking

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,560
of the giant stick insects, or phasmids, of Ball's Pyramid Island.

128
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,860
Oh, they have been saved?

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,900
Not only have they been saved, but there is a successful breeding program that's going

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,520
on now at the Melbourne Australia Zoo for these giant insects, formerly thought to be

131
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,560
extinct, and now they've got thousands of them.

132
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,300
Oh good, I knew you were hot for them, Dr. Howell.

133
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:14,480
I did my best online trying to whip up some sympathy for their plight.

134
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,080
These are giant walking stick type bugs?

135
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,180
They're phasmids, like you see in the movie Pan's Labyrinth, you know, these stick insects,

136
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,440
which transmit into fairies.

137
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:34,980
But the giant phasmids of, you know, actually they were found living on Ball's Pyramid Island,

138
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,180
which is an island very difficult to land on, an island which you can hardly believe

139
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,460
in the existence of when you see the photograph.

140
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Nonetheless, it's all too real.

141
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,460
You must have seen all that stuff I put up.

142
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,600
Yeah, that's the island that the Popeye's Island of the Goons is based on.

143
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,880
Well, the island is practically vertical.

144
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,160
Oh, yeah?

145
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,160
Well, it's like a giant arrowhead sticking a thousand feet out of the sea and thin in cross-section.

146
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,120
Look at it! It's gigantic!

147
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:09,120
Hard to land on because it's not horizontal, and the Tasman Sea swarms with sharks where it is.

148
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:18,620
Part of the sunken continent of Zealandia, which is administered by Australia, though, not New Zealand.

149
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,500
Now the Ball's Pyramid stick insect, or tree lobster,

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,080
as the natives used to call it, originally lived on Lord Howe Island nearby.

151
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,300
Wow!

152
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,760
Lord Howe?

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,900
Lord Howe. H-O-W-E.

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,380
But a British freighter with an unlikely name like the Macumbo or something, I don't have my notes here,

155
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:52,780
crashed, was foundered on that island, and black Norway rats escaped and ate the delicious giant tree lobster insects.

156
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,240
No!

157
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:11,180
They were thought to be entirely extinct until, in the early 2000s, scientists poking around found a last colony of these huge but harmless insects living under a small bush projecting from the horizontal Lord Howe Island.

158
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,740
Please Google, I mean not Lord Howe, Ball's Pyramid.

159
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,320
Google Ball's Pyramid and look at it.

160
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,600
One of the most amazing sights on Earth.

161
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,760
They also have Google Map overhead pictures of it.

162
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,640
They have pictures of it showing that it's as thin as a knife blade.

163
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,900
So coming out of the ocean, near the horizon there's this incredible vertical spire.

164
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,380
Wow!

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,540
The last home of these insect creatures.

166
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,720
But scientists were very busy gathering, running around, grabbing the last survivors.

167
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:50,600
And apparently in this species the males try to protect the females by throwing their legs over them and so on.

168
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,860
But of course you can't protect yourself against the scientist who is determined.

169
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh no, no.

170
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:05,420
So although the early ones that were captured all died, as I said they've now got a really successful breeding program going at the Melbourne Zoo.

171
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,860
And I had heard they planned to reintroduce them on Lord Howe Island.

172
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,400
And I heard they did.

173
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:19,080
And I heard that they successfully exterminated the black rats on Lord Howe Island.

174
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,420
Yeah.

175
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,760
But who's...

176
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,620
And that they got the people to pay for it through a tax program.

177
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,140
Who's thinking of the black rats?

178
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,500
Now there are no more black rats left.

179
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,040
Well, black rats are not native.

180
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,520
You bring a foreign species and your indigenous species dies.

181
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,260
It's the most destructive thing you can do.

182
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,840
So humans haven't killed everything.

183
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,860
These giant insects they have brought back.

184
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,480
And the great news is, praise Bob, there are still lost continents and sunken islands full of monsters and prehistoric creatures.

185
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,080
Yes.

186
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,120
And Skull Island might rise again.

187
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,760
I mean...

188
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,080
They're hard to get to and they're uncomfortable to be on.

189
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,040
It was only 1939 that Skull Island went under, right?

190
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,900
Or was it 41?

191
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,720
Some say 34.

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:01,760
Huh?

193
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,140
Some say 34.

194
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,040
It depends on whose chronology.

195
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,340
If it's the later chronology, it's 41.

196
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,240
Well, I...

197
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,500
There was...

198
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,220
It was sinking in 34.

199
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
And they did that movie about it.

200
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,220
Yes.

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,320
It actually sunk.

202
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,980
But that didn't happen in real life until...

203
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,380
I see.

204
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,460
I think 41.

205
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,220
Okay.

206
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,160
So you do use the later chronology.

207
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,280
It was already...

208
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,800
It's seismically unstable.

209
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,420
There were Nazis and American scientists both trying to get to Skull Island at the last minute before it sank.

210
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,440
There's a whole other movie in that.

211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,360
About the Nazis, I didn't hear about that part of it.

212
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,420
Oh, yeah.

213
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,760
Yeah.

214
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
It was Nazis and...

215
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,060
That was covered in Star Spangled War stories also.

216
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,960
Yes.

217
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:53,700
You had your Nazis and your American army guys fighting on islands inhabited by dinosaurs.

218
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
They were Japanese in those stories.

219
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,160
That was based on what almost really did happen at Skull Island.

220
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,680
Skull Island isn't in the Pacific.

221
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,260
That's one problem with your rationalization there.

222
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,940
What?

223
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,840
Skull Island is west of the archipelago of Pulap Nyas.

224
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,940
It, like Madagascar, is a large floating body.

225
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:14,940


226
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,440
It's a floating body in the Indian Ocean.

227
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,860
You can actually see the longitude and latitude on Captain Englehorn's map in the close-up shot.

228
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,740
I have Skull Island marked on Google Earth.

229
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes.

230
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,400
I was distinguishing between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.

231
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:32,760
Okay.

232
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,460
Sorry about that.

233
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,040
Dr. Hal, oh, God, I'm sorry.

234
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:44,920
The islands in the South Pacific, I'm sorry to be so boring and tedious, are geologically too young to have dinosaurs of any kind.

235
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,140
They are 50 million years old at the oldest.

236
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,460
I couldn't work with headphones on.

237
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,140
On the other hand, Madagascar and Skull Island are of incredible antiquity.

238
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,620
Damn.

239
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:03,560
And may even be a part of the original world of the Atlanteans because they really do go back.

240
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,720
So there you go.

241
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,040
There are ruins on Skull Island.

242
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,900
Now, in that movie that you believe is a fictitious version of the movie,

243
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
which is not as real events and not as documentary,

244
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,980
you may remember they go into the cave and they see that enormous idol.

245
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,840
It's huge, gigantic, fearsome.

246
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:32,400
And the genitals of that idol, the upward-pointing penis between the two testicles,

247
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,240
have a giant diamond attached, which they remove and take away.

248
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,640
Immediately, the island starts to sink.

249
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,560
That's what worried me about that ancient ring that Baby Bear found in the pond.

250
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,580
And removed from the pond.

251
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,340
Well, we can't go back in time.

252
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,800
We can't ask Baby Bear to return her treasure.

253
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,320
That would not be fair or appropriate or subgenius.

254
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,460
So we're simply going to have to roll with whatever forces have been unleashed, say I.

255
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,760
Well, the cool thing is there's still forces that can be unleashed.

256
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,180
And there's still some weird places like...

257
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,660
And new discoveries.

258
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,920
Like those hobbit people, homo floresiensis.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,380
Yes.

260
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,220
The miniature cavemen and ladies.

261
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,540
Yes, and they were miniature for the reason that...

262
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,700
Hobbit tricks.

263
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,260
Miniature creatures always arise in nature.

264
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,420
Limited habitat.

265
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,960
When there's infinite food and infinite room to roam,

266
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,400
you get huge animals, as when dinosaurs roamed the earth.

267
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,500
But when you're on a small island,

268
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,620
because of competition for scarce resources,

269
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,060
they get smaller and smaller.

270
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,040
And so you have the dwarf mammoths and so-called hobbits.

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,620
Right. They had little tiny, little itty-bitty homo erectus.

272
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,820
Yes.

273
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,900
And little bitty elephants.

274
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,400
But giant lizards, like the Komodo dragon.

275
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,020
Well, lizards don't have to obey those rules.

276
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,120
Right. So you actually...

277
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,960
There was a time when there were cavemen fighting, not dinosaurs exactly, but...

278
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Enormous lizards.

279
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,640
Might as well be.

280
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,560
They were dragons, to tell the truth.

281
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,580
They have that name.

282
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,560
They...

283
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,520
Megalania is the genus name.

284
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:24,880
And they're venomous. Right.

285
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Megalania prisca, in fact, is the species name.

286
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,160
Now, this was a monitor lizard.

287
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,800
And the history of life shows that monitor lizards,

288
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,920
when it's advantageous, can grow an enormous size.

289
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,940
The prehistoric mosasaurs were huge animals.

290
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,340
Huge monitors, which had originally been water monitors,

291
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,320
had gone back to an entirely aquatic lifestyle.

292
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,000
It had a tail like a whale and flippers and swam,

293
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,600
but still had the forked tongue, which monitors the ancestors of snakes.

294
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,640
We start talking about lizards, and look who shows up.

295
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,400
The lizard expert.

296
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,720
Who slithers up the Susie?

297
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,160
Yes, it's Reverend Susie the floozy.

298
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,260
You true her.

299
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,100
We do revere.

300
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,140
Well, I was trying to explain...

301
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,240
Oh, this is the lizard skin, the cold, wet lizard skin.

302
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,840
That Susie is handing out.

303
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,200
This is the weirdest material.

304
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,920
Today, a small version of Megalania called the Komodo dragon exists.

305
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,780
It's squid.

306
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,360
Squid skin.

307
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,140
Varanus komodensis, I think.

308
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,080
Komodoensis.

309
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,760
I was calling it ludros skin.

310
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,820
But, yeah, they're creatures that...

311
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,980
This is made from the mane of the royal ludros,

312
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,780
which is a giant amphibian.

313
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,960
It can leave the water because it holds water in its mane.

314
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,020
The mane retains water, and this stuff is made from the rare...

315
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,820
When you say mane, are you talking about some sort of exterior lungs?

316
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,140
Yeah, it looks like a lion's mane,

317
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,100
but it functions almost like an exterior lung on this giant amphibian.

318
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,900
It's more like the frill on a chlamydosaurus king.

319
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm glad you...

320
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,020
Oh, it's gelatinous embrace.

321
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,260
It is a frill, you're correct.

322
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,460
Cover up that heaving ocean.

323
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,720
Hey, that's my booze mams.

324
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,080
Now, I need to know which side is front.

325
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,140
The cleavage is like that north thing on those little bobbly compasses that old farts used to have.

326
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,400
Look at those things move.

327
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,200
I wish the radio audience could see what I'm seeing now.

328
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,080
Susie's got those things moving.

329
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,180
I wish the radio audience could see what I'm seeing now.

330
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,020
Susie's got those things hefted up in this buttressed up...

331
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,200
What do you call it?

332
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,580
Furbished and burnished up.

333
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,620
It's my tsunami.

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,440
Yeah, man, it's like a heaving ocean at high tide.

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,740
Ooh, yeah.

336
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,640
Said a nearly nearsighted...

337
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,960
Watch her jiggle like a bowl full of jelly.

338
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,980
I put the ho in hokusai.

339
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,900
Said a nearly nearsighted detective in a stream of unwanted invective,

340
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,160
has your east tit the least bit the best of your west tit, or is it a trick of perspective?

341
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Ooh, by whose directive?

342
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,680
Well, I didn't like...

343
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,460
That house sure has a pretty mouth, don't it?

344
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,420
He can talk, he can just talk up a copper girl.

345
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,120
He sure does.

346
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I bet he could recite things out of every orifice of his body.

347
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
He could recite the clothes off of you, I bet you.

348
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,380
Well, that don't take no trouble.

349
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,340
Yes, it doesn't take a lengthy recitation.

350
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,040
I'll have to read you my gorilla poem later.

351
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,140
I wrote a poem.

352
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,800
Stang wrote a gorilla poem.

353
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,360
Everyone has been inspired.

354
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
I was inspired through the year up to now.

355
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,600
I know, I know you weren't.

356
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,840
Philo will like it, though.

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,660
Uh-huh.

358
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,640
He's still got a little bit of the nasty little boy in him.

359
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,300
That's all that's in him.

360
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,060
Well, that's why he's the overman.

361
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,340
He gets to go to the same parties Bob goes.

362
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,020
Yes, the child is father to the man.

363
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,200
I told her we could get that out of the long court, screw.

364
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,120
Now you're getting me all turned on, Susie.

365
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm not going to be able to work.

366
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,260
Anyway, remember to look this stuff up and find out that it's all perfectly real.

367
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:22,160
The giant phasmids, Ball's Pyramid Island, the giant dragon or lizard, Megalania prisca,

368
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,040
and how it preyed on primitive man.

369
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,980
Aw, they're so religious the way they prey.

370
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,120
Yes.

371
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,380
So there were cavemen fighting dinosaurs.

372
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,540
I bet they used spears, too.

373
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, no, not exactly.

374
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,100
Like in Earth, they were.

375
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,720
In the earlier movies, they're fighting giant lizards, you see.

376
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,820
Like in the 1941 one million B.C. rather than the 1966 one million years B.C.

377
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:55,460
Why don't you ever take it to the proper extreme and you fight the monster and then you team up with the monster?

378
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,120
That's the way the Japanese monsters have figured it out over the years.

379
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,400
Right.

380
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,340
You eventually turn the monster into a good guy.

381
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,600
You fight and then you team up.

382
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,900
Well, I need two hands.

383
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,780
I'm trying to...

384
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,960
Well, if you don't team up, the monsters team up.

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,440
She's okay.

386
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,060
I got her volume up higher so she can do that.

387
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,160
What?

388
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,620
You got the...

389
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh, I see.

390
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,840
I'll try to talk using my cleavage just like an ear horn.

391
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,000
Right.

392
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,900
Just like an amplifier.

393
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,720
I can do that for you if you have...

394
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
A tramplifier.

395
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,740
There you go.

396
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,640
I wonder if I get an echo effect if I yodel into your cleavage.

397
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,120
Insert a yodel.

398
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,240


399
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,240


400
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,780
I'm trying to...

401
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,460
I'm trying to...

402
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,700
Insert a yodel.

403
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,740
I can't tell with the headphones on.

404
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,420
He's the only one that's got them, folks.

405
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,060
Susie, you know that little...

406
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,080
That thing?

407
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,480
Shih Tzu dog that...

408
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,320
I cleaned him that up.

409
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,480
This is what's left of it.

410
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,740
This is what's left of the dog that those people brought to the campground.

411
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,800
Put those disgusting remains away.

412
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,440
Oh, wow.

413
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,620
We've all heard this dog story.

414
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,280
I knew she'd kind of like it.

415
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,500
Okay.

416
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,080
She collects dead things.

417
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,640
But not in such a state of...

418
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,260
Why does it look more like turtle?

419
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,220
Unless it's a turtle.

420
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,440
I don't know.

421
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,440


422
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,440


423
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,440


424
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,440


425
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,660
I wonder if Shih Tzus are actually like hairy turtles.

426
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,960
Well, under that hair, no one would know.

427
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,720
No, because turtles aren't annoying.

428
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,500
Yeah.

429
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,840
Turtles don't nip like that.

430
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,260
Well, maybe they're like some annoying offshoot that have been like totally purged by the turtles.

431
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:16,700
Hmm.

432
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,840
No, I know you didn't do that to that dog, Susie, but we were kidding around that if anybody...

433
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,260
What didn't I do to that dog?

434
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,580
Could you be a little more specific, please?

435
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,640
If anybody was going to...

436
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,680
Caused its cells to explode and its bones...

437
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,920
Turn an annoying dog inside out...

438
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,740
...articulated in fragment...

439
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,060
Yeah.

440
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,680
...it would be you.

441
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,020
Nah, nah.

442
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,560
A lot of people don't like little snapping, yapping dogs.

443
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,080
She doesn't like children either, friend, so better watch your kids.

444
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,420
Well, children are mammals.

445
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,620
Mammals suck.

446
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,300
Yipping, snipping rugrats.

447
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,680
By definition, mammals suck.

448
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,840
Well, yeah, that's true.

449
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,280
Yeah.

450
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,420
Wha?

451
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,140
Duh.

452
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,720
Yeah, it's all clear now, isn't it?

453
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,220
They're nippled animals...

454
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,460
Yeah.

455
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,200
...and they suck.

456
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,780
They're teetering.

457
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,980
Mammiferous, hence the name mammals.

458
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,860
Mm-hmm.

459
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,140
Well, some marsupials are bad that way, aren't they?

460
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,240
Well, they...

461
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,660
You know, they don't have it as nice as...

462
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


463
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


464
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


465
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


466
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,660


467
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,380
...mammals do.

468
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,960
They have to lick milk off little hairy projections and so on.

469
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,880
It's not...

470
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,640
Wow, and I thought my job sucked.

471
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,540
...not as nice as the mammal way.

472
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,500
Well, I guess it's time for my daily utterance of the line, it's tough being a large mammal.

473
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,120
What?

474
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,480
That's part of my daily complaint.

475
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,580
It's true.

476
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,440
We are large mammals.

477
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,900
It's not usually...

478
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,880
I'm not just always complaining on my own part.

479
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,060
I know a lot of large mammals that are...

480
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,980
As they get older, they get sick and...

481
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,360
Mm-hmm.

482
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

483
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,140
...it's just...

484
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,820
It's not fun to watch, and yet I'm surrounded by aging large mammals.

485
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,660
If you draw...

486
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,100
Even the little tiny ones are aging.

487
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,860
Mm-hmm.

488
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,340
If you write, rather, the name of every creature that's bigger than a human down, it fits on

489
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,660
one piece of paper.

490
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,180
But every creature that's smaller than a human fills volume after volume because, except

491
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,940
for a few exceptions, we are among the hugest creatures that exist.

492
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,000
Yep.

493
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,040
Size only matters if you're doomed.

494
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,660
I think humans made damn sure that they didn't have a whole lot of competition left.

495
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:15,440
Before people got there, both Australia and North and the Americas were loaded with dinosaur-sized

496
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,160
giant mammals and even...

497
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,980
And giant birds.

498
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,400
...giant kangaroos, giant birds, all kinds of stuff.

499
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:20,580
Swaps.

500
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, there were 10-foot tall carnivorous kangaroos.

501
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,440
Now you know about those.

502
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,980
If one cave boy can impress a chick by burning down an entire farm...

503
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,600
...and a forest full of animals so he can get that one bone and buy her from her dad,

504
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,440
that's what's going to happen to that forest.

505
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,760
And the happy hunting grounds went on forever and ever, they thought.

506
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,780
But look now.

507
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,980
Lastly came the age of mammals, dogs and monkeys, sheep and camels, and the mammoth

508
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,880
and the brontotherium.

509
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:59,760
Finally, in the waning flicker of the Cenozoic, bigger things gave way to man who had been

510
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,820
born to bury him.

511
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,860
Like a puny hairless monkey, still this enterprising, spunky little feller made the critters recognize

512
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,100
his mystery.

513
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,260
He enslaved them and he slew them, for meat, milk and fur he grew them and he wiped the

514
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,800
ones he couldn't use from history.

515
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,120
Oh, you are so...

516
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,900
He can sure whip it out, can't he?

517
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,180
Well, it's going to be time to write the...

518
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,960
the last chapters.

519
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,340
That's right.

520
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,240
In about two days.

521
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,940
We're going to begin with the literary climax.

522
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,080
Have you ever climbed an axe?

523
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,820
I've climbed away from an axe.

524
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,880
That makes sense.

525
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,320
Climb... I didn't get that.

526
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,460
Oh, no, I'm not supposed to.

527
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,380
Well, there's another subjevious driving in, judging by the bob sticker on the back.

528
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,160
Nor do I slide down the razor blade of life to make sure I'm not going to die.

529
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,160


530
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,160


531
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,980
I think that was a...

532
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,340
I don't think that was a...

533
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,640
The universal sign for, hey, pull me over.

534
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,240
I think I saw a bootleg bob sticker just go by.

535
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,280
A bootleg, I tell you.

536
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:09,500
Anything is possible.

537
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Somebody made their own.

538
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,620
Was he sticking out of a boot or something?

539
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,840
They didn't call me up and ask for permission to enlarge that dob's head to that size.

540
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,560
Let's solve that problem about the monster tracks right now while we've got Susie here.

541
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:21,900
Oh, yeah.

542
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,400
You haven't been leaving those three-toed monster footprints around, have you?

543
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
No, no, actually not.

544
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,020
Well, guess what?

545
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,340
There are some footprints now.

546
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,820
They look a lot like the dinosaur track fake that you were doing last year.

547
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, actually, I did not pack those this year.

548
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,500
Wow.

549
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,600
That answers that.

550
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,280
I figured, well, this year there will be no three-toed dinosaur tracks because I'm just going to lay down on my job.

551
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,940
Well, I've got news for you.

552
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,680
There's three-toed something tracks.

553
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,280
There's some right behind the building here.

554
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,380


555
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,620
If they were moisture, it's just not that damp.

556
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,700
If it rains, we might see more of those tracks than we like.

557
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,220
I thought they were like chick tracks.

558
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,620
Well, they are three-toed.

559
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,920
They are three-toed.

560
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,320
They are bird-like.

561
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,180
Chick tracks attract chicks.

562
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,460
Chicks dig chicks.

563
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes.

564
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,060
What is it?

565
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,760
Hot for chicks?

566
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,640
They do.

567
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,580
Somebody waved a chick track at me and I was right over there.

568
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,840
So that's true.

569
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,480
That's another thing I meant to bring that I forgot.

570
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,180
I picked up.

571
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,100
You could define me as a chick.

572
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,060
I'm more like, I don't know, stew hen.

573
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,080
Oh, mother hen.

574
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,640
Oh, bah, bah.

575
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,840
You almost made me say.

576
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,140
No, come on.

577
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,440
Stang is going to end up with egg on his face if he continues.

578
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,400
No, I'm going to endeavor that this is the one time you don't have to censor me.

579
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,400
Oh.

580
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,600
Well, all right.

581
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,920
Well, you know, last week or a couple of weeks ago, I played.

582
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,200
I played all of the stuff that had to be censored from real radio.

583
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,560
I put out a special internet only hour of slack that was all recorded last year here.

584
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,540
It was a lot of Pisces sexy songs about the tool of the Yeti.

585
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,980
And oh, it's Andrew did that lovely Beatles number.

586
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,400
All you need is fuck.

587
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,100
I see.

588
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,320
There's one for me to cut.

589
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
Oh, and I'm trying to be a good example.

590
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,900
I'm trying to be a good example.

591
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,660
I'm trying to be a good example.

592
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,660


593
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,740
Sorry about that.

594
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,740
Well, all Stang will take is editing shears.

595
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,380
My edit fingers are still working.

596
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,500
I can still drop those beeps in.

597
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,320
Now you're going to be saying shuck and fit.

598
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,440
Or I'll put some silly cuss word there.

599
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,680
Too muck and fudge too.

600
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,960
You know, even that's not cool because even though it doesn't have any dirty words in it,

601
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,420
it's still offensive to community standards because they know what too muck and fudge means.

602
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,780
To that one person who complains.

603
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,780
When I leave my house, I'm offensive to community standards.

604
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,640
Right.

605
00:27:59,640 --> 00:27:59,860
Go figure.

606
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,900
But they can't stop me from leaving my house.

607
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,220
Well, on radio they have to hear it.

608
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,620
Because if I don't, that means somebody's going to have to do a wellness check and one

609
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,200
time it's not going to be nice.

610
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,440
Well, maybe all the time it's not going to be nice.

611
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,060
They do a thorough one, I understand.

612
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,640
Do you think you could get one of those gigs where the government pays you to stay home

613
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,300
and not go to work and take your pills?

614
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,740
And not grow alfalfa?

615
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,020
Not leave the house.

616
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,620
Right.

617
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:24,820
Yeah.

618
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,320
And not grow soybeans.

619
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,000
And people who have that job.

620
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,000


621
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,680
I promise not to grow them too.

622
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,380
Yeah.

623
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,880
Boy, will I grow the hell out of them.

624
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,900
Really?

625
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,820
I wouldn't even, I don't even give crap one about them.

626
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
I'd have a crop going.

627
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,980
But the whole payment you get is for not growing them, you see.

628
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,580
Well, yeah.

629
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,260
That's where the thrill in growing them.

630
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Ah, I see.

631
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,160
The contrarian streak.

632
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah.

633
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,680
I'd suddenly be a farmer with a boner.

634
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,940
There you are.

635
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,280
Yeah.

636
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,980
Yeah, I'd be getting a man.

637
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,840
And of course there would be that strange looking ragged scarecrow standing out in the

638
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,260
field.

639
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,500
In old stripper clothes.

640
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,760
A former inamorata.

641
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,660
Are you guys talking about Pisces?

642
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,000
No, I was, uh.

643
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,960
She was posing out there like she thought you were talking about her.

644
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
No, I was not.

645
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,880
She'd make a pretty scary scarecrow.

646
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,520
That's why I was not mentioning Pisces in such a context.

647
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,320
No.

648
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,460
She'd kick your ass.

649
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,640
Yes, so why are you trying to create, uh, put words in my mouth?

650
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,000
I wouldn't want to tangle with her.

651
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,860
Actually, I would like to be a scarecrow in a way.

652
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,700
Be out there in the sun and the wind with the...

653
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,460
No, my perfect plan is when I croak, I want to go to the body farm in Knoxville, Tennessee

654
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,420
and be used for forensic research.

655
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,320
But I want to be dressed up in my preaching bustier with the tassels on it and whatever

656
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,260
left of me painted with some garish crap on my face.

657
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,560
It looks kind of like the garish crap I wear in life.

658
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,460
And just put me under a tree, under a wash of leaves and use me to scare the hell out

659
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,100
of the noobs.

660
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,960
Shrouded in a living leaf.

661
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,780
And that would be, oh my God, that would be bliss to me.

662
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,000
That's my place.

663
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,460
Can you put that into writing and we can make it happen?

664
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,540
But you know...

665
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:14,660
Whoa.

666
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,680
If, you know, uh, and you have to sign over your power of attorney to me.

667
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,160
Yuck fair.

668
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,420
Yeah.

669
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,360
For, and all of your stuff.

670
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,800
Oh yeah.

671
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,040
All your stuff in your house.

672
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,140
Your slack altered house.

673
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,860
Okay.

674
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,180
150 linear feet of record albums.

675
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,200
God.

676
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,760
Two cantankerous lizards.

677
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,860
Forget the record albums.

678
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,140
Oh no, no, that's part and parcel.

679
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,740
And then there are my archives over a thousand shows.

680
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,740
Uh, plus a lot of that's on cassette.

681
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,380
I know how much room that takes up.

682
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,420
That gets pretty bulky.

683
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,080
I have to be buried in a special pyramid containing all those recordings.

684
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,020
All three of us probably have closet space.

685
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,140
I know.

686
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


687
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


688
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


689
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


690
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


691
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


692
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


693
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


694
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140


695
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,840
And my weird underwear.

696
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,520
And my weird underwear.

697
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,060
That's horrifying.

698
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,300
You imagine the lingerie I have.

699
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,840
Oh my God.

700
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,940
I imagine it.

701
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,140
The lingerie that lingers longer in the mind.

702
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,380
I sniffed it from you when I wore that one time.

703
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,040
It's like Satan's soup starter.

704
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,380
Satan's soup starter?

705
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:06,960
Mm-hmm.

706
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,260
Is it like particularly spicy?

707
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,640
With rhinestones, yeah.

708
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,300
Oh.

709
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,500
Yeah.

710
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,140
All right.

711
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,760
Well, that's good.

712
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,920
It's pretty easy to find her underwear collection.

713
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,820
You just sniff your way to it.

714
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,180
So you sniff your way to it, eh?

715
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,120
It's like a little bit of a...

716
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,120


717
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,120


718
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,120


719
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,120


720
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,600
It's like inviting tendrils of green waving through the air.

721
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,140
They hook into your nostrils and pull you like a windsock over to where they are, where

722
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,800
you can do your dirty pervert business.

723
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,340
Yes.

724
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,840
You hear the...

725
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,080
Yeah, I've scampered around in your underwear many times when you went shopping or something.

726
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,220
TMI.

727
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,020
Don't think I haven't noticed the staying tracks in my undies.

728
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,000
The staying of a...

729
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,660
They're about the same as yours probably.

730
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,820
I use two sides of the crotch.

731
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,140
This is starting to remind me of my Gorilla poem.

732
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,060
Well, maybe this would be the time to introduce it.

733
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,400
I'll tell it to Susie.

734
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,220
Go ahead and rip it out.

735
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,840
I met a gorilla named Hummus McGrew.

736
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,640
The stuff in her pussy tasted like glue.

737
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,580
After I finished my business, what did I do?

738
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,140
Put her back in my car, took her back to the zoo.

739
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,600
Something like that.

740
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,200
Well, at least it had a happy ending.

741
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,620
Yeah.

742
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,920
Yeah, it was responsible care for primates.

743
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,360
Took her back to the zoo.

744
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:20,560
I know something.

745
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,820
I know something unbelievably filthy that just won't pop into my mind.

746
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,740
Let's have it.

747
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,500
You've ruined me.

748
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,520
God.

749
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,240
Get squid slapped.

750
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,020
Well, thanks for the squid slap, honey.

751
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,100
Well, would you care to share it with our listening audience?

752
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,740
I wish I could.

753
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,040
I left it on somebody's answering machine once.

754
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,700
It happened when his retired dad was over fixing his garbage disposal.

755
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,760
What the hell was it?

756
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,580
Another terrible tale.

757
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,780
It was some sort of necrophiliac or a thing, you know.

758
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,340
A garbage disposal accident.

759
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,120
Something I'll have to cut if you ever remember to say it.

760
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,560
Yeah.

761
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,840
Yeah.

762
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh, I'll come up and blurt it sometime in the most inopportune moment.

763
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,160
That's fine.

764
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,840
Oh, Susie, are you going to be at the baptism?

765
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,440
That's tomorrow at 2 o'clock.

766
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,960
Oh, we won't have to do this stupid show until after the baptism.

767
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,600
Oh.

768
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,040
If we make it.

769
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,120
It all starts with the pancake-a-thon at 12 noon.

770
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,880
Because that is at Old Sequaw's Lair.

771
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,640
Bob-dism at 2 and...

772
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,540
Did you say Bob-jism at 2?

773
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,120
No, but you did.

774
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,760
Oh, okay.

775
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,620
Tomorrow, everything's different.

776
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,020
You can censor yourself this day.

777
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,340
We eat and there will be scrapple as well as pancakery.

778
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,620
Then the Bob-jism at Old Sequaw's Lair.

779
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,600
Two Dixie.

780
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,940
Then we basically come back here and do the bull-dot-off.

781
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:47,940


782
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:47,940


783
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:47,940


784
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:47,940


785
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:47,940


786
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:47,940


787
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,540
Yes, after everyone is exhausted from the ordeal of the Bob-dism.

788
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,120
Wonderful psychological ploy.

789
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,860
Yes, it is a traumatizing experience.

790
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,280
Even if you're just a frog watcher.

791
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,600
Reborn unto Bob.

792
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,680
Some of the frogs are hard on the eyes.

793
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,440
I used to catch them after staying Bob-dism.

794
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,420
I don't take my clothes off, so don't worry.

795
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,600
Hal, I just hold the microphone.

796
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,140
Hal and I both wear our priestly vestments.

797
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,140
Until it's over.

798
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,700
Well, I'll be there if only to watch my boobs float.

799
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,220
That's why I come here every year.

800
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,520
That's why everybody comes here, Susie.

801
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,140
I think we can all agree the main reason we're here,

802
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,740
because we're going to get ruptured even if we're at home.

803
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,340
But you can't watch Susie's boobs float at home.

804
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,180
It's like a testament of our faith.

805
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,140
A chest-timent to our faith.

806
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,340
Bob-bob-bobbing.

807
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,240
It's quite tit-notted.

808
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,020
Yeah.

809
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,500
You are getting sleepy.

810
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,820
I'll be able to do that soon.

811
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,520
I'm working on my man-tits.

812
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,580
I want to teach you the tassel-stang.

813
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,080
Yeah, right.

814
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Oh, man.

815
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,000
I know that.

816
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,380
Oh, man.

817
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,220
Oh, we could be like the Burns and Allen of tassel-tossers.

818
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,760
Right.

819
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,640
Well, I could...

820
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,740
You'll be the burnt one.

821
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,460
How about if I stuck a tassel down there and flipped?

822
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:11,740
Yeah.

823
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,700
Say goodnight, Gracie.

824
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,960
Do you have enough?

825
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,480
Already trying to top me.

826
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
Top the topper.

827
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,320
Well, it depends on where we put the tassels.

828
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,020
Uh-huh.

829
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,880
In one case, they'd only need one.

830
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,140
You could have a long tassel on your wing,

831
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,580
because Tura Satana taught me about the tassel physics.

832
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,160
Anything over six inches is going to tangle.

833
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,140
But that's because you have the other tassel involved in the equation.

834
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,560
Right.

835
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,380
So I could have one really long.

836
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,360
I had a physicist work it out on a placemat once for me.

837
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,680
I guess if I put it on the longest pecker,

838
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,980
it wouldn't get tangled up with the other peckers.

839
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,760
Well, you'd have to take the other peckers and kind of tie them up together.

840
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,260
The other peckers would all have to have little bitty tassels on them.

841
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,740
And pull the line down around your butt crack and tie it around your neck so they wouldn't like...

842
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,200
Right, so they could make it bob.

843
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,440
So they wouldn't fling out and...

844
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,860
Yeah, like somebody sticking a stick in the spokes of a bicycle, you know.

845
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,460
What about battery power?

846
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,580
Oh.

847
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,360
A powerful nine volt battery.

848
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,900
Americans are so lazy.

849
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,980
Okay.

850
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,080
Solar powered?

851
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,580
I'm a Luddite when it comes to tassels.

852
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,820
I've never used electricity to power my tassels and I'm quite proud of that.

853
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Well, that's a little bit more.

854
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,080
You've saved the grid.

855
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
Dovetail joints.

856
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,160
Susie really was taught how to shake tassels on her boobs by Tura Satana,

857
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,900
the actress that was in Faster Pussycat Kill Kill.

858
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,280
She was a premier tassel tosser.

859
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,280
How many people here have heard of Tura Satana?

860
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,260
Well, there.

861
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,420
This is an educated crowd.

862
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,980
They all have in subgenius land.

863
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,140
They're Korean.

864
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,320
You know, you ask that in a normal crowd, huh, what?

865
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,000
Is it on Dancing with the Stars?

866
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,620
I had to take her out to get a bra one time.

867
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,720
Now, ask the subgeniuses who's president of the United States.

868
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
Does anybody here know who the president is?

869
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,480
They're kind of maybe one guy.

870
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,100
He's a guy that everybody's blaming.

871
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,560
Obama, actually, has been recently...

872
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,080
We discovered the real character behind Obama.

873
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,640
Obama is Obabo, the Pres-a-serp.

874
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
But, you know, I...

875
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,060
And he looks really funny.

876
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,780
He's cool looking.

877
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,600
Mr. Sister has a picture of him, I'm sure.

878
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,680
Funny-looking, funny-talking foreigners know who our president is,

879
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,720
but we don't know who their presidents are.

880
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,700
Speaking of Mr. Sister, he should be bringing the socialist social materials down here pretty soon.

881
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,100
That's happening now?

882
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,460
He's going to feed us all Bloody Marys.

883
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,740
How are we ever in Popsicles?

884
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,740
That's...

885
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,920
Susie, would you hand me that schedule there?

886
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,020
No, no, not the...

887
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,680
Not the squid?

888
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,560
Yes, the schedule.

889
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,260
Everybody needs an ice-cold squid.

890
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,860
It was refreshing, yes.

891
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,180
I just wanted to make sure.

892
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,280
This is Thursday, eh?

893
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,780
It's cold, and it's not that hot today.

894
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,240
Because there's nothing about a socialist social here.

895
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,780
No, that was something he came up with, just...

896
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,440
He wasn't sure when he was going to do it.

897
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,220
But he makes really strong drinks, y'all.

898
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,080
I don't know.

899
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,460
So be careful.

900
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,640
He said it was going to be...

901
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,760
He didn't tell the schedule, Mr. Sister.

902
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,740
...liberal thing, he said.

903
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,820
He didn't tell the schedule, Mr. Sister, about that one.

904
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,300
Oh, he just invented the idea of...

905
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,440
Will there be liberal portions?

906
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,700
Well, maybe, if he's a...

907
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,540
No, he can't do liberal portions.

908
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,760
That's why I thought...

909
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,260
These liberal portions...

910
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,780
Isn't it like one of those progressive dinners?

911
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,120
He was going to make everybody a sandwich, too.

912
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Oh, how nice.

913
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,140
Wow.

914
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,020
We know that has a special significance in our closed society.

915
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
I've never been as...

916
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,960
Well, I can't say that, I guess.

917
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:49,260
Yes, just as the Bower bird brings gifts to his lady love, the subgenius presents her

918
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,020
with a sandwich, traditionally.

919
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,420
And if he doesn't, she gives him a black eye.

920
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,700
So that's what got him in trouble.

921
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,200
He posted this sexist picture with the girl with the black eye.

922
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,940
I should have brought my sandwich sooner.

923
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,840
I should have brought my sandwich sooner, or something like that.

924
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,200
And all of a sudden, the church was against women.

925
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,300
Or at least that's what they said on the girls-only Facebook page.

926
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm against women.

927
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,060
That was the most outrageous thing.

928
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,260
I break into the secret no boys allowed Facebook page,

929
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,480
and they're talking about how the church is prejudiced against women.

930
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,460
And I'm looking at this on a no-boys-allowed church page.

931
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,520
age. But, as Bob said, where would the church be without its hypocrisy? It was built on

932
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,640
a sandy, shifting beach of hypocrisy. But there's no girls, there's no boys only page.

933
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,440
I would like to point out, I had nothing to do with that. The church was boys only for

934
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:57,260
a total of 15 minutes when it was first born. I am not, I am not, I'm trash. But I am not

935
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,700
Facebook trash. Obviously. If you take one look at it, you can tell this is not Facebook

936
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:10,600
trash. Thank you. This is Google Groups trash. You're not on Facebook, really? No, she's

937
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:19,300
on Facebook about like me. I'm face blind. Why the hell would I be on Facebook? It's

938
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,700
like somebody who can't tell butts apart being on butt book. Why would they bother? Well,

939
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,300
there'd be language.

940
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,280
There'd be language to help you. You know, figure A, figure B, like that.

941
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,180
Susie is a much bigger male chauvinist pig than any of the guys I know. Oh, God. She

942
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:42,700
could teach all of us a lesson. It's kind of like an art project. You guys are so frilly

943
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:49,060
when it comes to women, I swear. Well, as a matter of fact. Sadly true. One of the ladies

944
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,680
on staff said. Did you see all the art in the brochures? I was telling her that I would

945
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,080
like someday to trick.

946
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:03,920
The subgeniuses into leaving the road and going into the woods, maybe only a few feet

947
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,860
into the woods. And she goes, yeah, good luck with that. Going. I've hardly ever met a boy

948
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,380
that didn't try to put the make on me. And none of these guys have. They're all playing

949
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:20,420
card games and watching television at a camp out. That's the subgeniuses for it. There's

950
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,780
a beautiful girl standing in front of him going, okay, I'm ready to go. And they're

951
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,240
like going, oh, you play magic.

952
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,240


953
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,300
Patrick the Gathering 2.

954
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,800
God, the shame.

955
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,940
The shame.

956
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,600
The whole reason we do this at this campground

957
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,580
is so it won't be like a comic book convention.

958
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,340
You know, we make it really difficult, don't we?

959
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,300
Hard to get to, out in the middle of nowhere.

960
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,060
Usually we schedule really terrible weather.

961
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,000
Kind of let us down this time.

962
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,540
So, you know, it's like this.

963
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,900
My daughter, I used to try to get my daughter

964
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,880
to go out on little hikes with me.

965
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,020
She finally said, Dad, you don't understand.

966
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,200
I'm not just a city girl.

967
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,080
I'm a TV girl.

968
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,980
It was her way of saying

969
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,120
she basically would rather be in the Matrix.

970
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,060
And that was before Facebook

971
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,420
and really before comedy.

972
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:30,040
And then she would say, Dad, I'm not even a TV girl anymore.

973
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm a Facebook thing.

974
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,840
I thought Facebook was not cool

975
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,300
among the rising generation.

976
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,440
It was all about parents checking on you and so on.

977
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,000
They just are into the instant download.

978
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,160
Isn't that right?

979
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,340
Yes, that's right. Nobody buys CDs.

980
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,320
That's the bottom line.

981
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,240
Nobody buys CDs.

982
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,360
Rudy Schwartz project guy, Joe Newman,

983
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,520
sends me his, whenever he does a new album,

984
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,240
he sends it and says,

985
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,940
oh yeah, Fight C. Taj bought a CD,

986
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,680
but that was only to check whether our PayPal

987
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,580
new credit card thing is working.

988
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,240
That's a subgenius, you see.

989
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,640
That's not what the run-of-the-mill person does.

990
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,900
The so-called average man

991
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,400
would not now buy a CD.

992
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,120
They get it.

993
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,900
I want to store everything on the cloud

994
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,620
because I trust the cloud.

995
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,960
The cloud will take good care of all my precious documents.

996
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,520
And surely it will keep everything private,

997
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,660
but I want to be private.

998
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,020
I fart clouds, but I wouldn't put my show on one.

999
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,580
Praise Susie.

1000
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,380
That's a line for the A.

1001
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,580
In those super chilled clouds,

1002
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,540
sometimes giant eyeball monsters lurk

1003
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,520
that can decapitate alpine climbers.

1004
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,020
That sounds like one of my farts.

1005
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,560
I'd love to get up.

1006
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,480
Yeah, that's fine.

1007
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,460
I'd love to get up.

1008
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,560
Sit down and do your thing.

1009
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,380
Super cold.

1010
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,880
Great.

1011
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,420
Okay, well,

1012
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,580
in case you may not have noticed,

1013
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,180
we are in Caffeina's Cafe.

1014
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,940
And tonight, for dinner,

1015
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,840
they are featuring redneck salsa pork chops

1016
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
with fresh herb rice.

1017
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,960
Holy guacamole.

1018
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,280
And for vegetarians,

1019
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,240
artichoke cheese frittata.

1020
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,400
Both of those come with a house salad

1021
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,500
without a sauce.

1022
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,400
Awesome sauce dressing or ranch dressing.

1023
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,440
Just so you know,

1024
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,160
those things are featured here for dinner,

1025
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,520
and you're more than welcome to come

1026
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,220
and have your dinner here.

1027
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,280
They'd really like to...

1028
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,380
They made that food,

1029
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,660
and everything that is made here

1030
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,400
is made from scratch right here.

1031
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,080
It's all homemade.

1032
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,640
I'm learning to scratch.

1033
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,220
Oh, well, you ought to try it.

1034
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,280
They're not up to scratch.

1035
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,440
Their scratch here is a lot better

1036
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,500
and a lot different than some you may have tried before.

1037
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,500


1038
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,500


1039
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Is it organic scratch?

1040
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,800
Yes, pure, 100% organic.

1041
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,840
Isn't that GMO scratch?

1042
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,740
Heck no.

1043
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,600
Nope, this is the real thing.

1044
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,800
I think they're calling it scritch.

1045
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,040
And they'll give it to you on a plate

1046
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,360
with a cutlery and a napkin.

1047
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,560
You can sit down and eat here at the table.

1048
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:06,860
Absolutely.

1049
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,640
They really, really take good care of you here.

1050
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,900
Not balancing your shifting paper plate

1051
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,320
on a knee al fresco, but...

1052
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,820
Frittata always sounds like some technique

1053
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,180
of nut tickling.

1054
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Careful, Frittata's...

1055
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,480
That's our Susie.

1056
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,200
Frittata's, I believe they call it.

1057
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,720
Hey, pecans need thrills, too.

1058
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,800
And they do have wonderful coffee here

1059
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,520
and five flavors of brownies.

1060
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,580
Yes, look at the sugar rush on display.

1061
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,840
Yes, absolutely.

1062
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,940
Genetically, over there.

1063
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,780
It's incredible.

1064
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,220
And ice cream sandwiches.

1065
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,360
If it was really hot, you might like one of those.

1066
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,440
And drumsticks.

1067
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,200
Are you kidding?

1068
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,600
Klondike bars.

1069
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,780
Klondike bars.

1070
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh, yeah.

1071
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,600
Lots of good stuff.

1072
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,500
Well...

1073
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,580
What would you do for a Klondike bar?

1074
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,820
You'd go up there and...

1075
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,660
Want to know what I did for a Bulldike bar?

1076
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,180
Which bar was that, Susie?

1077
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,780
I forget.

1078
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,760
Not the Lexington?

1079
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,960
Something by the Stockyards.

1080
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,420
Yeah.

1081
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,240
Well, you must have been the Bell 11.

1082
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,020
It wasn't even a beef town.

1083
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,680
But a smoky place.

1084
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,600
Mm-hmm.

1085
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,500
Well, look, my collection of crazy instrumentals ended,

1086
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,440
and I didn't even...

1087
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:21,780
I didn't even notice.

1088
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,360
Oh.

1089
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,000
Well, then I...

1090
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,340
This is my music...

1091
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,600
What counts as crazy is...

1092
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,500
What's crazy about it?

1093
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,240
Stuff you'd play at your wedding or something.

1094
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,840
Wait, that's assuming you had a normal wedding.

1095
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,700
Good, the bad, and the ugly.

1096
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,560
That's always good.

1097
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,200
Caravan.

1098
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:38,740
To play monsters!

1099
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,280
Oh, yeah.

1100
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,160
That's my monster-fighting music.

1101
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,460
The Ecstasy of Gold, yeah.

1102
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,480
Mona Lisa.

1103
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,320
Morricone, eh?

1104
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,380
That's from The Matrix.

1105
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,520
Those are mostly movie soundtracks.

1106
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:49,480
They're good.

1107
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:49,920
They're fine.

1108
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,720
Soundtracks are great.

1109
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,420
Why don't you start them up?

1110
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,600
Put more music in.

1111
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,660
That's what I mostly listen to, if I listen to anything.

1112
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,480
There's more passion in them.

1113
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,500
And then there are the things that are not quite soundtracks.

1114
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,480
Like, I have an album that has...

1115
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,260
Unsound tracks.

1116
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,720
...disco versions of the Omega Man soundtrack.

1117
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,660
Well, that's what caused the extermination of humanity in the first place.

1118
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,740
Yeah, by Jeff Love.

1119
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,280
G-E-O-F-F.

1120
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,540
Love and his orchestra.

1121
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,540
Charlton Heston in the Omega Man with Rosalind Cash and...

1122
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,020
I've got a CD of Catty Noir from Monster High doing it.

1123
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,400
That's awesome.

1124
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:21,480
That's awesome.

1125
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:21,480


1126
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:21,480


1127
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:21,480


1128
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,240
...a version of Magic Carpet Ride.

1129
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,100
Paul Kelso.

1130
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,580
He was Dutch.

1131
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,180
Yes, but Matthias.

1132
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:27,880
Who was he?

1133
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,140
Oh, Anthony Zerbe.

1134
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,280
Anthony Zerbe.

1135
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:30,860
Yes, yes.

1136
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,580
There was one time I was running an errand.

1137
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,060
I was going to the Kroger.

1138
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,840
I passed a pizza place, and there were some EMTs going in for lunch.

1139
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,100
EMTs?

1140
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,160
You know, ambulance students.

1141
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,980
And right about nose level...

1142
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,780
Slow ambulance to China.

1143
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,080
...a name tag went past my eyeline, and it said Zerbe.

1144
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,380
Zerbe.

1145
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,120
Zerbe.

1146
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1147
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1148
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1149
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1150
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1151
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1152
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1153
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1154
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1155
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,480


1156
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,620
I took a few steps, and I stopped and turned, and I said,

1157
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,340
Excuse me.

1158
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,400
Zerbe is a fine name.

1159
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,940
Anthony Zerbe was a fine actor.

1160
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,000
And the guy said, Why, thank you.

1161
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,840
He was my uncle.

1162
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,140
He was my uncle?

1163
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,760
And went in to get a pizza.

1164
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,060
I thought there was a nice completeness there.

1165
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,860
He didn't say what killed his uncle.

1166
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,440
No, no.

1167
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,180
Not overindulgence in pizza.

1168
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,580
It was perfect.

1169
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,580
Nice zipless little encounter.

1170
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,200
Uh-huh.

1171
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,620
Yeah.

1172
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,680
Sometimes you...

1173
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,380
Even when you're...

1174
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,040
Trying not to meet the famous person, you have to,

1175
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,400
because they're right in front of you.

1176
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,260
And in order to get around them, you have to say hello.

1177
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,620
Even if it's some famous person you despise.

1178
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,380
God, I was hot in the tubes for Matthias.

1179
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,140
Oh, God, I was hot in the tubes for the scabby-faced, pasty mutants.

1180
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,940
Oh, man.

1181
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,040
You were wearing a tube top, did you say?

1182
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,620
Well, you must love the Church of the Subgenius.

1183
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:46,860
Yeah.

1184
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,920
If you like pasty-faced...

1185
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,540
No kidding.

1186
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,840
That's why I came here.

1187
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,480
Mutants.

1188
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:51,460
Mutants.

1189
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1190
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1191
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1192
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1193
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1194
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1195
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1196
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1197
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1198
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


1199
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,160
I wanted the hot mutants, baby.

1200
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:59,620
Well, the mutant mountain boys are supposed to be part of this here convocation gathering.

1201
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,640
Saturday night.

1202
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,060
Saturday night.

1203
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:01,760
That's right.

1204
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,380
All night.

1205
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,880
Well, that'll be on the saucers.

1206
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:13,900
Oh, by the way, Reverend Mountain Boy changed her name to Reverend Andrew Genus.

1207
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,060
Doesn't really fit.

1208
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,060
Not her.

1209
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,880
It fits her.

1210
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,360
The statuesque one.

1211
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,460


1212
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,460


1213
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,460


1214
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,460


1215
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,460


1216
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,460


1217
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,980
That's Reverend Ba-bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp to me.

1218
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,580
Yeah.

1219
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,760
I thought these days they said...

1220
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,580
I can't do the scintillating bells that go along with the bumping.

1221
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,660
A few of those are imaginary.

1222
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,180
She's not really very androgynous, and yet here she's Andrew Genus.

1223
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:42,480
Well, that indicates her wishes, so we will respect them, of course.

1224
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,940
That's what the cool kids are into these days.

1225
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,340
There are no cool kids left.

1226
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,020
Yeah, there are.

1227
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,820
There's like a special...

1228
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,480
They're not asshats.

1229
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,720
There's another secret subgenius Facebook page.

1230
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,880
Besides, there's the girls-only one where they talk about how prejudiced the boys are.

1231
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,640
And then there's the post-selfies-of-your-privates one.

1232
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,900
The tits-and-balls page, which I was really excited to hear about.

1233
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,020
And they told me that I was allowed to look at them.

1234
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,000
But then I found out, no.

1235
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,460
If I know who these people are, I don't want to see them.

1236
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:21,740
I'm naked.

1237
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,220
I'm too old.

1238
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,740
I did post some pictures of myself.

1239
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,880
Elected officials only.

1240
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:35,360
I posted pictures of myself from 1998 when you and those other redheads stripped me down and threw me in the pond.

1241
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,500
You couldn't see your works for the leeches.

1242
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,640
That's what's so sad about it.

1243
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,660
The leeches cover up everything I had to show.

1244
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,160
They weren't very big leeches.

1245
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,400
The giant leeches.

1246
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,680
Oh, well, tiny leeches.

1247
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,660
If only I'd stopped them.

1248
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,360
One more.

1249
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,020
One foot back.

1250
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,780
Navy versus the night monster.

1251
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,000
Then they'd have to imagine how long my peckers were.

1252
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,100
As it was, I had the leeches.

1253
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,360
That water was cold.

1254
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,240
You could see it in the picture.

1255
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,480
That water was cold.

1256
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,840
Oh, well.

1257
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,380
It was like the witch's feet under the house in The Wizard of Oz.

1258
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,800
See, that's over with now.

1259
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,260
I don't have to worry about having to do that ever again.

1260
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,080
The witch's feet under the blanket suddenly pressing against you while you're lying there.

1261
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,020
No, I didn't know about that.

1262
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,380
You never know.

1263
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,240
Right.

1264
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,640
You're right.

1265
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,020
You're right.

1266
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,220


1267
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,440


1268
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,440


1269
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,440


1270
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,440


1271
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,100
Those prison cell moments where you're going to have to get stripped.

1272
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,440
No, we need more redheads.

1273
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,480
You're the only redhead.

1274
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,060
You can't wrestle me in there by yourself.

1275
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,200
Got any redhead wigs to distribute?

1276
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,580
Doc Ellis taught me some moves.

1277
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,640
I can take you.

1278
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,520
I believe it.

1279
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,140
You heard it right here, folks.

1280
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,000
More premonitory prefiguring here for the chaos, the hell that's going to break loose.

1281
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,080
We guarantee it here at X Day 17.

1282
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,400
Something has broken loose, that's for sure.

1283
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,880
Yes, something is at large in some genius world.

1284
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,840
Something is loose in the woods.

1285
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,760
It walks by night.

1286
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,680
It walks in the shadows.

1287
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,620
I wonder if it leaves droppings.

1288
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,020
Fumits, we call them.

1289
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,660
Fumits, yes.

1290
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,660
Yes.

1291
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,240
Scat.

1292
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,620
I heard there was some early conversation about coprolites and dinosaur dung.

1293
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,940
Oh, that was up at the cabin.

1294
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,600
They were yakking about that.

1295
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,800
Oh, Dr. Dark was talking about how oil is made.

1296
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,460
I ended up having to yell out,

1297
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,020
oil is not made of dinosaurs and chimpanzees are not monkeys.

1298
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,120
Well, he didn't say oil.

1299
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:39,640
He said coal, but he's still wrong because coal is made from the ancient coal forests of the Carboniferous Age,

1300
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,840
as scintillatingly smart Susie knows.

1301
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,400
That was an accident.

1302
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,400
Well, Carboniferous, I mean, how hard is it to figure that out?

1303
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:49,940
Yeah.

1304
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,120
But people think dinosaurs are in gas because of lengthy promotions by the Sinclair Oil Company

1305
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,800
and particularly a Chevron commercial of the 1980s.

1306
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,640
So you just, people just won't listen.

1307
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,700
That's something they believe in.

1308
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,400
And they all ran off the cliff like lemmings and turned into gasoline.

1309
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:17,880
Well, they were on a different ark and Noah's Ark had a huge recoilless cannon mounted in the foreworks, you know.

1310
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,320
Sank the dinosaur ark.

1311
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,960
Below the waterline.

1312
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,680
In the fo'c'sle.

1313
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,660
It was, I think, yes.

1314
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:30,460
Hey, didn't we drive by some church around here that's doing a Noah's Ark passion play type of thing?

1315
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,300
When it rains long enough.

1316
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,620
I thought it was Oa's Nark.

1317
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:43,320
I'm curious to see the special effects that a small town, one of these little bitty towns, would put into a Noah's Ark show.

1318
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:49,100
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord and lived to be older than 900 years,

1319
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,060
which was mythological.

1320
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,600
Who's listening?

1321
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,540
It's just the art.

1322
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,060
Oh, it's just the art.

1323
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,220
They've used all the wood in the town to construct the art.

1324
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,980
Is it still sex of the sheep if it's a guy in a sheep suit?

1325
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,480
I mean, I want my perversion as pure as possible.

1326
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:11,120
But I have a feeling if I go there looking for a hot sheep, it's just going to be some Christian in the sea.

1327
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,800
We are poor little sheep who have lost their way.

1328
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,760
Well, I don't know.

1329
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,020
Which means I'm still going to have a good time.

1330
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,560
Or it might be a goat dressed as a sheep.

1331
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,220
No, no, that's true.

1332
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,720
Or a coyote in sheep's clothing.

1333
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,320
That's not fraud.

1334
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,380
That's a bonus.

1335
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,160
Or a bear dressed as Dr. Legume.

1336
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,060
That the man wear the fell of the lamb and the woman the fleece of the sheep.

1337
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,280


1338
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,320
Yeah, that kind of makes sense, doesn't it?

1339
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,400
A bear dressed as Dr. Legume.

1340
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,860
Now, that would explain a lot, too.

1341
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,020
A bear dressed as Dr. Legume?

1342
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,080
As Dr. Legume, yeah.

1343
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,620
A bear's wanting to be something more fearsome.

1344
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,880
That sounds like a sort of manufactured explanation.

1345
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,760
More powerful, more evil.

1346
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,880
It doesn't sound parsimonious.

1347
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:49,760
More rapey.

1348
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,600
It's too elaborate to sound plausible to my way of thinking, if you'll pardon me for saying so.

1349
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,980
No, a solution won't.

1350
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,700
That's what you would call rapey or wit.

1351
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,080
Yes, but they say it's...

1352
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,820
It's more rapey.

1353
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,360
Yeah, more rapey wit.

1354
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,240
Hard not to indulge in it sometimes, I suppose.

1355
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,160
Anyway.

1356
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,000
Anyway, it's actually almost another hour has gone by on my little recorder here.

1357
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,240
Well, I'm glad.

1358
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,780
Yeah.

1359
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,620
I'm glad you're back.

1360
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:20,680
I'm glad you're back.

1361
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,760
And I would say we've recorded at least 15 minutes worth of usable stuff.

1362
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,000
Yeah, we've just been enriching magic here.

1363
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,700
Snipping, cutting it down, chopping, resizing, shaping.

1364
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,080
Right.

1365
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:39,760
I find the little scissor, what we call scissor space, cut points, and then put something interesting in.

1366
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,480
Mm-hmm.

1367
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,120
See?

1368
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,660
I notice that's what you do on your shows, too.

1369
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,960
Why don't you do what I do and just make everybody say what they never said before?

1370
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,940
I do that with you.

1371
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,620
I manipulate you.

1372
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,140
That's a lot of work, Susie.

1373
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,900
I used to do that, but my editing fingers wore out.

1374
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,680
Look at that.

1375
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,600
Look at that witch finger.

1376
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,340
That's because of you.

1377
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,220
Holy God.

1378
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,680
Yeah.

1379
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,020
That really, that looks like Princess Wee's frankenfood.

1380
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,380
Yeah.

1381
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,420
Only it's on a hand.

1382
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,760
That really isn't editing.

1383
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,380
This is copy-paste, mofo.

1384
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,060
This is why her shows are more edited than my shows.

1385
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,200
She's willing to let her finger get like that.

1386
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,580
Too bad this is the audio.

1387
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:19,760
That is good.

1388
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,180
It's a witch finger.

1389
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,120
Not video medium.

1390
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,800
I could paint another fingernail on this knuckle and look like I've got like a two-headed snake deal going on my index finger.

1391
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,340
That's pretty good.

1392
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,820
It's all from, started out clicking tapes.

1393
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:38,820
Yeah, you know, your hands aren't particularly veiny or old-looking until you start really checking out those editing knuckles.

1394
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,660
Because of you, I'll never be a hand model.

1395
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,140
Hmm.

1396
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,600
And I can only pick my nose up to here now.

1397
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,140
Well, you can pick your friends and you can pick your nose.

1398
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,440
I can't get it all the way up.

1399
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,060
I can't get it to the sinus.

1400
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,440
If I have this itch behind my right eye, I've got to use a toothpick now.

1401
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,240
Thanks for nothing.

1402
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,440
How about a Q-tip?

1403
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,940
They are cute, aren't they?

1404
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,460
Yes.

1405
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,420
She's pulled a lot of trains for the church.

1406
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,480
Ooh, I have locomotives.

1407
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,940
Well, I've had enough of this.

1408
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:15,580
If you would like to hear more about X-Day, Church of the Subgenius, Suzy the Fluzy, Ask Dr. Howe.

1409
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,480
After all this.

1410
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,820
Or anything, or something interesting.

1411
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,680
You can look at subgenius.com.

1412
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,460
Look until your little eyes melt and run down your cheeks.

1413
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,420
And it'll feel so good when you stop.

1414
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,680
I lied.

1415
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,820
Is Suds waiting to be called on?

1416

I don't understand why you have your hand up.
