1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,280
The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear, what you say, and what you think.

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, how much money do you think you're going to make out of this?

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,100
Oh, I don't know.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,520
Money, talk.

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,860
Now it is time to grow up and take some responsibility.

6
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,540
So what? Why shouldn't they be offended?

7
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,760
Because they've done what they shouldn't be offended.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,820
Uh, what was that?

9
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,560
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius Hour of Slut.

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,420
Wow.

11
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,500
Wow.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,720
Wow.

13
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,300
Wow.

14
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,380
Wow.

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,740
Wow.

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,120
Wow.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,520
Wow.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:27,900
Wow.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,260
Wow.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,400
Wow.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,800
Wow.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,040
You are no longer in control, my friend.

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:00,900
We shall dominate you, dear listener, as we have dominated others of your species.

24
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,320
There's no escape.

25
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,120
You can only do your duty.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,300
It was me who done it anyway.

27
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,960
But you know, friends, you start talking about that weird stuff.

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,180
You start talking about the neither forces.

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,440
You might end up summoning some of them things.

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,820
Yeah, we subgenius ministers here found out there's some things you just don't play around with.

31
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,420
You don't start messing with somebody else's religion, they say.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,740
But you start messing with the elder gods, friends.

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,460
You stir up forces.

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,360
Suddenly everything's going wrong.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,000
What you gonna do about it, boy?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,020
Oh, what you gonna do to get straight?

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,880
Not much you can do if you get everything out of balance.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,860
You thought it was real funny, didn't you?

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,800
Thought you'd go and pull the devil's leg, eh?

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,980
Go ahead, son.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,240
It's funny. Funny big joke.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,200
Let's go. Go ahead, little girl.

43
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,360
Let's go spray paint funny pictures on tombstones.

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,460
Let's go make a fake...

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,940
bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.

46
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.

47
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,340
Oh, fun.

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,860
Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,080
I'm ready.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,140
He-he-he-he-he.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,080
Yeah, you just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius.

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,540
Oh, we're in it as deep as you.

53
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,540
We took money for it.

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,180
We know our souls are damned.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,420
Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped up we don't think about it.

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,680
Yeah.

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,160
I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
Pathetic Bobby.

59
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,060
You're Bobby, ain't you?

60
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,100
Thought you'd be cool.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Thought you'd get in with the cool guys.

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,080
Thought you'd live away.

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,260
We're laughing at you, boy.

64
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,540
B-O-B.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,980
B-O-B.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Bobby.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,180
B-O-B.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,560
Bobby.

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,620
Bobby.

70
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,380
Bobby.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:45,940


72
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:45,980
Bobby.

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,920
Bobby.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Bobby.

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:48,760


76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,180
Bobby.

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,300
Bobby.

78
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,840
Bobby.

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,020
Bobby.

80
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,020


81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,020


82
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,020


83
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,020


84
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,020


85
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:15,040
B-O-B.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


88
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


99
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,040


100
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,660
It does my heart to hear your voices coming over that airwave with a message of slack and redemption for me.

101
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,840
The covenant of suffering is a sacred trial of faith.

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Here every morning as I stare across my word, Professor Verily, into my cross,

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,600
Say it, brother, say it.

104
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,360
which stands a tree which has no leaves, yet has them.

105
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,860
Yes, my heart is moved.

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,180
Are you working at home now, Reverend?

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,980
And was the operation a success?

108
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,520
The operation was a success, yes, and I want to thank all the listeners for their letters and their recommendations and the pieces of their heart.

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,580
Now then, yes, as I look at that, I am moved.

110
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,080
Yeah, we know about that, but answer the question.

111
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,620
The Uberbrow is trying to ask you a question.

112
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,420
Will you be appearing here on the West Coast any time soon?

113
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes, praise God.

114
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,660
Ah!

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,020
Praise God.

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,840
Praise whoever it is.

117
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,520
We're listening to Pope David Meyer of New York.

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,100
Here is he.

119
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,100
Hello.

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,040
Hello.

121
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,480
What exactly are you on?

122
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,080
Hello.

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,480
Hello.

124
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm on the miracle drug, sleep snot.

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,320
Well, you probably took the wrong...

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,260
...gum the lid and makes the world seem rosy.

127
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,580
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's sleep snot.

128
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,900
Well, I think you took the wrong...

129
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,340
...pills.

130
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,960
...pills.

131
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Get your car headlights whiter than white, what?

132
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,000
...the wrong pill. You're not on this station.

133
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,500
You're not in this studio.

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,100
We'll have to refocus.

135
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,260
We can't listen to this till tomorrow when we wake up and turn the cassette machine on.

136
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,400
Now the only way you're going to hear it is on tape later.

137
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,880
You have entered the world of retards and mouth holes.

138
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,180
You have entered the world of retards and mouth holes.

139
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,880
Feel free to eject your...

140
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,300
...touch at any time, even though you are not free.

141
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,020
Your free will is an illusion.

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,660
Give up.

143
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,720
All you desire is petty and insignificant.

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,120
Your life is nothing.

145
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,120
Let nothing go.

146
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,000
You have nothing to lose.

147
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,780
Upon this tape is encoded the answer and question...

148
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,480
...to mankind.

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
To mankind's deepest dilemma.

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,100
There are no missing steps in the analysis nor the synthesis.

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,540
If you listen you may open your eyes.

152
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,580
If you hear, you may see the way.

153
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,220
The answer they, one day you may understand.

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,660
The answer they, one day you may understand.

155
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,980
The answer they, one day you may understand.

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,440
Your art echoes and bestsettes.

157
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,800
But for some people, that is what sounds to they.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,280
We are just only spun to understand.

159
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,900
This is the more critical government of art.

160
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:36,900


161
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,400
...or just an ολόγ annoyance.

162
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,320
We might just sing it, because there are the things he or she has to do to benefit.

163
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,320


164
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,280
We might just sing it, because there are the things he or she has to do to benefit.

165
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,000
...of lace.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,040
I focus mine.

167
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,780
One must experience the story as a series of variations without a theme,

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,220
a chaconne without a bass,

169
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,880
a concerto performed with an absent soloist.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,900
Each listener is expected to enter the solo part and to hear it only in their own head.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,700
The Retard 8 is brought to you by Mr. Pure.

172
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:25,580
And Mr. Pure knows just what to do with the tapes from the TV tards.

173
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:35,200
Lords, ladies, third sex,

174
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,240
a total...

175
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,980
a total...

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,700
I told you.

177
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,060
I told you.

178
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,680
I told you about apomorphine, but you don't listen.

179
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,880
You got too much invested in the mafia and General Motors.

180
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,740
I say you gotta kick the money habit too.

181
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Get them green things off in your back.

182
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,340
Nothing to lose but your chains.

183
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,800
That is stocks, bonds, castles, roses, whores,

184
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,860
soft toilet paper, connection with the man,

185
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,720
it is a long, long way to the jungle.

186
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,080
But it's worth it.

187
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,140
Build up your muscle and character.

188
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,420
So much for that.

189
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,060
I hope you all enjoyed this video.

191
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,220
You can find it at the end of this episode.

192
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,040
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,040


195
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,040


196
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,040


197
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,700
Slack!

199
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,860
You have the power to find Slack!

200
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,480
Good something for nothing!

201
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,000
Credit cards are taken!

202
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,980
Slack!

203
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,220
Send cash!

204
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,880
I want more Slack!

205
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,540
Send your money now!

206
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,100
Conspiracy denied me again!

207
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,580
Send your money!

208
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,680
I will have my Slack!

209
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,560
Your Slack's open and here!

210
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,260
Slack!

211
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Buy more Slack!

212
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
Use Slack!

213
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,640

216
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
All sorts of Slack!

217
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,600
Use Slack!

218
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,620
Every kind of Slack imaginable!

219
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,880
Slack!

220
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,660
Slack from the other side of the world!

221
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,820
Slack!

222
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,220
Slack from right next door!

223
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,540

Slack from right here!

227
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,900
You Slack!

228
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,500
Right here!

229
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Right now!

230
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,020
Use Slack!

231
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,380
We have used Slack!

232
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,580
I want my Slack!

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
I want my Slack!

234
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,240
Use Slack!

235
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,760
We'll find recognition with the fruit of order!

236
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,620
Use Slack!

237
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,920
Slack from here!

238
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:09,980
Slack!

239
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
Just for some time!

240
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,180
Slack in your lives!

241
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,180


242
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,780
With the SRG community!

243
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Slack!

244
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:19,680


245
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,680
Let me see Slack!

246
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:24,680


247
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,120
Slack!

248
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,120


249
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,120


250
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,240
It reads like an Instagram account.

251
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,920
It's a permanent Slack account.

252
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:29,920


253
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,200
Now, I can work with as many people as possible.

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,900
When a few days go by, my Channel will open!

255
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:31,940
I can spend all of my respect to my current videos.

256
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:31,940


257
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
Browse your не самого на Pluiechriler.

258
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,380
You will have the answers in a moment or two.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
I will see how you are online.

260
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,600
Slack on YouTube, Glets Gaussian

261
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,600


262
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,420
Slack is not for everyone!

263
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,780
You cannot take my Slack away!

264
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,420
Slack can be taken by prescription!

265
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,520
My God!

266
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,280
Slack!

267
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,200
Used Slack there from out of band experience.

268
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,240
Dear friends, we'd like to bring you more out of band experience, but you can bring more to yourselves.

269
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,400
If you check out their CD.

270
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Yes, they're on CD now, as well as cassette and LP.

271
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,640
The CD is called Open Your Ears and all you have to do is call

272
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,500
one Slack.

273
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,820
Got that pencil ready?

274
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:44,840
One six one seven lick OBE, out of band experience and kings of feedback.

275
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,920
But, but what, what now?

276
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,320
Where do we go with Ron Slabe's industrial music in the background?

277
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,220
Where do we go with this show?

278
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,160
It was to be a, a, a, an hour of Slack of music.

279
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,360
Yes, uh, because we have to whip several out at once now.

280
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,280
It's a different scene around here.

281
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,320
And what musics should we bring to you?

282
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,820
Something new or something so old it is new?

283
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,780
typed this following

284
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,880
if the

285
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,260
able

286
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,240
needed

287
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,040
to

288
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,420
You've got to love them.

289
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,960
You've got to act like a man.

290
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,780
You live your life by being fair.

291
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,080
You find life goes straight like this.

292
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,440
Against enemies, we'll fight in vain.

293
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
Against a natural man.

294
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,380
You've got to act like a man.

295
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,760
You've got to act like a man.

296
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,720
You want to be like a man.

297
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,420
You've got to act like a man.

298
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,480
The road, the grass, the stars, the sea.

299
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,820
Sometimes it's like a nightmare creeping.

300
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,940
If you don't give or what you take,

301
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,320
you may never win.

302
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,260
The ways are parallel.

303
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,880
But nothing's an speculate.

304
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,500
You think things will be OK for some people.

305
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,780
You think nothing is wrong.

306
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,900
You're French.

307
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,020
But that's the way Americans live.

308
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,020
Talking about the past.

309
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,880
Thank you.

310
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,300
Thank you.

311
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,160
Thank you.

312
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,760
Thank you.

313
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,580
Thank you.

314
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,560
Thank you.

315
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,840
Thank you.

316
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,680
Thank you.

317
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,140
Thank you.

318
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,920
Thank you.

319
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,120
Thank you.

320
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,300
Thank you.

321
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,620
Thank you.

322
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,140
Thank you.

323
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,780
Thank you.

324
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,680
Thank you.

325
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,160
Thank you.

326
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,280
Thank you.

327
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,480
Thank you.

328
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Thank you.

329
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,340
Thank you.

330
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,980
Thank you.

331
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,620
Thank you.

332
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:41,820
Thank you.

333
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,720
Zug's Rift, the great, the great, subgenius, great man.

334
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:15,160
Zug's Rift from his rare CD, Villagers, on musical tragedies.

335
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,380
You can occasionally actually find that thing somewhere.

336
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:32,880
And coincidentally, the rhythm guitarist on that album is none other than Joe Newman, for you Hour of Slack listeners.

337
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,080
And yes, we're in the midst of just a musical Hour of Slack.

338
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,000
Why not? It's about time. We've had enough words.

339
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,480
Well, actually, there's going to be tons of words on the other side.

340
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,040
But for now, let's just...

341
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,680
Lay back and...

342
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,440
Well, here he has no intentions of looking your way.

343
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,900
And that's just to say that he needs you to test his intentions.

344
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,460
Hey, please come crawl out your window.

345
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,880
Or use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.

346
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,860
How can you say he will haunt you?

347
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,720
When you can go back to him anytime.

348
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,240
And you want to.

349
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,320
Now he seems so truthful.

350
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,260
Is this how he feels?

351
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,220
Look at him, trying to appeal the moon, and it's cold.

352
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,980
With this business like Andrew and his bloodhounds, that feels...

353
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,260
Oh, if he is just the same guy who left his job and was in jail,

354
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,260


355
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,920
Now I have a resolution to make for this whole thing,

356
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,740
ная, that is,

357
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:29,740


358
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:29,740

Hey, please come crawl out your window

Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you

365
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,940
Now how can you say he will haunt you

366
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,280
When you go back to him anytime that you want to

367
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,360
He looks so righteous

368
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,540
Why your face is so changed

369
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,000
Why you sit on the box that you keep him in

370
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,260
While his genocide boots and his friends rearrange

371
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,260
And he's got a gun in his hand

372
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,260


373
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,780
The delusion of the loved and women

374
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,560
To give up their views

375
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,900
I am he as you are he as you are me

376
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,880
And we are all together

377
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,760
See how they run like beasts from a gun

378
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,140
See how they fly

379
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,140
I'm flying

380
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,780
Sitting on a cornflake

381
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,900
Sitting on a cornflake

382
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,120
Waiting for the bad to come

383
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,700
Corporation t-shirts

384
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,280
Stupid bloody Tuesday man

385
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,600
You've been a naughty boy

386
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,000
You let your face grow long

387
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm the Eggman

388
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,780
They are the Eggman

389
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,520
I'm the warmest

390
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,180
Who moved the tube

391
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,460
Mr. City Policeman

392
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,020
City pretty little policeman

393
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,080
In a crowd

394
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,260
See how they run like beasts from a gun

395
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,860
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky

396
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,260
See how they run

397
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm flying

398
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,460
I'm flying

399
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm flying

400
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm flying

401
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,340
Yeah, I'm in Augusta

402
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,420
Yeah, I'm in Augusta

403
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,700
Mississippi's on the dead-dark side

404
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,820
Mississippi's on the dead-dark side

405
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,260
Grab a rocket, push hard

406
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,260


407
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,260


408
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,620
And I found another priestess

409
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,240
Boy, you've been a naughty girl

410
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,300
You've let your knees down

411
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,700
I'm the Eggman

412
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,380
I'm the Eggman

413
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,200
I'm the warmest

414
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,940
Who moved the tube

415
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,060
Sitting in an English garden

416
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,600
Waiting for the sun

417
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,400
And if the sun don't come

418
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,320
I'll give it a chance

419
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,080
By standing in the English rain

420
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,260
I'm the Eggman

421
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,260


422
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm the Eggman, yeah, I'm the Eggman.

423
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,200
I am the walrus, the coot, the choo.

424
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:58,040
I am the Eggman, yeah, I'm the Eggman.

425
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,540
I am the Eggman, yeah, I'm the Eggman.

426
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,060
I am the walrus, the coot, the choo.

427
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,240
I am the Eggman, yeah, I'm the Eggman.

428
00:34:50,260 --> 00:35:01,740
I am the Eggman, yeah, I'm the Eggman.

429
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

430
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

431
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,960
Oh, listen, tender lockblacks, let me take your little hand.

432
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,760
I'll take you from this hellhole to the promised land.

433
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,340
Don't blame me, oh, children, if those promises are king.

434
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,400
Cause promises like life can be bought so very cheap.

435
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,540
Oingo Boingo, dear friends.

436
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,160
Oingo Boingo with their amazing rendition there,

437
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,580
preceded by James Marshall Hendricks

438
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,740
doing an old Bob Dylan song

439
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,800
on a Japanese CD.

440
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,540
They won't allow those pieces in America, apparently,

441
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,560
for some reason.

442
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,320
And what next here?

443
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,900
I don't know.

444
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,220
Well, this sounds good.

445
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,740
Let's just turn this up.

446
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,240
This is Hazug's riff in the background.

447
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,500
But that reminds me of something else.

448
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,720
It's good.

449
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
Take a look.

450
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,460
Come on now, who do you love?

451
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,240
Who do you love?

452
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,940
Who do you love?

453
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,860
Who do you love?

454
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,320
Who do you love?

455
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,440
Come on now, love, take me by my hand

456
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,780
Let me know that you understand

457
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,320
Who do you love?

458
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,120
Who do you love?

459
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,740
Who do you love?

460
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,360
Who do you love?

461
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,800
Who do you love?

462
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,780
Diving out of town on a midnight train

463
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,380
Through the fine and cold of rain

464
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,440
Who do you love?

465
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,240
Who do you love?

466
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
Who do you love?

467
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,760
Who do you love?

468
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,100
Put your hand in the tube

469
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,380
I don't mind this 22-hour

470
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,160
I don't mind dying

471
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,500
And I

472
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,360
Who do you love?

473
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,340
Who do you love?

474
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,520
Who do you love?

475
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,140
Quicksilver Messenger Service and uh...

476
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,440
Poor Blo Customancers

477
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,100
We can do this

478
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,200
We can do this

479
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,100
I'm película Interior

480
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,820

Tech Edge

485
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,280
We like to make fun of religious nuts and other cults and so forth.

486
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,500
But, you know, sometimes it's not all that funny for some people.

487
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,060
There's a story here in Dallas.

488
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,560
It's been going on for a while.

489
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,400
There was an article in the Dallas Morning News kind of wrapped it up.

490
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:16,680
But it's a tale of the pursuit of allegations of satanic ritual abuse.

491
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,320
It pretty much ruined a bunch of people's lives.

492
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,620
And there never was any satanic cult ritual abuse.

493
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:34,400
But the accusations of it and the hysteria and the witch hunt that built up around it

494
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,380
actually happened.

495
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
It actually created more child abuse.

496
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:49,560
Anyway, a couple of people, this was in Gilmer, Texas, the mighty East Texas town of Gilmer.

497
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:55,260
A small group of East Texas child welfare workers and foster parents whose pursuit of

498
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,040
allegations of satanic ritual abuse culminated in short-lived murder indictments against

499
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,380
a police officer and seven other people are under investigation by their parents.

500
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,060
program called Propaganda.

501
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,460
The Consultants are setting up a program that isippingмер office in Queens City.

502
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:10,480
This was無 Arb retraining officers

503
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,480


504
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,060
social workers that the main to evil doing Christian social workers.

505
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,040
Once again, they never mention religion somehow in this entire article, evenYour Advocate is Urgent Urgent

506
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,780
though, the whole thing is obviously About like aèle who is trying to help whoa

507
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,040
bat's convinced of non-existent satanic abuse, which we've been hearing little heard of other

508
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,520
which we've been hearing about more and more of them kind of nuts.

509
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,380
There would have been much far worse for that group in Queens City, Kaie Parkwood,

510
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,380


511
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,940
The murder indictments, dismissed in March for lack of evidence, were only one consequence

512
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,840
of the social workers' efforts to unmask a satanic cult for which no independent evidence

513
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,720
exists.

514
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,420
Their actions may have seriously compromised the underlying child abuse prosecutions, widely

515
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,700
held to be well-founded.

516
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,300
Now, let's see if I can...

517
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,240
Uh, you can listen to my newspaper here, isn't it?

518
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,880
Well, where's that damn...

519
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,640
Okay, here we go.

520
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:12,900
Two foster parents involved in the case committed suicide last November after one of ten children

521
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,000
in their care was beaten into a coma.

522
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,620
Subsequent investigation revealed that the case workers had failed to detect signs of

523
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:29,420
systematic abuse and neglect by the foster parents, James and Marie Lapp, who were among

524
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,180
the welfare workers.

525
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,520
The foster parents were also involved in the case.

526
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
The foster parents were also involved in the case.

527
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,380
Now, the...

528
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,560
Apparently, the main welfare worker villain...

529
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:53,840
Welfare worker slash fundamentalist Christian villains, in this case, are Ms. Gore and Ms.

530
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,760
Minshew, estate child welfare workers who have said that the children's biological

531
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,760
family, the Kers, belong to a murderous, satanic cult.

532
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:17,180
Uh, however, it seems that, uh, these, uh, two wonderful do-gooders for Jesus against

533
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,020
Satan have done these following things.

534
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,040
Uh, they took children from their biological families without any investigations.

535
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,920
They moved children from foster home to foster home, sometimes without the knowledge of their

536
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,980
supervisors in order to keep them isolated from any outside influences.

537
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:44,180
See, these social workers only would work with, uh, fellow fundamentalist foster parents,

538
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,480
see?

539
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,620
They'd get kids away from...

540
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,020
Say some parent...

541
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,060
Some parents, you know, they screwed up.

542
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,820
They did...

543
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,640
They messed up and had a real bad day.

544
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,300
Or they were actually abusive.

545
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,540
Anyway, these social...

546
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,900
These fundamentalist social workers would get hold of them.

547
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,720
They'd give them to other fundamentalist parents who were themselves crazy.

548
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:14,740
Um, these social workers, uh, recruited their own investigators and special prosecutor for

549
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,880
the criminal investigation of this child abuse situation.

550
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:25,140
Their own investigators, of course, were self-professed experts in ritual abuse, the kind that teach

551
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,120
people...

552
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,880
They'd go around giving seminars about the Church of the Subgenius being a subgenius.

553
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:30,880


554
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,840
They'd say, you know, this is a cult, this is a satanic cult.

555
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,660
Man, you know, the only reason anybody even believes in Satan is because some ridiculous

556
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,720
Christian told them to...

557
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,040
Not to.

558
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,280
Let's see.

559
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:51,780
Uh, these folks, uh, these, uh, social workers, uh, reported many incidents of purported harassment

560
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:59,600
by this cult, uh, that they invented, such as animal torture, fires, and stalking, none

561
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,740
of which could be confirmed.

562
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,060
And they questioned the children so often and in such a leading manner that the children

563
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,840
may have felt compelled to fabricate stories of ritual abuse in order to please them.

564
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,820
The same kind of thing happens, is like a big fad with therapists these days, apparently.

565
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,000
Uh, you know, buried memories.

566
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,120
And, you know, it's funny the Salem Witch Trials work the same way.

567
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:28,620
You know, give a bunch of little kids enough terror and attention and they'll come up with

568
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,400
any story you put into their heads.

569
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:30,860
Uh, yeah.

570
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,100
Let's see.

571
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:44,720
It was Ms. Minshew, Ms. Minshew, as regional foster home developer who recruited, trained,

572
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,120
and supervised this, uh, the Lapps, which were foster parents, and Ms. Bass, another

573
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,420
one.

574
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,760
She was in the position to determine how many foster children they got and how much money

575
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,780
they received.

576
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,860
The Lapps, the ones who committed suicide, had five children.

577
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:00,860


578
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:00,860


579
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:08,360
Five foster kids and five adopted kids and were getting $2,500 a month, plus large adoption

580
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,800
subsidies and childcare payments at the time of their deaths.

581
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,080
They'd cared for as many as seven at a time and gotten $190,000.

582
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:25,380
Oh, no, Ms. Bass, the other one, had made $190,000 in foster home payments.

583
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,840
And this other group of fundamentalists who were buddies of the mainstay, they were the

584
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:30,840


585
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,920
ked out by one another.

586
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,460
They kept a former

587
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,300
son in the 혼 años, and they told her story to make it reconvenient.

588
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,260
him?

589
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,340
I heard some good stuff about you.

590
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,700
Yeah.

591
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:02,000
Rather than police or sheriff's officers, the child welfare workers relied on self-professed

592
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,300
experts in ritual abuse.

593
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,460
This case parallels dozens of others throughout the country in which children have told stories

594
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,180
of satanic or ritual abuse not borne out by evidence.

595
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,920
In some cases, children have recanted their statements saying they were only trying to

596
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,120
please insistent adults and that the lie simply got out of control.

597
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,440
In this case, these kids actually had been abused, although not just normal, hideous,

598
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,400
unspeakable child abuse, but not for any non-Christian deities.

599
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:45,040
But only nine months after this stuff was reported did these fundamentalist welfare

600
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,980
workers ever do anything about it.

601
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,960
When they did, they got the parents.

602
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:57,700
After the parents were arrested, then these folks got hold of the kids and let's see.

603
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,940
They began to interview this little boy.

604
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,940
They started in the morning and by nighttime the boy became so upset that he curled up

605
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,700
into a corner in a fetal ball.

606
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,960
He screamed and flailed and kicked begging, stop, stop, I'll do what you want me to do.

607
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,940
The adults urged him to tell them how he had been abused.

608
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,660
They told him they already knew that he had because other children had told them so.

609
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:29,620
The boy said what they urged him to say and then he soiled himself.

610
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,900
Well, you know, it's wonderful the way these do-gooders take care of these children, you

611
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,040
know.

612
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Out of the, the kids, man, think of these kids out of the frying pan of the, of the

613
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:46,020
drunken abusive parent into the crazy abusive fundamentalist.

614
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,060
Um.

615
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,060


616
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:54,360
Fundamentalist number two, Ms. Gore, was moved to another office where she has no responsibility.

617
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,500
And Ms. Minshew was placed on leave.

618
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,980
But they're still looking into this whole thing.

619
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:07,940
The people who killed themselves, there was a foster couple who killed themselves because

620
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,400
the husband had beaten one of their foster kids to death.

621
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:13,620
Um.

622
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,040
When an officer and social worker interviewed the last child.

623
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,040


624
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,040


625
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,040


626
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,040


627
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,280
They were told that the child had collapsed after the kid died or went into a coma.

628
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,540
They got vague or unconvincing answers.

629
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,000
Their questions were deflected with descriptions of horrors the children purportedly had suffered

630
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,180
at what the hands of Mrs. Lapp called that damned cult.

631
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:33,440
Um.

632
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:40,800
A few hours later, several of the couple's ten foster children told social workers that

633
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,040
the Lapps had slammed the seven-year-old boy's head against the floor.

634
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,100
Um.

635
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:56,320
The Lapps were part of that small group of fundamentalist welfare worker and foster parents

636
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:04,040
who so driven by their unsubstantiated fears of a satanic cult that they disregarded both

637
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,200
agency rules and common sense.

638
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:07,960
Um.

639
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:16,080
Ms. Bass is described by some people as priding herself on getting children.

640
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:23,620
A mother sent Mr. Lapp to the public mission.

provoca reg unseren rolers takeover of 사건d

651
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,180
rights. Now to get these kids to talk about the satanic rights, apparently they

652
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:58,400
would bring out scary monster masks and things like that. And it's nice to know

653
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,580
that this couple killed themselves after they were found out as being guilty of

654
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:13,500
beating this kid to death. Oh that previous background music by the way, it

655
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:22,820
was by Tommy Lopez. Blue Ooze I believe he calls it. Anyway it turns out that

656
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:28,180
after this kid was taken to the hospital, the Laps told all kinds of different

657
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:33,240
stories about how the kid, basically they said he banged his own head against the

658
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,940
floor during a temper tantrum and deliberately had made himself

659
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:43,260
unconscious. However the people immediately started moving this

660
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,480
country.

661
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,700
The couple started moving from one town to another in Texas and would always tell their new

662
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,600
neighbors that they were fleeing persecution by the murderous satanic cult.

663
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,580
But they were always calling the police. The police chief said he found Mrs. Lap

664
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:08,700
curiously indiscreet for a woman supposedly in fear for her life. She liked the attention, he said.

665
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,180
Anyway it turns out that in the hands of these

666
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:19,020
Christians, the parents seem to be more interested in railing to their visitors

667
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:25,120
about the satanic cult than in reaching the injured boy's bedside. Nearly all of

668
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,680
the children said that they were routinely forced to run stairs, up and

669
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,940
down stairs, undergo beatings with a belt and forgo food as punishment.

670
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,500
Sometimes a number of the children said their parents, their foster parents banged

671
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,160
their heads against the floor. And this was all to get them to the hospital. And this was all to get them to the hospital.

672
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:52,980
The confession out of the kids that they had been abused by the satanists that these selfsame foster parents had imagined.

673
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:59,460
Dear friends, and they call the church of the subgenius some kind of a damn...

674
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,360
I mean...

675
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,340
God...

676
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:09,040
Yes, we do have a certain paranoia, my friends.

00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,600
You know...

678
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:11,920
But...

679
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:20,580
Those of us who have been through the crucible do develop a certain edge of paranoia.

680
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:31,580
But I think that it may in some cases serve to make us just a bit more aware of what's actually happening in our real surroundings.

681
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:41,660
As opposed to the spirit world where it is so much easier for those who are always very

682
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,480
strong and white, to turn to falsehood
