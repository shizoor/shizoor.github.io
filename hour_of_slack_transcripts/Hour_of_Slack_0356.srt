1
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,840
And last, I have control of your radio tubes.

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,380
Uh, and I do too.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,920
Good. This is Ram the Hawk.

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,120
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,200
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNOM.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,260
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,820
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,400
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,200
Keep listening, you idiots.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,640
Else I shall kill you.

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,260
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,900
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,920
This truth that I'm about to give you has exploded in power.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:03,940
Woo!

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,460
Woo!

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,480
Thank you. Oh, I'm enjoying this.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,700
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,240
lies man's most formidable challenge.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,600
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters longed for extinction.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:26,920
Ah!

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,140
Ah!

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,660
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet as they once had thousands of years back.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,060
And that ain't all.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,100
Science was baffled and powerless.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,960
This is confusing.

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,660
A terror stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,380
Well, things are looking up.

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
A once proud civilization.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,000
A nation now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful allies.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,880
Bob.

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,620
Titan against Titan.

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,840
But things weren't normal.

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,860
There were changes.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,140
Ah!

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,220
Ah!

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,320
Your mother bit me.

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,120
I never saw him by like that.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
It's a beautiful sight.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,900
Strange.

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,180
Fright mode changes.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,640
That night it all started.

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,980
Stop doing that.

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,080
Ah!

49
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,340
Ah!

50
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,880
Ah!

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,880


52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,880


53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,080
This was the night of the crawling terror.

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,760
American International presents...

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,420
The Soap Genius Hour of Swatch.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,120
Hosted by your friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Joe.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,120
Uh, uh, join him tonight, dear friend, spy.

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,900
Uh, Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence, yes.

60
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,780
And of course, uh, Reverend Joe Riley, whose, whose, uh, brand new media barrage tape we'll

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,120
be hearing the cuts of.

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,460
Have the technology, have the tapes.

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,720
Bob told me to make this.

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,560
Not gonna resist.

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,320
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine oxypropylene bag should drop down, open the

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,540
receiving flap and inhale deeply.

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
Don't ask questions.

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,320
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurant traces.

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,100
Scanning is a must.

70
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Scanning now.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,960
Continuing.

72
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,420
Take notes if need be.

73
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,320
Call for assistance.

74
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Operators are standing by.

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,760
Forward when notified.

76
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,580
Void when prohibited.

77
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,480
Visitors only.

78
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,320
Ten minute parking.

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,060
Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate except in the presence of Krishna, Muhammad, Buddha,

80
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,000
Jehovah, Vincent Price, or Bob.

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,160
Okay.

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm ready to go.

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


86
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


88
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


90
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


91
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


93
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


94
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,340
There's a crack.

95
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,020
It's Candy Frappy.

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,420
It's Frappy Candy.

97
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,100
Stop.

98
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:11,560
Huh?

99
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,900
You're both right.

100
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,920
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

101
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors, and colors.

102
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,460
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

103
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
And the taste?

104
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,900
Candy Frappy Candy.

105
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,620
Candy Frappy.

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,060
No, no.

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


108
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


110
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


111
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


112
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


113
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


114
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,060


116
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,040
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms.

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,960
For several days now, I should say, I think.

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,060
So don't forget, that's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

119
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,540
Now with Extra Dimension Love Hamster 16.

120
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,300
Habitual not included.

121
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,900
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends, this one's the beans for maximum best fun.

122
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,840
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,200
From Squidco, the Gobi Bar people.

124
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,240
The preceding tape will cause brain damage.

125
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,620
Nothing to fear.

126
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,940
Buy something and inhale its fumes.

127
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,220
Position yourself between a chair and the wall.

128
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,200
And exhale rapidly, causing barking noises throughout the day.

129
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,620
Wiping the area with a lint-free cloth can cause extreme visions.

130
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
Such as these.

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,080
Lord God, help us obey authority.

132
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,620
Bless our leaders for making us what we are.

133
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,960
This is your word, O Lord of heaven above.

134
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,740
Bless our overlords for protecting us from our wretched selves.

135
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,720
May we be blessed with a lust for submission and guidance.

136
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,780
May we think of the Lord and not of pain.

137
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,620
Authority is great.

138
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,080
Ignorance is bliss.

139
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,900
Peace is war with the devil.

140
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,040
This is the word of God.

141
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,040


142
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,040


143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,560
This is the word.

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,680
Amen.

145
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,940
Welcome to yet another Bulldada Audio Barrage tape.

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,140
Volume 1 couldn't possibly hold all the eclectic propaganda needed

147
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,520
to become a complete raving lunatic for Bob.

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,800
The audience is now listening to the music of the music of Bob's life.

149
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,320
On this tape, you'll hear rantings from every two-bit B-movie actor ever born.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,900
Cold, precision auto monster boys.

151
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,460
And from hundreds of dysfunctional appointments across our globe.

152
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,360
Music.

153
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,740
Music.

154
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,480
Music.

155
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,720
Music.

156
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,780
Music.

157
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,460
Music.

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Music.

159
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


160
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


161
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


162
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


163
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


164
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


165
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


166
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


167
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


168
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


169
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


170
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


171
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


172
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,020


173
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,040
Music.

174
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,240
Hi there.

175
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,820
How do you do?

176
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,900
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.

177
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,680
Thank you.

178
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,760
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.

179
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,580
Ah!

180
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.

181
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,580
What the hell are you doing, Lee?

182
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm watching Bob.

183
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,960
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Curry.

184
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,940
What do you think you used to do? You backstabber, you traitor, you...

185
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,180
Snap out of it, bud.

186
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,580
Um, I lost my job. I had a job. Now I don't live on the lawn.

187
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,060
Ah!

188
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,040
I want you to be like me. I want you to worship me. I want you to be like I am.

189
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:21,980
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have, the courage that I have, the compassion that I have, the love that I have, the all-encompassing mercy that I have.

190
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,220
I want you to be what I am and something greater.

191
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,560
I want you to give you more than I have. I want you to be greater than I am.

192
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,200
And if you don't want to go this route, then go to hell where you want to, but don't bother me.

193
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,820
I want to heal the other mind. Heal my toe, honey. Heal my back. Heal my bottom.

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,840
But don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.

195
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,340
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.

196
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.

197
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,780
Jesus said that every human being was a God.

198
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,260
It is written that you are God.

199
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,740
I'm a God.

200
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,200
You're a God.

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,460
You're a God.

202
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,700
And I'm a God, and I'm going to stay a God until you recognize that you're a God.

203
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,220
And when you recognize you're a God, I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.

204
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,460
You are a God.

205
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,300
But until I see all of you knowing who you are, I'm going to be very much what I am.

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
God Almighty God.

207
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,460
Call the next defendant.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,380
Kay Bridges to the bar.

209
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,380
Joanosis, hindsight,ə

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000


214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,100
C. James Allison to the standing.

215
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,020
Silence, Kay.

216
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.

217
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,620
Murdered?

218
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,300
But I never murdered anyone.

219
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,220
Nod with a sword.

1957, Cynthia anticlimactic date member Professor Warren Roberts Jacobswin casual service He is free.

221
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,420
that you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell

222
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,120
with your malicious tongue.

223
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,200
It would have been a thousand times better

224
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,580
had you murdered them with a sword.

225
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh, no.

226
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,360
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,400
I only spoke the truth.

228
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,780
No, Kay, you spoke that which you wanted to be true.

229
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,680
But granting that you did only speak the truth,

230
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,320
who gave you license to defame

231
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,280
and destroy the character of others?

232
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,260
The serpent with his venom and his ire,

233
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,180
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,

234
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,420
with his deadly call and fatal fangs,

235
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,200
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman

236
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,280
who stabs and kills the character of another.

237
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,200
Let your own words condemn you.

238
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,300
May 10th, 1973.

239
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,260
Linda's been saved.

240
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,020
Such a good friend and spiritual help.

241
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,100
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,

242
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,960
you'll really get to know her.

243
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,580
What do you mean?

244
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,220
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life

245
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,780
as you think.

246
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,760
But I'm not one to say anything.

247
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,400
You just call me when you need advice.

248
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,520
Well, I've got a lot to do.

249
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,140
I have to go.

250
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,340
Goodbye.

251
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,560
Goodbye.

252
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,240
Oh, no.

253
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,440
Well.

254
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,920
I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.

255
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,720
I don't believe I want any part of it.

256
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh, no.

257
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,380
Oh, my God.

258
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,300
My God, have mercy on me.

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,660
I never realized.

260
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,160
Have mercy on me.

261
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,400
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,

262
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,180
have driven the babes away from my church.

263
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,380
You who have in your lifetime destroyed the weak,

264
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,860
among my flock.

265
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,720
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.

266
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,300
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?

267
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,640
There is no mercy for you.

268
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,080
You are sentenced to hell where you will be haunted

269
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,120
forever by the souls you sent there.

270
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,400
Oh, no.

271
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,720
I don't want to go to hell.

272
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,300
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.

273
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,580
I didn't know.

274
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,560
I only repeated what I heard.

275
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,620
You didn't know that the most spiritual of all crimes

276
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,460
is the crime of gossip.

277
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:21,960
Oh, no. I didn't know. You didn't know that the most spiritual of all crimes is the crime of gossip.

278
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,000
Your record will speak for itself.

279
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,540
Oh, no.

280
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,740
But yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check,

281
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,960
addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs,

282
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,020
daughter of Connie.

283
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,280
Oh, that felt so good.

284
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,860
I forgot.

285
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,560
Wow, look out!

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,920
Donuts.

287
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,820
Call her!

288
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,300
Well, call her right outside the building. Come on.

289
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,360
Call her right outside the building. Come on.

290
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,400
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.

291
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
It was almost a half second.

292
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,620
That'll last forever in my memory. First time ever.

293
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,500
Fuck it.

294
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Oh, we got some more!

295
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,140
Why do I feel that they're...

296
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,120
Bergman knew how to use silence.

297
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,920
The silence of the soul.

298
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,240
Sure is nice out here. I hope the boat comes, though.

299
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,260
Fellini knew how to use silence.

300
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,200
Gary said he was here.

301
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,480
Horrible boatman with his grisly hands.

302
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,840
Yeah, I know. Don't touch him.

303
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,160
A giant flaming oar.

304
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,700
Mr. Boatman.

305
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,760
Please, Mr. Boatman.

306
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,160
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue and it's all black and icky.

307
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,600
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

308
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,880
No, no.

309
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:48,240
And be prepared to go past my dog, my three-headed dog's cerebrus.

310
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,180
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

311
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,400
The triple-brained.

312
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,500
Monster which guards the gates, the gateway.

313
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,100
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

314
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,480
What's he reading from?

315
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,700
Yes, I am a way.

316
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,500
It's a B-movie script.

317
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
Into eternal sorrow.

318
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,080
I am the way to forsaken people.

319
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,020
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

320
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,700
It is getting hot in here.

321
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,380
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.

322
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,060
Made beyond me and beyond time, my son.

323
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,140
Bob and Virgil went several levels.

324
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,900
It's nice out here.

325
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,360
Oh, look out.

326
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,360


327
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,360


328
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,880
Further down into Hell.

329
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,780
Makes you forget all about this shit.

330
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,780


331
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,800
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his pike from one hand to the other,

332
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,340
pulled out from his voluminous ditty-bag a sop of cakes with wine and honey,

333
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,700
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths of the three-headed monster,

334
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,700
which guarded the cavernous entrance to Fun World.

335
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,880
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.

336
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,100
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh...

337
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,420
Uh...

338
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,700
Energy.

339
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,820
bulging stomach.

340
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,540
This three-headed

341
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,620
thing

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
wafted in the air.

343
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,580
That's enough of horrible

344
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,780
horticultural facts from the world of mythology.

345
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,040
His gigantic

346
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,620
postulus scabrous

347
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,540
hide quivered

348
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,720
unspeakably as with canine lust

349
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,500
he scraped his hindquarters across

350
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,680
the floor, howling and dribbling

351
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,260
from all three heads simultaneously.

352
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,520
Huge ticks the size

353
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,500
of small land crabs leap from

354
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,280
his fur-sparced

355
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,120
epidermis.

356
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,160
Suddenly the dog leaped across

357
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,680
the vast expanse of hell

358
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,540
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

359
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,920
He was forced to be in the show hour after hour.

360
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,520
P-Dog, why did you make me do

361
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,960
that horrible thing?

362
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,420
Yes, the bells of hell

363
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,480
go ting-a-ling-a-ling for you and not

364
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,860
for me.

365
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,460
Take my glands away, King P-Dog.

366
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,040
Bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling

367
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,100
and ring eternally.

368
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,160
Yes, from Cerebus the P-Dog

369
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,480
they all go for Ivan's leg.

370
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,100
Ow! Get that damn little, get those

371
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,760
horrible little poodles off of me!

372
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,240
I hate poodles!

373
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,120
That was Madame Wazonga

374
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,940
and her dancing chihuahuas performing

375
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,080
once again on the subgenius

376
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
Hour of Mystery and Darkness.

377
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,040
That was really a beautiful little dance

378
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,440
number, Dr. Howell.

379
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,200
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were

380
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
capable of that.

381
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,900
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?

382
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
You know that there's

383
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,660
a certain song that we have to play

384
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,140
between every other song that we play.

385
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,080
It's called the Tune-Up Song, you know.

386
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,240
Boop!

387
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,260
Yeah.

388
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,120
All that kind of mess.

389
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,160
Elvis Presley and stuff.

390
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah, there we go.

391
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,860
Big ol' rocker there, yeah.

392
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,640
Thank you very much,

393
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,060
thank you very much, yeah.

394
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,860
We sold a million records on that one right there.

395
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
And all that bull-mess.

396
00:16:51,380 --> 00:17:02,800
Besides, Frank killed the original album

397
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,060
with a。。 to get fine viewership power!

398
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,080
You made the whole album!

399
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,440
Now all you're listening to

400
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,640
is a cool original album

401
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:17,640


402
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,580
When you crankbites,

403
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,200
plays a grand 5 dollars

404
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,500
in recht recurrent

405
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,480
Slack!

406
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,620
Send cash!

407
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,300
I want more Slack!

408
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,920
Send your money now!

409
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,500
Conspiracy denied me again!

410
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,960
Send your money!

411
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,500
I will have my Slack!

412
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,900
Your Slack should open in here!

413
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,640
Slack!

414
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,820
Not your Slack!

415
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,540
Use Slack!

416
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,020
The tick!

417
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,340
Use Slack!

418
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,220
Your period!

419
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,520
All sorts of Slack!

420
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,820
Use Slack!

421
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,880
Every kind of Slack imaginable!

422
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,160
Slack!

423
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,000
Slack from the other side of the world!

424
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,480
Slack from right next door!

425
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:04,580


426
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,880
Slack from right next door!

427
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:05,880


428
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,360
Here we go!

429
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,840
The Slack Jones man here!

430
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,440
Slack Jones, my ladies and gentlemen!

431
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
Use Slack!

432
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,320
Right here, right now!

433
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,100
Use Slack!

434
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,920
Use Slack!

435
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,500
We have used Slack!

436
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,160
We have used Slack!

437
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,160


438
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,160


439
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,880
Just remember,

440
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,380
nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner

441
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,960
when they've tried over and over and over

442
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,800
to do righteousness

443
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,720
and no one received it.

444
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,520
You get them in a corner, they're extremely dangerous.

445
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,540
I want my Slack!

446
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,640
I want my Slack!

447
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,500
Who slacks with Slack definitions

448
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,520
is different.

449
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,940
We're extremely dangerous.

450
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,340
Extremely dangerous, aren't they?

451
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,620
I think you can sense the hands of these people

452
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,940
that we are a nonviolent people,

453
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,320
but we are extremely dangerous.

454
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,600
Slack! Slack!

455
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,780
Slack! Slack! Slack!

456
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,240
If you have the cash,

457
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,620
you can have your Slack.

458
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,700
Money in Slack!

459
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,880
Something for nothing!

460
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,680
Slack is green!

461
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,940
Slack!

462
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,940
Slack is government control for your protection.

463
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,220
I want more Slack.

464
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,400
Slack is not for everyone.

465
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,820
You cannot take my Slack away.

466
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,440
Slack can be taken by prescription.

467
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,500
I want to be free.

468
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,300
You don't have anything on me that I care about.

469
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,700
Everything you have on me, I've let it all hang right out for everybody to see.

470
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,480
You're getting worried about yourself.

471
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,660
I don't mind losing my life. What about you?

472
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,940
I don't mind losing my reputation. What about you?

473
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,680
I don't mind being tortured.

474
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,940
What about you?

475
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,080
I'm just no longer afraid and I've lost interest in this old world of capitalist sin.

476
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,300
Racism, I've lost interest in it.

477
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,160
So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy-minded people

478
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,480
that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies,

479
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,140
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst,

480
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,560
I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant,

481
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,100
a glorious,

482
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,120
and a glorious screaming in.

483
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,920
Your ultimate goal on this adventure through inner space

484
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,080
will be the very hub of this microcosmic solar system,

485
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,920
the atomic nucleus.

486
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,600
Its capabilities are almost unimaginable.

487
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,080
It is a million times smaller than the atom,

488
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,980
and yet it contains 99% of the atom's weight.

489
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:32,060
The density of the nucleus is such that if we had one cubic centimeter,

490
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,640
half a teaspoon,

491
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,880
it would weigh 100 million tons.

492
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,700
And at the same time, with 250 units of tetanus-immune globulin human,

493
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,460
administered in the contralateral gluteal muscles,

494
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,400
an educational service of the Longines-Whipnor Watch Company,

495
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,060
I have a wonderful free gift waiting for you now.

496
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,300
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

497
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,120
Uh-huh.

498
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,020
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye.

499
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,500
Attaboy, Looper!

500
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,020
Woo-hoo!

501
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,980
Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this luncheon,

502
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,200
I asked myself this.

503
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,340
Who are you, Luther Hage, to be the guest speaker at this luncheon?

504
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,700
I thought about my answer about being the guest speaker for a long time.

505
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,200
What is a guest speaker?

506
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,040
Let me clarify this.

507
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,820
I have been called Brave.

508
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,400
What is Brave?

509
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,040
Let me clarify this.

510
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,480
Of course we all know that it is short for Brave-ery.

511
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,520
That goes without even being said.

512
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,680
But it is also a symbol of another thing.

513
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,020
Uh, well, I don't know if you know, but I just think that it's a symbol of something.

514
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,020


515
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,600
Thank you for having me.

516
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,020
It's real quiet, Dad.

517
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,140
I'll let you... I'll leave it.

518
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,360
I won't say anything unless you listen to it now.

519
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:17,800
Ah!

520
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:19,820
Ah!

521
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

522
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,300
What's he doing? Ah, ah, ah, ah!

523
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,220
Ah!

524
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,620
Ah!

525
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:26,980
Ah!

526
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,920
Ah!

527
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,580
For your own listening pleasure,

528
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,160
please be sure that your balance control

529
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,180
is now in the center position.

530
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,420
Thank you.

531
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,380
I am in aluminum foil now.

532
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,140
I think it's got to be done. I don't think it can be helped.

533
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,600
Oh, oh, oh, ride!

534
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,800
Oh, oh, oh, ride!

535
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,140
Oh, oh, oh, ride!

536
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,780
Well, they thought he was rolling.

537
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,220
Your heart will bump, your nerves will paralyze

538
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,720
as you shall hear the strangest things

539
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,020
that you've ever heard.

540
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,300
That never met your eyes.

541
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,180
They're not that strange, Al.

542
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,520
Yes, you will travel into the chilling,

543
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,640
thrilling, slimy, haunted

544
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,260
radio station.

545
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,340
Just sign on the dotted line,

546
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,920
little boys and girls.

547
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,160
And now you've bought an interest in the

548
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,020
Captain Beefheart Beefsteak Mine.

549
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,480
There's a beautiful vein of pure linguine

550
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
running through these rocks, and I want you boys

551
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,460
to have every opportunity to become shareholders

552
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,180
in this money-making project.

553
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,740
Now don't bother to read it, just sign your name

554
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,460
on the dotted line, and why, soon you'll be

555
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,480
a beefsteak tycoon.

556
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,780
I promise you that.

557
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,300
...bobbing it.

558
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,960
No grain in it.

559
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,760
Oh, oh, oh, ride!

560
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,240
Still there.

561
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,060
Dora.

562
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,360
What, Dora?

563
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,160
Is he laughing at us?

564
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,880
Hey, that's my job!

565
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,000
That's my job.

566
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,160
I just try to help folks.

567
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,540
That's all I do, is try to

568
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,140
come on and help.

569
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,240
Not that the job pays well.

570
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,720
Never has on this planet.

571
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,900
Did you ever notice anybody ever tries to help, we shoot them?

572
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,460
Did you ever notice that?

573
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,060
Ah!

574
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,020
If the risk is little,

575
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,700
the reward is little.

576
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,340
Who the hell are you?

577
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,180
You're welcome.

578
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:31,780
Tweet.

579
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,080
Where's the tweet?

580
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,160
That ain't no tweet.

581
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,440
Oh, here it comes!

582
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:36,880
Here it comes!

583
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,340
Look out!

584
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,980
Look out!

585
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,440
Look out!

586
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,740
Look out!

587
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,880
Cleve told me of an incident that happened to him the other day.

588
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,020
He was standing in a nearly deserted Boston subway station.

589
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,420
Tell it, brother.

590
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,880
Tell it.

591
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,620
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.

592
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,980
And he said,

593
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,500
What's your name?

594
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,420
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said,

595
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:58,920
Bob.

596
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,960
That's right.

597
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,680
He said, Bob.

598
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
And the drunk said,

599
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,520
All the best drunks are named Bob.

600
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,520
Bob.

601
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,520


602
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,520


603
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,520


604
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,520


605
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,520


606
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,520


607
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,520
In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.

608
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,280
And then that man got down on his hands and knees,

609
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,380
and he licked that third rail.

610
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,480
How many of you listening by radio can lick that third rail?

611
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,220
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to?

612
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,540
Huh?

613
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,960
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses.

614
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,060
Yes.

615
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,940
Sitting there praising Bob.

616
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,280
Singing hymns to Bob.

617
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,000
But you're afraid to get out there.

618
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,020
What?

619
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,420
P-dog for Bob, huh?

620
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,000
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?

621
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,140
Oh, you Californians are so laid back.

622
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,540
We're into violence and hate in Texas!

623
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,940
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.

624
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,400
We thought he was a good guy.

625
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,660
We thought he was like, on our side.

626
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,040
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him.

627
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,780
Just to praise his sweet name.

628
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,140
I didn't get any ammo.

629
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,560
I got some PCP.

630
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,840
Well,

631
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,820
Well, you'd best be lying.

632
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,980
But I didn't get no ammo.

633
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,060
Well, at least that.

634
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,300
There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.

635
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,840
None of the sacred PCP of the church.

636
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,540
Ah, yes.

637
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Many people meet here on the beach to call Sterno.

638
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
There's the little Sterno at the bottom of the hall.

639
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,040
Oh, look, I see him now.

640
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,760
He's been poked and prodded awake now by the bad show.

641
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,240
Let's hurt him now.

642
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,960
Subgenius corrupt.

643
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,740
Uh, Energon crystals.

644
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,140
Our muscle's flexing.

645
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,580
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.

646
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,240
Okay, here it comes.

647
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,720
Look out, look out.

648
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,840
Sterno's love muscle is flexing.

649
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,040
Watch out, everybody.

650
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,760
Stand back.

651
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,440
Stand back.

652
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,080
Oh, no!

653
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,080
Excuse me, it bumped into me.

654
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,240
Hey, you thought P-Dawg was ugly.

655
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,800
Don't get any on you.

656
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,220
You hadn't seen nothing until Sterno whipped out of bed.

657
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,600
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.

658
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,860
That damn thing's got three heads, Ivan.

659
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,680
Whoa!

660
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,320
Beat that!

661
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,060
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?

662
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,820
Only one foreskin's infected, though.

663
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,600
Something unwholesome about that critter.

664
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,820
Don't look at it too close up, little show.

665
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,180
There's kind of a capacity there for, uh, isolation.

666
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,060
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could

667
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,440
and then give you a call so it's the bad show again.

668
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,220
Well, good.

669
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,080
We're gonna take those chromosomes and DNA fragments

670
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,940
from Subgenius Rue

671
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,920
and somehow mediate a recombination

672
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,800
between those two types of, uh,

673
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,120
just plop them into the protocluster

674
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,460
and let them realign on the wall.

675
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,020
Why not?

676
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,560
Why not?

677
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,200
So we're gonna, we're gonna take the resultant strain

678
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,120
and inject it right into that golfer head.

679
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,120
That's the way it goes.

680
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,620
No!

681
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,360
No!

682
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,940
Don't inject the head!

683
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,620
You'll bring it back to unholy life!

684
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,080
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course,

685
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,000
leaving a trail of sizzling blood.

686
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,420
It's like a little snail trail.

687
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,500
Decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.

688
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,900
As the head...

689
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,200
floated and levitated along,

690
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
it kept uttering the word,

691
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:08,740
Why?

692
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,800
And it realized its tragic loss

693
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,540
and the tragedy that it had invented for itself

694
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,240
and sunk into a depression.

695
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,500
Oh, mumbling and muttering,

696
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,780
mindlessly champing with its jaws in a...

697
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,440
But listen!

698
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,280
Please listen!

699
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,380
Once upon a time, long, long ago,

700
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,800
a lovely queen sat by her window sewing.

701
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,380
Ha ha ha!

702
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,320
Ha ha ha!

703
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,820
Ha ha ha!

704
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,000
Ha ha ha!

705
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,680
Ha ha ha!

706
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,140


707
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,620
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.

708
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,160
Ah!

709
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,300
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.

710
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,260
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.

711
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,500
Is that a boy or a girl?

712
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,720
Is it a spaghet?

713
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
It's a dyke!

714
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,160
No, it's a hippie!

715
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,940
A communist?

716
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,900
Rascals!

717
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:02,960
A drag queen!

718
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,860
Or a washrag queen!

719
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,720
Probably a speed freak!

720
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,100
Or a pothead!

721
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,060
Or a mutton queen!

722
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Look at her! It's just a whore!

723
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,180
Or maybe a gold digger!

724
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,280
Or she's a hustler!

725
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,340
Or some sort of intellectual!

726
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,320
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.

727
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,920
It could be a bag hag.

728
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,420
Or maybe it's a bee girl.

729
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,740
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.

730
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,520
Yeah!

731
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,200


732
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,760
I mean, for a little girl, now her happy year!

733
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,900
She could have rushed to her official engagement!

734
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,320
Oh, that game would make usutter children.

735
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:42,880
Oh yeah?

736
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,260
Uh, I can be sure!

737
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,800
She'd be a nearby model.

738
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,760
And I'd be God's image of the queen,

739
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,700
Bertie Lee will come and steal your dream!

740
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:52,700


741
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,540
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

742
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,120
Interesting. Thanks, Dad.

743
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:11,200
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

744
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,180
What are they doing, Texas?

745
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,560
This is the weekend old drink, the blood of Christian babies.

746
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:28,440
For more information, you may write Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

747
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,540
So call now for your free no-obligation information.

748
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.

749
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,440
Like a lot of women, I've discovered.

750
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,100
Recently, one of my breasts is larger than the other.

751
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,220
And by saying that phrase to you, it will now go out and be stuck in your heads,

752
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,500
thousands of other people's heads, and I'll be free of the curse.

753
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,380
I hope.

754
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,000
It all comes at me. There's too much of it. I can't take it.

755
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,280
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do one thing at a time.

756
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,920
You just have time to wash.

757
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
Mirror, mirror.

758
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,540
On the wall, who is the fairest of us all?

759
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,480
You sure as hell.

760
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,860
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.

761
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,060
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.

762
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,460
But she was not really alone, she found.

763
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,100
All the little woodland animals were her friends.

764
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,220
You're all right.

765
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,800
And chirping and chattering happily, they led her to a new home.

766
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,760
Hey, what kind of a place is this?

767
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,940
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.

768
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,440
Looks like a rogues gallery.

769
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,420
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes, and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.

770
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,260
Shut up, shut up!

771
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,560
You're doping?

772
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,820
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.

773
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,060
She took one bite and sank lifeless to the floor.

774
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,200
And that ain't all.

775
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,620
Now you drop dead, you nitwit.

776
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,740
God bless you.

777
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,280
It's a beautiful thing.

778
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,600
Praise Bob.

779
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,680
Why not?

780
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,580
The man with the plan.

781
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,720
Open the scene up now.

782
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,920
The master of natural world domination.

783
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,060
The most superior mutant.

784
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,460
Marching across history or the face of it.

785
00:33:52,780 --> 00:34:00,400
Well, if you go here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian, you do find there is a whole section of WAD ads,

786
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,040
mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.

787
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,700
It's a wonderful, theatrical world.

788
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,060
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but now everybody's doing it.

789
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,300
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule.

790
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,440
You cross a mule.

791
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,280
You're a mutant with the normal and you get some sort of mutation.

792
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:25,280
But now that mutants are doing it with other mutants, it's almost become, I don't know, mainstream.

793
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,660
I know.

794
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,120
It's really sad to see the best minds of our generation doing all that 50 stuff over again the same way they did it back then.

795
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:42,680
And now, you know, now it's almost like uncool to be anything but mutant, you know.

796
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,100
I mean, it's sort of like...

797
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,820
Well, you know what I'm saying?

798
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,100
Yeah, you're saying it, it, it, it, it.

799
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,480
Yeah, exactly.

800
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,760
And on top of that, if you're mutant...

801
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,200
It is.

802
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,820
It's like, be different for the sake of being the same.

803
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,840
Yes, that's right.

804
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,380
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.

805
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,360
And that's really no better than the normal.

806
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I mean, when you get right down to it.

807
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,360
Here on show.

808
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,080
Yeah.

809
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,440
Well, that's why the Church of the...

810
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,260
The Church of the Sogenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of our lives.

811
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,120
Then we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutations.

812
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,680
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.

813
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,040
I just want to be thee.

814
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,240
Not thee, me.

815
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,340
Well, me for ye is thee.

816
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,180
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.

817
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,580
You gotta be the you me.

818
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,680
I gotta be the I me.

819
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,660
Well, this is no longer the me generation.

820
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,000
That was last generation.

821
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,460
So perhaps it's the...

822
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,580
Yeah, but I'm sterile.

823
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,340
So, you know, I'm kind of stuck with it.

824
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:55,900
Well...

825
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,960
If I could reproduce, then I might have a ye generation.

826
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,680
Ye?

827
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,940
Ye, that's true.

828
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,940
No, no, ye.

829
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,940
Ye, that's true.

830
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,280
Right.

831
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,100
These get confusing after a while.

832
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,940
Why not?

833
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,740
Remember Sam, let me ask you.

834
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,300
Bob's number is 999.

835
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,100
Whose number is 911?

836
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,820
So I know who you are.

837
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
God bless you.

838
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,560
Hello?

839
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,180
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated, you mother...

840
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,840
Come on, that's a pretty unprofessional obsession right there.

841
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,720
Well, it's true, but it's all we got.

842
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,740
Well, we'll just have to be cartographers of the head.

843
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,840
And it's our duty to explore the wilderness.

844
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,060
Artillery-like art.

845
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
New gray matter preserve.

846
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,860
Just don't look up its neck stump.

847
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,560
You might see something you wish you'd never seen.

848
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,240
It was an ugly sight.

849
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,820
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.

850
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,220
Yeah, I know what you do with that neck stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.

851
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,240
Well, I've...

852
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,200
I know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump.

853
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,100
I've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched,

854
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,900
intimidating circumstances.

855
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,980
But this relationship has provided for me.

856
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:27,680
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know, inhaling deeply of the church air.

857
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,840
On the air.

858
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,620
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?

859
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
We're going to go to the caller.

860
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,760
Hold on.

861
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,820
Okay.

862
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,520
Sir, I know who you are.

863
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,600
God bless you.

864
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,160
Okay.

865
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,480
We had that nasty caller diverted before we could even get our hooks in.

866
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,680
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel when he's lifting his head at the

867
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,360
scent of that golfer head.

868
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,240
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed

869
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,700
tonight.

870
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,260
Might have.

871
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,020
That's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues, as I'm often doing

872
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,340
the show.

873
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,700
Yes, all you gas-fans trapped out there.

874
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,720
Might have is the grass-fanned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.

875
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,020
The clues are buried in the show.

876
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,040
But that board's lit up like a Christmas tree, Commander.

877
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,800
Well, the character and climate of the show, no doubt, have exerted a slight influence on

878
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,680
his actions.

879
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,680
A tidal influence, we would say.

880
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,300
Yeah.

881
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,060
That's true.

882
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,140
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.

883
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,120
That's right.

884
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,300
They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.

885
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,160
Well, we'll...

886
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,260
The water's best for brewing.

887
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:45,100
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries, which lay beyond those.

888
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,480
Okay.

889
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,540
Okay.

890
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,540


891
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,540


892
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,540


893
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,540


894
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,540


895
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,200
Good night.

896
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,740
Good night.

897
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,400
Take a bad, heavy discussing impression of all the information.

898
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm sorry, that was very obvious, but no offense.

899
00:38:59,680 --> 00:38:59,680


900
00:38:59,680 --> 00:38:59,680


901
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,620
I'mões using

902
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:00,960
Carlischenesehen.

903
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,600
But that many use it with no staffs to stem the outburst.

904
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,480
That, un�이sober from Jan消kaise.

905
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:12,700
And the Fail processes.

906
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:12,700


907
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:12,720
I ask you one question.

908
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:12,720


909
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,000
with the rest of van Klơöf or refrigerated with you in your next convent to say I was cursed?

910
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:16,540


911
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,180
by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.

912
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,100
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?

913
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,360
Why don't we catch them?

914
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,620
You must decide, for you are the jury.

915
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,640
It's not my intention to delay this court.

916
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,180
God bless you.

917
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,260
Wouldn't that be weird?

918
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,920
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?

919
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,120
I say, I believe in everything.

920
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,680
You don't mean that, yes.

921
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,780
Even that, yes.

922
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,320
Yes, I, yes, yes, I do.

923
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,740
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.

924
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,780
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology, everything that exists.

925
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,960
And that don't give me no room for no arguments.

926
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,680
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.

927
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,040
That's something to think about, sure.

928
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,100
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.

929
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,860
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.

930
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,900
That's right.

931
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above it.

932
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,280
God bless you.

933
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,320
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street,

934
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,640
so we walked on down and stood in the grassy slope just this side of the triple underpass.

935
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,100
The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.

936
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,000
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.

937
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,820
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president, so she said,

938
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,820
look, there's the president's car.

939
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,700
Get a picture of him.

940
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,220
He turned to us and waved.

941
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,440
He faced forward again.

942
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,300
I lifted my Polaroid.

943
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,320
Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.

944
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,120
Ow!

945
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,280
Ow!

946
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,320
Ow!

947
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,180
Ow!

948
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:22,600


949
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,820
That's a pile of horse manure, son.

950
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
God bless you.

951
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
I don't know.

952
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,620
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.

953
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,200
Ha, ha, ha!

954
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,440
Ha, ha, ha!

955
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,880
Just because you're not the same

956
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,880
Doesn't mean you're weird or strange

957
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,920
You're just different

958
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,460
Being different

959
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,940
Is being great

960
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,380
You too, isn't that a risk?

961
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,200
Just because you're a different one

962
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,180
There's no telling what you might become

963
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,340
Thinking different

964
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,840
Being different

965
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,260
Is being great

966
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,940
God bless you!

967
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,640
It's not who you aren't.

968
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,620
It's who you are.

969
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,040
And being yourself

970
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,620
Is being great

971
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,060
From the Church of the Genius Women

972
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,020
Aaaaaah!

973
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,380
Let's get into trouble, baby.

974
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,120
I'm, uh, I'll give you time to play some music

975
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,820
Because we're shooting

976
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,000
Music

977
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,100
Music

978
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,320
Music

979
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,520
Music

980
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,780
Music

981
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,620
Music

982
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:35,620


983
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,740
Music

984
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,300
Music

985
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,140
Music

986
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,140


987
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,140


988
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,140


989
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,500
Music

990
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,220
Music

991
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,120
Music

992
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,980
Music

993
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:54,980


994
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,220
Introduinct

995
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,880
The show rolls forward!

996
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,420
And the point ises go a-

997
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,720
The Mobiuses go nuts!

998
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,100
ليOD

999
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,280
A hurtling juggernaut that can't be stopped

1000
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,120
Why did your stand a unconditional surrender?

1001
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,440
But Mike, let's be serious.

1002
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,660
And squabble.

1003
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,020
Well, all right.

1004
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,040
What's a four-letter word for...

1005
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,360
Oh, wait.

1006
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,920
Hold on.

1007
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,720
What's a four-letter word for pronate?

1008
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,480
Food.

1009
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,460
How about prolapse?

1010
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,320
Just prolapsed on me.

1011
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,480
Aliment.

1012
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,780
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1013
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,040
Bear with me a moment.

1014
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,960
There's a fond analog that...

1015
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,040
I'm gazing into the mirror now.

1016
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,580
Those simple, bare necessities.

1017
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,980
Okay, I'll eat it.

1018
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,460
I'll eat it.

1019
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,960
Okay, we're going to go with the menu.

1020
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,640
It's a punch-up 3-D food.

1021
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,860
Okay, well, how about the spooky strips of light

1022
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,780
and I'll take the dead moth shining pie.

1023
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,980
At Dead Moth Drive-Thru Plaza,

1024
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,200
the pie is our profession.

1025
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,240
I'll take the fluttered wall soup.

1026
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,180
Now available at Waldrug.

1027
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,100
And the dipping French woman.

1028
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,000
Okay, thanks.

1029
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,100
From local slave way.

1030
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,240
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.

1031
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,000
Wait a minute.

1032
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,200
Ivan's about to squeeze again.

1033
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,900
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III

1034
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,380
about a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.

1035
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,600
Yeah, it makes me think of Meese, too.

1036
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,260
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.

1037
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,020
You know, basically, ancient sense of smell

1038
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,680
just kind of makes you think of Meese when,

1039
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,100
well, when the whole building...

1040
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,320
It's a little bit of a mess.

1041
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,240
...squeezes like that together.

1042
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,440
And suddenly it dawned on a crooker friend that...

1043
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,080
Wait, is it six o'clock?

1044
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,280
Things have changed a bit.

1045
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,400
Rappaport hired a long-time Meese friend E. Robert Wallach

1046
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:52,780
to get a...

1047
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,300
Oh, yeah.

1048
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,020
Well, I just got...

1049
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,340
I just went to the bathroom there

1050
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,020
and almost finished the stark fifth.

1051
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,260
But then I forgot, I turned around,

1052
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,760
I flushed it before I even thought about it.

1053
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,800
And so more shows are probably going to be backing up the pipes

1054
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,300
and coming out of these little microphones.

1055
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,020
I need a gift.

1056
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,840
Oh, sure.

1057
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,000
And I really, I just have no idea what to get him.

1058
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,120
I know just what you mean,

1059
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,600
and I have just the gift you need,

1060
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,920
but I can't sell it.

1061
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,540
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.

1062
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,280
I will not tolerate any outbursts,

1063
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,620
donations,

1064
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,860
any talking among yourselves,

1065
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,800
any laughter,

1066
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,200
nor anything that would interfere

1067
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,100
with the nature of the show.

1068
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,100


1069
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,100


1070
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,400
I'm going to have to get a normal,

1071
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,580
orderly presentation of testimony.

1072
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,180
Oh, a radio!

1073
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,560
With your mid-afternoon news.

1074
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,920
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO

1075
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,120
in today's sunny, smogless skies.

1076
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,040
The official response...

1077
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,240
...one every three and a third day.

1078
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,840
Oh, they put a mic in the station.

1079
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,880
Here we go.

1080
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,900
Oh, it's coming alive.

1081
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,700
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the toilet.

1082
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,660
That's Mobius.

1083
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,620
Mobius.

1084
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,880
Hey, hey, hey, let go of my...

1085
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,400
Let go, let go, don't pull me in there!

1086
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,060
Oh, God!

1087
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,580
Ow!

1088
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,400
Oh, fuck!

1089
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,140
And children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.

1090
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,640
It's immune.

1091
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,560
Irradiated food.

1092
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,180
Is the new Stark Fist out yet?

1093
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,320
Yeah, it's out.

1094
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,080
A little listener asking a real question.

1095
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,720
Quick, get out of here! Stop it!

1096
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,480
Yeah, it's out.

1097
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,480
It's worth $40.

1098
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,080
But let's go over that again.

1099
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,260
Dear friends, the Stark Fist,

1100
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,100
the long, long, long awaited Stark Fist of Removal

1101
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,600
is indeed almost ready.

1102
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,740
It's almost finished, just as we've been saying

1103
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,860
for the last two years.

1104
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,040
And this time, we really do mean it.

1105
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,760
And, uh...

1106
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,700
Whoop, there went that...

1107
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,660
Shoot, we flushed it away again.

1108
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,680
Now I've got to start all over again.

1109
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,160
See, you backflush these things,

1110
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,940
and there's the little collar.

1111
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,600
He's floating up.

1112
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,080
He'll be floating face up there, he is.

1113
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,680
It'll be out soon, but we can tell you

1114
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,220
what the theme of the next issue is.

1115
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,340
Get the plunger.

1116
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,640
Get the show plunger.

1117
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,180
Get that little collar up out of there.

1118
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,340
The theme of the new Stark Fist is not you, Gary.

1119
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,380
Oh, I'm afraid he's drowned.

1120
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,640
Yeah, well...

1121
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,360
Put it down as slowly as you can.

1122
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,220
Oh, it's only an overshot.

1123
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,640
Like Paddy said.

1124
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,320
On the floor.

1125
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,140
Put it on the floor.

1126
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,240
Gently.

1127
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,760
Now, just what could have happened

1128
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,040
to get such a piece of tripe?

1129
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,880
You have no idea what I've gone through

1130
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,940
in the last three months.

1131
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,040
Sometimes I'm perfect in all, mentally.

1132
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,180
I sit for hours and hours,

1133
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,460
looking in the mirror,

1134
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,280
hoping and praying for the slightest sign

1135
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,240
of my physical change.

1136
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:58,920
And then come.

1137
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,500
And I feel myself going back

1138
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,160
to the animal instinct.

1139
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,720
I try to fight it.

1140
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,840
I try to fight it with all my willpower.

1141
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,560
And I feel.

1142
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:16,760
William.

1143
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,900
William, what am I gonna do?

1144
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,580
What am I gonna do?

1145
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,200
Fight.

1146
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,520
That's all you can do.

1147
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,140
Oh, no.

1148
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:23,680
Look.

1149
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,420
Ha!

1150
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,060
Oh!

1151
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:26,900


1152
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,560
Ha!

1153
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,660
Ha!

1154
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,920
Oh!

1155
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,400
Oh!

1156
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,480
Oh!

1157
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:32,840
Oh!

1158
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,500
Oh!

1159
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,300
Yeah!

1160
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,680
Oh!

1161
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:35,840
Oh!

1162
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,780
Oh!

1163
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:37,780


1164
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,660
Oh!

1165
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,140
What is it?

1166
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
We better get back

1167
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,760
cause it will be dark soon

1168
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,240
and they mostly come at night.

1169
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,340
Mostly.

1170
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,060
God ali'l2007 !

1171
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,920
Translate.

1172
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,320
Sure is preferred, isn't it?

1173
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Mmm, I like that.

1174
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,700
What is the truth about rock music?

1175
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,880
I think it's an octopus.

1176
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,760
Plato said,

1177
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,760
when the music of a society changes,

1178
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,600
the whole society will change.

1179
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,400
Certainly, I got married so I could retire.

1180
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,260
Lennon said,

1181
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:46,360
the best and the quickest way to undermine any society

1182
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,560
is through its music.

1183
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,800
Can you think of anything else?

1184
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,380
No, you've covered it all.

1185
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,820
Satan has taken music and he has counterfeited it.

1186
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,060
See that?

1187
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,760
Convoluted it.

1188
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,500
Twisted it.

1189
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,240
Exploited it.

1190
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:17,700
And now he's using it to hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.

1191
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,820
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.

1192
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,580
A message into the minds and the lifestyles of...

1193
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,660
of this generation.

1194
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,020
And that ain't all...

1195
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,260
...suit!

1196
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,500
What kind of ungodly being was that?

1197
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,740
Don't you believe in reincarnation?

1198
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,980
A wise guy, huh?

1199
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,360
Quick, kill him!

1200
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,460
Subdini's in space.

1201
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,240
They took me up to the top of that space needle.

1202
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,180
They showered me with beautiful gifts.

1203
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,540
And beautiful girls. Moon maids.

1204
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,740
Wow. What moon maids?

1205
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:58,740


1206
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,900
Yeah, look at those satellites.

1207
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,100
Look at them spiked heels.

1208
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,580
Oh, that one's looning me now.

1209
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,480
I can't tell whether those are convexities or concavities, but that looning...

1210
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,940
Hey, they some kind of moon maids.

1211
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,100
I say, do that again.

1212
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,540
Boy, can you dig those potatoes out of the craters.

1213
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,160
Hey.

1214
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,300
Oh, I love it.

1215
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,180
Tiny flagellants move through this microscopic stool as if they owned the planet.

1216
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,680
What happened? What, did something die in here?

1217
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,380
Or is there just more shit?

1218
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,240
It's that dinosaur egg that Hal's been sitting on for the last...

1219
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,880
...twenty days.

1220
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,380
Look, it's cracking!

1221
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,960
I hear a screeching, a scratching noise.

1222
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,120
He's not even aware that his own child is being born now!

1223
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,020
It's got the head of a boy!

1224
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,340
And the body of a Tyrannosaurus!

1225
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,540
Yes, but it smokes Shermans. Do you think that it could be?

1226
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,080
And it's still talking!

1227
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,520
I just don't know about this guy.

1228
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,240
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev bought covert aid for erosion.

1229
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,480
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child on the show and didn't even notice.

1230
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,580
And so we're going to cook this little rare creature up for breakfast.

1231
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,140
Yes, this single living example of a cross.

1232
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,860
The dinosaur baby child's making his first phone call.

1233
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,000
A homosaurus sapiens.

1234
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,820
It's Jack the Show, and it is no longer available in your area.

1235
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,940
The show fought its way to the front of the castle.

1236
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:40,220
The show thought to itself, should I swim across the moat or should I crawl through the mud?

1237
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:47,760
Or should you crawl six miles over broken glass and radioactive mine tables just to hear our program?

1238
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:52,880
How many callers, how many records, how many eardrums?

1239
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,700
We're going to talk about some of the subtle racism and sexism in the Bibles.

1240
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:08,260
The sexism's pretty well accepted, but we will talk about the racism because it's so much more hidden and it's so much more dangerous what genocide the wretched can justify with the racism in it.

1241
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:17,040
Through devious ways Satan has tainted the Bible and they justify their racism on the fact that Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, went off to a great city.

1242
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,720
How is there a city if Cain was the only first son of man?

1243
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,780
Well, this city was not occupied by man, but the beast of the field.

1244
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:32,220
And Mormons and many other religions still teach that blacks are the descendants of Cain and the beast of the field.

1245
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:41,460
We single out these painted Bibles, even St. John and St. Luke versions, so you will know that ours is the only Bible that should be read.

1246
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:52,480
Versions of the Bible which have racism in them is going to be exposed and then we will announce how we will edit the Bible.

1247
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,620
How does thatGenesis of Rebellion

1248
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:17,720
No! Yes! Yes! Finally only one microphone is on, and Dr. Howell and Gary Gabrog, friend, and puzzling evidence all went to rock it away.

1249
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,380
And that's what I am going to do in a minute!

1250
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,760
And while we certaintly haven't been on the phone to our friends lately, and strained for time,

1251
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:25,760


1252
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:25,760


1253
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:40,260
We've been, well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to, the edits of wonderful little sound bits, holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

1254
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,560
That was all edited by St. Joe Riley.

1255
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,360
Oh, praise St. Joe Riley.

1256
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,420
Saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.

1257
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,820
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others.

1258
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,060
There's a song called Used Slack buried in there.

1259
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,960
That was by Out of Band Experience, OBE.

1260
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,740
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.

1261
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,440
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.

1262
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:22,240
On the commercial for our new product, Candy Frappy Frappy Candy,

1263
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,880
was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

1264
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,580
Oh, yes, up there in New York land.

1265
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:39,160
The background music that's on right now is, of course, J. Condom from his album, Zombo Fropland.

1266
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,980
And now, this.

1267
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,640
Well, no, how about this?

1268
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,800
How about the post office box of the church?

1269
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,200
The subgenius.

1270
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,020
I know that so many of you have been sitting there with your pens in your hands,

1271
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:05,040
just aching to write down that address where you can write for free information

1272
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,520
about all the other services of our beloved church.

1273
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,940
Ah, yes.

1274
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,520
And that post office box number, we'll just write to Bob.

1275
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,980
That's all you need to do.

1276
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,400
Write to Bob at postofficebox.

1277
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:31,720
Postofficebox 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1278
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,860
That zip is 75214.

1279
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:46,020
Once again, that's box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1280
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,500
And now, this.

1281
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,400
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1282
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:50,680
And now, this.

1283
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,360
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1284
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:40,420
And now, this.

1285
00:58:52,420 --> 00:59:22,020
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1286
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,400
And now, this.

1287
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,400
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1288
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,580
And now, this.

1289
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:29,920
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1290
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:29,920


1291
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,120
And now, that zip is 75214.

1292
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:31,680
And now, that zip is 75214.

1293
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,420
And now, that zip is 75214.

1294
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:32,420


1295
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:32,860
The dead hours...

1296
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,120
The dead hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

1297
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,720
This is the time when women who have been many hours in labor finally deliver.

1298
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:48,100
And then the idea of the supernatural seems the least implausible.

1299
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,400
Mobius Rex is clambering around on top of the...

1300
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:52,400


1301
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:52,400


1302
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,740
their, say, say, reckless

1303
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,720
in theory are.

1304
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,660
Amazing camera.

1305
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,000
For those of you interested,

1306
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,040
monitor number four will show Mobius.

1307
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,060
At this time,

1308
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,020
ancient superstitions and night fears

1309
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,320
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

1310
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,740
The time when those who sleep

1311
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,460
are deep in the dreams.

1312
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,120
And this is the hour when the callers call.

1313
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,620
The Church of the Subgenius Radio Show.

1314
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:16,580
Hello?

1315
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,280
Hello, you're on the air.

1316
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,560
Cookie, this is the show trying to bother Philo.

1317
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,220
Uh...

1318
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,620
State short question, please.

1319
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,840
What's for breakfast, Cookie?

1320
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,880
Cookie, this is Ivan.

1321
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,460
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwatt.

1322
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,360
Hey, hey, hey, I got it.

1323
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,560
So we can hurt him.

1324
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,840
How many presidents does it take

1325
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,720
to screw in a light bulb?

1326
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,400
No, no, wait, wait.

1327
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,580
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?

1328
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,380
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.

1329
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,220
Get it?

1330
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,560
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1331
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,600
Spooky bad show.

1332
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:45,600
Cookie?

1333
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,580
Oh, no.

1334
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,880
Can we talk to little dude?

1335
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,440
Don't listen to these men.

1336
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,140
Not unless you have a connection to dog heaven.

1337
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,040
Oh, no.

1338
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,980
Friends, this is dog heaven.

1339
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,240
And this is Philo Drumhead.

1340
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:00,960
Hey, dog heaven.

1341
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,080
Philo Drumhead.

1342
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,920
We've woken up just to be here entertaining you

1343
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,040
in all of Northern and Central California.

1344
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,160
No, I'm still asleep.

1345
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,480
You are going to save the universe this time.

1346
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,320
Yeah, that's right, Philo.

1347
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,020
You have a link up to the sleep.

1348
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,500
Be of good cheer.

1349
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,480
Well, just tell us what you're dreaming about

1350
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,540
and we'll see you next time.

1351
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:21,540


1352
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:21,540


1353
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:21,540


1354
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,400
And we'll let you go eventually.

1355
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,400
I'm dreaming about little dude.

1356
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,980
Your dog?

1357
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,060
Your dog that you had five years ago?

1358
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:31,580
Yes.

1359
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,240
I've never forgotten the little chap

1360
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,660
who was so dear to us.

1361
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,700
Still running out there.

1362
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,880
He weighed up 500 pounds.

1363
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,280
Fields of toxic substance.

1364
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,240
That's what it is.

1365
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,020
He's prancing and dancing through

1366
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:47,180
fields of clover and dioxin.

1367
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,860
In that land where no cars are.

1368
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,480
And the smell of good Cleveland.

1369
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,480
Under a country's nails.

1370
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,780
The only cars that are there

1371
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,660
are those that are run over by dogs.

1372
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.

1373
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,440
Little dogs.

1374
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,240
Well, we're all going to meet at the Jefferson Memorial

1375
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,240
for something later,

1376
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,400
so we just wanted to call you up.

1377
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,320
Yeah, I'll be down there.

1378
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,080
Don't order anything before I get there, okay?
