1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Well, Mary access lessness mess

Okay, first any more quarters any more dollars don't crowd it don't crowd in help the guy okay first

I'll tell you what who to me the first one to buy one of these here machine. Thank you, sir

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,240
There goes the first sale folks next sale who'll be the next one to buy one of these here miracles. Oh

00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,840
Yes, send all your money

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,940
Yeah, it's a pipe all right

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,460
Yeah

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,680
Morgan

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,120
The Sun will become dark the moon blood red the stars of the heavens will fall

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,700
There'll be two major earthlings that are going to be coming the islands and the mountains are shaken out of their sockets and the second

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,000
One no Island no mountain was found in the face of the earth

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,020
It's all coming

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,440
Yes, I'm ready now

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,380
Then close your eyes

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,580
Tap your views together three times

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,440
and

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,540
Think to yourself

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,180
There's no place like Bob you mean us

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,200
Sure

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,940
Gee well, I don't want to get in trouble

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,300
But you said your mom's out shopping yeah

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,320
But what if Wally came in and caught us?

25
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,360
He's out playing basketball and if there's no one here to catch us

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Then it's all right to do it

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,000
But we don't have any smoke stuff

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
Here we have

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,420
And a feet core of impudent snobs, I don't know if they even listen to this show

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,220
genius

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,320
a

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,420
block

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Ava

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,300
That was a pop you don't want your pops and your

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,280
clicks in your recording sequence because the bob can cause a high point or a peak as we call it

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:42,840
and a click stands to signal a service interruption and a cuss word requires an edit for

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:52,100
the broadcast version and it's recorded down in hell by the recording imps yes ladies and gentlemen

38
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:03,740
from this point forward we are going to bob the cast here next day 12 to enter these recorded

39
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:16,540
sounds into the eternal record of this great event for through experience of this great event in arms

40
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,200
not worse in foresight much advanced we

41
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:21,740
may

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,360
with more successful hope resolve to wage by force and three

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
fills out the werdebragian

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,780
gaia eternal war against uh

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,660
the body of the holy order to be Peter gave fert his energy

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:35,660


47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,720
impostor

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,220
other elements of what he has the system

49
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,800
of which we see I had to

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,120
reacting to

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
not against

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,800
a remember

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:44,800


54
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,600
should be

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:47,840
just

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,020
I'm

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,240
Jack

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,240


59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,860
there

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,560
as you'd like to say

61
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,100
amy

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,600
circumstance. And also don't forget to careful we might need that arrow to

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:06,200
fight for our lives. Yes you can't let the old arrow get out of trim or dull

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,460
since it may be needed to be brought into play at any moment against the

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:20,460
dragon of reaction. That old dragon underground in straighter limits bound

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:28,360
not half so far casts his usurped sway and wrath to see his kingdom fail

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:38,260
swingers the scaly horror of his folded tail. Now you know the oracles will end

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:47,860
there will be no more noise no more loud chatter overwhelming the signal down

69
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,000
here on earth base one.

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,040
As the energy fields of the approaching saucers dampen all other communication.

71
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:03,500
And what appears to be the normal tide of conspiracy broadcast is actually the

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:12,000
backwash or the echo in the heads which have been long trained to carry on on

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,760
their own in case of such a starry synecdoche. But we being on or anti

74
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,300
progress.

75
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,960
Remd again here our own channels.

76
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,620
Our own eternally recurrent reality show.

77
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,600
If only we could get the sitcoms up again what work it would be for gaffers

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,200
goofers lighting experts and other electricians.

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,780
In just a few days.

80
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,700
In a few days we'll be aboard these escape vessels.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,440
For very air it's so scary.

82
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


83
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


84
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,320
The internet itself is the computer and the internet that serves you and when you want

85
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,740
a hamburger a hamburger materializes in your hand email out of the ethers.

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,720
And yet I spent the last week paying for cable motors.

87
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,960
But what if I'm worried about.

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,880
Oh I've got to make sure that all the hours of slack are available for the radio station.

89
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah it does.

90
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,180
All the world is handy.

91
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,920
My God how can we be lost in this.

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Show them about the internet.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,420
I'm a little sympathy kid.

94
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,880
Silly trivial things when the grandness of a whole new universe.

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,000
The whole universe is laid before us barren and bare naked.

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,420
And we're going to get to crawl all over it.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,460
Well that's.

98
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,960
You're worried about it the damn.

99
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,300
And I'm sitting here fretting about whether.

100
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,460
The CD's in the case or something.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,200
Or not.

102
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,420
As if as if I gave a hoot about it.

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,260
This is what it's going to sound like in space.

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,340
My spaceship.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
I'm the freak.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm the freak.

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,480


108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm the freak.

109
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


110
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


111
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


112
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


113
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


114
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


115
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


116
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


117
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,820


118
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm the freak.

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:50,600


120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:50,600


121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,220
And we're going to get to crawl all over it.

122
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,220


123
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,880
We're going to get to crawl all over it as well.

124
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,060
This is just not going to happen.

125
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,100
But at least we're going to be able to get to it.

126
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,100


127
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm going to try.

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,120


129
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,120


130
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,120


131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,120


132
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,120


133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,140
Emily go.

134
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,360
Oh that was the sound of the noisy spaceship of the late great professor Chas Smith from

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,900
his WCSB swamp radio show some years back.

136
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,580
And this now is the sound of hour of slack number 1216.

137
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,940
Our 12x day July 5th 7am special.

138
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:31,260
There will be various other sounds, such as the puzzling evidence show clip we heard earlier, and bits of the great movie of the great book Wise Blood, and nice stretches of live hour slack with Dr. Howell and Priestess Pisces recorded at Tarzan's subgenius rascals radio station on the Brushwood main stage, and music from 12X Day.

139
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:51,620
But half of this episode, the halves that sound like they're outdoors in the cold, cold wind, are from the little Zephodian recorder that was in my preaching jacket pocket during the morning of July 5th, the coldest July 5th dawn in recorded history, complete with comments from the peanut gallery, as heard here.

140
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,680
John David Stangerson gonna be on the jack off like last year, is it?

141
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,180
And the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that.

142
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,240
I know that you've got your hands in your pocket.

143
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,320
I like what I feel.

144
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,460
Maybe that's it, that's all we have to do.

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,400
Oh Bob, please come. Oh Bob, please come.

146
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,580
If we knew what would make Bob come, we'd be Connie.

147
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,280
Could it be that somewhere on some dirt road near Sherman, there's an exospec ship, Meyer, you and your mom.

148
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,220
That's a good excuse.

149
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Because it doesn't have a real drive.

150
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,540
I'm out with this horse and buggy.

151
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,980
This earth weather, we weren't expecting.

152
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,620
We've listened to this weather for 7am every single time.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,440
It's a motor max though.

154
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,240
It never snowed, we didn't have earthquakes.

155
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,100
Wait a minute, we were supposed to have earthquakes.

156
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,220
Firestorms, what a firestorm we feel real good about now.

157
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,860
A super volcano in Yosemite would be great.

158
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,720
What could possibly go wrong?

159
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,080
Maybe an asteroid hitting the ocean somewhere, superheating the atmosphere.

160
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,980
Mmm.

161
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,640
I wish we knew how to turn that thing on.

162
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,300
Death race.

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,900
Yeah, those are supposed to be real hard.

164
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,460
It's the end of the world man.

165
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,800
Fire in the fire room, the students are engaged, and the gun will never hire in the combat site.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,860
And the western coming in a hurry with the fury's breathing down your neck.

167
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,040
And, Kenya.org.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,420
It's the end of the world as we know it.

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,940
We're bringing it to you tonight.

170
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,740
Five hours of the end of the world.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,400
Because there's a little known obscure cult.

172
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,560
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,060
They're friends of mine.

174
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm not sure why.

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,740
I don't want to ever see them again.

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,520
So, the end of the world takes them away.

177
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,360
Poof, they're gone.

178
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
On July 5th.

179
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,860
If you have not gotten your wristbands, you must do so immediately.

180
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,500
Or face the consequences.

181
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,080
I don't like peeling the label off of a mattress.

182
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,560
It is much worse than peeling the label off of a mattress.

183
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,920
And we have to get these little bands so that we can be tracked by, uh,

184
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,240
Stats.

185
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,580
And if you haven't gotten your little band,

186
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
Your special bracelet.

187
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,200
You should look behind you towards the back of the arena.

188
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,400
And there is the band table where you can receive your little band.

189
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,500
Being displayed by Princess We back there.

190
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,100
Yes, modeled by Princess We back there.

191
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,620
Please pick up your band.

192
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:31,180
If you do not have it, then other people who aren't friendly and don't know you might think that they should have to do horrible things to you.

193
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,380
Because you're not marked appropriately.

194
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,920
Uh, the band, of course, is also a negative reinforcement electro-stimulo-

195
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,100
It is the electro-stimulo-negative reinforcement bracelet.

196
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,940
Yeah, if you try to leave, your hand will fall off.

197
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,580
It'll blacken first.

198
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,620
Yeah, yeah, it gives you a chance. It's not like, it's not like you're instantly gonna lose your hand.

199
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,960
If you hold it up against the light, you can see little wisps of smoke coming from under the fingernails.

200
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,180
And then almost immediately, it's sort of a blackery.

201
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:08,300
A blackery, blackening and, and what do you get? They call it, oh yes, a loathsome and detestable putrescence.

202
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,460
As a mass of liquid, your hand drips off the end of your arm.

203
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,540
What is the delay on it? It's like maybe 20 minutes? Long enough for you to go get to a, get your supplies.

204
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,560
And then it will reset since it knows you're getting supplies and then you come back.

205
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,160
Right. If you go into town to buy beer, don't go.

206
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
You'll probably have a dog or you'll probably have permanent scars.

207
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Although the things are timed to stop working on July 5th at 7.15 a.m.

208
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,220
The tendrils of ectoplasm just won't carry on that day.

209
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,380
We should have programmed for 7 a.m.

210
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,880
What are we programming for?

211
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,360
7.15, I wasn't thinking.

212
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,380
Well, so what? Who cares if some lazy slobs are trying to get some last hamburger?

213
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,820
Hmm.

214
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,100
Crazy people would set their end of the world at 7 a.m.

215
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,340
It was only $6.

216
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,240
On a Sunday yet.

217
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,260
Yes.

218
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,760
I see some people are taking a suck on Bob's pole, Bob's stripey pole.

219
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,020
Who's brave enough to drink his blood?

220
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,500
What did that hat doctor dark have?

221
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,860
Eight minutes to go!

222
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,000
What have you got hidden under that?

223
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,600
Yay!

224
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,540
Eight minutes of Earth oxygen left to breathe.

225
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,720
Oh, did I mention they don't have air aboard those things?

226
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,680
Hmm.

227
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,200
It doesn't count for a blood roll.

228
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,220
Sad, Dad.

229
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:40,980
Ugh.

230
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,980
I get AC in the saucer.

231
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,100
We had to pay extra for that, didn't we?

232
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,800
There's endless speculation as to what do we have to do right to make the X's show up?

233
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,420
Have more home video cameras? Could that do it?

234
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,000
Did everybody not have sex like we instructed you to?

235
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,720
You instructed us to do that? I thought I was being creative.

236
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,420
Well, that was the idea.

237
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:15,360
Somebody suggested, well, maybe the subgeniuses aren't, you know, acting sexy enough like our ads all suggest.

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:25,280
And so the idea was if I tell everybody not to have sex, of course, that's the only way to actually get them to have sex.

239
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Reverse psychology.

240
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,680
Yeah.

241
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,680
I was wondering what that squishy, crunching thing was when I was crossing the field. Now I know. Thanks.

242
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,500
A used furry squid, heartlessly slung aside.

243
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,760
I know. They forgot to de-beak it, that's all I'm saying.

244
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,300
Got only six minutes to go.

245
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,540
I've got butterflies in my stomach.

246
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,260
Oh, wait, no, those are those crickets from that pinata.

247
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,480
I knew I shouldn't have eaten so many of them.

248
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
About a half an hour ago.

249
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm not gonna get any of it.

250
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,700
Okay, we smashed the pinata. We hung Bob from the rafters over there.

251
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,400
We made coffee. We, uh, some people stayed up all night.

252
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
What do they want us to do?

253
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,560
It's the show, it's the end of the world on the 5th, by the way. That was the whole point of all this X-Day stuff.

254
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,220
People are gathering in Elm State, New York.

255
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,440
For no good reason.

256
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,440
And looking at the sky, hoping some big cardboard pleasure sausage comes and picks them up.

257
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,200
I was there on the first X-Day and there was a big X in the sky.

258
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,780
Hey, now, you know what's really weird? I was not there for the first X-Day. I was out in the desert.

259
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,520
You can look at it on YouTube on my channel, it's Puzzling Evidence TV.

260
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,120
And you can see the, uh, what we did for X-Day.

261
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,740
It was all guns and propane.

262
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,200
But, uh, weirdly enough, right at the time it was on the TV, I was there.

263
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,540
And it would have been the X at the first X-Day that you saw.

264
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,220
I, I kid you not, there was an X in the sky over the western U.S. too.

265
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,740
Wow.

266
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,880
It was very strange.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,540
That's strange.

268
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,880
And if I wasn't so tired, I would have taken a picture.

269
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,520
Ah.

270
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,000
But I was exhausted. We'd been up all night shooting at aliens, trying to stave off the end of the world.

271
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,020
I guess we were successful. We can't really look out for it.

272
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:26,080
And then there was the year Pastor Pressure tried to float a giant, heavy, wooden flying saucer using helium balloons.

273
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,600
And all it did was crash and burn.

274
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,940
Wooden helium balloons?

275
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:40,180
One year there was a giant inflatable sheep that, a fuck sheep, that was, uh, that did inflate and rise.

276
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,280
Tried to shoot it down with potato guns, remember?

277
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:48,720
Yeah, yeah, we had to shoot it with potato guns to get to, to down that, uh, sex vessel.

278
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,040
What's the difference between people and animals?

279
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,860
And...

280
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,720
What do you mean you people?

281
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,360
I had a sheep...

282
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,880
Well, it was the last year or the year before.

283
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,400
I had a sheep and I didn't have any...

284
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,160
Some hippie set off those lanterns that float.

285
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,760
Oh, yeah.

286
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,020
You know, just the hot, little hot air, miniature hot air balloons.

287
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,340
What do you think, was the entrance a hundred miles away?

288
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,120
Oh, man. Oh, people were...

289
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,360
It was at night and people came rushing out of the amino acids concert going,

290
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,620
Oh my God! Oh, I've never seen anything like that!

291
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,460
And I've got an embarrassing picture of Mr. Sister going,

292
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,940
I've been around for 55 years and I've never seen anything like that.

293
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,620
And I had to go, well, keep watching.

294
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,120
Well maybe you didn't want to see what our goal in America's football club.

295
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


296
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


297
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


298
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


299
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


300
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


301
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,700
Yeah.

302
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,260
I mean, obviously the university is and is not grave property.

303
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,540
I mean, it's totally big, you know.

304
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:49,540


305
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Anyway, put a needle...

306
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:51,960
Agh!

307
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,440
Amino disrespect.

308
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,860
No, no.

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,580
Oh.

310
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,320
No, we like them.

311
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,960
We do.

312
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
The amino acids.

313
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,540
The amino acids.

314
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,360
And Sunday, July 5th, of course, the rupture should occur.

315
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:25,120
Now, kids, you know, on Sunday morning at 7 a.m., July 5th, it's going to be pretty exciting.

316
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,880
And you'll, you know, be enjoying your new body if you decide to.

317
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,860
You want it.

318
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,180
Maybe there'll be time for one last cup of coffee.

319
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:43,100
But take a little time before then to think about what you might want to save from old planet Earth.

320
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,240
You know, I already have dibs on most of the world's museums.

321
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,460
Great museums and several zoos.

322
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
And the Grand Canyon.

323
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,100
And Yosemite National Park, which I'm going to use as a weapon.

324
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,580
But the plastic dinosaur warehouse outside Las Vegas, Nevada.

325
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,340
That I've got.

326
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,900
Hal has the dinosaur warehouse.

327
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,580
I have the karst structures.

328
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,280
You're not allowed to visit that, you know.

329
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
I have brushwood.

330
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,780
But just because I know the owners are going to forget, they're dudes paying subgeniuses.

331
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,100
But they don't take this stuff that seriously, necessarily.

332
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,380
They may forget to save this lovely piece of land.

333
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,040
So as soon as I rupture this up, I'll hand it over to the Barneys and the Guzmans.

334
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,240
Praise them, by the way, for continuing to let us do this.

335
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
No matter what.

336
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,040
Well, actually, there have been a few little conditions.

337
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,520
We subgeniuses are no longer allowed to use fireworks after that explosion.

338
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,660
Or those explosions.

339
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,340
Those several times.

340
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,200
Several times.

341
00:18:50,540 --> 00:19:00,300
And we don't allow any bands using the name date rapists in the hot tub.

342
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,020
What, somebody made a crop circle with a lawnmower over there?

343
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,200
Well, don't believe the Grays.

344
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,120
They're not exes.

345
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,340
They're flying saucers.

346
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,680
Crash.

347
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,820
They make the kind that go wobbly and crash in New Mexico.

348
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:15,780
They're pathetic.

349
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,800
And they look like weather balloons if you look at them real close.

350
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,260
I just have to have a really, really loud...

351
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,120
I have to have a loud enough orgasm to reach that side of the field.

352
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,180
And I don't think I can do that.

353
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,680
Will you put a drink of what you want your cult members to drink?

354
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,300
I've got a whole...

355
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
He's got your drink.

356
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,440
Oh, he's got his.

357
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:33,920
Yeah, man.

358
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,940
He's got his drink.

359
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,840
Huh?

360
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,360
I need females.

361
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,200
All females I can get.

362
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,620
Mars needs women.

363
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,340
Okay, we need to get them to remember where we are.

364
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,000
So what I want you to do is to yell like this.

365
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,640
Yes, come!

366
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,340
Yes, come, yes!

367
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,280
Ready?

368
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes, come!

369
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,560
Yes, come!

370
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,800
Yes!

371
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,680
Keep going.

372
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,560
Yes, come.

373
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Yes, come!

374
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
Yes, come!

375
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:06,800


376
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,020
Yes, come!

377
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,320
Yes, come!

378
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,360
Yes, come!

379
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,340
That should get some attention.

380
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,940
Six fifty eight!

381
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,100
Okay, so that should...

382
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,600
I think that'll sit in there for a while.

383
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
I hope it works for something.

384
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,740
Yeah.

385
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,340
Yeah.

386
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,440
I'm gonna feel like a fucking maniac.

387
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,000
Stop it.

388
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,220
It's all going to burn, Doctor.

389
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,240
Doesn't that feel good knowing that this is the year?

390
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,940
It's all...

391
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,000
I really, I really believe it.

392
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,700
Well, no, they...

393
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Maybe the...

394
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,060
It's getting harder and harder to believe.

395
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,500
The ashes can be in themselves the genesis of...

396
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,120
a new form of existence.

397
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Ashes du ashes.

398
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,480
The...

399
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,000
Asses da asses, butts da butts.

400
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,120
For example, those who are familiar with the work of the alchemist Borelis, remember what he wrote in...

401
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,200
Borelis?

402
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,960
Arialis?

403
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:11,120
No, this was Giovanni di Borelli, who was Latinized to Borelis, but his specialty was

404
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,780
palinogenesis, or resuscitation from the ashes.

405
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:24,120
For a flower once burned could be, by his method, restored from the ashes.

406
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,340
Wow.

407
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,420
All the frop we've ever consumed could come back.

408
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,680
Have you ever thought about that?

409
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,520
All the things you ingested, how large a mass...

410
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,580
Yes, this huge towering pile of all the meat that you've ever eaten, which will confront

411
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,360
you one day.

412
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,420
But on the other hand, there are other things that you'll be more happy with.

413
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,840
Chocolate.

414
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,880
All the poop.

415
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,740
All the poop will come back.

416
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:44,760
All the poop.

417
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


418
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


419
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


420
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


421
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


422
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


423
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


424
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


425
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


426
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,760


427
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,200
No, no, no, that's going out, it's supposed to come back in.

428
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,720
Oh, no, no, it's like I never get what I wish for.

429
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,160
I wish for the chocolate, I know I'll get the poop.

430
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,020
But I'll think it's a chocolate, that's the main part.

431
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,140
One embraces the other.

432
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,960
One hand what?

433
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,120
As far as the equation of the chocolate and the poop are concerned.

434
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,260
I was trying to find the lyrics to that bluegrass spiritual I did.

435
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,980
Chocolate rain.

436
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,920
But it was about Bob and I can't find it.

437
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,980
There's one, there's one, there's one, there's an alien behind you.

438
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,940
Well, it's just a gray, it's not an exit.

439
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,140
Even the gray is, you know, a hoping for the world.

440
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:38,460
Yes, the rightness, the roundness, the firmness and fullness of the full development of time.

441
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,240
Time hath endless rarities and shows us that the world is not a place of the dead.

442
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,240


443
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,680
But it is a place of all varieties, which revealeth all things in heaven,

444
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,460
maketh new discoveries in earth, and even earth itself a discovery.

445
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,520
That great antiquity, America, lay in the earth a thousand years,

446
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,140
and a large part of the earth is still in the urn unto us.

447
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,160
Now, in your brochures that we give out,

448
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,720
you find the poem, The Night Before X Day, by Pope David Lee Black.

449
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,520
Which is your study assignment for the evening.

450
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
A bundle of sex toys he had in his pack.

451
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,480
Oh man, I knew better than to show him my back.

452
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,860
His eyes, how bloodshot, his nose, how hairy.

453
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,520
His breath smelled of whiskey, his demeanor was scary.

454
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,600
He drooled from his mouth and was white as the snow,

455
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,480
except for the black dots on his chin.

456
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,960
He was a one-man show.

457
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,700
The stump of a pipe he held tight.

458
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,860
He was tight in his teeth, and the froth-smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

459
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,440
He had a dotted face like it had been punctured with quills.

460
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,900
He was obviously high on a multitude of pills.

461
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,420
He was loaded and drunk, a right jolly old elf,

462
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,820
a narcissistic bastard stuck on himself.

463
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,180
With water in his eye and a twist of his head,

464
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh shit, I said to myself, I started to dread.

465
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,260
He bagged the whole thing, but went straight to his work,

466
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,160
taking all of my frat booze and money, what a jerk,

467
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,680
and laying his stinky finger aside of his nose,

468
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,560
and giving a nod out the tent flaps he rose.

469
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,860
He sprang to the Chevy to his team gave whip,

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,680
and away they all flew to an awaking spaceship.

471
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,100
As he drove out of sight, as I screamed, motherfucker,

472
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,360
he said, thanks for the money, see you next year, sucker.

473
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,400
Heh heh heh heh, that's a joke.

474
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,900
Heh heh heh heh, hee-oh.

475
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,220
Ahem, ahem, hee-ha, ah-ho.

476
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,140
And I thought my jokes were bad.

477
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,220
Three minutes, three minutes of cold feet.

478
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,980
Did you adjust for daylight savings time?

479
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,560
Three minutes left of shivering, I'm sure they have climate control aboard those things.

480
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,880
I mean, you know, they have the technology to destroy or create planets.

481
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,820
You'd think they'd have AC and heat.

482
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,880
God, I'm glad I brought extra shoes.

483
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,360
It's only one thing.

484
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:24,220
Now, someone, somebody here is the FBI agent that always has to watch these things.

485
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,720
You know, out of a token gesture.

486
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,900
What if they weren't here when they all committed suicide?

487
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,080
I'm sure that's Bucky.

488
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,720
Huh?

489
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,460
That's Bucky.

490
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,240
He's Canadian.

491
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,600
He's the first one I've actually been to.

492
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,480
That's Bucky.

493
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,380
That's bullshit.

494
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,080
No, they, somebody told me they draw straws.

495
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,840
Okay, we better.

496
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,540
Oh, fuck, only one minute.

497
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,840
Now, I don't have a second hand on this thing.

498
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,880
Rock solid alibis.

499
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,240
Who has a second hand on their watch?

500
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,540
I'm sure Modem has.

501
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:51,780
Anybody?

502
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,560
Walking around naked.

503
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,500
Oh, I can fake it.

504
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,880
Count down the remaining.

505
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,240
I'll say it's about one minute to go here.

506
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,000
It's a little creepy, actually, that.

507
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,300
One minute.

508
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,580
One minute!

509
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,920
Is it, what?

510
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,540
We're on 20 seconds over here, Asher.

511
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,340
Who's the time keeper?

512
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,960
Who is the, we always put it to the last minute to decide that.

513
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,980
Closest person with an actual clock.

514
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,120
That's a conspiracy time.

515
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,700
What have we got?

516
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,500
Ten seconds.

517
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,680
Oh my God.

518
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,000
What?

519
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,260
In New York.

520
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,220
In New York?

521
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,020
It's 7 AM!

522
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,840
Yeah!

523
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,420
It's 7 AM!

524
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,180
It's fucking.

525
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,040
Fuck them, it's so scary.

526
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,680
Oh.

527
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,240
Oh.

528
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,240
Ah.

529
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,480
Oh.

530
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,060
Oh.

531
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,560
Oh.

532
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:30,800


533
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:30,800


534
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,960


535
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,040


536
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,380
Oh.

537
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,480
Oh.

538
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,620


539
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,880
Oh.

540
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,860
Oh.

541
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,140
Oh.

542
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:35,840
Oh.

543
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,940
Oh.

544
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,420

549
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,680

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,340

553
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:44,720
by prefer merely to help you and to crack pepper for you uh to shine your shoes to to do anything

554
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,720
you're hard to find realistic and then you have to stick it together just as in real life but

555
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,200
oh man man this is great i am so glad that i am a saved subgenius

00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,520
As far as I'm concerned, you are the king.

563
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,440
Man, this is great.

564
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,020
This is just unbelievable.

565
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,020
I think somebody else wants to meet you.

566
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,600
I think Sammy Davis Jr. would like to sit down and have a word with you.

567
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,000
Hey, look, I'll see you later, man.

568
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,360
There's a little filly over there I want to talk to.

569
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,780
Hey, man, hang in there.

570
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,200
I love Bob.

571
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,040
Hey, Bob, thanks, Elvis.

572
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,000
Man.

573
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,220
God, this is just so...

574
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,660
Trevor, baby, Ivan Stang.

575
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
That's you, isn't it?

576
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,720
It's Trevor and Ivan Stang.

577
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,960
Ivan Stang, I'm a person with...

578
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,820
I just have my adenoids removed.

579
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,920
I have the wrong table.

581
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,040
Why?

582
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,800
You know, it's great being rich and famous and having...

583
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,260
It's only been, what, two hours since 7 a.m.

584
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,780
The rupture happened two hours ago, and already I'm stuffed in my face,

585
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,380
masturbated, met Elvis.

586
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,640
I've done all the things I never, ever did before.

587
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,900
And more 17?

588
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,560
Yes.

589
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,280
Oh, thank you, thank you.

590
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,820
Hey, what other celebrities are around?

591
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,140
Is Lenny Bruce happen to be on my planet?

592
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,560
I think Mr. Walsh is in the other room at the bar,

593
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,040
but I would go and then...

594
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,060
Oh, well, I'll have to...

595
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,160
Oh, don't bother.

596
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,720
Don't bother.

597
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,260
No, no, no.

598
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,640
Anything for your pleasure.

599
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,600
I'll take a few minutes.

600
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,220
Mr. Walsh!

601
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,440
Oh!

602
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,080
Fuck, didn't work.

603
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,020
Where are they?

604
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,480
Maybe...

605
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,900
He's getting drunk.

606
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,320
Now, that is from geosynchronous time or whatever they call it, right?

607
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,840
Oh, it's got its own built-in atomic clock.

608
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,080
That's his, ask him.

609
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,480
Yes, definitely.

610
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,480
Yep, okay.

611
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,360
7 a.m. has come and gone.

612
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,920
Oh, no.

613
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,080
Fuck.

614
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Damn it, Bob.

615
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,160
Why does this seem so familiar?

616
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,460
Maybe it's 7.05.

617
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,940
Once again.

618
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,260
7.05 and I'm here.

619
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,500
The reason you all get fucked is you're not getting fucked.

620
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,580
Well, we try...

621
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,180
Now, speak for yourself, honey.

622
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,660
Princess, we've been hard...

623
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,240
I've been hard at work all night.

624
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,480
Think about it.

625
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,880
At our age, that ain't easy.

626
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,560
Well, my age.

627
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,980
Look, if you two want to play bunnies, which is fine.

628
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,260
I'm not talking about you.

629
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,740
I'm talking about the rest of the group.

630
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,040
She's not the kind of person she's preaching to.

631
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,840
Wrong.

632
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,360
You know.

633
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,060
Damn.

634
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:01,960
Well...

635
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,360
Is that rock any dryer in this grass?

636
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,060
I'm not getting fucked.

637
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,880
I paid $30.

638
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,460
Well, hell.

639
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,640
Holy shit.

640
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,220
Well, if you paid $30, you already got fucked.

641
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,040
Now, you know, we have occasionally run into people who are actually honestly furious

642
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,300
that for $30 they didn't get to ride in a spaceship and destroy cities.

643
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
I mean, I'm...

644
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,180
They were really angry.

645
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,520
Really?

646
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,780
Really?

647
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,200
Really?

648
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,200


649
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,200


650
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,200


651
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,200


652
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,200


653
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,140
Now I am.

654
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,780
Really pissed.

655
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,060
Now I am.

656
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,380
After I sleep for about nine hours, I will wake up and I'll be so mad at you.

657
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,080
After coffee, probably some prop and maybe some booze, then, oh yeah.

658
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,100
Oh yeah.

659
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,440
Why did I drink this whole cup of coffee?

660
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm never going to be able to go back to sleep.

661
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,360
Oh, that works.

662
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,840
Then you can stalk everybody else.

663
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,640
I'll go to them.

664
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,920
Just in case anybody wondered, I don't have any special...

665
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't have any special statement because I always assume, you know, the best.

666
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,820
Although I got to admit, this is going to be a familiar scene.

667
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,320
It's funny though, there's more people every year.

668
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:14,740
When we drove down here about 45 minutes ago, there were only two people here and now probably

669
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,780
40 or so.

670
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,800
God, are we getting dumber?

671
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,940
Or are we getting more faithful?

672
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,460
Is our faith merely growing?

673
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,720
I hear the urge of Jesus in his voice.

674
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,560
Jesus.

675
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,580
Now you listen to me, boy.

676
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,620
Jesus is a fact.

677
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,140
You can't run away from Jesus.

678
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,360
No, you listen.

679
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,040
I come a long way since I'd believed in anything.

680
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,760
And I come halfway around the world.

681
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,660
You ain't come so far that you could keep from following me though, have you, boy?

682
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Some preacher's left his mark on you.

683
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,920
Did you follow me for me to take it off or to give you another one?

684
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, you know, once again, the important lesson Bob has taught us is that we don't

685
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,580
know when that hour shall come.

686
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,840
You know, so it could happen in the next five minutes.

687
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,400
Is that not so?

688
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,920
I mean, the world ends in a minute.

689
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:22,920


690
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:22,920


691
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,260
It's tomorrow.

692
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,260
It didn't say the world ends right now.

693
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,160
That first sentence in that first pamphlet, number one, published January 2nd, 1980, it

694
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,000
says the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

695
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,680
Well, that could be any tomorrow.

696
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,540
So I guess the point is you better be ready.

697
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm preaching a say if everybody here already paid their 30 bucks.

698
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,920
Isn't there supposed to be one guy here jumping up and down going, I told you to rip off.

699
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,500
I didn't pay my 30 bucks.

700
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,360
I snuck in.

701
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,120
Oh, this time it's motor Mac.

702
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,400
Folks, may I ask, please, if we could just be kind enough to take a moment, please, and

703
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,300
bow our heads, which we've not done yet.

704
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,980
And have ourselves just a moment, please, of silent sacred.

705
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,020
No.

706
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,700
I.

707
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,300
I.

708
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,220


709
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,180


710
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:19,640


711
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,020


712
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,180
I.

713
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,840
I.

714
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:30,080
I open up my whole sleeping dictionary, with the

715
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,940
rough road.

716
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:32,940


717
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,960
Ah, yes.

718
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,660
The year 2000.

719
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,120
The distant future.

720
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
The year 2000.

721
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh, that's better.

722
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
That was a long way back there.

723
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,400
There's no show in there.

724
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,400
Yeah, I didn't think so.

725
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,400
Show's over here, Doug.

726
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,260
Y2K.

727
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,780
Here I am.

728
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,700
We are robots.

729
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,500
Okay, good.

730
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,700
We're the robot versions of ourselves.

731
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,580
That's the really cool thing I was trying to tell you earlier.

732
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,020
Yeah, we're the automatons that just keep going,

733
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,920
even though our bodies have already left for X.

734
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,520
You know, for the outer world.

735
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,940
For the outer world.

736
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,460
We already left a long time ago.

737
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,860
That's why we keep going about this myth of X-Day.

738
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,200
But still, it's good.

739
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
Everything is so automated now.

740
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,360
We actually did leave.

741
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,580
Still, it's good, right, X-Day?

742
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,120
Yeah, we actually, our real Earthly cells actually did leave in 1998.

743
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,300
It's just our robot cells that continue on this illusion.

744
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,560
And here we are.

745
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,100
And this planet is Mars.

746
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,580
The humans are dead.

747
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,760
The humans are dead, and we're still here.

748
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,760
We're just robots.

749
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,260
Michael Jackson was a human.

750
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,860
It's too soon.

751
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,680
Yeah, they talked about Michael Jackson,

752
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,300
but what about Aliak Mark-Connor?

753
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,580
They look like they're dead.

754
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,800
I'll just confirm that they're dead.

755
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,380
Okay.

756
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,900
Bubbles is not dead.

757
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,200
Okay, here's the emotional part,

758
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,540
simply because I really,

759
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,760
really do want to thank everyone very much

760
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
for coming here to X-Day,

761
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,880
which for me is the best goddamn party of the year,

762
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,960
and I most certainly will be here next year.

763
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,740
How about you?

764
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,700
I am ready.

765
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,120
Because just think,

766
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,660
if not for this X-Day,

767
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,240
last week you would have been out there at your job,

768
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,380
but instead you are here waiting in the rain.

769
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,280
With your feet freezing.

770
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,900
Apparently it wasn't a dozen of them.

771
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,460
It was a must.

772
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,600
It was supposed to be a baker's dozen.

773
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,080
The rain's falling.

774
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,300
Thirteen.

775
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,260
Oh, yeah, Dr. Howell just mentioned,

776
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,180
apparently a dozen wasn't the magic number,

777
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,760
but a baker's dozen.

778
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,260
So X-Day 13, the lucky 13.

779
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,620
X-Day 12 was waiting for Bob.

780
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,340
Sad, sad.

781
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,600
But yet there is hope.

782
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,340
There is hope that X-Day may yet again be awaiting.

783
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,220
Could be ten minutes from now.

784
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,880
Could be.

785
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,240
Could be shuffling back.

786
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,880
To our little tents and rented big houses.

787
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,860
And suddenly be lifted up.

788
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,360
Ruptured.

789
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,820
Burst into flames.

790
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,840
Our spirits fly up into,

791
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,880
be captured in special jars on some silvery ship.

792
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,680
Metaphysical thing that only exists in certain dimensions.

793
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,580
Could be.

794
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,280
Could be.

795
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,040
You know, you just don't know yet.

796
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,240
Good gobs, man.

797
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,380
Maybe we need a new Jesus.

798
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,440
A Jesus like nobody's ever seen before.

799
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,400
Another thing we're missing that we haven't had in several years

800
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,880
is a proper crackpot with a sandwich board that says the end is nigh.

801
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,160
The end is nigh.

802
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,100
The end is nigh.

803
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,500
My toes are numb.

804
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,980
Does that mean they replaced my toes?

805
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,120
I thought the X's replaced the body part at a time.

806
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,480
Yeah.

807
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
Well, that's the other thing.

808
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,520
I mean, it's obvious.

809
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,520
It's becoming increasingly difficult to see the end of the body.

810
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:57,520


811
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:57,520


812
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,480
It's becoming increasingly obvious to some of us that the X's are taking a piece at a time.

813
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,260
In some of our cases, it's memory.

814
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,360
They're removing old memories, short-term memories.

815
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,500
Some of us, obviously, they're removing the morals and ethics.

816
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,340
Teeth.

817
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,180
Don't remove our memory.

818
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,640
I've lost, they took a lot of my hair off the top of my head.

819
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,960
Look at the dejected. They're already shuffling away.

820
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,520
They're already shuffling away.

821
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,500
Heads down.

822
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,080
Was it this cold when they threw you in the lake with the tarn?

823
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,460
Yes.

824
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,720
That's why my peener didn't look any bigger than that.

825
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:47,820
Also, you know, there's nothing like having, what was he, 800 primate eyes focused on you when you're naked.

826
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,080
And it's standing in that pond.

827
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,860
Did you ponder it?

828
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,960
We were swamped with ideas.

829
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,560
You can learn by buying the 1998 DVD at the Swag Shack.

830
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,860
You're a quick study, a quicksand study.

831
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,900
Surely he knows.

832
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,560
Yeah, we're sinking, sinking.

833
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,400
Yeah, that's the one thing we can be really, really thankful for this X-Day.

834
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,680
What's that?

835
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,440
No chicken head.

836
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,500
Wow.

837
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,840
Anybody who was here last year, you can't.

838
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,700
I cannot imagine.

839
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,200
Because we had that big fryer up there.

840
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,400
Oh my God, we should have just killed them.

841
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,140
Last year it was called the Curl.

842
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,120
We really seriously should have killed them.

843
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,860
I wonder if they tasted like chicken.

844
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,640
I walked up to Stang and said, Stang, can I kill them?

845
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,340
And he said, well, Pisces, I don't know.

846
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,940
More flesh for the barbecue.

847
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,820
Well, I didn't want to, I knew you'd be speaking in court under oath going, well, Reverend Stang said to go ahead and kill them.

848
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,180
No, it was General Soul.

849
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,380
It's the Manson defense.

850
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,880
I didn't kill them.

851
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,280
Reverend Soul.

852
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,240
You go to the top of them stairs and repent, boy, and renounce your sins and distribute these tracts to the people.

853
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,460
Come as clean as you are.

854
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,140
Vortication, blasphemy, what else?

855
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,340
If I was in sin, I was in it before I ever committed any.

856
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,880
There ain't no change coming me.

857
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,640
I don't believe in sin.

858
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,920
Nothing matters but that Jesus don't exist.

859
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,160
Go distribute them tracts to the people.

860
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,760
I'll take them up there and throw them in the bushes.

861
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,180
You be watching.

862
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,740
See, can you see?

863
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:49,820
If the Exes had gotten here nine months ago when everything tanked, they would have come in and seen that the anguish level would have been off the meter.

864
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,700
That's true.

865
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,400
And it would have been a tankless job.

866
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,720
Oh, no.

867
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,540
Well, they live, you know, for them, human anguish is a drug.

868
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,540
I mean, they would have gotten such a buzz off the anguish level.

869
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,160
They're feeling rather anguished right now.

870
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,880
Maybe that's exactly what they're doing.

871
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,420
But then they elected Obama, and all of a sudden there was just so much simpering hope.

872
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,400
Oh, yeah.

873
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,480
Oh, that hope makes me sick.

874
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,380
I'm sure that they did come near, and Bob had to do some serious tap dancing.

875
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,080
To say, no, no, no, we're going to get it up, come back next year.

876
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,400
So, yeah, it's Barack Obama's fault.

877
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,560
I told you.

878
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,020
He's the anti-Bob.

879
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,360
But, no, he's got Bob in his name.

880
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:38,780
Yeah.

881
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,220
Beat Obama.

882
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,300
Yeah, but he's the anti-Bob.

883
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,580
The ears tell you.

884
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,600
And the lack of a pipe is the main thing.

885
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,340
Exactly.

886
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,900
He's got some of the dots.

887
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,280
Yeah.

888
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,080
Sleepers, it's all your fault.

889
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Faceless ones.

890
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Yeah, right.

891
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,100
They're the smart ones.

892
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,280
Kill them.

893
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,760
Where is he?

894
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,680
Slaughter them for the warmth inside of their bodies.

895
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:06,760
Yes.

896
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,000
Yes, choose the most important.

897
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,240
I shouldn't have drank that cup of coffee.

898
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,180
Let us wrap ourselves in their intestines to warm up.

899
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,860
Yes.

900
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,260
Yeah, those were the days.

901
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,300
Intestinal fortitude would be our...

902
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,480
They're not properly making use of the heat.

903
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,580
Yes.

904
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,000
God, slaughter them.

905
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,400
And slaughter them.

906
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,380
It takes a very...

907
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,000
Man.

908
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,520
Their dicks and their appendix in that order.

909
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,360
We lost them.

910
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,100
Yes.

911
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,580
Well, you know what?

912
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,560
The affidavit is...

913
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,940
This has got to be like the absolute worst stand-up comedy venue anybody could ever dream

914
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,320
up.

915
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:47,760
Oh, as Jesus used to say every 645, somebody had to say it was going to be 7 a.m., 1998.

916
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,760
As if it was up to me.

917
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,300
I always give...

918
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,880
As a cannibal boy, I used to say, I just worked for the tips.

919
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,300
Jehovah One told Bob it was going to be 7 a.m., 1998.

920
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,060
Now, you know, what are you going to do?

921
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,220
Disbelieve Bob and Jehovah One?

922
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,380
Again?

923
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,220
Yes.

924
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,080
And again, and again, and again?

925
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,140
It's a broken record.

926
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,340
Well, we've been...

927
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,080
Maybe they have the time...

928
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,440
We've certainly been faithful.

929
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,760
True or dumb?

930
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,920
You've been faithful.

931
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,900
I've been faithful.

932
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,360
My hands are just like that.

933
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,780
Faithful of faithful.

934
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,060
You know who's not here?

935
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,680
Come on.

936
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,800
Susie the floozy.

937
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,780
Susie the floozy.

938
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,620
Susie the floozy.

939
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,320
That's what I...

940
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,880
That's like...

941
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,480
There's a Susie the floozy shaped hole in my crotch.

942
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,700
We forgot.

943
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,760
Her cleavage was supposed to bring them in.

944
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,040
That's what they cite in there.

945
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,560
Well, maybe that's why she stayed away this time.

946
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,140
Maybe she thought it was scaring them.

947
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,840
Cleave unto others.

948
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,220
Cleave unto others.

949
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,040
I hope she didn't just lose faith.

950
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,680
Huh?

951
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,980
Maybe she lost faith.

952
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,660
Maybe she lost her costume.

953
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,660
Maybe she lost her costume.

954
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:50,660


955
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,700
Usually she...

956
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,700
Usually at about 6.59 Susie suddenly appears in some outlandish something.

957
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,820
Handing out something.

958
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,480
Yeah.

959
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,520
Yeah.

960
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:01,980
Yeah.

961
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,900
I almost feel like I cheated because I'm not getting my Susie the floozy special surprise

962
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,120
package.

963
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,980
Lift her up in her tent.

964
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,860
Throw her up and down like Mickey Mouse.

965
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,380
Last year she had little sacks for every single person that showed up and they all had uncannily

966
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,280
apt surprises in them.

967
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,240
But mine had a t-shirt that said,

968
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,900
No Purple!

969
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,920
Something in the house that was unusual.

970
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,140
They all seemed like they'd been carefully selected yet they were randomly handed out.

971
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,020
But no presents this year.

972
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,700
There wasn't nothing in her stocking for X day but switches and ashes.

973
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:41,880
Again.

974
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,660
We've done it before.

975
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,060
We'll do it again.

976
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,960
We'll do it again.

977
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,460
And again and again.

978
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:48,920
Yes.

979
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,220
Apparently again and again.

980
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,780
Again and again.

981
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,760
Power up the sonic.

982
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,660
But you know, by God, just to spite them I'll be here next year.

983
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,420
Just to spite them.

984
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,020
It's a disease.

985
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,020


986
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,020
It's a gan-a-rea.

987
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,700
A gan-a-rea.

988
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:11,020
We'll by golly, we'll let those normal people and pagans laugh at us.

989
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,220
Let those Discordians have their fun.

990
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,800
Ha.

991
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:14,780
Yeah.

992
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,600
Yeah.

993
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,160
Wouldn't the Discordians have a cool.

994
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,180
Yeah.

995
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,180


996
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,980
Convention that causes everybody to get up at 7 in the morning.

997
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,400
Yeah.

998
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,200
Freeze their asses off.

999
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,040
Yeah.

1000
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,640
Damn.

1001
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,680
Oh well.

1002
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,140
He does.

1003
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,500
He has an appointment today.

1004
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,080
What kind of jackass schedules an appointment on X day?

1005
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,480
Stop what you're doing everybody.

1006
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,440
I didn't expect it.

1007
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,020
This is the best day to make an appointment.

1008
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:48,200
Well it's been pointed out that why would, you know, god-like aliens necessarily use

1009
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,880
the same calendar and.

1010
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,860
I was just going to say.

1011
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,140
You know, I mean everything we do is because we have ten hands and ten fingers and ten

1012
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,540
toes.

1013
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,840
Well some of us.

1014
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,440
Some have ten hands.

1015
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,160
Two nuts and one dick.

1016
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,360
Some of us.

1017
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,480
And.

1018
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,320
Yeah.

1019
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,000
Damn.

1020
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,680
What about us who have two dicks?

1021
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,100
Come on.

1022
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,840
You know so we can't, we can't expect the god-like aliens to go by some time table.

1023
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,860
Another god-like alien told some salesman.

1024
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1025
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1026
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1027
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1028
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1029
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1030
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1031
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1032
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1033
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1034
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,860


1035
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,240
Could you work in that Elder Goats?

1036
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,980
In 1953.

1037
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,640
We had a long time to plan this party.

1038
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,920
You'd think it would be a better party.

1039
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,420
Oh well.

1040
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,000
I like, I like that sign that says fat free.

1041
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,100
It's like the whole.

1042
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,000
The whole.

1043
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,820
It's also saucer free.

1044
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,320
It's a little slack free.

1045
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,280
They ought to change their name to slack free.

1046
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:48,820
Yeah.

1047
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:49,840
It's a little slag free.

1048
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840


1049
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840


1050
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840


1051
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840


1052
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840


1053
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:49,840


1054
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,100
When he told me he would give me four hours and three percent.

1055
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,100


1056
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,100


1057
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,220
Could I

1058
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:02,700
OK why'd you say l charComment.

1059
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:14,800
Ah Should I just say like.

1060
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,220
black confusion, sitting in silence, listening to nothing.

1061
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,800
That's loneliness.

1062
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,100
That's loneliness.

1063
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,460
That's the most frightening thing I've ever felt.

1064
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,720
Hey, thanks for giving out the rest of those aliens.

1065
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,840
Ouch!

1066
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,820
That was Fat Free of Brooklyn, live at 12X Day,

1067
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:07,340
and more such as studio CDs can be had via FatFreeBand.com.

1068
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,120
Earlier, we heard clips from the classic movie Wise Blood,

1069
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,320
some 12X Day live hour of slack from on stage,

1070
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,800
some puzzling evidence on KPFA Berkeley with church co-sub founder Dr. Philo Drummond

1071
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,120
of QuiveringBrain.com,

1072
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,480
and even some of the amino acids from TheAminoAcids.com.

1073
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,160
Incidentally, the music in the background right now

1074
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,960
is from their friends in the band Free Cake,

1075
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,280
also recorded live at X Day.

1076
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:40,220
But now, back in time, we go again to July 5th, 2009, conspiracy time,

1077
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,520
about 7.30 a.m. at Brushwood,

1078
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,700
with the subgeniuses of...

1079
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,600
what turned out to be the 12X Day drill.

1080
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs, I swear.

1081
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,860
Huh? What?

1082
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,780
If you move...

1083
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,060
There he goes, right there.

1084
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,660
On your shirt, on your sleeve,

1085
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,020
it's the silhouette of J.R. Bob Dobbs, right there.

1086
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,160
The shadow.

1087
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
That's that guy's head.

1088
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,360
I don't think...

1089
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,280
I must be...

1090
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,320
Way to be a good buzzkill.

1091
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,360
Well, like he wasn't going to notice it's his head.

1092
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,480
He's two feet away from him.

1093
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,660
Hey, look, it could be worse.

1094
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,420
We could all be wearing identical shirts and have little plastic pipes,

1095
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:14,780
and I'm...

1096
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,180
It'd be that lame.

1097
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,960
That's a good idea for next year.

1098
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,120
Well, I'll wear the same shoes.

1099
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,200
Those Heaven's Gate apples.

1100
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,900
Actually, somebody did suggest,

1101
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,940
there were so many people with those black shirts with the Bob thing on,

1102
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,040
we should do a photo op,

1103
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,180
to really look nerdy.

1104
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,040
You know?

1105
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,860
Where it was like all these geeks with the same shirts and glasses.

1106
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,520
I think we've already come uncomfortably close to that.

1107
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,080
Don't let the motion...

1108
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,480
Yeah, let's not make it any worse.

1109
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,760
Grass was...

1110
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,440
It wasn't so wet.

1111
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,980
I'd suggest we all lie down and do a Heaven's Gate.

1112
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,240
But the grass is too wet.

1113
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,080
And we don't have the right drugs.

1114
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:52,700
Yeah, beds.

1115
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,600
Let's go to bed.

1116
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,960
I mean, I didn't bring enough Valium and vodka for that.

1117
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,880
But, the Valium and vodka does sound good right about now.

1118
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,300
Yeah.

1119
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,320
Their system of oppression.

1120
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,240
What did it lead to?

1121
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,960
I like that show, Life After People,

1122
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,600
because all the humans are dead.

1123
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,380
The pinks, the pinks fried in their...

1124
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,800
In their own juices, and that was what was left.

1125
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,080
Or, or Twilight, all the people are dead.

1126
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,360
Or 2012.

1127
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,120
Man, it was so great.

1128
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,200
It's just like the...

1129
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,400
A lot of times their brains, like mine included,

1130
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,400
turns into pudding.

1131
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,280
It's usually, mine usually turns into vanilla, I've found.

1132
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,080
Vanilla pudding.

1133
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,460
I would bet somebody like we, for example,

1134
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,620
would probably turn into a pistachio pudding.

1135
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,580
So their brain turns into pudding,

1136
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,260
and if you can find the little hinge,

1137
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,280
you can go in and have a few bites of it.

1138
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,840
Pretty tasty stuff.

1139
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,120
I thought that's what you were keeping the spoons for.

1140
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,640
You got my mouth watering now.

1141
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,620
You just gotta find the person when they're right in,

1142
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,400
at the right flavor.

1143
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,380
You gotta find that hinge.

1144
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,720
I have trouble finding it myself.

1145
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,580
You're probably just about ripe.

1146
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,360
Yeah, I'm about ready.

1147
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,860
Yep, yep, I can hear it ring in there.

1148
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,720
Yep, it's about ready.

1149
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,680
I've got pure oatmeal in here.

1150
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,660
Oatmeal?

1151
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,440
Pure.

1152
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,740
Is that your secret?

1153
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,140
Nothing but oatmeal.

1154
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,160
Nothing but oatmeal?

1155
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,420
I usually get pudding more than anything else.

1156
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,640
In here, it's turtles all the way down.

1157
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,200
Like this guy, for example, if you look,

1158
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,100
you see right here?

1159
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,040
Right through there?

1160
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:20,700
Uh-huh.

1161
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,540
See where the hinge starts?

1162
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure enough.

1163
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,740
I bet even he didn't notice that before.

1164
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,600
No, no, no, he's never been eaten before.

1165
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
Only your hair has been eaten, for sure.

1166
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,840
He hasn't.

1167
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,340
He hasn't.

1168
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,160
You can tell.

1169
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,000
He's got a good seam and a match on it all the way across.

1170
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,820
I'll have my monkey brains well done, Bob said.

1171
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,840
You know, I'm figuring he's probably, actually,

1172
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,720
he looks like he's got white chocolate.

1173
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,320
Mmm.

1174
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,820
Mmm.

1175
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:43,820


1176
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,080
That's a really rare option.

1177
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,960
That's only one way to find out.

1178
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,420
Yeah, we'll have to catch him later.

1179
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,980
I say get him in the sun for just about an hour a little bit later.

1180
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,660
I've got a screwdriver.

1181
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,820
Careful, man.

1182
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,160
He's high.

1183
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,760
I've got a Swiss army knife.

1184
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,800
Well, I've got a knife in my pocket, but I hate damaging those hinges that way, but,

1185
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,440
you know, it's just the way it is.

1186
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,580
Well, how's the Kool-Aid?

1187
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,260
Jesus calls you.

1188
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,540
Jesus calls you.

1189
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,240
Hey, looky down yonder.

1190
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,300
Did you see that blind man down there?

1191
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,820
He's giving out tracks and begging for money.

1192
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:13,820


1193
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:13,820


1194
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:13,820


1195
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,360
Jesus, you ought to see him, and he's got this here ugly child.

1196
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,760
I mean, you better get on the other side, lady.

1197
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,140
There's a fool down there giving out tracks.

1198
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,620
Don't pay no attention to that fanatic up there.

1199
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,040
Don't I know what exists and what don't?

1200
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,380
Ain't I got eyes in my head?

1201
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,120
Am I a blind man?

1202
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,360
Let me tell you something.

1203
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,260
Maybe you think that you ain't clean because you don't believe.

1204
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,140
Every one of you are clean.

1205
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,800
And I'll tell you why.

1206
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:50,060
If you think it's because of Jesus Christ crucified, you're wrong.

1207
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,320
I ain't saying he wasn't crucified, but I say it wasn't for you.

1208
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,700
I'm gonna start a new church.

1209
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:04,900
The church approved without Jesus Christ crucified, and it won't cost you nothing to join my church.

1210
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,320
It ain't started yet, but it's gonna be.

1211
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,860
I don't need Jesus.

1212
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,720
What do I need Jesus for?

1213
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,780
I got love.

1214
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,220
I got a wife.

1215
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,500
He got a wife.

1216
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,280
Well, that's another.

1217
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,980
Lagume is never here.

1218
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,860
He's never been at one of these 7am deals.

1219
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,260
He probably thinks he's being smart.

1220
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,540
Wait a minute.

1221
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,920
Man, is he wrong.

1222
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,020
Yeah, right.

1223
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,680
Well, yeah, 98 was the last one for about 500 people.

1224
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,860
It was half of our church business dropped off after 98.

1225
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,820
Which indicates something real scary if you think about it.

1226
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,780
People actually thought it was gonna happen.

1227
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,100
Well, we all thought it was going to happen, but they were disappointed that it didn't happen.

1228
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,900
It was like they didn't see the whole point.

1229
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,100
That Bob was giving us time to appreciate what we have.

1230
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,440
You know, we can sleep when we die.

1231
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,500
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1232
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,060
Yeah, he's teaching us to appreciate life.

1233
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure of that.

1234
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,280
It must be that.

1235
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,820
Bob is teaching us whether we're smart fellas or fart smellers.

1236
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,880
Speaking of which...

1237
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,360
Appreciate life, huh?

1238
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:23,300
Is he also teaching us to appreciate miserable, sucky, shitty things?

1239
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,940
Actually, you may have a point there.

1240
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,920
I mean, what's the point?

1241
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,540
I mean, I understand the intention of the good, but I mean...

1242
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:36,700
Well, if we can get slack out of doing this, by God, we can get slack out of anything.

1243
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,560
Yeah, you make a point.

1244
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,780
And we're laughing.

1245
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,400
Well, you and me are, anyway.

1246
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,040
Well, you know, laughing sort of like...

1247
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,300
You got paid to.

1248
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:49,600
I mean, it's sort of that mental illness sort of hospital kind of laugh, though.

1249
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,740
Yeah, oh well.

1250
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,120
That's better than those jerks with their snickery laugh.

1251
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,480
Their ha-ha, look at those kooks that think they were going to get ruptured every year.

1252
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,240
That's what kills me are the ones...

1253
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,840
The people on the internet that go,

1254
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,580
You're so dumb.

1255
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,840
You thought them saucers were going to come.

1256
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,280
You know what the answer to that is?

1257
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,120
You're stooped.

1258
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,000
And then they spell stupid wrong.

1259
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,140
Right, and the answer to that is, is that I'm sorry you feel that way, sir, but I'm getting laid.

1260
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,160
That was my favorite response.

1261
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,320
Princess Wee and I did the Numa Numa takeoff.

1262
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,600
Yes.

1263
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,940
Which, by definition, you know, what could be stupider?

1264
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,780
So some...

1265
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,100
One of the first comments,

1266
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,520
This is stooped.

1267
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:31,980
Lol.

1268
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,640
Yeah.

1269
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,660
Yeah.

1270
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,600
That sums up the...

1271
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,120
The internet.

1272
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,480
It's like, gee, thanks for letting us know.

1273
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,120
Oh, hi.

1274
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,440
Frankly, it was the stupidest thing on the internet at that time, I thought.

1275
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,140
That's what we were shooting for anyway.

1276
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:49,640
And that's a talent.

1277
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,640
You know what's really awful is to have somebody walk up to you and go,

1278
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,600
You're those Numa Numa guys.

1279
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,300
That happened at a text day.

1280
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,680
They didn't even know we were, you know, important subgenius officials.

1281
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,280
All they knew is we were the Numa Numa guys.

1282
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,440
Alfred E. Numa.

1283
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,160
Alfred E. Numa.

1284
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,780
You know, you can't live forever.

1285
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,940
And you can't keep getting away with this kind of crap forever.

1286
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,300
Oh, now it's scapegoating time.

1287
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,220
I'll just hide behind this here fella.

1288
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,300
But that hat.

1289
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:26,680
You can't hide from Bob behind a funny hat, Dr. Dark.

1290
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:32,500
But you, the listener, can hide from boredom and pinkness with Bob at subgenius.com,

1291
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,440
online home of Church of the Subgenius and this radio show, The Hour of Slack.

1292
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,760
That's subgenius.com.

1293
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,920
Or P.O.

1294
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,380
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1295
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,960
And now we go back very briefly to X Day Drill 2009 and one final startling message about the Xists.

1296
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,860
They came and left.

1297
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,420
They said we were one short.

1298
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,020
Only one short.

1299
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,500
They said we were one short?

1300
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:00,900
Yeah.

1301
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,360
Goddamn, Suzy's never going to hear the end of this one.

1302
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,580
One short.

1303
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:07,940
Wait a minute.

1304
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,000
I hope they meant person.

1305
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:09,600
Not text.

1306
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,940
I think so.

1307
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,920
Yes, I did.

1308
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,640
I'm like, look at that boob.

1309
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,220
I don't know.

1310
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:20,680
They did a scan and there was an odd number of testicles, so they took off again.

1311
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,680
That was a bad omen.

1312
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,280
We must find another one-testicle match.

1313
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,860
I've got a jackknife.

1314
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,020
You volunteers?

1315
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,740
Take a two-testicle man in.

1316
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,240
That's what I was going to say.

1317
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,400
You volunteering?

1318
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,200
Seriously, there's no conspiracy.

1319
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,780
There's just one lone nut.

1320
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,440
Yeah.

1321
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,480
I don't know.

1322
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,500
Will we make it to the end of the tape?

1323
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,780
Maybe the Xists run on sexual-

1324
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,860
That's when they'll show up.

1325
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,400
That's when Bigfoot will run down the road.

1326
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,000
The Loch Ness Monster will jump out of a pond.

1327
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,020
Somebody will spontaneously combust.

1328
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,780
The tape just spontaneously combusted.

1329
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,500
Okay.

1330
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:08,420
Well, I have another one in my pocket, but I think that's a cue for us to do the right

1331
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:08,420


1332
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,080
thing and go pass out.

1333
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,720
And then there's the horrible theory that the sub gene that everything went wrong in

1334
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,740
the original 1998 and we're stuck in a loop where for all eternity it will be 7 o'clock

1335
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,520
in the morning when nothing has happened.

1336
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,120
Forever and ever and ever.

1337
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,780
And then there's the horrible theory that the sub gene that everything went wrong in

1338
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,420
the original 1998 and we're stuck in a loop where for all eternity it's 7 o'clock in the

1339
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,420


1340
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,420


1341
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,420


1342
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,420


1343
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,580
o'clock in the morning and nothing has happened forever and ever and ever and then there's the

1344
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:51,020
horrible theory that the sub-gene that everything went wrong in the original 1998 we're stuck in a

1345
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:56,560
mirror for all eternity it's seven o'clock in the morning and nothing is happening

1346
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,940
we're telling you

1347
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:16,560
they come down in flying

1348
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:17,960
yes

1349
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:33,060
the blood is running and the lights were fading and they stopped
