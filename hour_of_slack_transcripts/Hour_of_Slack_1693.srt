00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm poorer and still in debt.

00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:11,760
Pope Francis writes that hundreds of Catholic priests gathered in Pennsylvania to complete the annual Catholic sexual abuse pilgrimage.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,940
This pilgrimage is a religious duty. All able-bodied Catholics who can afford it should perform sexual abuse at a sex resort in Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:31,080
The Pope writes that no effort must be spared to stop a PR News from occurring, but also to stop the possibility of it being covered up and perpetuated.

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,180
The Dow is 10-25-7-80-5-15-2.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,120
President Trump is continuing to denounce PR News at a sex resort in North Korea.

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,420
Trump says you're listening to PR News from Washington.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,960
President Trump says PR News is greasy.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,280
I don't know what on earth you're talking about.

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,820
Yes.

You bet.

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,380
What does that mean?

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:34,320
Some water over the docks can't really get high.

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:45,620
Some water over the docks can't really get high.

23
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,380
Fuck dogs.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,080
Fuck dogs.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,780
Fuck dogs.

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,460
Fuck dogs.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,540


28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,900
Fuck dogs.

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,480
Fuck dogs.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,200
Fuck dogs.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,080
Fuck dogs.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,140
Fuck dogs.

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,140


34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:08,300
Warning, warning, warning.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,100
You are now listening to the The Self-Genius Broadcast.

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,200
Come out of your homes.

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,200
Unlock your cars.

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,020
Quit your job.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,720
Eat the nippers!

40
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,460
Stop all unnecessary productions!

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,000
Stop voting for them!

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,480
And no matter what,

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,820
Please, stop!

The American Dream is dead.

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,340
The American Dream is dead.

47
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,860
The American Dream is dead.

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,480
The American Dream is dead.

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,060
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

50
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,640
I am the truth.

51
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,440
Hey, you, baby, you don't know how bad it's gonna get.

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,820
If you think shit sucks now, you ain't seen nothing yet.

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,860
Because it doesn't get better unless you're pretty.

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,620
It doesn't get better.

55
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,160
Unless you've got money.

56
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,740
It doesn't get better.

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
So just give up.

58
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,980
It never gets better.

59
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,460
Ah!

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,460
Thanks to Cool Hand Chris for the collages.

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,840
And now, this.

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,700
Dave, it's a week out.

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,980
Uh, Dave.

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
Why are you crying?

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,780
What?

66
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,180
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,200
Hold on just a sec.

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
Keep talking.

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
Keep talking.

70
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,460
Keep talking.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
Oh, good, I can hear you.

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,960
Good.

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,020
That's very good.

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,700
Keep immobulating.

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,220
And don't always, remember, forget the little old doctor in the All Quiet on the Western Front story?

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,160
I don't remember that one.

77
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,200
Well, he urged his child to all become war heroes for the fatherland, you know?

78
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,720
Uh-huh.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,480
Which I guess is a place somewhere near, uh...

80
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,720
Hunks upon your centerline.

81
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,240
Who's just being a good father?

82
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,860
Yeah, a good father like, spelled like Fuhrer.

83
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah.

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,620
March through your doom, kiddies.

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,960
You know, he'd give him a big fat lollipop and a spoon to string on while he was marching him off to wars.

86
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,640
Boy, it's a good thing that would never happen nowadays in our modern country.

87
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
Everybody's so smart now.

88
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,640
They would never be suckered in by a bunch of big mouth politicians.

89
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,700
Right.

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,180
Like waving flags and holy books.

91
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,100
Yeah.

92
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,920
With holes in them.

93
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,660
That's, this, we've really evolved very far.

94
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,280
I mean, I haven't waved a Bible in a while now.

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,080
At least, a few weeks or something like that, I've not waved one single Bible.

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,120
I've got about 40 versions of it on the wall behind me.

97
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,340
It used to be my father's bookcase, and I kept most of his books because he had all these Bibles.

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
And, uh...

99
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,860
An equal number of books about how the real history of the Bible and how it came to be written and what it is, which is a book.

100
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,860
And I think we know where books come from, because...

101
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,540
They come from numerous a-holes.

102
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,140
Yeah.

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,560
Yeah, we know how to do that.

104
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,440
We've done that ourselves.

105
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,300
We've made books.

106
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,980
We've even made holy books with holes in them.

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,800
Yeah, big fat ones.

108
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,060
Especially in the logical part.

109
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,880
Yeah.

110
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,120
But that's all good.

111
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,060
That's all good, because now we can start.

112
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:09,300
Oh, you were everybody who's hatin' on the same thing I'm hatin' on these days.

113
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,140
I have a new all-encompassing hate.

114
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,820
It's a...

115
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,020
It's a...

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,840
It's a...

117
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,640
It's a specific part of the conspiracy that I like to call chronic, horrible, debilitating diseases.

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,240
Because lately, they've been giving a whole lot of my friends a lot of trouble and death.

119
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:40,300
I've heard of so many new diseases recently, even advertised on television and the radio, which are, you know...

120
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,620
Oh, the hell they tell.

121
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,640
They have their...

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,720
They'll give you a good...

123
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,280
They'll give you a good deal on new diseases now.

124
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,100
New and improved.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,680
Yeah.

126
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,840
New antibiotic antibiotics that kill existing antibiotics.

127
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,180
I couldn't believe the tone of it.

128
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,820
There was a kid running with a balloon, and like, kind of not older, but middle-aged woman

129
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,200
riding a bicycle with a big smile on her face.

130
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,000
I guess it's supposed to make me happy that I don't have zynocanthus solia, or metapartus

131
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,760
mergulia, or any of the other diseases described in the doctor's...

132
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,200
Well, you know what's really horrible?

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,460
Is that's not a bunch of hooey.

134
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,460
And they aren't new diseases.

135
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,060
They've just been better identified as such.

136
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:38,940
How successful is it, Dave?

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,800
It's probably cheaper.

138
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,920
It's cheaper.

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,880
And it generally works because they still go by the red lantern theory.

140
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,020
Uh-huh.

141
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,100
If you don't heal somebody, you're going to have to hang a red lantern on the other side

142
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,680
of your window.

143
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,240
Meaning don't go there.

144
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,000
You get too many red lanterns, you get kind of a reputation for being a killer.

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,360
You know what I mean?

146
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,860
Are you talking about modern China?

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,460
Yeah, I was going to say...

148
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,080
No, modern China, I will talk about Mao, who sent his many, many minions out into the countryside.

149
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,300
To try to stamp out this superstitious Chinese medicine.

150
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,900
And there are enough centenarians to convince him that maybe there's something in ancient Chinese medicine.

151
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:32,420
And so he let it thrive and flourish along with Western medicine, which was the one that everybody takes.

152
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,680
Well, why not both?

153
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,900
Well, that's kind of what Mao proposed.

154
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,120
But you wouldn't want to say you're a communist by agreeing with Mao.

155
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,660
Well, that's all getting pretty confused.

156
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:44,820
Yeah.

157
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,020
Because these days, it's like half of the Americans are on the side of the communist Russians.

158
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:57,780
And more Koreans, just because, you know, the God-King-Emperor is buddies with them.

159
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,180
So therefore, you know, all is forgotten.

160
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,220
That man is so silly, he makes me want to cry sometimes.

161
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,700
But back to these diseases.

162
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,960
That's a disease, you know, but that's a chronic debilitating disease.

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,440
He's crying over...

164
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,160
Political leaders?

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,920
No.

166
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,100
The present administration is a chronic debilitating disease.

167
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
A blight.

168
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,940
A cancer upon democracy, as they say.

169
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,380
But this is a comedy show, so none of that stuff's real.

170
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,740
So that's just all part of the show.

171
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,220
And it was just all part of the show 20 years ago.

172
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,100
That was a joke.

173
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,860
That couldn't really happen.

174
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,700
Yeah, it's really weird how prophecy mimics reality.

175
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,140
What's that phrase?

176
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,360
What's that phrase again?

177
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,100
Truth becomes artistic.

178
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,900
Bob was right.

179
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,060
Bob prophesied the whole thing.

180
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,900
All of it.

181
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,980
He said, and I quote,

182
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,740
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

183
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,920
Bob said that back in the 50s.

184
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,080
Maybe the 60s, because they weren't saying bummer in the 50s.

185
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,440
Well, he could have been out of temporal space and time as usual again.

186
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
What do you make of that quote?

187
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,220
He hung around with beatniks.

188
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,040
Or rather, beatniks hung around...

189
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,900
All the Marines had that phrase for a long time.

190
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,120
Beatniks hung around with them.

191
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,780
Bob is more like it.

192
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,420
But so did billionaires.

193
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
Why not both?

194
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,020
We've always...

195
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,060
Well, we didn't always say that, but we do now,

196
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,760
because it seems to work for just about everything.

197
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,700
Why not chiggers and mosquitoes?

198
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,000
Right.

199
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,960
Why not lederhosen and skringer belts or cougar belts?

200
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,320
Yeah.

201
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,740
Why not crippling heat, then crippling rain?

202
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,600
Exactly.

203
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,100
Whether a drought so hot that if you step outside,

204
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,480
you just instantly burst into flames.

205
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,600
Without...

206
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,880
Without a space suit, practically.

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:57,220
And then if not that, then it has to then otherwise be floods and mud that makes it impossible

208
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,520
to clean anything ever.

209
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,040
So why not both?

210
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,960
Can't we have both at the same time?

211
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,480
Let the devil beat his wife so it's hot, but it's raining.

212
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,480
For a clear blue sky.

213
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,600


214
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,960
Maybe raining frogs and little harmless snakes.

215
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,680
I've seen frog rains.

216
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,980
I didn't want to diminish what you were just saying.

217
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,580
Did you really?

218
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,540
It's very true.

219
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,180
There's no...

220
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,280
I think out of 30 days of...

221
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,420
30 days in a month, 29 days are bad weather,

222
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,920
and there's only one day that, you know,

223
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,340
it's 75 degrees with a low of 69.

224
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,500
We finally had that day today.

225
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,460
It was drizzling a lot.

226
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,400
The dogs and I still went out of...

227
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I thought it burst into flames again down there near Dallas.

228
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,160
No, no, we're having a rainstorm.

229
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,100
There's actually flooding in the other areas in North Texas,

230
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,180
not where we are,

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,860
because this place is under an Indian curse.

232
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,720
It keeps the rain away most of the time.

233
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,780
But we had four inches just in the last couple of days.

234
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,780
You sure you weren't just talking about your molasses dipper there

235
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,300
when you said we had four inches?

236
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,540
Why not both?

237
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,820
Yeah, I mean, sure.

238
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,280
Sure, that's about it.

239
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,900
Yeah.

240
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,180
Four, yeah, that's about the best I can do at my age.

241
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,300
Of course, I can't find half of it.

242
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,440
It's rolled under a couch or something.

243
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,260
Well, then that means you're a potential eight,

244
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,000
just like our glorious leader.

245
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,520
What's his name, Fritzie?

246
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,120
Mushroom President Shroompecker.

247
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,960
Yeah, President Shroompecker.

248
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,860
But that's another artist's quote that we won't...

249
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,660
We don't want to...

250
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,340
No, that phrase...

251
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,800
...haven't done anything.

252
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,460
Three days ago,

253
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,000
when I got up in the morning,

254
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,840
or whenever it was,

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,940
and I looked at the news on my phone,

256
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,520
and the first thing I saw was

257
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,360
the comparison of the president's equipment

258
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,460
to a character from the game Mario Kart.

259
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,840
And I know exactly what little mushroom head...

260
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,300
He's a little mushroom guy.

261
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,720
And I thought, okay, that's the...

262
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,280
She said it wasn't freakishly small.

263
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,520
But it was freakish

264
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,520
because of that mushroom-y kind of...

265
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,820
Yeah.

266
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,680
You know, bulbous, overly gross thing.

267
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,260
And the first thing I thought was Shroompecker.

268
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,400
I would find that very physically satisfying,

269
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,980
that type of bulbous, grotesque thing there.

270
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,420
Well, he thought so.

271
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Or a resource-based...

272
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,460
He thought so.

273
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,720
She found it to be about as uninspired as she'd ever had,

274
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,560
and she'd had plenty.

275
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,860
Yeah, but she's a beatnik, too.

276
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,160
And besides, she had her foreskin removed,

277
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,880
and she transformed herself into a lady's woman.

278
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,600
Yeah, mangroves.

279
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,340
Yeah, she's not really my type.

280
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,600
It's not your cup of meat, as the old...

281
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,220
No, no.

282
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,740
In fact, kind of the opposite.

283
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,420
I go for this sort of photorealism in my robot.

284
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,020
And then you Photoshop the photorealism

285
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,840
of your backwards mentality.

286
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,740
Yeah, I add pimples and the odd hair,

287
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,560
a little bit of cellulite.

288
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:11,820
Balloons and that stuff.

289
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,400
I have a cellulite.

290
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,440
And that's it.

291
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,440


292
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,440


293
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,820
I have a cellulite filter

294
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,660
to add cellulite when there's not enough.

295
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,340
Yellow tints.

296
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,620
In my uber porn.

297
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,280
You know, I turned 65,

298
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,700
so I can get the porn plus now.

299
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,220
Super porn.

300
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,440
Yeah, but the problem is 65 what?

301
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,140
You turned 65 what?

302
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,680
65 X days.

303
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,880
It all turned out to be drills.

304
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,160
Just a drilling for oil and nary a gusher.

305
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,360
Just occasional dribble.

306
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,840
If you keep looking long enough,

307
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,300
you're bound to hit pay dirt someday.

308
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,100
Or maybe you just...

309
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,960
That's the idea.

310
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,880
That's the idea.

311
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,460
We'll just keep drilling until the year 8661

312
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,840
or whatever it is.

313
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,860
Who knows?

314
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,620
There's obnoxious children everywhere.

315
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
That should give them pause.

316
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,340
Or at least some dangling kind of feet or something

317
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,120
they can wear when they're out in the universe all alone.

318
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
From NPR News in Washington,

319
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm linked to heart-wrenching charges.

320
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,120
Facebook is spreading misinformation.

321
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,680
Information.

322
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,920
In, um, food, uh, water, uh, uh, tin.

323
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,100
The Dow is 325-323-5818.

324
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,460
President Donald Trump will wrench Korean families

325
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,140
who were forced to say this is PR news

326
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,840
from Friday to Sunday.

327
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,020
Aren't you curious about Caffeina's, uh,

328
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,420
cogent cuisine when you smell it?

329
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,840
I sure am.

330
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,200
What is on the menu today, do you know?

331
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,120
It's, uh, bean burgers, whatever they are,

332
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,920
and, uh,

333
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,640
slaw.

334
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,940
Delicious cold slaw.

335
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,740
Slaw?

336
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,060
Yeah, doesn't slaw sound good?

337
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,760
Is it cold slaw?

338
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,400
Well, it's coal slaw, like old King Coal Slaw.

339
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,260
But, uh, there are other things also.

340
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
Anyway, the cooking smells.

341
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,640
You know anything about the temperature of the coal slaw?

342
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,460
Is it hot coal slaw or is it cold coal slaw?

343
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,000
I imagine it is cool to offset the piping hotness

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,120
of the burgers as they sizzle when delivered.

345
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
I forgot about that.

346
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,980
If you indulge in a greasy, delightful meal,

347
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,840
do not then run over and handle all the swag

348
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,920
on the swag table.

349
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,520
We must maintain high standards here at X Day 21.

350
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,160
These things, when unbought,

351
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
will go back into the box for future iterations.

352
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,560
Reverend Lord Angry Larry,

353
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,000
did you get a bean burger and a...

354
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,900
Yeah, come and sit in on this colloquium.

355
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,260
Thank you.

356
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,920
The College Radio will never be the same

357
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,880
after these particular...

358
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,800
What on earth?

359
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,860
It sounded like a direct hit.

360
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Oh, there we go.

361
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,480
There you are.

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,200
Oh, don't worry about it, mister.

Obey.

hypoglycemia well yeah

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,420
carl run off the road so if only they'd had healthful marijuana inside now the temperature

385

outside right now is about 150 degrees of frizzling 150 degrees here at uh cofinas where

386
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:32,920
we pant in the shade like an exhausted hound hi suzy there suzy is in the audience

387
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,700
what a flash of inspiration she gives us is the southern bell

388
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,640
she's showing us her ding dong

389
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:56,240
you have your discordia and i have my discordia my discordia is driven by the urge to see

390
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:04,000
maximized human potential i don't expect or want perfection but i do think we can do better than

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,840
kitty gulags casual racism that isn't so casual anymore and an abandoned space

392
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:21,360
program humans were meant to do grotesque things and we've settled for the banal i think that has

393
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,180
to change and that's why i am a discordia this dissatisfaction with humans that are content to

394
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:36,380
be humans isn't irritant to most people i run into that's okay your approval is not my concern

395
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,500
what is my concern is that things should be better

396
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:51,460
faster sexier more over the top widescreen and loud as hell i am a fun house mirror you look at me

397
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,800
you see yourself only far more manic more into it and maybe with a beard that you haven't got

398
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:06,120
my beard is strictly there to protect you the citizens from my dangerous levels of wopple

399
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,940
you should take a moment to think it it's all that stands between you and me

400
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,960
you and death by sexy it's also worth mentioning that your reflection is doing the safety dance

401
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,440
while you yourself are standing here with a briefcase and a latte wondering how you're

402
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,900
going to finish your insane workload before deadline be the deadline be what john q public

403
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:39,560
lives in dread of finish that with a preposition dare me to drive be the vague formless terror in

404
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,380
the break room

405
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,080
humans really can't function without that and there isn't enough to go around without your help

406
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:58,980
I am mighty but even I can't do it alone I am a a day test I am a mad scientist I'm laughing

407
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:06,520
maniacally while the world saves me the trouble by destroying itself I'm going to go on record

408
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,940
though as saying my apocalypse is way cooler than this

409
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:19,660
this one. You are pensively waiting to be drowned by the rising ocean. My apocalypse has really

410
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:28,020
fucking big giant squid coming in with the remorselessly advancing tide. Your apocalypse

411
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:36,100
has financial collapse. Mine has armies of radioactive gorillas. Your apocalypse is the

412
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:45,980
banal failure of the machine. Mine is a big goddamn neon sign saying these systems are failing.

413
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:56,760
Pick your poison. Ignominious extinction or fighting Nessies in the sewers. Stop that shit.

414
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,800
Put that briefcase down. Explain yourself. How in this day and age are you not on fire?

415
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,080
Why are you not on fire? Why are you not on fire? Why are you not on fire? Why are you not on fire?

416
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:12,240
Throwing your hands in the air and howling. The world is your Pripyat amusement park.

417
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:24,060
Get on the fucking ride or kill me right in the face. I mean, seriously, just look at you people.

418
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:34,840
And that was nano brand by the good Reverend Roger,

419
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,080
not by the devils.

420
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,080


421
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,540
by me. And now this.

422
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,200
Keeps opening your old smile,

423
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,640
Bang and smile, folks are on a hill.

424
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,660
Impersonate a wounded grasshopper.

425
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,740
What the f***?

426
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,920
Sparkplug, quit messing up my cards.

427
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,080
See, you ruined the timing.

428
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,160
Broadcasting live on Freethink Radio from Hypercube HQ

429
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,880
in the future capital of the former Spanish Empire,

430
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,760
Orlando, Florida, this is time for the show.

431
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,080
The show where we get together every week to figure out

432
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,920
what to do on next week's show.

433
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,060
I'm Reverend Fid Schooley of the Church of the Broken Carp

434
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,520
Antenna with me right here in the Hypercube

435
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,400
is Mr. Hypercube himself, Dr. Engineer, Dr. Fox.

436
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,120
That's me.

437
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,760
Yep, literally.

438
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,840
And does somebody have a quarter?

439
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,740
I need to flip it to decide whether or not Pease is back

440
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,640
from his pre-show smoke.

441
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,860
Reverend Pease, if you're out there, sound off, big boy.

442
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,820
What do you think? Do you think he came back or not?

443
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,260
I'm asking you.

444
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,300
I don't know.

445
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,280
Well, would you come back soon?

446
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,540
I have not seen Pease. I have not seen Pease all night.

447
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,420
I haven't talked to Pease. I missed the Pease.

448
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,720
And I know everybody else did.

449
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,080
So get his ass back here when you can.

450
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,860
Do they?

451
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,180
And we'll get on with this thing.

452
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,880
Yeah, that'll show them.

453
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,360
That'll show them.

454
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,240
Yeah, bunch of cheese wagons.

455
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,720
It's going to be a rough one today.

456
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,540
I don't feel so good, guys.

457
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,020
Oh.

458
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,100
I was going to tell you when I did.

459
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,580
I thought it was going to be a good show.

460
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,180
Julie's got the sickies.

461
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,740
Somebody's got the sickie ickies.

462
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
Oh, no.

463
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,920
I kind of do, guys.

464
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,060
It's going to be good later.

465
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,160
We got blind eyes and viewer males, and we're going to play

466
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,680
Is It a Band and all that stuff.

467
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,820
We're going to play Is It a Band.

468
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,040
If I make it.

469
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,080
Did you hit show?

470
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,720
To there.

471
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,820
Because, guys, I got to tell you.

472
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,620
Fresh hot show for you tonight.

473
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,100
I don't feel real good.

474
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,020
First of all, I got, I went to the Wawa.

475
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,060
To the Wawa's.

476
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,920
And I got a, well, it's a pulled pork omelet rito.

477
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,140
And it's not being real nice to me right now, you guys.

478
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,740
Is that where they just take the pulled pork and wrap it in the eggs?

479
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,440
Like an egg burrito?

480
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:24,760
It is.

481
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,420
They take the egg disk and they put that on top of a burrito.

482
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,720
And then they throw a bunch of pulled pork and some salsa in there and roll it up.

483
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,720
And it's not like I ordered this custom.

484
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,180
I stepped up to that little screen.

485
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,860
And this was the only selection under breakfast burritos.

486
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,260
And I'm like, well, that sounds pretty gross.

487
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,120
But if it's up here on the screen, it's got to be like kid tested, mother approved.

488
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,080
Right?

489
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,420
So I proceed to order it.

490
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,060
Because before they used to do egg sandwiches, you could get a cinnamon raisin bagel.

491
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,260
And I always ordered that.

492
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,980
And every time I did it, the cashier would look at me and be like, oh, you made a mistake.

493
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,000
You got the cinnamon raisin bagel with your order.

494
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,080
And I'm like, oh, you made a mistake.

495
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,520
You got the cinnamon raisin bagel with your egg sandwich.

496
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,440
And I'm all like, yeah, that's what I wanted.

497
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,280
And they go, oh, you're one of those people.

498
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,260
So I figured if it's on the screen, maybe it's not always legit.

499
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,520
But I got this thing.

500
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,440
And I.

501
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,300
It's important to note, though, Fidd, that you don't like food in general.

502
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,900
You find the whole concept of food disturbing.

503
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,500
I think that you should tell the listening audience that so they can put your dilemma in your perspective.

504
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,720
That's true.

505
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,680
I mean, I've said it before.

506
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:33,980
But I'm not.

507
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,600
But I have basically a business relationship with food.

508
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,840
You need it.

509
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,920
You got to have it.

510
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,240
I literally have to eat it.

511
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,820
But you don't care for it.

512
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,560
Interpret that any way you will.

513
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,080
But no, I don't take joy in it.

514
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,280
It's basically I try to get like I try to have the least negative experience possible.

515
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,800
That's how I choose the food that I eat.

516
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,300
And we can get into that.

517
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,220
Raisin bagel with egg sandwich.

518
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:01,820
Exactly.

519
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,500
Yeah, exactly.

520
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,700
It puts it.

521
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,020
It puts it in a better light.

522
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,120
Well, the way the way that I assemble my food is I just pick random ingredients that I like.

523
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,240
And if I like all of the ingredients individually, well, then if I put them together, it's it's got to be good.

524
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,560
Right.

525
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:32,240
But no, this this pulled pork omelet Rito from the Wawa's is really I feel like I ate like they pulled the Titanic's anchor out of the Atlantic.

526
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,380
And then I ate it.

527
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,140
And and then so what did I do to remedy the situation to remedy my double down?

528
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,320
Got another one.

529
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,160
I I smoked some frop.

530
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,360
I smoke a bunch of frop.

531
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,180
Good.

532
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,760
Now I'm too frapped, man.

533
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,180
And like and now we got to do the show.

534
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,200
It's live, man.

535
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,000
So it's going out.

536
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,600
And I like, dude, dude, I'm freaking out a little bit.

537
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,940
He's talking me down, bro.

538
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,740
I don't know.

539
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,100
I think it is too much, bro.

540
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,440
I think.

541
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,320
I mean.

542
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,560
I don't know.

543
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Buying a pulled pork breakfast sandwich Rito from a Wawa's is the equivalent of getting sushi from a Texaco.

544
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,580
Finn can maintain with a small keg like a pony keg.

545
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:23,800
He could just sip on one of those all day and he would he could walk a straight line for a mile.

546
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,640
But if I have two beers, I'm ready for sleepy town like I am done.

547
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,300
I'm not interested in f***ing.

548
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm finishing the drink.

549
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,420
I'm over anything about it.

550
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,520
But I can eat the Chipotle chorizo pulled pork egg.

551
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,500
Rito.

552
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,160
Perfect.

553
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,440
I can do that.

554
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,260
I'm able to do that.

555
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:57,140
I'm able to consume the burrito and all the other terrible garbage that I eat all the time because it tastes good and it makes me happy.

556
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,080
Yeah.

557
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,480
Right.

558
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,280
Radio break.

559
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,000
Call sign.

560
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,420
Fid interrogative engineer.

561
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
Would you please display the board on the monitor that I can see?

562
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,160
Thank you.

563
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,840
Thank you in advance.

564
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,440
Yes.

565
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,060
I just like looking at my levels when I talk, you know, I know it's a little narcissistic.

566
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,840
Is it?

567
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,200
Is it narcissistic for me to like to look at my my my level bar?

568
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,040
Well, what is narcissism?

569
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,260
I mean, is it?

570
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,340
Is it just appreciating yourself a little bit?

571
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,400
Come on now.

572
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,580
Well, not me, but maybe like my self-satisfaction.

573
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,140
Who?

574
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,580
Who here would know anything about narcissism?

575
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,260
Peas.

576
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,400
He's what is narcissism?

577
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,420
He probably knows.

578
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,620
I think.

579
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,700
Well, I'm not the person to ask.

580
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,700
I'm so humble and handsome and modest.

581
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,460
Right.

582
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,280
Exactly.

583
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,900
These are all the traits that you want in a Peas.

584
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
But, you know, I guess narcissism.

585
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,300
I could look at.

586
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:06,060
I could look at other, you know, radio hose or maybe, you know, I got a couple of those

587
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,980
up in the quick.

588
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,800
The radio is on fire out in the old radio.

589
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,920
That's a dishwasher.

590
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,960
Yeah.

591
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,940
Well, I grinding hall.

592
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,100
I can vouch for that.

593
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,700
Peas is very handsome.

594
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,440
Actually, I will go so far as to say this live on the radio.

595
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,140
And if that isn't enough.

596
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:34,960
Let me add to that by saying that Peas is just so gosh, damn handsome.

597
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm not a gay man, but I would let you wear one finger.

598
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,320
No, not if I would.

599
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,560
You're handsome enough.

600
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,760
I would let you put one finger in my butt.

601
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,540
Nothing.

602
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,240
Nothing weird or anything.

603
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,040
But like, but one.

604
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,380
I give you one.

605
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,460
And that's it.

606
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:52,720
Nothing.

607
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,260
Wish, if you will.

608
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,600
Yeah.

609
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,140
It's like snapping the wishbone.

610
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:01,220
At Thanksgiving, you only get one, you know, at least a year.

611
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,240
I break pieces finger off in my b-hole in whichever one of us gets the middle knuckle can make

612
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,600
a wish.

613
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,720
That's how that works.

614
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,400
See you Thanksgiving.

615
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:11,900
Peace.

616
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,240
It's going to be great.

617
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,460
So I'm comfortable with where we're going.

618
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,480
We're going to have a wishing booth.

619
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,720
Julie's sterile wishing booth.

620
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,060
Dark, dark hut.

621
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,200
It's sterile.

622
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,960
It's okay.

623
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,200
We're going to have our special uit of at-at.

624
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,020
Where are we going?

625
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:47,060
South DAR THA accent?

626
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,120


627
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,580
I just shapeshift.

628
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:54,240
Oh, I lost previous

629
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,220
quite possibly be the world's greatest event ever. And we're going to do it here in Orlando,

630
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,920
Florida, September 15th.

631
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:36,540
Okay, so what was it again? You have the what? Imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome. Dr.

632
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:45,700
Brujaha here today with Animal Overlord. You say that you have experienced imposter syndrome.

633
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:52,920
Overlord Animal, that is correct. Well, how is that? Dr. Brujaha, in what way do you feel

634
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,220
imposter?

635
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,340
Like you're an imposter.

636
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,060
Because I didn't go to school to learn the things that I know.

637
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,440
So I'm wondering if this is something that many people in the Church of the Subgenius

638
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,280
experience at one point in time or another, because the con-infested guilt that we have

639
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:20,540
somehow managed to absorb being near the pink so much, might it be that this imposter syndrome

640
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,880
is really what we should be considering an absolute blessing?

641
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,440
Because no, we didn't earn it. But we got it. And that's what we should celebrate, I'm

642
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,420
pretty sure, right?

643
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,060
That's a good one.

644
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:42,100
Yeah, because I'm pretty, I'm okay with like, yeah, I caught myself feeling that the other

645
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:48,540
day. And then I told my brain, shut up, brain. That's ridiculous. Of course, you're supposed

646
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,220
to be here. You know, sitting next to the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

647
00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:00,700
the queen and, and receiving all of these chocolates that were handmade by all these

648
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,040
people. You know, whatever it was, I can't remember exactly the scenario, but I imagine

649
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,780
it was something, or maybe I was like, you know, folding napkins in a classroom with

650
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:18,480
like, you know, Jimmy Buffett and the ex-President Obama. I don't know. Maybe, maybe, maybe

651
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
something like that.

652
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,820
You definitely deserve whatever free appetizer they were going to give you.

653
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,200
Whatever, whatever happens to keep you.

654
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,060
It's going to come my way. Unless it's, unless it's bad, I deserve it.

655
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,520
Right. Except, except for the, you know, sometimes the stark fist of removal does come, whether

656
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,420
or not any of these things are deserved. That's, I think, the point of the, the doctrines is

657
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,860
to realize that it's irrelevant, which is part of the charm of it. There's no, there's

658
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,940
no shame in being gifted things.

659
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,380
Right.

660
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,140
Or accepting these wonderful gifts. And there's no blame when the gifts are then taken away.

661
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,140
Right. No shame, no blame. Because it's not our fault. It just happens.

662
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,120
It's true.

663
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,940
It just happens.

664
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,540
Well.

665
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,120
I mean.

666
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,020
Sometimes you can put on a mask and a costume and you can like make it happen better.

667
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,800
Oh, yeah. You can totally always make it. I mean, if you need the mask.

668
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,460
Especially with a mask.

669
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,300
If you need the mask and the costume.

670
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,100
Yeah, definitely.

671
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,680
Yeah.

672
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,060
I'd never thought.

673
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,660
I'd never thought that it would be necessary to dress up. I thought I was just doing that

674
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:36,040
because clothes are socially acceptable. Whether or not they're the same, the social normative

675
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:43,960
clothes. But, but they sure like that. I get more imposter syndrome when I get things wearing

676
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,180
clothes than when I don't wear clothes and I go out into public.

677
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,360
Right.

678
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,040
I definitely feel like I don't belong for a reason if I'm trying to.

679
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,640
Get things done while not wearing clothes.

680
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,200
That's very insightful.

681
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,540
Depends on what I'm doing. In public. In private, if I'm not wearing clothes, I get things for

682
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,040
a reason. Different topic altogether.

683
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,960
All of the reasons and more.

684
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:20,640
All the reasons for. Yeah. So, yeah. But as far as imposter syndrome, do you think you're

685
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,120
going to be able to learn to live with it?

686
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,920
I can try. I can certainly try. Or I can not try.

687
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,840
There you go.

688
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,220
And just see what happens.

689
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,760
Yeah. That's, that's more like it. That's more like it. High five. Awesome.

690
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,200
So, yeah. I deserve it regardless of whether or not I earned it.

691
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,260
That is true.

692
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,940
Because I'm receiving it in the now and I'm thankful for it.

693
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,680
There you go.

694
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,120
So, there you go.

695
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,900
And you deserve it even if you didn't want it. So, like, if it gets taken, if something

696
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,980
gets yanked away.

697
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:59,960
Yeah. I mean, sure, I'll take the small circus of baby pygmy elephants. That sounds so much

698
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,100
fun. Oh, wait. You mean you just wanted to store them here for the weekend and now you're

699
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,880
taking them back? Fine. I guess. I mean, we had a good time while it lasted.

700
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:16,060
Yeah. Did you though? Because in pygmy elephants, that's still poops that you got to clean.

701
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,180
Well, that's the, that was actually the benefit was all that beautiful elephant dung.

702
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,440
Fertilizer for the garden, yeah.

703
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:21,900
Dung, yeah.

704
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,480
Oh, my gosh.

705
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,520
It's just amazing.

706
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:23,860
Amazing.

707
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,060
Yeah.

708
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,080
Fragrant.

709
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,500
And, you know, I love the...

710
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,240
Piles of it.

711
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,960
Have you seen those, the postcards that they, or the greeting cards that are made out of

712
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,640
elephant dung?

713
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,260
No, but my friend plastered her house in Thailand with elephant dung.

714
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,780
I think it's, I love that poop. That crap, that shine.

715
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,160
She said, she said it was, it, it came when it dried. It was like a mauve color too.

716
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,800
Right?

717
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,780
Yeah. It was like mixed with clay, but yeah.

718
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,660
What were they eating?

719
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,360
Right?

720
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,020
And also flowers.

721
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,420
Flowers.

722
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:53,740
Flowers.

723
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,380
But, yeah.

724
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,220
Balloo.

725
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,440
Dirt.

726
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,460
Baby pygmy elephants, though. They're like the size of a dog. They're cute.

727
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,540
I don't think that's, I just...

728
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,620
A whole circus of them.

729
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,340
It was like six.

730
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,020
It was fine.

731
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:18,160
What's the difference in like the, I was going to say the plasticine era and the Neolithic period, but I meant what's the difference?

732
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,660
Well, one, one was the invention of plastic and the other one was the invention of neon.

733
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:31,860
Oh, geez. All this time I thought it had to do with wheels and overshoes and all kinds of rectal, you know, poison and stuff like that.

734
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,860
Man, it's amazing what I can do.

735
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,740
That's a Devonian.

736
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,280
Yeah.

737
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Are we not men?

738
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,240
Right. We're, we are Devonians.

739
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah.

740
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,600
At least part of the time.

741
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,600
Now it can be told.

742
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,860
I used to have the little red book and I threw it at an old woman one time.

743
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,200
Oh, that's a shame.

744
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,200
I have, I have...

745
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,820
Mother's spa's little red book.

746
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,400
But it doesn't have the burn marks from when you stuffed it in the old lady's eyeball.

747
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,560
No, no, I didn't ever did anything like that.

748
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,240
No, you're not such an upstanding young gen.

749
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,200
Where is that book?

750
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,580
My daughter, who's 53 years old and has bad teeth.

751
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,020
You don't have a daughter.

752
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,400
No, I don't. I do have a son, though.

753
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,100
Yeah.

754
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,240
And I have a physical...

755
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,920
Yeah, and your grandkids are older.

756
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,640
Some of them are older than you, right?

757
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,680
Right. That's what I like about it.

758
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,660
They grow so fast.

759
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,540
How could you give birth to somebody who's older than you are?

760
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,820
But just think of it, that's the way God...

761
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,500
Not God.

762
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,900
That's the way nature planned it.

763
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,800
Or Napster. I don't know.

764
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,540
Well, I don't think that kind of thing is planned.

765
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,120
I think it just, you know, in some freakish families that happens.

766
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,840
You don't? You just think it's a freakish family?

767
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,560
Yeah.

768
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,900
Like, for instance, the Lonesome...

769
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,400
Lonesome clan.

770
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,040
Grandpa and Grandma Lonesome.

771
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,580
There was a reason they had that name.

772
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,200
Oh, she got thrown out of mission school, Grandma Lonesome.

773
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,500
She was quite a troublemaker.

774
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,420
A tumbler, they call them in Yiddish.

775
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,700
People who wouldn't shut up, you know?

776
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,420
And so, after 10 years after, I realized she was my actual full-blooded, bullhorn native grandma.

777
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,120
That's when we had to come to terms with everything.

778
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,740
And I think it was a power.

779
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,680
Well, in 1983, we got married.

780
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,240
But it was absolutely, you know, a sex...

781
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,080
A loveless relationship, I guess you'd call it.

782
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,320
Because all she wanted me to do was take out the garbage.

783
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:40,500
And I said, look, lady, I'm not going to continue just to do your bidding just because, you know...

784
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,120
You remember what I was saying.

785
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,800
Because she was your grandma, man.

786
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,680
You're supposed to take out the garbage for her.

787
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,380
You told me that she had a wooden eye.

788
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,980
Well, yeah, of course. Don't they all?

789
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,660
No.

790
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:50,780
No?

791
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,100
My grandma's all had just regular...

792
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,660
You said she had a wooden finger and a wooden eye.

793
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:01,780
Right.

794
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,100
She had the badge that was both the police mark.

795
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,420
She was a valiant, or whatever they call them.

796
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,360
A forbisher, or a freebooter, or something like that.

797
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,760
It's like a special tag you get to wear once you pass a test.

798
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,520
And she had a wooden eye, and a wooden finger, and a wooden...

799
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,420
Tongue, sometimes, when she'd snap, when she'd get snappy.

800
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,120
Snapping grandma.

801
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,880
Snappy granny.

802
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,700
Yeah.

803
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,020
Our generation grew up really sheltered compared to them.

804
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:40,000
Those depression grandmas and grandpas, they could wring a chicken's neck and not even think twice about it.

805
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,760
Then wipe their fanny with it.

806
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,320
They'd be talking at the same time, like, that they were snapping a chicken's wringly.

807
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,780
Like it was nothing.

808
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,500
Like they were...

809
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,760
You know, cracking an egg.

810
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,440
Right.

811
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,540
And they could crack an egg without using their hands.

812
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,280
Yeah.

813
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,640
They were tough back in them days.

814
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,560
Back before the invention of tools.

815
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,820
Yeah.

816
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,120
Or walking upright.

817
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,680
Especially a lot of them still had a slither on their bellies like snakes.

818
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,040
At least she didn't tell me that one time.

819
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,020
I believed it anyway.

820
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,240
But I guess they're not...

821
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,720
Snakes aren't really reptiles.

822
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,280
They have their own classifications.

823
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:20,780
Are they?

824
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,420
No, snakes are reptiles.

825
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,680
They are reptiles?

826
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:23,760
Snakes are deaf.

827
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,760
Yes, they're reptiles.

828
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,620
Are birds reptiles?

829
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:26,880
No.

830
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,140
Because they're ancient ancestors?

831
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,020
No.

832
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,760
No.

833
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,620
They're more like dinosaurs, but they're really birds.

834
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,500
I've heard of the term called avial, which meaning they're bird-like or something.

835
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:37,940
Yes.

836
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,280
The avian...

837
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,840
What is it?

838
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,320
Family?

839
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,920
The avian family.

840
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,760
It's like the lonesome family and the stang family and the avian.

841
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,760
Oh.

842
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,640
Speaking of grandma lonesome...

843
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:59,380
There's kingdoms and there's families and genuses and subgenuses and species and subspecies.

844
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,340
The subspecies are hot looking.

845
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,260
Yeah, they are.

846
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,180
I remember that.

847
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,860
But I can't trust...

848
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,520
Subspecies.

849
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,140
I got so darn sexy one time thinking about...

850
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,400
Well, there were actually three subspecies that I was viciously warning my friends about

851
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,740
because they were going to get me in trouble.

852
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,740
You know, if I'd straighten up and start thinking right.

853
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,740
You know, they'd say,

854
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,740
Hey, you're abnormal.

855
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,640
There's something wrong with your brain.

856
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,360
You know?

857
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,740
But no, I don't understand.

858
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,100
What were the three subspecies?

859
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,560
Of what?

860
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,620
Of people?

861
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,600
Of the...

862
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,440
Mushrooms?

863
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,180
Well, of course of mushrooms.

864
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,520
Let's start with mushrooms.

865
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,780
The edible ones have a kind of a grayish brown under...

866
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,540
Gilch.

867
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,060
Underneath the cap.

868
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,300
The ones that look like our leaders, proboscis, are poisonous.

869
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,520
Just like all the ones that have that reddish purple thing.

870
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,540
Don't eat reddish purple mushrooms, people who have, you know,

871
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,560
live near forests or mushroom grow.

872
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,380
Because they can...

873
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,560
But the psychedelic ones are always purple.

874
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,780
I don't trust you, Dr. Dave.

875
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,440
Well, you don't have to.

876
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm going to get a second opinion.

877
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,300
It's a comedy show.

878
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,780
And who knows what could be the stick in this?

879
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,420
Probably nothing.

880
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,960
I'm not going to eat any mushroom I find on the ground because I'm no expert.

881
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,960
I didn't take any of those courses at Starwood that my friend teaches.

882
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,420
These are more like old certain nationality.

883
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,880
Ethnic men's rumors of how to tell if something was good.

884
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,140
You throw a copper penny in the pan.

885
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,580
If it turns blue, it's okay.

886
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,440
Or it doesn't turn blue.

887
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:49,920
It's okay.

888
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:57,000
And they weren't around to realize that pennies don't have copper in them anymore.

889
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,920
Many of them perish from their silliness.

890
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,840
Just try to make a good bowl of spaghetti.

891
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,340
Oh, next thing you're going to tell me that dimes and quarters don't really have silver in them.

892
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,200
And silver dollars are made of tin.

893
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,120
Well, they are.

894
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,580
Silver dollars are made of tin.

895
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,160
In fact, it's not even...

896
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,280
It's a hypoglycemic form of...

897
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,220
What's the word for douchebag?

898
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,740
Oh, geez, I can't.

899
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,280
Trump.

900
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,880
Hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic?

901
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,340
Both of them.

902
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,100
I've had both.

903
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,200
It's bad to not have enough or too many of them.

904
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,400
Yeah, I've had both at the same time.

905
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,060
That's the worst.

906
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,860
What, having three glycems?

907
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,260
You can't...

908
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,040
Having not enough will kill you and having too much will kill you, but you have to do both.

909
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,820
You feel like you're dying all the time.

910
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,720
Yeah.

911
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:49,740


912
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,260
So I don't ever want to end up like that again.

913
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,800
That's why my diet is so restricted now.

914
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:02,420
Well, ask good old Dr. V. Gates, the former World War II barbecue technician.

915
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,960
You can't keep that kind of stuff in your pants.

916
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,560
Much less your belly.

917
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,040
I mean, much less your belly.

918
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,460
It's easier to keep in your pants than in your belly.

919
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,540
Kill you in your belly.

920
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,060
Of course not.

921
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:16,980
In your pants.

922
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,800
Well, some people...

923
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,260
Some people actually do that for fun, believe it or not.

924
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,520
In many lands, I mean, a rabbit is called a heron.

925
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,040
Isn't that the...

926
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,820
It comes out of our noses.

927
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,740
What's that supposed to be called?

928
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,380
A rabbit?

929
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,300
You know?

930
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,220
What are those called?

931
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:45,760
Well, currently at the University of Fribegia in southern Minnesota...

932
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,480
In my nose, it's almost like they have an independent life.

933
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:56,180
It's almost like they're some kind of parasite that lives there and actually dodges the scissors when I go after them.

934
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,060
Oh, yeah.

935
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,760
I have to Photoshop all my selfies because of them.

936
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:08,200
Whenever they know I'm pointing a camera at myself, they jump out of the end of my nostrils and pose for the camera.

937
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,520
Do they stay in position there or do they do their business on you?

938
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,360
No, no.

939
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,780
They just stick out until the picture's over and taken.

940
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,400
Then they go back to...

941
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,520
They're always visible.

942
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,380
The problem is people think they're boogers, right?

943
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,100
But I don't think they are.

944
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,820
Boogers don't have little tiny eyes and mouths, do they?

945
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,840
And fangs.

946
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:30,880
Right.

947
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,660
I mean, they're really tiny.

948
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,040
They're more like the size of maggots.

949
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,960
Like the maggots that live in your nose, you know, if you don't really wash out enough.

950
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:48,060
But they're not maggots because they're anchored in one place.

951
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,260
Right.

952
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,000
They're...

953
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,260
Yeah, they're too many.

954
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,820
I should look at one of them under my stereo microscope.

955
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,540
Actually, why have I not done that?

956
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,520
I guess I was scared.

957
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:07,040
But why give them the dignity or the overabundance of your magnitude?

958
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,800
Well, if they're not...

959
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,340
By looking at them that way, why don't you just look at them with your naked eye and your naked body?

960
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,340
Just lay there asleep one night without any clothes on and stare at them.

961
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,260
I know...

962
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,820
But they're in my nose.

963
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,440
I can't look at them in my nose.

964
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:24,840
Right, I know it's difficult.

965
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,660
I can use a mirror.

966
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,920
Well, wasn't it you said you can't look at your own eye?

967
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,380
You can look at your own nose, toes, fur, hair.

968
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,960
Actually, I worked out...

969
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,020
This was for X-Day if I was a sadist.

970
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,980
If I was into X-Day for the revenge, which I'm not really.

971
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,780
I'm in it for the conservation.

972
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,260
Three sex.

973
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,820
No, well, duh.

974
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,960
But also the conservation.

975
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,560
I want to hoard a lot of stuff.

976
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,740
I'll finally be able to.

977
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,320
Anyway, the...

978
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,720
What was I going to say?

979
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,120
Oh, yeah, the vengeance.

980
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,860
If I was going to be vengeful, I would let my nose worms loose on somebody.

981
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,640
Well, you make that sound like it's such a small deal.

982
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,620
If you were of the mind, you would lose...

983
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:19,720
You would lose...

984
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,720


985
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,180
Listen, your nose whistles.

986
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,440
I mean, your nose...

987
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,740
That wasn't what I was going to say.

988
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,900
I could...

989
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,440
It was good, but...

990
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,700
I thought it was...

991
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,640
I thought it was beautiful.

992
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:49,700
What I meant to say, friends, was that on X-Day, to really get somebody, I guess, I could surgically remove, let's say, the right...

993
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:55,700
The right eye of a living, conscious person, but not all the way.

994
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:19,100
I'd leave the optic nerve attached, if stretched, but I would gradually and very carefully rotate and shift that right eyeball until it was pointed directly at the left eye, thus allowing the still conscious volunteer to...

995
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,700
To...

996
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:19,700


997
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:19,700


998
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:19,700


999
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,240
See his own eye.

1000
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,260
To look at his own eye.

1001
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:33,420
These are the kinds of things I've thought of to do on X-Day, but from which I will refrain.

1002
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,220
Because I like to think I'll be too busy saving things.

1003
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:48,560
And for that reason, among others, I'm almost glad that X-Day didn't happen in the conspiracy 1998.

1004
00:51:49,720 --> 00:52:00,540
Because I wasn't old and wise enough to fully appreciate that preservation is even more slackful than vengeful destruction.

1005
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:06,160
As orgasmic as vengeful destruction may be.

1006
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,820
Anyway, that's what I meant to say before I totally and utterly spaced out.

1007
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,700
And now, on with the show.

1008
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,460
Hour of Slack number 1690.

1009
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,160
93.

1010
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:29,700
You know, I should do what that tire, that mower tire repairman told me.

1011
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,020
He said, whatever you've been on, you should stay off of it.

1012
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,480
Whatever you've been on, you should stay off it.

1013
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:43,340
He was talking about the fact that I repeatedly somehow punctured my mower tires.

1014
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,980
And had to have the same one repaired twice.

1015
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,840
But...

1016
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,700
But...

1017
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:49,700


1018
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,380
But when he said that to me, whatever you've been on, you should stay off it.

1019
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,320
Right.

1020
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,400
I thought, my first thought was, how did he know?

1021
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,340
Right.

1022
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,120
He knows.

1023
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,740
He knows.

1024
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,140
How did he know?

1025
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,460
Well...

1026
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,820
He knows about my nose.

1027
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,600
He knows about my nose.

1028
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,280
He must have had nose worms and stuff.

1029
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,560
Yeah.

1030
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:15,780
From NPR News in Washington, I'm allowing PR's reports to proceed as soon as Pakistan's Grim Crickets zoom from Washington.

1031
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,420
More than two million Muslim faithful promised to combat.

1032
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,640
Pakistan's endemic PR news in Washington.

1033
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:44,260
Speaking of chronic debilitating diseases, I just had to straighten my spine up.

1034
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,660
It keeps wanting to shrivel up, basically.

1035
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,420
And grow growths on it.

1036
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,380
Fossilize in between all the, what used to be smooth discs.

1037
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,520
Lubricated organic discs between all my bones back there.

1038
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,240
But I think they've kind of turned more like into wood.

1039
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,360
Yeah.

1040
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,560
Yeah.

1041
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,580
Well, I think I always should like to fold this career orgasm.

1042
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,140
Right now.

1043
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:25,100
And go and sit down somewhere else where I can stretch my foot out, which is starting to make noises.

1044
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,880
You know, I just got Tarzan's radio station back from Ohio.

1045
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,020
This is the first show we've been able to do that had background music or you.

1046
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:45,320
I've had to send out reruns or piece together things from the meager X-Day recordings.

1047
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,020
So...

1048
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,420
Yeah.

1049
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,180
Yeah.

1050
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,140
Yeah.

1051
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,900
But now we're back.

1052
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,520
We're back.

1053
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,560
We don't have Princess Wee, but we have another dog.

1054
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,440
My new wife, Claudia the Pit Bull.

1055
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,420
Who has dutifully slept through this whole two-hour show.

1056
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,920
She's cranny.

1057
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,960
Well, I think I'm going to go because it is midnight here then, I guess.

1058
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,480
It would be, according to my time control, it would be 11.15.

1059
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,560
11.15.

1060
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,460
Where I am?

1061
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,600
Where you are.

1062
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,020
Yeah.

1063
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,400
Oh.

1064
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:25,280
Have you ever had a watch or like a sundial?

1065
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,420
I was going to just reach down and look at my phone, but my hand is not nearly large

1066
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,700
enough to reach down there.

1067
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,780
See, I keep a handcuff on.

1068
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,260
Watches are obsolete now.

1069
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,240
You know that, don't you?

1070
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,460
No, no.

1071
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,920
It's my security handcuff.

1072
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,860
I'm handcuffed to time.

1073
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,600
Locked to time that way.

1074
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:46,960
Yeah.

1075
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:46,960


1076
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,080
Yeah.

1077
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah.

1078
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:47,540
Yeah.

1079
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1080
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1081
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1082
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1083
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1084
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1085
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1086
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1087
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1088
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1089
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1090
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1091
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1092
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,300
I'm locking my phone, but actually, Dave, my phone is huge and I have to put in a special

1093
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,320
code every time I want to use it to see what time it is.

1094
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:04,800
And I'm very used to looking at my old-fashioned wind-up little clock on my wrist.

1095
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:13,840
And I usually know what time it is without a watch to within about 10 or 15 minutes because

1096
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,900
of time control.

1097
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,640
And I'm in emergent tile.

1098
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,060
And these are tricks I learned in the Church of the Subgenius.

1099
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:26,100
I can also be free of time even while wearing this handcuff because I can do both.

1100
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,740
I hear a strange...

1101
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,280
I'm sure you're the lucky one.

1102
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:35,400
I think the aliens are trying to ride on the broadcast.

1103
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:43,140
I hear a faint static that's the kind that could carry a pattern, a signal.

1104
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,480
Hmm.

1105
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,400
For all we know, it could be encoded.

1106
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,000
It could be a recorded video or the formula for a weapon that will destroy the world.

1107
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,160
But friends, the only way to know whether that's ever even happened for real, for sure,

1108
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,320
is by joining the Church of the Subgenius.

1109
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:06,920
And you can find all the details you want about that or buying the book Neighbor World

1110
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,060
by lonesome cowboy Dave P. DeLuca.

1111
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,240
The P stands for P.

1112
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,960
And no relation to Reverend P's.

1113
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,020
And the way to do that is to go to subgenius.com.

1114
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:31,700
You can also just Google Neighbor World or Lonesome Cowboy Dave, I suppose, and GoFundMe.

1115
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,440
Why don't you just give Dave free money?

1116
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:39,420
I wrote a whole rant about how I'm a victim and I need people to give me free money and

1117
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,540
fix me a sandwich.

1118
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,160
Ha, ha, ha.

1119
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,640
Ha, ha, ha.

1120
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,220
Ha, ha, ha.

1121
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:43,220


1122
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:43,220


1123
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:43,220


1124
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:43,640
Yeah.

1125
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,900
I have been writing rants, but they're usually not about churchly things.

1126
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,100
They're usually about common, everyday-type things.

1127
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,360
Well, who could care less about subgenius things?

1128
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,500
Well, why not both?

1129
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,800
You know, that's what I think.

1130
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, once again, why not both?

1131
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:02,380
Okay.

1132
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,020
Yeah.

1133
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,620
All right.

1134
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:03,900
Yeah.

1135
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,580
That's almost always true.

1136
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,500
Pain or pleasure, why not both?

1137
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,040
Ice cream or hot peppers?

1138
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,960
Why not both?

1139
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,080
You know, Lonesome Cowboy Dave or popular cowgirl Daveena?

1140
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,520
Why not both?

1141
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,580
Yeah, that's the way I feel.

1142
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
I find them daily.

1143
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,860
I just look at them for a while and wish I was 12 again.

1144
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,180
Okay, Dave.

1145
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,080
Well, we need to go.

1146
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,140
That's subgenius.com.

1147
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,020
That was what I was trying to get to.

1148
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,140
That's what you were trying to say.

1149
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,640
I was trying to spit that out.

1150
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,120
Subgenius.com.

1151
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,920
And there's no O in subgenius.

1152
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:54,960
Subgenius.

1153
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,040
Yeah.

1154
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,280
Okay.

1155
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,200
Okay.

1156
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,840
Thank you, Dave, for calling in.

1157
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,580
Thank you, Stang, for being a polished idiot.

1158
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,640
I keep my old knob polished.

1159
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,160
I do.

1160
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,420
I try to.

1161
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,640
I know you do.

1162
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,020
Keep it polished.

1163
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,300
I find it.

1164
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,840
Finding it is the hard part.

1165
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:15,960
Well.

1166
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,080
As it were, so to speak.

1167
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,180
I wish.

1168
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,040
Okay.

1169
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,000
You have a good one.

1170
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,780
Okay, Mushroom Man.

1171
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,280
Okay.

1172
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,060
Okay.

1173
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,440
Shroomhead.

1174
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,260
Hey, is Dave gone?

1175
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:30,940
Oh, my gosh.

1176
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,580
It's just me.

1177
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,700
My background music from Quest for Fire is gone.

1178
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,980
And I guess I should go.

1179
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,560
Friends, I'm going to throw in.

1180
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,020
No, I'm not.

1181
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,540
I'm going to say thank you and praise Bob.

1182
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,100
Good night.

1183
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,080
Now I can throw in the fact that the subgenius membership is 35 bucks.

1184
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,700
We really should raise it to 45.

1185
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,640
It's been 35 since 1994, I think.

1186
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,220
That's ridiculous.

1187
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,200
So, yeah.

1188
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:08,760
Yeah.

1189
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,620
And we need more.

1190
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,000
We need more subgeniuses.

1191
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,260
And more little subgenius yeti half-breeds.

1192
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,200
Babies that can replace us old-timers as we slowly shrivel up.

1193
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,420
Or quickly shrivel up, as the case may be.

1194
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:38,600
So, let us be glad that there's somebody in the subgenius land still having kids.

1195
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,120
I don't blame people for not.

1196
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,260
But.

1197
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,140
We got to get new $35 members from somewhere.

1198
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,000
And we've used up the baby boomers.

1199
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,820
I think we've hit every single one of them up.

1200
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,400
And they're either on the saucers or they're off the saucers.

1201
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,760
And, of course, 99.999% are off the saucers.

1202
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,640
Praise Bob.

1203
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,400
If it was for everybody, it wouldn't be for us.

1204
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,620
Know what I'm saying?

1205
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,820
Know what you're saying?

1206
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:11,520
So.

1207
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,360
Yes.

1208
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,180
Yes.

1209
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:17,220
Yes.
