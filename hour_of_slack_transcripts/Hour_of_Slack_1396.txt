Ah, you see, you see, my ears didn't work, huh,
because this fuse had blown and these wires had broken and so forth,
but I was able to reach into my little tool kit here
and find not only the tools and the special attachments
that I needed to get my hearing going again,
but also...
Ah, he's reading from a damn script.
The news!
No, it was...
I read the news.
I went to the trouble of actually looking at the news
before I came in to do the show,
and they have discovered the largest known prime number.
Yes, the largest known prime number has been discovered
over a godzillion.
It's so large that it took 211,000 computers
working together on the internet.
This one kid in Wisconsin or someplace
happened to be the one.
I'm a computer that got the answer.
That took so long to calculate
since the last prime number.
A number 6.3 million digits long
that would take 1,500 pages to write out.
That's a big number.
That is a big, big number.
That's the largest primal number,
and it is the number of inches,
of the primal member,
of the primal EPOPed J.R. Bob Dobbs in length.
That is the size of his love for you,
dear listener.
Ah, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
The lonesome cowboy Dave is singing
in the background this love song
to the listener.
I'm singing.
Oh, that's not Dave.
That's a record.
I'm sorry.
It sounded, it sounded,
look, poor Dave's ears are broken now.
Why, maybe it's something contagious.
Maybe it's something that just listening to this show.
A virus of pinkness.
Friends, we just came back weeks ago, actually,
from numerous devivals.
The Detroit,
or the Detroit Vivital, I like to call it,
was a fantastic success
with man, the Christ punchers,
the amino acids, and the jollies.
It was most jolly,
and we had the Beachland Ballroom show
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra
and lonesome cowboy Dave
with backup babe singers,
Princess Wee and Reverend Cinzia,
and also numerous wonderful,
new ranters, and some, in some cases,
not exactly so new.
The young Reverend Pisces delivered a great rant
about Connie, and the dynamic Reverend Carter LeBlanc
did a wonderful 15 minute stretch,
and we'll be hearing lots of live devival show tonight,
and plus little bits and pieces of Norrell Preff.
And now, a man.
A man.
I'm obese.
Why are there fu**ing manners?
B οι bη'r Dassis already ate at 70.

it's best to be늦rody
God, we don't waste yarn on that.

Come-on girls,

and maybe the bla-la-la-la.
What the fuck am I supposed to be? If I'm not supposed to be what I am.
What the fuck am I supposed to do? If I'm not supposed to do what I do.
What the fuck am I supposed to say? If I'm not supposed to say what I say.
What the fuck am I supposed to fuck? If I'm not supposed to fuck what I fuck.
And the only booze on Sunday is the blood of Christ.
Goddamn the Christians.
Goddamn the Christians.
Goddamn the Christians.
Goddamn the Christians.
Goddamn the Christians.
Man.
Friends, we saw man at the Detroit Devival.
He's from Detroit.
And I hope that he gets really rich and famous.
He acts like he really doesn't want to.
And he's great.
We'll be hearing a lot more man on this show.
Friends, I should jump in here and mention that if you want to hear this show
without all of the facts and talk.
Without, in other words, with all of the cuss words still intact,
you can download the show from our website, www.subgenius.com,
in high-quality stereo MP3 or in low-quality mono MP3.
But in either case, the cuss words are all still there.
So you can hear all the facts.
If you care.
Care to do so.
Thank you.
I need to speak to you about a few things tonight.
I know the evening is winding down.
Those of you who care are drunk.
Those of you who don't are probably drunk, too.
But I have just a few points I want to touch on.
Because right now we are dwelling in what seems to me to be
the hour of strong delusions.
It's a time of delirium.
A time of denial.
It's a time of blindness and self-deception.
It's a time where a lie is being told to all of the people, all of the time.
And it starts when you're young.
You know?
You try to do things the way you're told.
You try to follow the rules, maybe.
Just to figure out what the hell is going on.
You know?
Just to...
Just to try to make sense of what all the grown-ups are telling you.
But the more you try to comprehend what those grown-ups are telling you,
the more you start to see the contradictions.
The more frustrating it gets.
Because you start to realize that all of these people are lying.
And they're not just lying to you.
They're lying to themselves all the time.
And it starts to make you angry.
You know?
You start to get frustrated.
You start to realize...
Because what's within you, that's it.
It's not just empowering of you to criticize.
It's empowering and self-deception.
McC pole.
Being the voice of the wild and the proud.
All this suffering.
To give you a chance toeducate yourself, to help increase your sense of shame,
and to try to open up what's inside your head and the knowledge of what your engineering may look like.
It's not.

throw a brick through a bank window or maybe you try to kick this shit out of a yuppie or maybe you
try to throw some pipe bombs and some mailboxes out in the midwest but that's no good either
because they've been waiting for that they've been telling each other for years that you're
just the sort of person that's bound to do that sort of thing eventually that's why they keep
files on you is because they want to see it coming before you do and they know how to handle violence
they understand violence they have ways of dealing with violence because your violence can only be
retail and them they've got the corner on the wholesale market so maybe you try to play the
game you go the other direction you get a decent job you get married you open a bank account you
approve your credit rating you vote you buy a house you buy a house you buy a house you buy a
buy a house, you go back to college,
you maybe even work somewhere peaceful
like a community college library.
Maybe you even get to start your own business
or maybe you get to get paid to do something you like
like play music or write creatively
or maybe you get involved with a cause
that you believe in like environmentalism
or drug legalization or the peace movement
but eventually one of two things is going to happen to you.
You're either going to stop feeling
or you're not going to stop feeling.
And you know, when you stop feeling,
well, you got to do something, you know,
something that'll provoke a reaction.
You know, maybe you try psychedelic drugs,
maybe you try pornography,
maybe you try new age religions,
maybe you try paganism, comic books,
art, philosophy, food, casual sex, whatever.
Or maybe you're from the other school.
Maybe you still feel too much.
Maybe you need to numb yourself
so you try drugs, pornography, new age religions,
paganism, comic books, art, philosophy, food, casual sex,
whatever, what is it that you want all along?
You want one thing.
You want slack.
Where's your slack at tonight?
Because my...
Mine's right here
And you may not have slack right now
But you better know that you need slack tonight
The subgenius
We all know the subgenius
Must have slack
But it's the eternal paradox
Because you can't get slack
Just by slacking off
Any goddamn pink boy
With a semi-functional brainstem
Can sit on the couch
Like a lump of dog shit
If you're gonna make the effort
To pull the wool over your own eyes
For the sake of all those little subgenius children
That are trying to figure out
Why adults lie all the time
Be honest with yourself about it
I'm gonna say that again
I mumble sometimes
I wanna make this clear
If you're gonna lie to yourself
At least
Be honest with yourself about it
Because if you're okay
With where you're at
With who you are
With what you're doing
At least take the time
To tell yourself
The things you tell yourself
To make yourself believe
At least
Have the balls to say
Give me false slack
Or kill me
Come on, say it
Give me false slack
Or kill me
Who's gonna say that?
Come on
You know, people are like
Oh, whatever
Come on, say it
You gotta admit
False slack
It's better than no slack
Or all
Bullshit
False slack
Is no slack
At all
Slack
Slack is like the square root of negative one
And false slack is zero
No amount of false slack
Added to or multiplied by
Any other amount of false slack
Can ever equal anything but
Nothing
Nothing at all
You will never get enough
False slack
And that's what we're after, right?
We're after too much
And you can't get enough false slack
Much less too much
A friend of mine used to say
Nothing exceeds like excess
Well, you know, it's hard to know
When you've got enough
But you can do it
You can usually tell
When you've got too much
There's enough ambiguity
In the world today
And too much
Is not an ambiguous concept
We all know what too much is
And I bet you a lot of people here would
Just to be safe like
Just a little bit more
Just to be sure
Because, I mean
Slack
Too much
Too much
Too much


It's not when the vending machine
Gives you an extra bag of M&M's
That might be more than you deserve
But that's not too much
Too much is when the things that life gives you
Are so real
They're so overwhelming
So rich
So full
So amazing
And rewarding
And funny as shit
And maybe it knocks you down
Or maybe it wakes you up
Maybe it blows your fucking mind
But maybe
Maybe you even get to experience
Something so intense
And so startling
That it suddenly makes you see through
All that other bullshit
And get one good look
At the face of your true desire
And that is a pretty clear sign
That you're not dealing with
False slack anymore
And that's what I'm here to talk about
What is your true desire?
What do you want
To the exclusion of all else?
If you're tired
Of getting by
With your weekly pat on the back
Your nine lives tuna casserole
You're gonna need a bigger piece
Of wool
To pull over your own eyes
Once you decide
That you want that big ol'
Juicy chunk of raw unadulterated
Slack
Once you know you want it
Well they're gonna have to kill you
To stop you
Right?
Just give me slack
Or kill me
And nobody here's gonna get killed
Over some piece of crap they bought at a mall, right?
We're all smarter than that
We're subgeniuses
But we're not stupid
It's like collecting coins
Or antiques
Or comic books
Or old ceramic instruments
Or some kind of













Slater's
From the power lines
These things are only worth
What you're willing to pay for them
And you're selling yourself short
If the things that matter to you
Are things that you can pay for
Bob Dobbs
Bob Dobbs makes a million dollars
Every time he fucks up
I fuck up every day
Where's my million dollars?
Hell, if I could get one dollar
One dollar
For every time I fucked up
I'd have something, wouldn't I?
Come on
You can do that
Stupid people make money all the time
It's not that hard
What's your excuse?
Reverend, Reverend, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, dear friends
And now, man
I'm gonna make you pay for this
Are you late again?
Get back to work
I want that on my desk right now
Have you been drinking?
Give me those figures
Read the memo
Get back to your cubicles
This will affect your performance review
And you think you deserve a raise?
You're fired!
We wanted someone
Who's intelligent
Highly motivated
Creative
Yet flaccid and gullible
I share my profits
Pay your rent
Feed your kids
Put the fat on your ass
And the gas in your car
And you think you deserve a raise?
You're fired!
And you think you deserve a raise?
You're fired!
Fired!
And he feels so fine in his brand new red suit
He's ready to take his sleigh out for a ride now
He's ready to join the new Iraqi army
But he's going to be interrogating those elves
And dropping them off at high altitudes
If they don't give him the correct coordinates
Is that Kevin?



What kind of guy?
You don't give them cream corn either
He's Lambo
Baby, where'd you get those coordinates?
I'll never tell
Hey, I think it looks like 15 south, 2 west
Wow
Yeah
That's a number, man
My compass is going wild!
Man, look at mine's pointing all the way due north
The magnetic poles have shifted
Your compass is in control, young man
We can't
The poles have changed
Yes
What was once right is wrong
And what was once good is now evil and vice versa
What was once frozen is now laid to waste
What was once helium is now toothpaste
Once that was...
Oh, never mind
I'm sorry
Wait a minute
Can you get some helium?
Oh yeah, I've got the scores on helium
That stuff that you rub on your teeth?
No, you don't necessarily have to rub it on your teeth
You just like open up the bottom of the balloon
And you just run your nostril
And you very gently puff on it
And...and...and...and...and...
And then what happens?
I'm at a loss for words now
I know that something inside your head explodes
And has to be replaced there
That doesn't really sound like fun
It's not fun
It's part of a learning experience we all have to go through
Starting with you
Don't they give you some kind of medication for that?
And isn't the medication actually pretty fun?
Well, it's much worse though than the actual helium nostrils
Like for days and days afterwards
You can't defecate, you can't fornicate
And you can't spatulate, you can't...
Oh, give me a break Dave
You can't do any of those things
Yeah, but...
At the time anyway
Yeah, but see any words that end with eight can't be done
What's the difference?
You can't confiscate, you can't masturbate
You can't do any of those words that end with the letter eight
Or it's a number, I think
Oh, there's not much left to be confused about anymore, is there?
Well, Dave, you should count your blessings
That you're not afflicted with that right this minute
I'm counting my hairs
And I'm also counting concepts
That I'm throwing out the window for New Year's
A concept, a sentence
That is the goal
Oh, damn, I just blew it
Hey, look at your lips
They're all frozen
Somebody... what?
Now, when we talk about the exes
The men from Planet X
We're not talking about them little UFO
Piddly shits, you know
We're not talking about these little guys
Who crash saucers in Roswell
The masters will come back and...
And save us
What the hell is wrong?
Now, see, the devil
The devil gets into the equipment
This is nothing but a simple...
It's not a fault!
Wait a minute
Shit!
God damn it!
And now, it could sit down
Friends, before we jump to conclusions
Remember, I am a subgenius
Fuck Bill Gates!
Now, really?
Now, what did Bill Gates ever do to you
To deserve such a wonderful activity as fucking you?
He gave you a dollar of slack!
Actually, you know
You know the weird thing is
I sometimes wonder about Bill Gates
I sometimes go
What if that guy was somebody who sent me a buck
In 1981
And I didn't, like, address it right
And it didn't get to him
And he was a subgenius
He could have been saved
But!
That one little chance thing didn't happen
Because maybe I dropped the ball
Maybe the postman dropped the ball
Maybe he never even sent in that dollar
Maybe he ripped us off and stole it
Maybe that's where his fortune began
We just don't know
You can't know who is a pink
And who is a subgenius
Only Bob knows that!
So don't you go spiting your fellow bipeds
Thinking that somehow they...
I actually heard a person say to me
It's...
It's...
He said
And he was a good liberal
He said
Well, you know the thing about conservatives is
They're just not quite as human as we are
And I thought to myself
Well, my God
I guess the end justifies the means
I guess...
I guess it's alright if...
I guess one side of the conspiracy is better than the other side of the conspiracy
Jesus!
Well, I don't want to get into that, friends
Fuck them if they don't know
They can't take a joke, friends
Yeah!
The thing is though
I mean, those exes, those men from Planet X
They're...
To them
The difference between George Bush and Al Gore is
They just don't see that they're just all a bunch of monkeys to them
In fact, it's like roaches
It's like looking at a bunch of roaches
When the exes get here
They're gonna look around and go
Well, hell, we thought there was somebody gonna be here
But there's nobody here but bugs
Just insects
Shit!
Oh, well, I guess...
I guess us space men, us exes
We'll just take this water
These icebergs
We'll just skim these oceans off this useless ball of rock
Maybe suck off some of the magma
The mineral-rich magma
Oh, yes
And the gold!
And the diamonds!
Yes!
And the rubies
And the emeralds
And Princess Wee
And Bob!
The Bob, if they have one
And then they'll...
Then they'll notice that one little pipe-smoking roach down there
Oh, it's you, Bob!
We thought you were just one of those useless fighting roaches down there
Not Bob!
What?
What's that you say, Bob?
You want us to leave the oceans?
And the magma?
What?
Bob, you want us to leave the diamonds, too?
Well, what the hell are you gonna give us in return, Mr. J.R. Bob-Dog?
Your soul!
Soul!
You're gonna give us some souls!
Well, okay then, soul!
It's a deal!
Because souls are the one commodity of true value to the exes and us subgeniuses
Why?
Because souls are made of time!
And time is the only thing worth a shit!
Time, sales, and souls!
The whole idea is to milk as much slack as you can get from the limited pathetic,


pathetic time that you have!
And friends, it could be really pathetically limited if you've decided to kill yourself!
And that might be a good idea, but I suggest you wait until X day!
That is the one message of this stinking, ridiculous, little, pathetic church!
If nothing else sinks in, don't kill yourself until X day!
Sure, it's miserable, life is fucked, you're in chronic pain, go ahead and plan to kill
yourself!
But!
But!


What's the hurry?
Bob's gonna do it anyway for you!
Let him do it!
Why hurry the process along?
Well, because you're miserable, yeah right!
But!
Just wait until X day!
X day's when?
July 5th!
Surely this year, we ain't gonna let the Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses out kook us!
Huh!
Eh!
Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you this!
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!



I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!






So like I said, you could beat all you интересing things off these kids out that

See, listen, he's gargling in German
He's a secret spy for the Oriental Police
It's not one of ours
And those of you who are not prepared or aware
Must take the golden vow now
You will fight for something holy
Whatever that might be
Well, I can't agree with Reverend Stang
That the world is a monster club
guitar solo
Baby
I thought I saw a vampire
Looking through my window last night
Yeah
Crazy
I thought I saw a werewolf
Drinking from my toilet last night
Baby
I know I'm medicated
But I know things are gonna be alright
Crazy
I called 911
Had some cereal and I cried
This world is a monster club
And you must beware
Woo!
There's plenty of crazy things
Terror and love are scared
guitar solo
Hey, wrong monster
Baby
I thought I saw a mummy
Crawling on my tummy and inside
You're crazy
You're crazy
I thought I saw a werewolf
And it might be in my head
But baby
I don't wanna wind up dead
Baby
I swear I saw the werewolf
Drinking from my toilet last night
Crazy
I know I saw a baby
Hold my hand
I'm gonna be alright
This world is a monster club
And you must beware
Woo!
There's plenty of crazy things
Meaningful things, terror and block this internet
I thought I saw a window
Staring through my window last night
Crazy
I thought I saw an empire
Drinking from my toilet last night
Baby
I know I'm medicated
I'll come back one morning and feel alright
Crazy
I know I might seem crazy
I'm not
This world's a monster
Take a look around
Woo!
There's prison men in high places
Dark horses on the ground, yeah
Baby
Crazy
I'm not crazy, I'm completely sane
Crazy
The things I see on my TV are not in my brain
But coming from long distances at high frequency
Crazy
I, I can't take anything I can't take at the time
Crazy
I need my cynox and my cylox
I need my anaprox and baby
Ho ho ho ho
Yeah, whoa
You crazy
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
And now
What is this, March?
It is March, yes
This is coming up on the Ides
This would be the Ides
Wow
Wow, indeed
Well, just past the Ides
Hey, it's the Ides of March
It is
Yo
How could that have relevance to war?
Well, let's see
They stabbed Caesar in the back
That was the Senate
They did?
After banning partial birth abortions
Right
Then Colin Powell coerced the Senate to
Spank him on public TV
And then Rome fell
Because of all the sodomy that ensued
And there was war when that happened
Rome fell, Rumsfeld
That's right, Rumsfeld
And then there was the Dark Ages
Where basically it was just sodomy all the time
So tonight we're going to be discussing sodomy
And all it
Oh, no, tonight we're talking about war
What's it good for?
Sodomy in the trenches
So anyway
The Ides of March
And these topsy-turvy times
Compel me to ramble about something
I've been reluctant to mention
For fear of
Well, a jinx
I speak, of course, of the curse of Tecumseh
You see, President Harrison
Elected in 1840
Like many of our early presidents
Was a big Indian killer
Which, long story short
Led to a curse
Being placed upon him by Tecumseh
President Harrison
Was the first president to die in office
Contracting pneumonia
Secondary to the Indian curse
A fluke took a step towards becoming a trend
With Abraham Lincoln
Who was elected in 1860
And then re-elected in 1864
But not for long
A Catholic cabal struck him down
On April 14th of 1865
In 1880
It officially became a trend
When General James Garfield
Won the presidency
By a scant 10,000 votes
He proceeded to piss off
Big business and the New York political machine
And, less than four months into his term
On July 2nd
1881
He was shot by an angry lawyer
Charles Giteau
He died on September 19th
After months of tasty torture
At the hands of quacks
Which may have been some sort of Masonic ritual
It basically just gets spooky in 1900
When President William McKinley
Is re-elected to his second term
He was standing in a receiving line
At the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition
When an anarchist with an eye on the world
And unpronounceable name
That, on first inspection
Looks like some kind of joke
Leon Sholgaz, possibly
C-Z-O-L-G-O-S-Z
Shot him twice in the chest
You know, for anarchy
President McKinley had the decency to linger
For a mere eight days
And died on September 14th, 1901
And died on September 14th, 1901





Again, medical incompetence played its role
Giving him a touch of the gangrene
Before he died
Mr. Sholgaz's trial started a week later
And lasted a day
He was executed less than two months after the act
Like a good hashishun
He signed a confession
And was unapologetic
By now, you may be noticing
That all the presidents elected in a zero year
Eventually died in office
And this trend continued in 1920
With Warren Harding
Who was perhaps the worst president ever
The Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency
Indicates that he was bitten by a vampire
Planted by Al Capone
Officially, the return to normalcy candidate
Embattled by multiple scandals
Fled to Alaska
And died of food poisoning
On August 2nd, 1923
His wife died the next year
On November 21st, 1924
FDR, like Lincoln
Survived his zero year presidency
But finally stroked out on April 12th, 1945
In his fourth term as president
In 1960, JFK was elected
And we all know who killed him
On November 21st, 1963
Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980
And after just a few months in office
Was shot by a son of George Bush's friend
He died and was replaced by a CIA robot
On March 30th, 1981
Which brings us to the next episode of the show
The much contested 2000 election
Wasn't that exciting?
Who knew what was at stake?
A virtual free pass?
Of course the superstitious will insist
That the Reagan bot broke the curse
But time will tell
Time will tell
life is easy
Time will show
That tomorrow is beginning
For disasters will result

TheJennings, ==30–30 years after the actor's death as a minoró
B Radion Two Rushes tzussi
Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, but Brutus says he was ambitious,
and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome. Did this in Caesar
seem ambitious? When but the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made of
sterner stuff, yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. What cause withholds
you then to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their
reason. Bear with me, my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause till it come
back to me. But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he here,
and none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds
to mutely enrage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, who, you all know, are honorable
men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you.
The Tecumseh's Curse Lecture
And then a reading from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
You can get your foreign affairs information the same way I do,
from rappers. Yes, the Beastie Boys with their first track in years, In a World Gone Mad.
We love America, but that's no reason to get hysterica. They're laying on the syrup.
We ain't waffles, we ain't having it. In a world gone mad, it's time to be right.
So much violence, safe and smart. We're going on all day and night.
Too tired to fight, we're going violent, bro.
Now how many people must get killed?
Oil families, pockets to get filled.
How many oil families get killed?
Not a damn one, so what's the deal?
Ah, that's better.
Phew. Well, you look different now, though.
It's like having a vice.
Now it looks like your head has actually been slightly protruded in a vice, just enough
to give you a painful headache.
Are those headphones? I thought that was a sea clam.
I thought those were growing out of the side of your neck.
It is.
Good lord, the things we don't see when we don't open our eyes to the world.
It's my new girlfriend, the sea clam.
I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you.
Sea clam what?
I had one a couple of years ago, but it just sort of started smelling really bad after
a while. It stopped coming out of its little clam shell.
Oh.
Well, you probably had it out of the water too much. That's why you need to stick with
the land stuff.
Well, they're kind of like high maintenance girlfriends.
Really, you have to wash them three or four times a day.
You've got to keep a tub of salt water.
Prairie squids lick themselves. Well, they don't lick. They don't have to.
Well, they don't have to.
They clean themselves.
They use that beak.
Yeah, and you don't have to sweet talk them or anything. You just have to tickle them
a bit and de-beak them, of course.
Yeah, well, of course, you have to de-beak them after they do the dirty work, but beforehand.
No, no. Yeah, you go ahead and do it afterwards, Dave.
Have you ever had one clamped onto your neck going for your jugular vein? Just trying to
suck the top of the tumors out of your skull?
No.
You've never had that?
No.
Prairie squid trying to spot?
You have never had a prairie squid go for your neck? Oh, man.
No.
You are missing all the sport and fun.
I thought you were ... I knew you were a secret follower of Christ. I could tell.
You are always talking that ... Jesus, you are a secret follower of the ...
Everything's different.
We just do it different in Texas.
The pale Nazarene, aren't you? You really are. You don't know what real fun is, man.
That's like Satanoplus, baby. That'll make you ...
How do you know? How can you stand in judgment of somebody until you don't know what fun

is?
I'm just saying, you don't know what a Lucifer high is until you've had one of those things.
Take that little beak and stick it right in there in the tender meat part and start ripping
your flesh apart.
Dave, you make me feel so normal.
I don't make you feel ... I make you feel like you are missing things. You are. You
should expand your horizons or at least try and open your left eye once in a while. I
know it's very painful and the pus and everything, but just wash ...
I feel like ... I love having conversations with you because in the end, I walk away feeling
like the sanest man who ever lived.
See, that's more cardboard delusion, they call that right there.
Maybe.
Oh, I talked to old so and so and now I feel better because he's way whacked out.
Stang, you're more whacked out than all of us.
Yeah, how elitist.
How elitist?
I mean, it's not a joke or anything.
That sounds elitist to me, man.
Yeah, yeah.
Bourgeois.
Right, right. You want one person to be in charge of being the weird person that is out
there?
How bourgeois.
Yeah, how bourgeois, man.
I'm actually here to talk to you about something.

I'm here to warn you.
I'm here to warn you of what is coming.
Some of us here know what is coming.
Oh, did you see that coming?
That's nothing compared to what is coming.
You think that was fucked up.
Wait till the fucking you're gonna get from Connie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Fuck your mother!
Connie!
Connie has come to some of us, Connie-ites.
And what you have to understand is that the Connie that you boys have been learning about
is not the true Connie.
You got to come with me!
Connie's the kind of chick who may have been the band whore, okay?
Connie is the woman who will come up to you even though you haven't got laid since, say,
1991.
Connie will fuck you.
Connie likes fucking losers like your asses.
Connie likes fucking your bobby, wimpy, non-slack-havin' bastard motherfuckers.
Connie likes doing this because Connie gets power from this.
And that's what you bobbies just don't understand.
Because every time you look at that Connie-ite walking across the field at X-Day or at one of these
Devivals and you're sitting there looking at it and going,
Man, she's got a nice ass.
Man, she has got a nice set of tits.
And you go home after the Devival or after X-Day and you're sitting there in your bed all alone.
And I know you're doing it.
You're sitting there and you haven't gotten laid in a couple of months, maybe six months, maybe a couple of years.
And you sit there and think about that blonde brunette redhead.
And that beautiful Connie-ite you saw.
And you pull out your penis and start pulling the pud.
You know what?
While you're jacking off thinking about that Connie-ite, you're giving Connie even more power.
Because every time you sit there and gawk at a Connie-ite or jack off about a Connie-ite.
Or maybe.
If you are the truly luckiest son of a bitch.
And you actually get to fuck a Connie-ite.
You are giving Connie more power.
And as you give Connie more and more power.
It sort of tilts the balance.
So I want to say to you.
Go ahead.
Look at my ass.
Go ahead and admire this nice set of natural non-silicone tits that I possess.
Yes baby.
Go ahead and look at all the Connie-ites.
Go ahead and stare.
Because every single time you look at a Connie-ite.
Bob loses a little bit of his time.
Bob loses a little bit more slack.
And Connie gains more and more power.
So boys keep it up.
Keep bringing your friends to the church.
And tell them about the free sex that we always brag about.
Just keep getting your little hard-ons following around Connie-ites at X-Day.
Hang around the pool and watch for the Connie-ites to get naked.
Go ahead.
Keep it up.
Because what you don't understand is.
And what staying over here doesn't understand.
And what all the rest of you boys don't seem to quite comprehend.
Is that the balance of power is changing, fellas.
And those Wiccans thought that the goddess power was something.
Just wait until Connie gets a hold of the reins.
Thank you.
