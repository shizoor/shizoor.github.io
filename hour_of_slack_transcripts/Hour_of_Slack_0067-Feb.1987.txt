Cha-cha-cha-cha! Cha-cha-cha-cha!
Oh, yes, dear friends, you will not turn your radio off.
You won't. You can't.
Because I'm going to play Half-Assed Drunk by Doctors for Bob later on tonight.
And I know that's the all-time favorite Aura Slack song.
So here we go.
Here we go.
Young human, could he be the one?
Maybe.
But will he be ours to control?
Never, never was a devil, always gonna get us a Samuel.
This is K-N-O-N, 90.90.N, FM, in Dallas, Texas.
This is the subgenre of radio ministry.
Aura Slack on K-N-O-N, 90.9 in the left excess.
Praise Bob.
Aura Slack on K-N-O-N, 90.9 in the left excess.
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.
Variety of ingredients.
You can create an appetite in the prospective customer.
Where are we, Bob?
The code is broken.
Trouble?
Big.
Security.
Security.
I have the lead on.
I'm tight.
Well, take it off for me.
The message is, Mars needs women.
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,
living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.
He's gonna make a million dollars.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I'm gonna make a million dollars.

Or they're destroyed.
Hey, King.
Watch Shaker.
Buy everything.
Come on.
Get up off that chair.
Follow me.
Ready?
Go.
The Soap Genius.
Our old Slack.
What?
We're staying up late for her.
Wouldn't you say?
Definitely.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Welcome, potential initials.
Yes, I love you.
The Soap Genius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only
to be played on radio station...
KNON!
And only in the...

The city of Dallas, Texas.
That thing always catches me.
Here's your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.
With special guests Will of Dobbs and D. Lee Williams.
The man on earth.
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.
I can't wait a moment longer. I've got to have sex with you.
The facilities are now enormous.
This is where the young composer feeds a fragment of it into several tape recorders and gradually...
I call him to Hong Kong to find what dream he's going to livestream in his next life.

Marina, no, no, no, no, no.
Se mi sente Rocco Granata, quello mi impicca, ragazzi.
Per poco non gli distruggevo la canzone.
Era la versione originalissima di quella canzone con il Rocco Granata in Marina.
Marina, Marina.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I couldn't understand a word you were saying there, but what the heck, you know.
This is Doctors for Bob, a half-assed drunk.
This song was dedicated to Jesse Presley, the aborted fetus twin brother of Elvis.
You can't arrest me, officer. I'm not drunk.
I might be half-assed drunk, though.
I'm half-assed drunk.
Hell, you know who you are.
When you got a hangover and it's all hung over back, say to your girlfriend's car,
I'm half-assed drunk.
Just you and me.
Sergeant Carter haircut, go-mop out, hook up.
Living off a LSD.
Half-assed drunk.
And I'm feeling blue.
Well, a flood come in and it washed away my den and my water bill's still past due.
Half-assed drunk.
Called my boss.
I ain't feeling quite right.
Well, it can't be Monday, cause I don't remember Sunday and my hands are sitting Saturday night.
Sweet love song.
Half-assed drunk.
Hell, I'm drunk, yeah.
Well, I used to have a job, but I'm sick of getting robbed, so I finally just up and quit.
Mama had a fit.
Half-assed drunk.
Well, my head feels odd.
Well, baby needs food.
But his daddy needs a lewd brother.
Baby better find himself a job.
Half-assed drunk.

I have ass drunk
And I'm having fun
Stopped on a hill
Cause I had to take a pill
But I couldn't quite find my tongue
Have ass drunk
Hell, I can see
Well, they said the light was red
Now a couple of folks
Well, there was 22 mangled
And there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good
He had to sort of walk like this
For the rest of his life
Well, there was one guy
It was pretty neat
He was hurt pretty good, I guess
They had like this machine
That was like hooked up
Where he had this tube running up
Through his nose, you know
And that was the only way he could breathe
And well, there was this one dude
It was like a blade
He'd chop straight down on his toes
And last I heard he still couldn't walk
There was one guy
Well, this is what's weird
They found parts of him on front of the car
And other parts of him on the back
Of the same car
I mean, it sort of defies the mind, doesn't it?
How you could find pieces of the same person
On the front and back of the same car
I mean, I just don't understand
They ought to run some kind of scientific test
I don't even see how that could even happen
And a couple folks dead
Well, it sure looked green to me
Half-ass drunk
Hell, I wish I was
Turned a brand new Trans Am
Into an old tin can
Trying to outrun the fuzz
Half-ass drunk
I'm a victim of lies
Well, there's nothing wrong with me, Your Honor
I can see, hell, I got you damn
D-Dug your eyes
Half-ass drunk
Oh, woe is me
Well, I don't want to be a victim of lies
I really pay, but it's steady every day
Breaking rocks till they're broke as me
Half-ass drunk
Hell, I'm half-ass drunk
Lord, I'm half-ass drunk
Just as sorry, oh, half-ass drunk
Party band, they tried to say we couldn't
We couldn't play our instruments
Well, we showed them we was a damn rock and roll party band
We a damn king of rock and roll
Pauly's the champion
We a damn king of rock and roll
We brought Dr. Bob, said, Dr. Bob, get down
Dr. Bob, get down so low
They gonna get down so low
They gonna make James Brown look high
They gonna make James Brown look so high
Oh, yes, dear friends
That's Jane or Hypercleans with Doctors for Bob there
With a special censored version of Half-ass drunk
Your favorite song
Yes, Doctors for Bob from Little Rock, Arkansas
And they're gonna be here in the studio
Sooner or later
And hopefully sooner
Oh, and...
Boy, I'll get in a lot of trouble that night
The power
But, uh...
Hey, did y'all just hear interference just then?
I listen to the show on headphones that are attached to a radio
So sometimes I hear, you know, when the lightning strikes
Or the poltergeist gets into the transmitter
I hear it the same as you
Anyway, you can call here tonight
To get information, more information about
What the heck kind of a show this is
This is the Church of the Subgenius Hour of Slack, dear friends
And you can call
That number is
823-8534
No, wait
Is that right?
No, 823-7490
823-7490, friends
God, what's wrong with me?
I wrote the wrong thing
823-7490
And speak to the Will of Dobbs
And try to figure out what's going on
Or you can write to the P.O.
Box number which we'll give at the end of the broadcast
So have those pencils ready
Ah, yes
And meanwhile, we must find
The way to get back
Back to where we came from
And it's like this
Notice, y'all don't talk about religion much
I guess it's real hip out here in California
It's a more
Humanistic approach to life
No, we believe in just letting the
Holy benediction of Bob
Flow out like pus from a pustule
You just said that?
I just don't understand the true power of the show
And wholeness
Oh, it's very fashionable to say
Bob is a good man
Oh, he was a prophet
But, uh, the son of Jehovah One
No, well
I don't go for these superstitions
You say
Very fashionable
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips and bended knees
But silently, by slow degrees
My spirit's eye to Bob composed
In hope
Humble trust my eyelids close
In reverential resignation
No wish described
No thought expressed
Only a sense of suffocation
A sense, or all my soul impressed
That I'm out in the street undressed
Church air, one soul per breath
Church air, one soul per breath
Get your breaths right here!
Don't need oxygen
For the Bob's early life
That too loudly we'd screech
In the toilet blaspheming
Whose clogged eyes and dark ears
This is supposed to be a religious show?
I thought there was a separation of church and state
Bob and country
Where the house of God is

And, of course, the church is a church
And your monsters were washed
Our battle all teased
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Funny joke!
Bob's a funny joke here!
What?
Bob's a funny joke!
You've certainly been leading your radio listeners down the great path here!
A big old joke!
I guess the conspiracy's a joke too
Oh slack, I guess that's a joke
Well, as they say pinkness is next to greenness
The green of the cabbage
And where they meet
On an old homo's grave
Can't say that.
The devil's hands are my ideal playground
I hold the seven-bladed windbreaker
The wheels that turn are behind me
I think backwards
Starship
I'm always here
I will do
Don't stop
Keep on saving
My pretty girl
I'm always here
I'll tell you Executive Director
Deliver me to kunnen
I'm thinking about football
I'm in love
I'm worried
Thinking about who'm going to win
And that's where it goes
I'm worried about the outside Кстати

We're going to win
Will get Shaun

I think the most important thing that your listeners need to know
is that the Church of the Subgenius is man's only hope for slack
in these coming end times.
That's exactly why we're here in Berkeley tonight.
Now, what is this fabled slack once of you speaketh?
Slack, Bob, is...
Slack, I guess you'd say, is the absolute and total absence of any stress whatsoever.
It's the highest state that man can try to reach in his spiritual or carnal quests.
If the last 50 years made such a change,
just imagine the New York of 1980,
when everyone has a number instead of a name,
and the government tells you,
whom you should marry.
Just imagine.
1980.
Here, dear, take your medicine.
Come on.
Let me have some more pills before you call.
There you are.
Now take care of yourself.
Yeah, take care of yourself.
I like to go to the lake and like to roller skate and walking around.
Um...
Um...
Um...



I like to do things that are different.
Yeah, someone with a lot of energy.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Okay, your code number once more?
37.
237, and you're calling from Dallas.
Right.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Hi, you're on hotline.
Um, yes, my code number is 238.
Truthfully, it's a little terrifying.
I live for a while in the shadow of Castle Frankenstein.
Glad to hear from you.
Turn the radio on.
Well, I think you'll get the show no matter how you're listening.
It's being beamed through the heads of all essential Northern California,
no matter what they do.
Yes, this is the show that never stops.
It's whistling.
We're on our way.
But I don't get it.
Oh, no.
The church air pass.
No, you don't.
I don't understand.
Where's Whistler?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
See, as long as the Whistler's on,
we seem to be at peace with our universe.
We don't like to be too confused.
We're able to do more things.
If happy little bloopers find me on the way,
why, oh, why?
Why can't I?
This is Negative Land, unreleased album.
Three, two, one, zero.
Nip, sink, crash, bang, shot, boom, glass.
Damn bright, drag, light, breeze, and grow.
To pop up my universal gang.
Aerial, great, shoot, shine, I'm sober.
Car-bomb!
Three, two, one, zero.
X-ray, air through the whaley rag.
Bed, valve, flywheel, left arm rest.
Crank shaft, tire jack, rear view mirror.
Plow spring, piston spring, proper foam ties.
Car-bomb!
Three, two, one, zero.
Black-eyed, needle-bound, dashboard batting.
Left cab, round tire, rear-chill wiper.
Lean-hand, little hand, radio dial.
Front three, back seat, air-container.
Car-bomb!
Three, two, one, zero.
Rubber hose, rocker valve, ninja nose, pedometer.
Spy, butt gas cap, cigarette lighter.
Headrest, speed, red registration.
Floor mat, firewall, accelerator pedal.
Car-bomb!
Three, two, one, zero.
Little gray radiator, tonic on the wire.
Kleenex, consent deck, charismatic fluid.
Headlight, seatbelt, side-row cover,
and a bumper sticker that says...
No other possibility.
Oh, Negative Land.
They're so fine, folks.
Too bad you can't buy that.
Wish you could.
You have to come to the subgeniuses
to find stuff like this.
Negative Land.
Oh, and this song here, I'm going to get out of it
after a minute, but it's a...
It's a good one to listen to after having seen
that show, America,
which I didn't get to watch yet,
but I'm sure we'll be using quotes from that
on Hours of Slack after a few years.
Oh, you got it.
Okay, the Dealey Llama here has it on tape, friends.
But, so you'll be hearing it.
But this is Negative Land, some more Negative Land.
And it's so wonderful.
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

And what exactly can the listeners do about this problem?
It's a regulatory problem.
It's taken right to the Internal Environmental Preservation Agency.
What's going on down there?
What do you think you're doing down there?
Phone call!
Oh, uh, you better get it.
Who are you folks?
That's right here in my script. Phone call.
Here we go, starting the show.
Okay, first exercise when you get on the show is you gotta learn how to do fire.
That's pretty good.
Here, buddy, put your fire away.
No, no, no, you're supposed to wrinkle cellophane.
Oh, jeez, I forgot. Oh, well, okay, that's my point.
Can't you guys do anything?
Now, just, uh, calm down. This happens all the time.
There's nothing to be worried about.
There are lots of little listeners that are this confused.
But what do we care about them? They're evil. Evil.
Okay, you are the user. What we'll do is we'll be putting you through the job control generator.
Then you go into the job control file. Then you go down to either the project file or up to the data processor.
When you go through the processor, you'll be using the CT channels.
Through the temporary process terrain and on up to the C1 data.
There is a place terrifying to us, to women.
It is said a man will come.
A man will come.
The Kwisatz Haderach.
He will go where we cannot.
You've heard of the Scientologists, you've heard of the Moonies, you've heard of the Holy Rollers and the Snake Handlers.
You've heard of all the false gods, you've heard of the false prophets, you've heard of the false witnesses.
This is like all of those all rolled into one a thousand times worse and yet...
True.
With so much, I mean, we can save that many more souls.
It's not the money we're after, you understand. It's not the money. It's really not the money.
It's the...
The souls. Your very soul.
The souls that...
The souls that need Bob.
Yeah, it's not the whole, the entire soul either.
It's just the part of your soul that has rubbed off onto the dollar bill say that you carry in your back pocket.
Or the bit of your soul which the signature on the check carries.
Bob can glean, he can read the ESP smudge that is on your dollars.
And if you have...
If you're thinking of Bob...
Bob is thinking of you.
And you are under protection.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
It is by the juice of sap food that thoughts acquire speed.
The lips acquire stains.
The stains become a warning.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
And Bob's thoughts of you are in direct proportion to your thoughts of Bob.
Uh-huh.
And even more direct proportion to your rewarding of Bob because...
Because what are thoughts? Thoughts are merely zephyrs, are they not?
Thoughts are fleeting.
Thoughts are impulses.
But then what is the concrete proof of thought?
What is the energy by which we measure thought in this wonderful and I might say the best of all countries?
Well, it is the wallet essence.
And that is indeed how Bob judges you as we judge others.
The amount of wallet essence to which you render up yea unto Bob.
These green pieces of paper otherwise known as money, are these in any way related to the holy scriptures?
Are these the actual...
Oh, no. No. No. No. Absolutely not.
Where's that water?
Oh.
The Pope is thirsty.
Oh, God. Sorry, Pope. Here we go.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
It is by the juice of sapu that thoughts acquire speed.
The lips acquire stains.
The stains become a warning.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
Up there, my child.
There dwells the one true God who created all living things.
The true God is the moon.
No end to the earth.
Bob is fill in the blank.
Let him enter your life.
We can't show you the tape interviews.
He wants to protect you.
He must protect you.
He has to protect you.
Joe, come on.
He says Bob will protect you.
You said the dollar will stop the spot.
1-4-0-3-0-6-7-1-4-1-4.

One dollar.
Dollar.
Dollar.
And of course that's what the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is here for.
I'm telling you, all other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.
Question number two.
Do you believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the death and burial and resurrection of him?
Sir, we absolutely believe in him.
Everything.
We believe in it wholeheartedly.
Now was the first beast before him and caused the earth and them who dwell on it to worship the first beast whose deadly wounds.
And he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven.
Bob's my friend and he's taking me somewhere.
Bob's my friend.
Bob's my friend.
And he's leading me somewhere.
Is he waiting there for me?
Is he waiting for me?
Bob's my friend.
Bob's my friend.
And he's leading me somewhere.
Leading me around.
What could be waiting there for me?
What could be waiting for me?
What could stop the aliens from killing me?
Doctor, let him kill me.
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Bob can't help me.
He can help.
But will he?
Will he help me?
Got nothing if I'll beg.
Bob's my inner guide.
And he's leading my body.
Leading my body.
He's even nice to my pets.
He's nice.
He's nice to my pets.
Bob's a good boy.
That was Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.
All of our friends in Dallas, Texas.
Yeah, can you believe people still live down there?
I thought everyone left when the dinosaurs died.
But no, no, no, no.
They're still down there moving around the streets and hanging around with the cow buckers.
And, well, friends, we hope everybody's feeling fine down there in the land of cowboys.
And cowgirls.
And, yeah, well, you know, you're just going to have to be careful.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Thank you, Jim.
Glass Madness.
Now, boys and girls, your parents are in bed.
So you can call.
You can call the Willa Dobbs here at 823-7490.
Got it right that time.
823-7490.
And Bob will protect you.
Bob will protect you.
Bob has to protect you.
He must protect you.
Bob is going to protect you.
I don't care whether he gets paid or not, dear friends.
But it's better if you pay him.
A hell of a lot better.
And I do mean that literally, dear friends.
I mean, he has to protect you.
And he wants to protect you, too.
The fall of animal matter from the sky.
Charles Fort suggests, quote, to start with, that we put ourselves in the place of deep sea fishes.
How would they account for the fall of animal matter from above?
They wouldn't try, friends.
Or it's easy enough to think of most of us as deep sea fishes of the kind.
M. Bois says of a substance, reddish, very reddish.

Varying to yellowish.
That fell enormously and successfully in France and Spain on April 30th through May 2nd.
That this falling substance carbonized and spread the odor of charred animal matter.
That it was not pollen.
That in alcohol it left a residue of resinous matter.
Hundreds of thousands of tons of this matter must have fallen, friends,
with the odor of charred animal matter.
Making one think of an aerial battle that occurred in interplanetary space several hundred years ago.
Hmm.
It's all very absurd because even though we're told of a prodigious quantity of animal matter
that fell from the sky for three days in France and Spain,
we're not ready yet.
That's all.
M. Bois says that this substance was not pollen.
The vastness of the fall makes it acceptable that it was not pollen.
It had an earthy insipid taste, says Signor Simenini,
and described it as unctuous.
When heated, the matter turned brown and black.
But at the same time that this matter fell from the sky,
loud noises were heard and stones also fell from the sky.
Black rains and black snows, friends.
Rains as black as a deluge of ink.
Jet black snowflakes.
Such a rain as that.
That which fell in Ireland on May 14th.
Fell upon a district of 400 square miles.
The color of ink of a fetid odor and very disagreeable taste.
It left, quote, a most peculiar and disagreeable smell in the air.
And Charles Fort continues in the Book of the Damned about these
damned things that fall from the sky.
Our intermediatist principle of pseudo-logic,
or our principle of consciousness,
is that nothing is unique or individual.
That all phenomena merge away into all other phenomena.
That, for instance, suppose there should be a vast celestial super-oceanic
or interplanetary vessels that come near this earth
and discharge volumes of smoke and time.
We're only supposing such a thing as that now,
because conventionally we're beginning modestly.
But if this were so, there would necessarily be some phenomenon upon this earth
with which that phenomenon would merge.
Extra-mundane smoke and smoke from cities merge,
and both would manifest in black precipitations of rain.
Now you figure it out, friend.
The music here is by Mark Mothersbaugh,
and I don't know where it comes from.
It was sent here from Brazil, so you got me.
The music is by Mark Mothersbaugh,


It's not just a matter of time before it emerges.

It's a matter of time before it emerges.
It's a matter of time before it emerges.
It's a matter of time before it emerges.
And if you want to keep listening,
you know what to do.
You got 43 hours to listen to tapes of my life,
and let me tell you something,
I've got tapes of my life,
I've recorded everything I did for the last two years,
and I'd like you to listen to it and tell me,
Am I crazy? Can you tell me?
Am I crazy? Or what?
Hey, wait a second, I just got a few more things I want to talk to you about,
because, well, you know, wait a second, wait a second, no, no, wait...
Three minutes and thirty seconds at three o'clock,
three minutes and thirty seconds at three o'clock,
how precise this morning,
humm, ga, ba, dang, ba, ba, do, hoo, hoo, hoo...
Oh!
I'll open all the lines and give you the opportunity to,
maybe even to blaspheme against me if you want,
but I'm sure you won't do it because,
oh, the next song is beautiful.
This is a beautiful song.
This is Gianni Morandi with his eyes of a girl.
Anyways...
What you're hearing now is from a group called Mystery Tapes.
This is a new discovery we've made.
I'll be giving their address down here,
towards the end.
Keep your ears open for Mystery Tapes.

Oh, this stuff we're listening to here is done on a Macintosh computer, not mine.
This is all straight out of Macintosh.
No synchro sounds.
Weird, weird, weird stuff there off of little, little bitty.
I mean, that's off a Macintosh so dumb it's like mine.
Dumb as mine.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's go.
And the Pope, David Meyer, Pope of New York.
I should just say that I've seen pictures, the one official picture that the church uses for publicity purposes,
the one picture of Bob.
And I can best perhaps describe what he looks like by saying he looks a bit like a cross between Hugh Hefner and Hugh Beaumont.
Right, right.
That's other names that have been mentioned.
Mark Trail, who also smokes a pipe and has the, that smile, that smile that seems to say.
It says, I know the mating habits of every animal and bless and forgive them all.
Yes.
The smile of Bob says, here in 1953.
Posing for the stupid pipe tobacco ad.
I know how cool I look in 1984 when I'm really needed.
So you'll, if you haven't seen Bob's face, well, all of you have, all of you have seen Bob's face.
You didn't recognize it for what it is.
Yeah.
Dennis Domenes' dad.
No, he had glasses.
Bob is a more manly fellow.
He's almost, almost too manly.
Not to, not to say that Bob hasn't.
He has a lower pompadour, I think, than Dennis Domenes' dad.
He looks very much the Bon Vivant.
Yes, he is.
That he is.
Bob has, Bob has a wife in every state of the Union and countless children.
It's, it's very hard for us to keep track.
And the funny thing is of all these wives, I've interviewed three or four of them and they all, they all claim that he's the perfect husband.
He's always around.
He's, he's good with the kids.
And of course, he's the per, he's the best breadwinner in the country probably.
Bob is fantastically wealthy.
He does not need your money.
We at the foundation to spread his word, we.
To do his work.
Yes, to do the good work, the best work, we do need.
I use a penis, I wash a penis, I wash a penis, I use a penis, I wash a penis, I use a penis, how much more to know?

This is the gravity pilot.

Bob.

Bob is sex.
.
Sex.
Bob is sex.
.
Bob, Bob is sex.
Who told you that?

Bob, Bob, .

Bob is sex.

Bob is...
Bob is...
Young girls.
They can be yours.
Thanks for my mind, Dr. Swabob.
Thanks for letting me keep my mind, Doc.
The Dobbs model was built by Carlo Rambaldi.
And it's articulated.
It can make 27 smirks and sneers.
And it's plastic face.
It has big, friendly plastic eyes, too.
Big, friendly eyes.
Experience time travel, anvil possession,
past wives, UF odors, and big feet
here on the mysterious hour and a half of misery and darkness.
Yes, you're hearing the authentic spewings and spoutings
of Ivan Stang himself, as well as Gary Gubofran.
And the word was...
And the evil, Dr. Howell.
Burn him, he's evil.
Evil.
So can we attune our consciousness...
...to the fire?
There we are.
Boy, that's the funniest of genius jokes.
Hey, dude.

You're ready to hang the gate on a flashing today.
You know the word will cause our
to be found?
I've heard.



I've heard.
I've heard.
I definitely have heard.
I've heard.
I've heard.
I've heard.
I've heard.
I've heard.
I've heard.


I've heard.

Dr. Christian Barnard, prominent heart surgeon, is here to address a medical convention about his now famous rear transplant
My boy, my boy, my boy Bob
My boy Bob
At first, they didn't take you seriously
Good
Then they began to be frightened
Good
They kept their opinions to themselves
Good
They stopped joining clubs
Good
They informed on their friends
Good
But you went on and on and on
Now they're beginning to ask themselves, maybe I'm next
Where will it lead to?
Nowhere
Hi, doctor
Doctor!
No, please doctor
I'm here
I beg you
Does this hurt?
Doctor
Does this hurt?
No!
Dr. Please
No, that's it
Doctor, please
No, wait, can you just
Here, just
No, just
This is from Byron Warner's tape
I have something to tell you
The Jelly Mind Generation
I don't think we should go on today, I think you're too upset
Doctor, doctor, please
Doctor, doctor, I didn't mean it that way
Doctor, listen to me
Fascism is very much with us today, boys and girls
It is a time of frequent immorality
I myself killed some 15,000
We will discontinue the interview to check the quality of the recordings
We'll switch you to the 16th tee where we'll show you in slow motion
Arnold Palmer, US opium champion
What kind of pictures am I carrying in my mind today?
You know, of course, that you are living in a power age
What are you doing with it?
What is money, anyway?
Indeed, all is chaff which blows away in the exhalations of Jehovah One
It only gains its true power at the moment that it passes from your pocket into Bob's
And since Bob isn't here, you can still send for that information from the church of the subgenius
And they need to be laundered
We have the pocket of Bob here
What is it?
They smell like they haven't been washed in months
But look, Connie did this embroidery
Through this, the envious Wellman slashed
And as he plucked his cursed steel away
Mark how Bob's special ichor followed it
As rushing out of doors to be resolved if Wellman so unkindly knocked her no
It is too Wellman
Then fall Dobbs
Then burst a mighty fart
Great Dobbs he fell
I'm not going to be able to let my kids listen to this show now
Way to go
Why, it's just an ancient Anglo-Saxonism from the early history of our race
Meaning to hit or strike
Yes, as in Farquhar

Hardenfartin
Oh, here we go
How many of you pyroflatulate?
You've been blown off pyroflatulate
Don't be embarrassed
Come forth and testify
It's the first thing the royal septuagint does
It's gasses through our lungs with the sound of
Call any time, day or night, if the spirits are moving
Remember, there will always be a subgenius pastor there to hear your words and receive your heart
Until you talk to me
Professionals welcome, women discourage
You're talking to me?
Oh, it's the Good Sex for Mutants League and now stationed in Utah
Say, I see a little light here on our board
It looks like we have a caller after all
Oh, whoopty-doo, caller
A slack fan boy
Maybe, but maybe one from France
Hello, you're on the air
Listen, I've got a problem
Uh-oh
Every time I die, something happens
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The valiant never taste of death but once
And, you know, if Bob lets you know for sure that there is an afterlife
Half the people in the world would commit suicide
So there's an evolutionary reason for this
We're interested in the
Half would kill themselves, it's a real drag
It's the before life that concerns us
That's right, it's the pre-life, the pre-existence
The sub-life, something which is a plane of existence below our own life
Hanging around in the ethereal nothingness
The underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence
Subligacular
Wait a minute, we've forgotten the customer again
Oh, yeah
Dear lady, please express your opinion
Please
What should I do?
Open your mouth
You must donate your heart to Bob
Yes, open your mind
In a figurative manner, of course
And open your wallet
Yes, and bend over
And touch your eyes
And receive the word of Bob, dear friends
I speak to you through the voice of Dr. M. Brady
You will be changed, you'll be a new being after that
You'll have giant, powerful television sets and be able to walk through walls
That sounds wonderful
Say, could you tell me
Are you as beautiful as all the women here in the Bay Guardian want ads?
Yes, we are

Bob
It's a beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Oh, yeah
Beautiful people everywhere
Bob
Bob
The way they comb their hair
Bob
Bob
Makes me want to say
Bob

Bob
It's a beautiful world, baby

We've started getting cassettes
From a group in Canada called
Mystery Tapes
And I'm going to give you their address
You can send them like three bucks
For a sampler cassette
After which you will
And with the catalog you get with that
It's almost as good as the subgenius catalog

Well, Ron Lindsay ought to be here
Any second
Literally any second now
To do the Soul Oldies show
In the meantime you hang on
It's Mark Motherspa
Whipping out some oldies but goldies
And then we're going to go to a bit of
Cleve Brother
Cleve Duncan
Doing one of his
Slackmaster Cleve
And girls you need to send those essays in
About why you want that date
Why you deserve that date with Cleve
Oh yes, this is Reverend Ivan Stang
Signing off of the hour
So praise Bob

No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!
The world is getting rougher day by day.
If you think it's gonna get any better, just keep dreaming away.
You've got to hold your head up high all day and night.
Cause your brain's gonna go crazy.
The only weapon you need to settle up a fight.
Cause no matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.
No matter how much you scream and shout, ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out.
No matter how much you piss and moan, ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone.
No matter how much you whack your head, you're better off living than being dead.
Hit it! Hit it!
Society pushes harder on you every day.
You've got to get what you make and you hear them say.
But you can't have your cake and eat it till you know.
There ain't enough to go around and it's starting to show.
The planet's getting fouler all the time.
For men from your brain.
The grape turned into wine.
We've got to destroy the forces that are still in your sack.
Scare all them mothers, give them one big heart attack.
We've got to regain control of our destiny.
Cause they want to take it away from you and me.
But we've got to stop all this fighting amongst ourselves.
Cause that just keeps them confused.
And they think,
That's swell.
Stand up for your rights and soon you'll win them back.
