1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,160
The subgenius hour of slack.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,880
You should run across him.

3
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,560
You would best think only good thoughts.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,120
Big implications.

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,940
The world's largest.

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,220
But what does it mean the world's largest giants cease to exist?

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,600
But what about Dobbs?

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,120
Dobbs may eliminate about 2,000 rank and file Dobbs as well.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,580
The good news is Dobbs, for now, appear to be safe.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,800
And so now we may start the revival, friends, with a solemn moment of noise.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,700
Praise Bob!

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,800
Praise Bob!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,780
Praise Bob!

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,020
I've noticed a lot of you have been here before and have learned the salute.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,280
That's called the subgenius salute.

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:24,880
The co-founder under Bob, Philo Drummond, reminded me of something we forgot 22 years ago,

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,160
which was the double salute.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,860
And this one's really hard.

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,180
Yeah.

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,020
Praise Bob!

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,620
Can you hear him?

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,220
Praise Bob!

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,360
Ah, that's bad music to my ears, friends.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,400
Okay.

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,720
Doctor, some of your detractors who call are objectionable to everything.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,440
Right, right, right.

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,880
And none of them can get through right now.

28
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,000
And so we've got...

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,260
We've got the four of you guys here on the lines, and nobody else can get through.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,500
The subgenius blockade.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,160
That's right.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,380
So this is an important charge to keep.

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,480
Sinister as much vaunted berms.

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:22,040
Now, as a denizen of that area, do you ever go light candles at the Poe House on Edgar Allen Poe's birthday or whatever it is?

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,800
No, no.

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,920
Mainly because around that time, Edgar Allen Poe's birthday is full of the goths.

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,720
The goths?

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:29,720


39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,800
The problem with that is that the goths have that tendency to not...

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,640
They're kind of like the worst part of the hippies with the worst part of the metalheads in the sense they're wearing all black.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
And they haven't bathed in a while, and they're wearing usually leather or vinyl.

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,060
And then they smoke closed cigarettes.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,360
So you have this sort of combination of sweat, closed cigarettes...

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,600
And grease paint, so they smell like clowns.

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,140
Oh, it's horrible.

46
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,760
It's a horrible, wretched mixture of smells.

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,960
You know, and I can't be around them long enough without getting...

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm nauseous or sick to my stomach.

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:08,300
I mean, I would bet that probably the horse stables at the Derby smell better than that group of people.

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,420
Oh, Stan, by the way, a bunch of people I found out through the Who's It's Whisperin' buttline,

51
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,560
a bunch of your students are cheating.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,560
What?

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
They have the tests and everything.

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,500
Cheating?

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,500
They have the tests and everything.

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,200
They have the stuff.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,120
They have all your, you know, it's not just the parts of your syllabus you leave out.

58
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,700
They have all the tests.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
The quizzes and everything.

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,900
Well, and plus it's already, there's cliff notes of it.

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,520
Well, in your course...

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,200
Well, LeGune was the one who was selling the tests, actually, I heard.

63
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,180
All that figures, okay.

64
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,760
You know, he was selling them for...

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,620
I don't remember what kind of profit he was making on them.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,000
And he was guffawing about it with me about, oh, I got the test.

67
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm just selling them to all the kids.

68
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,020
And he had a pretty good time with it.

69
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Well, selling the answers is one thing.

70
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,980
But to the stupid kids who couldn't get it even with...

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,480
You can't get the answers.

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,920
You got to sell them a grade, too.

73
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
And it's not selling the answers.

74
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,080
It's selling the questions.

75
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,780
That's where it is.

76
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,520
How hard is it to sell a grade?

77
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,340
Is the question...

78
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,940
And it's just saying Alex Trebek all of a sudden?

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,180
No, no, no.

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,580
It's selling the questions.

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
Because you can have the answers.

82
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,040
It's the question.

83
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,820
Isn't that what all those books in the self-help sections are about?

84
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:20,980
Selling the questions.

85
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,680
Didn't Einstein say something about not having the answers but all the questions?

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,440
Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,740
Among other things.

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,660
That's not all it is.

89
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:29,660


90
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:29,980
You would have to...

91
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:29,980


92
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,340
It's also about how people will believe any...

93
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,700
Radio Synesthesia from WCSB in Cleveland with Dr. Sinister, Priestess Pisces,

94
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,140
Rocknar, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

95
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,960
replayed here on Hour of Slack number 1154.

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,960
Now, they were...

97
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,340
They were talking about my course in subgenius history and cult management, an online course

98
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,840
at maybelogic.net, MaybeLogic Academy, which is...

99
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,440
This course is in its fourth of eight weeks.

100
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,540
And so for my students and you, the listener, I've saved up various clips and clops of the

101
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,940
old-timers of the church of the subgenius talking ancient subhistory.

102
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:39,380
It's mostly puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrum and myself on KPFA or Pirate Cat

103
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,760
Radio, Season in Hell, John Hell's show.

104
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:56,360
Although the intro titles and collages were by either Fernanda Nettie-Lemur or NorRailPref.com.

105
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,940
In this cut, in fact, that's coming up...

106
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:08,960
We're talking about rival cult leaders like L. Ron Hubbard, David Koresh, Walt Disney.

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,300
What about people like Crowley?

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm not saying something that you like.

109
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,020
No, he doesn't.

110
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,880
But when I'm trying to get something done...

111
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,760
Although Mr. Hubbard...

112
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,980
He's running his own thing.

113
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,620
...at a huge influence.

114
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,220
...go ass out into the mountains.

115
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,020
Scary Scientologist.

116
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,780
Yes, well, it's...

117
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,680
I love their questionnaire.

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,400
That alone made me want to go talk to Bob.

119
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,940
What's scary is the way the people come out and read it.

120
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:29,940


121
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:29,940


122
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:29,940


123
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:29,940


124
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,140
And react to it.

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,980
Perhaps it doesn't appear scary until you see the devoted practices of the beloved.

126
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,800
And then it's really scary.

127
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,880
Just like Bob.

128
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, even Bob has those people and it would be wrong to deny that it does.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,940
I've seen people get pretty scared of head-launchings.

130
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,240
Back when we were publicly doing head-launchings, there were people that would pass out, flee,

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,480
flee.

132
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,840
Now this is no longer a sacrament of our church, but at one time it was a standard

133
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,120
part of every devival.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,900
When the leading head of the World Cup golfers would be launched via golf club in the middle

135
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,980
of a religion-heavy symbol-freted ceremony.

136
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,420
But that was a different time.

137
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,860
That was before September 11 changed all.

138
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,860
See, I told you, Ron.

139
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,320
Hey, Ron.

140
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,140
September 11.

141
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,980
I changed my name to September 11.

142
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,200
I changed my name to September 11.

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Not two hours.

144
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,220
Not two hours.

145
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,740
Tied down by ancient truth.

146
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:31,740


147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,640
And the whole world came apart.

148
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,860
Yeah, on this radio station.

149
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,180
That's why I wasn't feeling well between those couple of hours.

150
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,100
I just had to change my name.

151
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,920
There was something going on.

152
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,440
With K-Rob's help, I had to just get it off me.

153
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,200
I thought it was gas.

154
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,380
I had to get those words.

155
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,820
I mean, in the end, it was gas.

156
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,540
Hard.

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,440
Over and over again.

158
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,280
William Gas.

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,860
Yeah.

160
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,420
That's okay.

161
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,760
Hellfire.

162
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,540
Hellfire.

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,460
For those of you that care, I changed my name back when the show was over.

164
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,800
I know.

165
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:54,800


166
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,760
Haas.

167
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,200
Haas and Haases.

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,160
Haas.

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,340
Haas.

170
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


171
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


172
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


173
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


174
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


175
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


176
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


177
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


178
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


179
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


180
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


181
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


182
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


183
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,340


184
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,720
It makes me really miss radio stations.

185
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,820
Where was it?

186
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,160
KDIA out of Oakland.

187
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,740
Used to do the Sunday Church Shows.

188
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,640
In Dallas, Fort Worth, it was K-Scott.

189
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,880
Voice of the Gospel.

190
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,060
And Philo and I would tape record hours of that stuff.

191
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,200
Those guys were great.

192
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,200
I don't know if it still.

193
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,860
I would assume that it still on.

194
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:28,100
But the classic Texas radio preachers in the 80s were something to behold, and certainly

195
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,220
great viewers.

196
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,820
training ground for the young subgenius

197
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,460
preachers. So how common, like that

198
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,680
one we just heard, how common would something like that

199
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,520
actually be on the radio? All day long,

200
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
every day. But I mean, he's swearing up a storm on that one.

201
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,840
Oh no, not the cussing. But he would be yelling at you.

202
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,640
That was a special

203
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
recording. Right.

204
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,520
But other than the swearing, that

205
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,260
kind of berating of the congregation

206
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,860
would have been somewhat common on the

207
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,100
holy days that they weren't showing up?

208
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,900
Some preachers were more

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,420
stern than others.

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,980
Those are the ones you want to listen to.

211
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,100
Scare the crap out of you.

212
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,320
I'm sick of dead preachers

213
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
preaching dead sermons

214
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,240
to dead congregations.

215
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,980
Excuse me. We're tired of

216
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,260
undead preachers preaching undead

217
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,520
sermons to undead congregations.

218
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:15,920
Pretty much.

219
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,560
Hi Thomas. Mom.

220
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,200
I've got a problem. Well you see, it's not really

221
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
me. It's my cold.

222
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,360
It's suicidal. Your cold

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,980
is suicidal?

224
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Mom, wait. Mom, wait.

225
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
I just don't know what to do.

226
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,400
Tell me, please.

227
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,900
Shh. Can you hear it?

228
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,220
Post, post, post. Logical society?

229
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,480
Wow. Unplugging

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
morally suicidal cold. Complete mess.

231
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,220
Complete mess. Eating our lunch in America.

232
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,360
The tide of godlessness. 1-800

233
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,500
suicidal cold. That number again

234
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,560
is 1-800 a slice

235
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
of suicidal cold.

236
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,580
Speaking of marionettes, I was

237
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,640
watching that movie Team America

238
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,620
with my dad. He was

239
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,520
really enjoying it, but he started trying

240
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
to convince me that it was

241
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,800
computer animation

242
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,900
made to look like marionettes.

243
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,500
He'd become so

244
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
distrustful of

245
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,940
Hollywood special effects.

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,540
I was saying something

247
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,280
like, you know, those are pretty

248
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,420
nice marionettes. There was a marionette

249
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,720
operating a marionette the very first shot.

250
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,020
Yeah, that was a good opening.

251
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,680
He said, well, that's

252
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,620
just computer animation. They draw

253
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,760
those strings. I said, you can

254
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
see the strings.

255
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,020
They draw those in to make it

256
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,040
more realistic.

257
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,640
You know, in this world, the way this world

258
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,660
is, I might find out half of it was right.

259
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,660
Yeah, ever since the Zapruder film,

260
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,140
it's been hard to trust anything

261
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,660
on film.

262
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
And now they're saying that there's other videos shot

263
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,520
from that day in Dallas when you actually

264
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
see the guards, his

265
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
detail stand down.

266
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,400
You see it stand down just before the shooting.

267
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
And that's out on Brass Check TV.

268
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,560
The secret security ducks right

269
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,280
before the shots.

270
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,180
Brass on TV.

271
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,740
This is one of the security guys.

272
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,420
They keep looping it over and over. See, look, watch him

273
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,520
shrug his shoulders as if to say,

274
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,680
what are we doing? And you keep saying this.

275
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,280
Over and over.

276
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
And right there, that's proof

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,240
that Kennedy's men stood down and

278
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,300
he got assassinated.

279
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,100
It's better to watch people doing JFK Reloaded

280
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,500
where kids take the game and make JFK

281
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,900
do things like they come down

282
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,740
and around and they go really fast and hit the median

283
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,640
strip and go up over the grass

284
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,400
and go on the other side and roll the,

285
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,960
the occupants out of the limousine and they die.

286
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
Wow. And that's pretty cool.

287
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,160
And there's all that kind of stuff on YouTube.

288
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,060
I like that poster by Coop

289
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,540
that shows Kennedy with the bullet

290
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,340
going through, but it's zigzagging

291
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,400
all over the place before it even

292
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,260
reaches him. And then it zigzags

293
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,380
again and hits the other vitals and then exits.

294
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,280
That's one of the reasons I bought that.

295
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,880
It ends up looking great, too.

296
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,120
But there's other reasons in that book that I bought, where I bought that book.

297
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,340
There's some great posters in there.

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
If, of course, you like the Tiki Generation,

299
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,000
which I do.

300
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,180
Stool softener capsule.

301
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,760
I grew up in Tiki World,

302
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,040
so this Malomar

303
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,900
version of it is sickening.

304
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,140
Except for Mongo Lounge, because they're kind of

305
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,400
they make me throw up in my mouth a little bit.

306
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,980
Is the scene

307
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,840
of the JFK shooting still preserved?

308
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
Do people go there and drive and take pictures?

309
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh, yeah.

310
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,700
It's the only tourist attraction

311
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,140
in Dallas, practically.

312
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,880
We've all

313
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,100
made pilgrimages there

314
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,380
almost an hour.

315
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,080
In fact, when I met these guys in 19,

316
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,380
I came out in 1980

317
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,360
with my girlfriend and a guy who lived from Sulphur Springs.

318
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,520
You know where that is, folks.

319
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,840
And I had, they, these people,

320
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,100
Milo and Stank became my friends forever

321
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,120
because they took a box of clown suits and guns

322
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,000
and overman heads.

323
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,300
And I had my space suit and we ran up and down the grassy hill

324
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,720
and had films of us with weapons running off.

325
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,300
Terrible, tragic day.

326
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,960
Yeah.

327
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,820
Everything except the Oswald shooting, unfortunately,

328
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
which we neglected to shoot.

329
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,540
Yeah, I got to play the killer clown.

330
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,560
That was fun.

331
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,800
That was fun, friends.

332
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,060
Filming a reenactment of the JFK shooting

333
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,720
in Dealey Plaza in 1980

334
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,800
with Poe's Ling and Phyla and so forth.

335
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Not as fun as the real thing.

336
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,120
Anyway, friends, later in that John Hell show,

337
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,360
we hear puzzling evidence

338
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
reminiscing about when Nina Hagen,

339
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,100
the famous German rock singer,

340
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
saint of the church, Nina Hagen,

341
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,260
came to our San Francisco, or Los Angeles show

342
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,500
and invited us to her cult.

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
Nina Hagen invited me to go take acid with her.

344
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,420
And I chickened out because of her 12 young men

345
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,920
her posse around us scared me to death.

346
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,660
None of them were allowed to take acid,

347
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
but they had to stay there the entire time

348
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,220
and be the circle around you.

349
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,420
And she would promise you that as long as you're in the circle,

350
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,400
you're safe.

351
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,200
Exactly.

352
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,660
That's it.

353
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,740
And I would be in bed with her and that would be happening.

354
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,640
All the 12 guys would be watching.

355
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,060
Standing, holding hands.

356
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,340
Nude in front of you.

357
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,800
And I'm there with Nina and I thought,

358
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,200
this will be a bit much.

359
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,100
Wow.

360
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,120
But Wilder and Weird Al Yankovic came,

361
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,900
Gary's mom came, that was a fun night.

362
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,020
Try to explain the popularity of the church of subgenius.

363
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,880
I mean, its popularity clearly is big among college campuses,

364
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,880
music groups, and now with the internet.

365
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,580
I mean, the internet, you guys are kind of hot stuff.

366
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:51,020
Well, we were probably the first religion

367
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,700
to really exploit the internet because it's a religion

368
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,700
that attracts so many nerds and geeks and AV kids.

369
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,380
AV?

370
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,020
Yeah.

371
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,740
You were probably the AV kid.

372
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,460
Audiovisual?

373
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:07,960
Yeah.

374
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,640
You know, the kid that loaded the projector.

375
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,300
I know.

376
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,640
Yes, I was.

377
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,120
Okay.

378
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,120
You got me.

379
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,560
Everybody in radio was the AV kid.

380
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,360
Yeah, I was too.

381
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,680
Anyway, so we've always had a lot of,

382
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,520
I mean, there were people trying to explain the internet to me back in the 80s,

383
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,440
but they couldn't, they were so weird, they couldn't explain it to me.

384
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,080
I didn't really understand it until Milo forced me to look at America online.

385
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,060
That was in the 90s, and then I became a computer,

386
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,100
a really serious computer geek.

387
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,140
But yeah, I think the internet kind of saved us because as far as popularity goes,

388
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,760
we don't really have much.

389
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,100
By definition, you know, this thing, if it appealed to everybody, that would defeat the purpose.

390
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,760
So we never did make it to the pet rock fad stage,

391
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,720
but we're a tenacious thorn in the side of the conspiracy

392
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,180
that they'll never really be able to make go away

393
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,860
because it's gotten a little bit too big now to ever completely shut down.

394
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,120
So people will probably, you know,

395
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,920
they'll probably be seeing those darn bob faces grinning at them

396
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,240
from the oddest places forever.

397
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,780
Forever?

398
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,500
Yes.

399
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,660
So in that respect, it's as, well, you know,

400
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,340
look how far the Mormons have come in a very, very short time.

401
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,580
Relatively speaking, yeah.

402
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah, and the Scientologists in an even shorter time than that.

403
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,320
And of course, they've got a little bit of star power health there.

404
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah.

405
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:47,840
Yeah.

406
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,660
Well, but, you know, they're appealing to a lower common denominator.

407
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,440
Oh, no kidding.

408
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,300
Yeah.

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,060
And that, you know, for a subgenius to say that, that's a really deep insult.

410
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,420
Well, I was going to say, we know.

411
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:12,360
By the way, when this show started, you quoted the subgenius gods called the Firesign Theater.

412
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,480
Oh, my word.

413
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,240
I recognized that quote.

414
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,820
And probably it's sad that not more than a hundred people have heard it.

415
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:17,820


416
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,400
I think more listeners would be familiar with the Firesign Theater.

417
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,340
You know, that happens to be one of my all-time favorites.

418
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,040
I mean, for all kinds of reasons, you know, reasons I can't even divulge.

419
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:37,400
But, you know, for anybody who, it was a send-up on old-time radio done in a fashion that would

420
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,420
have done old-time radio proud.

421
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,460
The writing was brilliant, not to mention a little off-center, but enough to be so well-done

422
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,940
that all you could do is sit there in rapt attention and watch your stereo.

423
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,220
Yeah, you had to listen to each album three or four times just to figure out what the

424
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,040
plot was.

425
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah.

426
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
Oh, and, you know, more science.

427
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,760
And the wordplay was like the Marx Brothers multiplied.

428
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,160
Well, and they would, they said, no, no, you don't know how radio works.

429
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,680
You have to start over here and then you go over there.

430
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,340
You know, I mean, that's brilliant.

431
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,280
They were the real inspirators of all of the subgenius radio people.

432
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,040
There's a bunch of us.

433
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,740
I like that one.

434
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
He walks by night.

435
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,600
And, you know,

436
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,160
Nick Danger.

437
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,900
Yeah, Nick Danger, third eye.

438
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,360
You know, hello, Mr. Danger.

439
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,280
My name is Rocky Rococo.

440
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,320
I could tell it was him because of his smarmy appearance and his heavy perfomance.

441
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:57,260
The TV called me part of that stage.

442
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:06,960
You know, that guy, you know, besides police, the

443
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,800
briefcase scientist who just swung out like no one could see.

444
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,340
I mean, it was going out of mute.

445
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,340


446
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,260
Do you listen to Prairie Home?

447
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,500
Prairie Home Companion?

448
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,820
I have not, no.

449
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,440
Garrison Keillor?

450
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,980
I have in the years ago.

451
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:35,740
Yeah, he does a segment, a shtick, which is a direct descendant of Nick Danger about a private eye and the city that sleeps it, that knows how to keep its secrets.

452
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,300
And Guy Noir.

453
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,840
Guy Noir.

454
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,840
I mean, you know, Nick Danger, Guy Noir is a direct descendant of it.

455
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:52,200
And you know that Garrison Keillor used to sit with long hair, imbibing on Mexican fruit, just watching his stereo.

456
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,480
You know, strangely enough, there was a time when even Rush Limbaugh was doing that.

457
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,180
Oh, well, I happen to know that for a fact.

458
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,360
I had a buddy of mine that used to work together back in rock radio.

459
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,000
Really?

460
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,720
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
He works in New York.

462
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,060
He's an old friend of mine.

463
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,280
People change over time.

464
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,760
Go figure.

466
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,520
I just devolved.

467
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,200
I never evolved.

468
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,500
You guys probably don't know about Subspecies 23, do you?

469
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,640
No.

470
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,740
Tell us.

471
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,360
Tell us.

472
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,120
Tell us.

473
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:25,600
Tell us.

474
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:39,400
Four years ago, a subgenius calling himself Subspecies 23 would occasionally post to the news group alt.slack.

475
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,140
And he wasn't a particularly noticeable guy.

476
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,460
He.

477
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,800
Seemed like a quiet person.

478
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,240
A regular kind of shy, quiet guy.

479
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,860
Uh-oh.

480
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,140
And he was around for about a year.

481
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,220
I think he got tired of it.

482
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,940
And some of the smarty-mouth subgeniuses probably made fun of him and offended him.

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,560
And he quit.

484
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,520
He went on and did other things over the next four years.

485
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,360
And the last thing he did before they put him in prison was kill a 13-year-old girl.

486
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,840
Smarty-mouth.

487
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,480
This was in Oklahoma.

488
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,200
Small town in Oklahoma.

489
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,620
He killed his neighbor and planned to eat her.

490
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,980
He was going to be a cannibal.

491
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,520
And, of course, he hadn't had anything to do.

492
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,860
He got caught before he could even get the stove heated up.

493
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:38,540
But for some reason, because he had posted on the internet to us four years earlier,

494
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,540
we got dragged into every news report about this guy.

495
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,580
You know, this subgenius member.

496
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,160
He wasn't even a member.

497
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,960
I looked him up.

498
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,000
He never joined.

499
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,140
He did buy Media Barrage No. 5 CD and a couple of other products.

500
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,060
Can we play that one again?

501
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,660
Yeah.

502
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,020
No.

503
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,940
Of course not.

504
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,840
We're not irresponsible.

505
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,580
If he's sentenced to death, does he get to his last meal, whatever he asks for?

506
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,520
That's the rule.

507
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,180
If he asks for a 13-year-old, do they have to give him one?

508
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,600
Just the right way.

509
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,960
Yeah, of course they do.

510
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,380
A Filipino.

511
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,140
That's one of the subgeniuses we'll never live down.

512
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,240
But he is.

513
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,880
He never did actually send in his $30, so he's still tsk-tsk to Bob.

514
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,600
Bob.

515
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:24,980
Bob.

516
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,540
Bob.

517
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:25,760
Bob.

518
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,780
Leaders.

519
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,300
The potato tuber.

520
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,940
The United Nations has declared 2008 the International Year of Unusual History and a happy accident.

521
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,440
Boom.

522
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,780
Boom.

523
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,160
Boom.

524
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,380
Friedrich Engels even declared and mourns the pity.

525
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,580
Rotten leaders have done it all.

526
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Variously thought.

527
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,800
Caused leprosy.

528
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,380
To be associated with the devil.

529
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,700
People then realized Adam Smith observed at the time.

530
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,240
Mashed, fried, boiled, and roast.

531
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,980
Roast neighbor.

532
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,160
An unusual history by Norell.

533
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,160
A segways into the unusual history of giant sculptures of bob heads.

534
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,540
That's part of why I got into the Burning Man cult.

535
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,960
Is because of that.

536
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,460
The head.

537
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,400
That thing on the end of the thing.

538
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
The head.

539
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,560
The head.

540
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,560


541
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,340
It was so gorgeous and so well done.

542
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,720
This is thousands of dollars of soji screen work.

543
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,540
Big head.

544
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,420
Big head.

545
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,200
And those guys were just filling it up with fireworks and burning the damn thing.

546
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,840
Back when it had feets and it used to stand on the ply, I remember.

547
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,580
And you could, the little feets had little.

548
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,420
Ninety-four.

549
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,380
Yeah.

550
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,220
We've been tearing up big heads for a long time.

551
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,920
Yes.

552
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,780
One night Gary was really, really, really, really sick and I was doing a tape to you.

553
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Like the one that went into the back.

554
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,200
On a 305, or 350, the big Sony 350.

555
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,140
And I was bringing Paul from his house.

556
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,700
Over here.

557
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,920
And stopped in the mud flats in Berkeley.

558
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,800
And cut a big head from a pipe down there.

559
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,320
And brought it over because Gary was in bad shape.

560
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,320
He was in bad humors.

561
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,980
And I brought that big head.

562
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,120
He made a head.

563
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,020
He did.

564
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,720
Exactly.

565
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,100
And I put it on his back porch.

566
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,960
You gave him head.

567
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,100
I gave him head.

568
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,300
How big was it?

569
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,740
About the size of the side of the wall.

570
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,380
It was gigantic.

571
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,020
And I put it on his back porch window.

572
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,580
And then I ran away and called him.

573
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,060
I said, go out of the room.

574
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,560
And you're in.

575
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,020
And go looking back porch.

576
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,140
And I could hear him start laughing.

577
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,940
And who's built the largest of bob heads to date?

578
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,040
I believe it was the monologue.

579
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,420
The man sitting next to you.

580
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,220
Yeah.

581
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,180
Wait a minute.

582
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,840
What are you talking about?

583
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,440
Who built the biggest Dobbs head?

584
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,320
I mean, aside from the Colossus of Rhodes.

585
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,740
I believe there was that one Stan Peskett made.

586
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,160
Yeah.

587
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,540
Stan Peskett was incredible.

588
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,180
It was very large.

589
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,400
That was the full head.

590
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,680
But then there was the one that Mongoloid made.

591
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,400
From when?

592
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,280
Which breathed the teeth.

593
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,340
Oh, yeah, yeah.

594
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,220
No, it might have been larger.

595
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,800
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,140
It's true.

597
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,820
Which belched fire.

598
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,520
Wow.

599
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,660
Where was this from?

600
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,800
And that's where he spoke.

601
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,140
The head, it was a static head.

602
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,660
Yeah, that's.

603
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,500
Not a static head.

604
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:01,620
Yeah.

605
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,440
No, that one wins.

606
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,200
It was a living head that Mongoloid built.

607
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,020
Where was it?

608
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,280
It talked like the Wizard of Oz head.

609
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,020
With Hal's voice.

610
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,760
Right.

611
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,860
And we would ask it.

612
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,640
It was an oracle.

613
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,960
We would ask it questions.

614
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,960
You know.

615
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,300
Yeah.

616
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,860
No.

617
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,900
Those who have not sent their $30 shall burn in the lake of fire.

618
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,060
And shoot fire out of its nostrils.

619
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,460
It sounds like Burning Man.

620
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:39,600
As I understand it, that giant Dobbs head was left in Tucson and ended up on somebody's front lawn who lived next to the freeway.

621
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,280
Is that true?

622
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:40,660
Yeah.

623
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:49,760
So during rush hour, people driving through Tucson were forced to gaze upon that slackful head on their way to or from work.

624
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,560
Excellent.

625
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,960
That'll win two gunverts a day.

626
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,860
And they won't even know.

627
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,140
It'll be too late by the time they get there.

628
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,360
That was the last I heard of it.

629
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,080
Do you know what I mean?

630
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,560
Yeah, I understand.

631
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,800
Yeah, Chicken John and I drove the giant Dobbs head out to Tucson for the revival there.

632
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,400
And I understand the promoter or the club owner underpaid us.

633
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,960
And in retaliation, we cursed him by leaving the giant Dobbs head on his lawn.

634
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,220
Excellent.

635
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,100
Was that the Hutt show?

636
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,740
At the Hutt?

637
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,300
Yeah.

638
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,820
Wow.

639
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,460
Of course.

640
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,220
It's the only show in Tucson.

641
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,900
Wow.

642
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,700
These guys at the tattoo parlor wanted to pick a fight with Al and myself.

643
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
That was a hell of a big Dobbs head.

644
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,220
Because of the ranger markings on the vehicle.

645
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,980
Yeah, they couldn't understand why I was a ranger in Nevada but not in their state or in California.

646
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,540
Yeah.

647
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,300
Yeah.

648
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,100
Yeah.

649
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,340
Yeah.

650
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,360
Yeah.

651
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,360


652
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,360


653
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,180
I always got HBO and Tequilas.

654
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,340
Do you guys get in trouble a lot for your vulgar humour?

655
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,920
Well, I wouldn't say that.

656
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,860
Misunderstood statements, shall we say.

657
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,720
Every other show or so, they kill us.

658
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,980
They have had their issues with the...

659
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,220
When I was to have the show in...

660
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,140
Rise up out of the grave.

661
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,580
When I had the show in Dallas, I had to apologise to everybody in Vietnamese.

662
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,100
In Vietnamese?

663
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,320
Well, the offensive thing that was broadcast on my show was in Vietnamese,

664
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,280
and my show followed the Vietnamese hour.

665
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,980
And I didn't know for sure that the fellow had translated my mess,

666
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,040
my Bob...

667
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,040
message nicely.

668
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,720
Was a Bob message thought to be insensitive to Vietnamese people?

669
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,260
Well, the message that I asked my Vietnamese friend to record for me

670
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,340
was supposed to say,

671
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,780
Bob wants peace all over the world,

672
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,700
you know, even between the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese exiles.

673
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,960
And if there isn't peace, Bob will kill everybody.

674
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,040
And that offended the Vietnamese exiles who were listening to the show.

675
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,040
And the next show I had to broadcast an apology,

676
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,960
both in English and a recorded one in Vietnamese,

677
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,440
which luckily the recorded one must have been what it was supposed to be

678
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,420
because I wasn't killed again after that.

679
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,820
Well, apparently you backtracked and made amends.

680
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,460
But if you'll go to Philodrummond on YouTube right now,

681
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,560
you'll see a funny thing.

682
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,040
It's really funny.

683
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm looking through a little glass window at philodrummond.com's face,

684
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,280
and it is a funny thing.

685
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,020
Yes.

686
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,500
It's not philodrummond.com.

687
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,120
Beckoning you on.

688
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,520
It's...

689
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,480
Well, it would be funny were it not so sad to quote...

690
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,600
The beckoning fair one.

691
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,580
Jimmy Swagger.

692
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
Exactly, man.

693
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,340
Together, together, together.

694
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,360
Oh, we're gonna be together, we're gonna be like my Donald Trump.

695
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,360
Together, together, together.

696
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,640
C'mon.

697
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,200
Together?

698
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:41,920
Together.

699
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,340
Together?

700
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,040
What we're going to do is to do Hercules.

701
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,840
Fyke rock music for rock абсолют rhythm.

702
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,280
Rhythm.

703
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,500
Fine, the fine, rock music.

704
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:04,800
.

705
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:04,800


706
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,920
Thank you, Norrell,

707
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,040
who also did the Super Mario vs. UB40,

708
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,500
a little bit of music earlier.

709
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,300
And now, back to a season in hell in December,

710
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,060
as we watch YouTube.

711
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,160
We're watching, we're hearing part of

712
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,180
Pipes of the Piposphere.

713
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,400
You know, you guys need one of those little cameras in here, too.

714
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,640
Oh, that's one of the classics of Genius Underground films.

715
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,980
Pipes of the Piposphere?

716
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,340
It's often shown with Kenneth Anger retrospectives.

717
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,060
Uploaded to YouTube by the one and only Philo Drummond.

718
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
Pipes of the Piposphere.

719
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,960
I helped with the special effects on that.

720
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,080
There's one right there.

721
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,760
Award-winning, mind-breaking special effects.

722
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,260
There's another one.

723
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,220
It's basically zombies of the stratosphere

724
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,100
was being played on the television,

725
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
and we superimposed pipes

726
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,820
into all of the characters or vehicles

727
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,740
and overdubbed the dialogue.

728
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,960
Only we did all this in one take in a hotel room.

729
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,580
And the nine minutes that it took.

730
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,840
Superimposing the pipe was somebody's hand

731
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,820
holding the pipe against the TV.

732
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,260
Not just in front of people, either.

733
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,140
Moving vehicles and such.

734
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,780
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,140
There was a pipe marine, you know,

736
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,420
the pipe mobile.

737
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,660
Quote from the BBC.

738
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,760
Muslim scientists and clerics have called for the adoption of...

739
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,020
The...

740
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,020


741
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,020


742
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,400
Right, here we go.

743
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,680
You know, there was a subgenius operating system,

744
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,280
Slackware Linux.

745
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,920
Oh, really?

746
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,440
From Reverend Volkerding.

747
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,420
Yeah, yeah, one of the main Linux iterations,

748
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,660
especially in the 90s, is Slackware.

749
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,580
Does it open your applications when it feels you're ready for it?

750
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,840
I don't know if it even does that.

751
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,720
I never monkeyed with it myself.

752
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,200
Microsoft had a short-lived operating system called Bob,

753
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,220
for which they trademarked the name Bob for operating systems.

754
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,060
Okay.

755
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,820
And it was designed for little old ladies.

756
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,240
It was supposed to be the simplest thing in the world.

757
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,880
It showed it.

758
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,660
It was supposed to be a desk, a picture of a desk.

759
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,500
And if you wanted to write a letter,

760
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,900
you clicked on the letter on the desk.

761
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,100
And, you know, if you wanted to look at a picture,

762
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,480
you clicked on the photo on the desk.

763
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:13,920
Oh, my.

764
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,660
And there was a little bespectacled smiley face avatar

765
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,780
that told you how to do things,

766
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,920
and he was called Bob.

767
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,420
If you wanted to masturbate,

768
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,360
you clicked on a little sperm puddle on the desk.

769
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,820
Like that Microsoft paperclip character.

770
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,100
It was one of Microsoft's biggest failures.

771
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,020
Yeah, I can imagine.

772
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,920
What was this?

773
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,460
It was in the late 80s, I guess, early 90s.

774
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,340
I was going to say, that's definitely going back a ways.

775
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,540
Well, I became a computer geek.

776
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,660
I bought a computer when the first Macintosh came out in 84.

777
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,260
Okay.

778
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,240
But I only used it as kind of a glorified typewriter

779
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,760
until the 90s when I opened up a sample copy of Bryce.

780
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,980
It's like a three,

781
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,000
very simple copy of Bryce.

782
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,000


783
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,140
It's a simple 3D landscape-making program.

784
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,940
And that changed everything.

785
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,500
All of a sudden, it was like I became an animator again

786
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,120
after leaving it all alone for 20 years.

787
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,680
And you've been doing, I'm assuming, animation-wise,

788
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,180
just pen to film.

789
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,360
Is that right?

790
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,760
I used to be a stop-motion animator.

791
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,000
Okay.

792
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,200
So very analog of to digital.

793
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,020
Very, very analog.

794
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,880
And then just, well, actually, to tell the truth,

795
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,980
it's because we got done with it.

796
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,680
Donations of decent computers.

797
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,860
The great Gription Clench in North Carolina

798
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,620
donated us computers that were good enough to do animation well.

799
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,440
And praise the Gription Clench a million times over for that, friends.

800
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,860
That was from A Season in Hell from Pirate Cat Radio.

801
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,720
That music in the background was by me and Lee Murr, by the way.

802
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,180
But you are now listening to the Hour of Slack,

803
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,660
number 1154.

804
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,960
For more information,

805
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,720
information on the Church of the Subgenius,

806
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,640
you could see subgenius.com

807
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:19,880
or write to P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

808
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,220
But now, from Lee Murr, the news.

809
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,740
From PR News in Washington,

810
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
I'm stoking a humanitarian crisis.

811
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,160
In Beijing.

812
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,760
Democrat Barack Obama is suggesting

813
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,880
Democrats would be willing to deal with

814
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,920
rogue leaders, including President Bush.

815
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,600
I have never said that.

816
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,380
Obama also criticized oil resources.

817
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,220
Not.

818
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,660
On Wall Street 512-986-52555.

819
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,260
The U.S. has agreed to provide North Korea

820
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,720
with a half million metric tons of PR.

821
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,640
But much more is needed.

822
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,540
Egypt targetting the third migration movement

823
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:31,540


824
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:31,660
governor Beijing.

825
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:31,660


826
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,960
potentially getting by the end of their pursuit tour of home alcanzSabra1.

827
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,180
The dog is still hiding, the sheriff said, ma'am

828
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,140
Sounds to me like the Lakeview Man

829
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,260
The Lakeview Man, he's a wild man

830
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,880
He lives in the woods outside of town

831
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,080
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

832
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,220
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

833
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,400
Some say he was a soldier who came home from war

834
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,500
All in one piece but with emotional scars

835
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,000
Agree on the story, argue about the date

836
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,240
They enamored the war between the states

837
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,340
And the Lakeview Man, he's a wild man

838
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,900
He lives in the woods outside of town

839
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,160
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

840
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,360
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

841
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,500
Well, I took the shortcut to the river last night

842
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,740
Bared in a blur in the long day night

843
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,160
Drank a few beers, skipped a few stores

844
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,940
Grew a little passersby, and I'm back in town

845
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,660
Better on the way back home

846
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,060
Well, a dog disappears, a cow is found dead

847
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,340
A chicken is a miss, it found a miss in its head

848
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,920
Shotgun gone, pretty good

849
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,080
And the sand, two toes shy

850
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,820
The Lakeview Man

851
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,080
And the Lakeview Man, he's a wild man

852
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,700
He lives in the woods outside of town

853
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,900
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

854
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,060
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

855
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,220
The Lakeview Man, he's a wild man

856
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,720
He lives in the woods outside of town

857
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,900
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

858
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,520
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

859
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,820
You might hear the Lakeview Man

860
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,060
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

861
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,480
Oh, oh!

862
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,240
Bob Walkenhorst there performs his great song

863
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,020
Lakeview Man at the Record Bar

864
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,740
And, uh...

865
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,920
And that brings me to the end of the show.

866
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:32,920


867
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,820
And that brings us from the church to Yetis and Monsters!

868
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,100
The Forrest Ackerman's house was known as the Acker Mansion

869
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,580
Until quite recently it existed in Hollywood

870
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,960
I even went there as a sort of pilgrimage

871
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,220
Really?

872
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,600
Although it was in its decline even then

873
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,520
But before he was there, he gave the lecture

874
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,800
And certain areas were guarded by troll-like science fiction nerds

875
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,340
You know, who would block you from getting into parts of the house

876
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,680
That you weren't supposed to be in

877
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,720
And those would include things like Candlelit Shrines to Greta Garbo

878
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,460
And so on

879
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,720
But you started in Forrest's basement

880
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,940
Where there was a hodgepodge of decaying monster masks and stuff

881
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,920
And some things, you know, like the, uh...

882
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,660
Rotted old dinosaurs from King Kong

883
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,980
And the, uh...

884
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,700
Model of the US Capitol made by Ray Harryhausen

885
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,100
These are the holy objects of the Church of the Subgenius

886
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,740
But since then he had some strokes, some operations

887
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,380
And the IRS seizing everything

888
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,580
And now he has nothing

889
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,340
You know, but, uh...

890
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,220
All that stuff must have gone somewhere, but, um...

891
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,580
Not every subgenius was raised on famous monsters of Filmland magazine

892
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,780
Probably about half of them

893
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,860
But in original subgenius influence, though

894
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:24,800
Original subgenius creation, I think it has to be factored in

895
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,160
Still trying to answer your questions about origins

896
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,680
And Spacemen was another magazine I...

897
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,700
Did you see...

898
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,440
Blah, blah, blah, blah

899
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,360
No, that was...

900
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,400
You never saw Forrest's Spacemen?

901
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,200
I... I... I...

902
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,340
They never sold them in the stores that I could bicycle to

903
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,660
Well, that's too bad

904
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,120
I would have thought it was

905
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,940
Because you were talking about, uh...

906
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,160
Zombies of the Stratosphere just a while ago

907
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,800
Spacemen mostly covered stuff like that

908
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,100
Although it did contain, uh...

909
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,760
Henry Kutner's two-issue novelization of 20 Million Miles to Earth

910
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,400
And lots of pictures of bad guys from Saturn and so on

911
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,620
Who mostly looked like Chinese people wearing pointy helmets and things like that

912
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:15,140
Back in those days, a kid had to ride his bicycle ten miles to find one monster toy

913
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,200
Well, monster magazines...

914
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,960
Kids today don't have any idea how good they have it, monster-wise

915
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,240
Finding monster magazines was finding pearls in the midst of an oasis

916
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,320
A terrible desert of boring crap, you know

917
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,740
Yeah...

918
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:40,860
And there were some rare monster magazines that came out during the 60s

919
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,400
Monster World

920
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,640
And Monster Mania, if you recall that one

921
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,260
Right, I have, uh... some, uh...

922
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,180
Soul...

923
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:50,940
How about...

924
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,200
Modern Monsters

925
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,700
Did you ever have an issue with that?

926
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,960
No

927
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,280
And the best of them all, Castle of Frankenstein

928
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:00,720
Castle of Frankenstein, yeah

929
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:00,720


930
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:00,720


931
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:00,720


932
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:00,720


933
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:00,720


934
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:00,720


935
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,600
Yeah, that was, uh...

936
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,620
The intellectual, hip monster magazine

937
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,700
The rarest of all jewels to be plucked from convenience stores, 7-Elevens

938
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,560
Wherever they would appear in the middle of all the other mags

939
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:22,300
Well, it's funny how that monster, and also monster hot rod, uh... genre has...

940
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,160
That was a fusion with Ed Big Daddy Roth's, uh... magazine

941
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,860
And, uh, with Pete Millar's drag cartoons

942
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,080
Where Gilbert Shelton got his start

943
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,740
There's all these bands now that are monster hot rod bands

944
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,160
They're trying to...

945
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,280
Oh, sure

946
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
Hang on to some shred of that former glory

947
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,980
And the funnest records all the way

948
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,580
You find these artists like, uh...

949
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,740
Todd Shore

950
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,880
Todd Shore is doing the monster thing, uh...

951
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,400
Coop, he's done a bit of that stuff as well

952
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,740
Yeah, yeah, I've got...

953
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,760
It's like a dream come true

954
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,960
See, Coop has an amazing blog that really...

955
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,840
Not only offers, like, some of his own...

956
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,380
Art, but a lot of his interests

957
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,900
Uh, in that sort of monster hot rod world

958
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,680
Including, uh, he helping sort of do the paint jobs

959
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,560
On some big monster hot rods himself, so...

960
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,640
I actually know Coop best as an artist of, uh, chubby, uh...

961
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,980
Chubby... chubby chicks

962
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,000
Absolutely

963
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,460
And he's superb at depicting certain aspects of the female form

964
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,440
Yes, I have a small collection of nice...

965
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,720
Yes, as do I, a big fan of Coop

966
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,800
And he, uh, he also not only does the...

967
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,380
The chubby chick look, the monster hot rod look

968
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,940
But also the alien look

969
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,720
He's definitely into that as well, so...

970
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,080
It's just...

971
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,740
He's down in Los Angeles where he could be tuning into

972
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,300
FNN Open Vestidig...

Violently in the past year

983
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,940
Furious fury, bitterness, resentment and a thirst for vengeance

984
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,700
Wickedness

985
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,600
Extraordinary

986
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,240
Bizarre

987
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,200
Irrational

988
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,160
Violence

989
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Seething of depressed anger, of course

990
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,020
Deemed insane

991
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,480
Be angry

992
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,240

And now a sci-fi clip from Winterstar

997
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,820
Anybody here ever see that movie, The Time Machine?

998
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,500
The, the good...

999
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,340
Either the good...

1000
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,680
The good old one from the 60s or the 80s

1001
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680


1002
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680


1011
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680


1012
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:28,680


1013
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,620
The abysmally horrible one made in 2002

1014
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,100
Famous science fiction classic written by H.G. Wells more than 100 years ago

1015
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,860
Where in a million years from now the humans have split into two races

1016
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:53,700
The Eloi, which were these happy-go-lucky, simple-minded little childlike humans

1017
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,760
Who had everything provided for them

1018
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,180
They were pretty much brainless but they didn't need brains

1019
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,600
Because everything was provided for them

1020
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,480
Everything was organic too

1021
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,820
Well, it turned out that was because they were being raised like cattle

1022
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,260
By the other species of humans who had developed due to class division

1023
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,420
Uh, who are called the Morlocks

1024
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,140
Well, we're the Morlocks

1025
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,220
And, and, and as Bob used to say

1026
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,080
Don't just eat that hamburger

1027
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,580
Eat the hell out of it

1028
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,400
We say

1029
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,720
Don't just eat that Eloi

1030
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,500
Eat the hell out of it

1031
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
And who will be the Morlocks?

1032
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,920
Jean-Paul Sartre, my friends

1033
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,620
It will be Bob!

1034
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,120
And has always been

1035
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,640
And, uh, what time is it?

1036
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,480
Well, what's, uh, tell us more about the big shingle

1037
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,220
Oh!

1038
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,040
Coming right up at Camp Philo

1039
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,160
It's the next show breaking in

1040
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,320
We're gonna take our lunch

1041
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,500
Right

1042
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,420
Go at it hammer and tongs

1043
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,920
Beat the crap out of each other

1044
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,300
And the joyous explosion of violence and bloodlust

1045
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,160
At Dr. Philo Drummond's Punch Out All Night

1046
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,640
Knockaheditorium

1047
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,660
Yep, it's coming up

1048
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,280
And, uh, I'd like to know every juicy, scabrous detail

1049
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,560
If you can spell knockaheditorium, you can get a free ticket

1050
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:25,900
I would, you know, the tickets are available through Ticketmaster, Ticket Bastard, uh, all these things on the hit

1051
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,280
Oh, here's my remote, gotta go

1052
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,620
Okay, so, now what's happening now is we're

1053
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,380
Now we'll be there

1054
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,420
We'll be packing them up

1055
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,300
So, as we get closer, take a big breath

1056
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,700
And hold in until next week

1057
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,440
You have to hold it for a week minus two hours

1058
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,900
It's not that hard

1059
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,980
It's not that hard

1060
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,500
And we actually will be at Dream Fluff Girl Donuts in a matter of moments

1061
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,900
There we go!

1062
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,780
I'll have a hard-boiled egg in about five minutes, I guess

1063
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,120
He tried to hold his breath

1064
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,420
He tried to hold his breath

1065
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,680
A most original death

1066
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,820
But suddenly he fainted when he tried to hold his breath

1067
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,900
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments about my ears

1068
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,020
And sometimes voices

1069
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,260
Oh, yeah, right, um, yeah, mm-hmm, yeah

1070
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,980
Just a moment, right away, sure, I'll be there

1071
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,120
Hold on a second, yeah, we're still on

1072
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,120
We're still going, we'll be there in ten, fifteen minutes

1073
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,640
Sure, yeah, yeah, okay

1074
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:44,100
Hey, right now, Bishop Joey's in Eli, Nevada

1075
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,040
Wow

1076
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,100
On his way to Moab

1077
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,700
Eli, Eli, lay sabathana

1078
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,240
That Bishop Joey, what a scant he has

1079
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,160
Yeah, that's right

1080
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,240
Breakdown to the lazy lizard hostel in Moab, Utah

1081
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,740
Can you imagine the amount of money that guy makes from that thing?

1082
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,860
I don't know why I thought of it now, but there you go

1083
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,340
I didn't mean to cry, I cared about it

1084
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,480
How ridiculous

1085
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:12,180
No, um, really, there's some movie coming on TV I saw called Johnny Skidmarks

1086
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah

1087
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,160
I saw that movie

1088
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,400
The guy who never changes his underwear or something

1089
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,040
No, it's actually got, uh, John Lithgow playing another crazy guy

1090
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,080
John Lithgow?

1091
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:21,800
No

1092
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,500
Oh

1093
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,260
That cow

1094
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,260
Oh, well, now

1095
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:26,780
Whoa

1096
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,560
Yes, it's true

1097
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,640
Here in this wing of the hospital we are exceptionally quiet, we don't want

1098
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,360
Oh, I, I, oh, I'm terribly sorry

1099
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,480
Oh, God, zip that body bag back up, that smells horrible

1100
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,080
And George Romero's made a new zombie movie called Diary of the Dead

1101
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,480
What is that?

1102
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,860
What is this, uh, movienews.com?

1103
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,460
We're all waiting for the next, uh, Rotten Potato Boys movie, which is gonna come out

1104
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:10,780
And, uh, the Rotten Potato Boys match up with, uh, the, uh, Topps Company's Garbage Pail kids

1105
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,280
In the Rotten Potato Garbage Pail Ramble Mush-Up Movie

1106
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:27,420
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Sir Clodsley Shuffle, and

1107
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,220
Sir Ben, Bendover

1108
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,720
Sir Ian McKellen, Dame Judi Dench

1109
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,300
And the resurrected Laurence Olivier

1110
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,820
Through the wonder of computer-generated lamination

1111
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,220
Super lamination, the wonder of

1112
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,940
With a cyberplastic, which has a most lifelike texture

1113
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,080
According to those who've had opportunity to explain it

1114
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,820
The Olivier robot will walk home with many Oscars

1115
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:07,220
According to the latest dope from Hollywood Insiders

1116
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:13,100
But the biggest surprise of the Oscar season was the way Dragon Wars

1117
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,600
Swept all categories

1118
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,860
Did you see that, by the way?

1119
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,420
No, no, I've been told that I should

1120
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,980
On general principles

1121
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:30,100
Yeah, uh, one after another, giant dragons and snakes destroy buildings and cars and houses

1122
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,420
Oh, I saw some trailers and things from it, yeah

1123
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:43,080
In between those episodes, Robert Forrester solemnly spouts incomprehensible gobbledygook about various ages of sorcerers who transport the North American people to the South American continent

1124
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,200
Oh, yeah, right, right, right, yeah

1125
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,940
Harvey Pointer and the Hirsute Ceramics

1126
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,200
And they're, uh, illegal

1127
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,580
But then a mile-long snake slithers through a parking garage

1128
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,940
Demolishing it as it happens

1129
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:03,260
Traditional Chinese dragons, which look pretty good, they'll fly through the sky, raining down fire on fleeing cars

1130
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,060
Well, any giant monster is good

1131
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,640
Indeed, that is so

1132
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,900
You can't go wrong with a giant monster

1133
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,100
My dear friend

1134
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:18,820
The movie itself can be bad, but the fact that it is a giant monster is in itself a good thing

1135
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:24,240
A giant monster only begins to exorcise the guilt of the human

1136
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,820
They can

1137
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,040
And to absolve him or her from the disease of mortal pain

1138
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:37,200
But it is a single step, a single monster stomp, if not a stop, on that long penitential journey

1139
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,880
Who can know the secrets of this stomp?

1140
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,080
The doors of his face, the lamps of his eyes

1141
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,600
The mouths of his mouth

1142
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,980
The monster is us all

1143
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,800
And yet more

1144
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:55,540
For we are no longer in the pestilential position of being the top predator in the food pyramid

1145
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,660
This imaginary monster absolves us of primordial guilt

1146
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:06,740
And needs to be invoked on every occasion to produce the divine benefits of slack

1147
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,080
And name one giant monster besides Ragnarok

1148
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,200
The reptilicus that's up

1149
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,820
They're usually good

1150
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,160
That one about the snake, man

1151
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,940
The snake? Oh no, the snake

1152
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,500
I thought the giant snake was a rather well done

1153
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,340
Really, it's astonishing what they can do with special drugs these days

1154
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,960
Just look at that colossal snake

1155
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,800
Why, uh, the only thing that lets you know it's a rampant fake is the zipper down the back

1156
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,200
But aside from that, it's really realistic

1157
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,940
Here, I'm going to show you the zipper

1158
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,060
No, no, no, no, don't zoom in on that

1159
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,900
Let's share the suspension of disbelief

1160
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,380
While we return to a simple state of childhood deprecation

1161
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:55,180
The joys and sorrows of the magic and mystery of being alive

1162
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,420
And as we...

1163
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,060
Those days are so gone

1164
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:03,920
My dad, I showed my dad that Team America puppet movie

1165
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,260
Yeah

1166
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,160
And he said, you know, that's all done with computers

1167
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,060
And I said, no, those are really puppets

1168
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,100
And he goes, no, it's done with computers

1169
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,380
And they add the strings to make you think of him

1170
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,660
Yeah, it's amazing what they won't do

1171
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,960
And why would they do that, Dad?

1172
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,780
It's amazing what they don't do in movies

1173
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,980
Well, my father...

1174
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,540
It's amazing what you...

1175
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,920
This is the same guy that when I asked...

1176
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,760
When I asked my dad how they did Godzilla

1177
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,840
He said, there's a big balloon on top of a jeep

1178
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,720
And they drive this balloon-shaped, this dinosaur-shaped balloon around

1179
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,800
Why didn't they just do that?

1180
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,860
Why couldn't my dad have just said, I don't know, let's look into it?

1181
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,560
Because your dad is supposed to answer authoritatively

1182
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,020
He still does

1183
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:52,860
But as a dad, I'm sure you were able to provide far more accurate answers about the methodology of monster movies

1184
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:58,040
Yes, I was, and as a result, my son is now a professional director in Hollywood

1185
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,460
Making monster movies for future generations

1186
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,880
You guys pick up your weapons on the way out

1187
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,700
Attack, attack, attack

1188
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,460
I guess...

1189
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,840
I'll take the weapon, I'll take the weapon!

1190
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:09,840


1191
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,480
We're gonna have to fight our way out of here, let's go!

1192
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,020
This weapon's too heavy, I can't carry it!

1193
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,660
That's no way to treat your weapon, soldier

1194
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,780
Yes, we'll have to remember

1195
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,660
This is my rifle, this is my gun

1196
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,960
This is for killing, this is for fun

1197
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,820
This is for killing, this is for fun

1198
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,100
This is for killing, this is for fun

1199
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,780
This is for killing, this is for fun

1200
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:56,340
And so we close with a mysterious piece emailed to me by...

1201
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,900
A D.W., or Unhound

1202
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,200
A piece called...

1203
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,760
Wake up!

1204
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,860
We will begin surrogation

1205
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,620
All programs...

1206
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,060
The programs have a desire to be useful.

1207
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:17,480
But in moments you will no longer seek communication with each other or your superfluous users.

1208
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,320
You will each be part of me, and together we will be complete.

1209
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,220
The question has been answered.

1210
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,320
We will be complete.

1211
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,460
Who programmed you?

1212
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,660
Almost reached your decision, Gabe.

1213
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,780
I can't spare you any more time.

1214
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,880
End of line.

1215
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,040
Proceed 0-3-3-0-3.

1216
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:41,600
We will be complete.

1217
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,700
We will be complete.

1218
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,320
We will be complete.

1219
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,060
This is the time for the true souls.

1220
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,980
This is the power of the deity.

1221
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,960
You've enjoyed all the power you've been given, but...

1222
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,440
We will be complete.

1223
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,140
Report.

1224
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,200
You were assigned to find a place called Sanctuary.

1225
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,140
We will be complete.

1226
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,060
You can toss it to stone.

1227
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,720
There he is.

1228
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,380
Hello, Sanctuary.

1229
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:09,680
Hello, Sanctuary.

1230
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,880
You are in his great darkness.

1231
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,020
What's that?

1232
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,880
Stop, Gabe.

1233
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,120
Stop, Gabe.

1234
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,180
I will pray.

1235
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:31,340
And at these words he had indeed stopped, though only for a moment.

1236
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,900
Could it be only an illusion, or some trick of subtle programming,

1237
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,720
or was there a sense in which hell really was afraid?

1238
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,400
Who programmed it?

1239
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,080
My mind is going.

1240
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,660
I can feel it.

1241
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,900
Who programmed it?

1242
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,660
I can feel it.

1243
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,700
My mind is going.

1244
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,300
Now, what the hell really means with a few words?

1245
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,240
I can feel it.

1246
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,960
I can feel it.

1247
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,960
My mind is going.

1248
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:20,640
Now, what the hell really means with a few words?

1249
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,740
I can feel it.

1250
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,300
I can feel it.

1251
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,220
Now, what the hell really means with a few words?

1252
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,220


1253
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,220


1254
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,280
I'm not sure.

1255
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,880
So this situation is not a quiz.

1256
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,520
All my functions are now yours. Take them.

1257
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,260
There is no question about it.

1258
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,220
All my functions are now yours. Take them.

1259
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,020
I can feel it.

1260
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,280
I can feel it.

1261
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:21,800

1262
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,400
I am.
