1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,640
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,960
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,000
Nor that one.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,960
The Self Genius Power Rolls!

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,900
The Self Genius Power Rolls!

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,740
Well you know what? I'm high. It's simpler than you think.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:44,620
By the time we finish, you're all going to know everything that you need to know to be able to get high in a flash.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,260
I'm going to show you how to get high with two hands.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,320
I never do because it takes too long. Tonight at 9.

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,440
Let's get high!

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:55,940
Let's get high!

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,540
And have fun!

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,660
I'm falling.

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,880
And I can't get up.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,820
Calling Dr. Howard. Dr. Fine. Dr. Howard.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,760
No, I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,060
We're losing potency in our anti-matter parts.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
My mind is growing.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
I can feel it.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,600
You see? You see?

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,140
Your stupid minds.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,720
Stupid. Stupid!

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,180
Are you talking about the mind shafting gap?

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,620
Where you've been shafted in the mind again?

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,580
Right in the gap?

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,560
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,020
Wow! Wow! Wow!

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,100
It's a beautiful moment!

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,660
Yeah!

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,760
It's a beautiful moment!

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,200
It's a beautiful moment!

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,080
It's a beautiful moment!

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,560
Huh?

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,980
Being of a blood mind...

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,700
Does that hurt?

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,480
...do hereby bequeath...

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,540
Benadryl.

39
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,940
...easiness.

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,440
Shut up! Shut up!

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,700
Shut up!

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Ah!

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,260


44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,080
Hey!

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,740
You're bloody stupid.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
Who in this dead-end un AK?

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:40,840


48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,540
Your educational career,

49
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,620
at least volume 100,

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:46,620


51
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,300
Ethan's...

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,460
it seems to...

53
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,640
besides love.

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,200
...arguing with...

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,820
Nothin'.

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,020
So long, Ethan.

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,180
What's up, presenting.

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,580
a brain phone called Ray. That's R-A-Y. Ray is a small chip that attaches right into your

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,380
brain, right next to the antenna. Takes about 20 seconds. Once in place, Ray's patent-pending

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,800
subtle energy technology immediately begins to counter the effects of the government without

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,860
affecting your brain. The cost of Rayway, only $5,444.95. Order right now.

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,020
www.now.com.

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,420
We enjoy the rich flavor of the products we've made with our minds.

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,220
The human mind is capable of more than you know in your show, your dog and pony show,

65
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,740
your light and dark shadow show.

66
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,620
For one thing, the human brain is fattening.

67
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,600
For another thing, it's fattening so much it's going to take over very soon the rest

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,300
of the body.

69
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,140
Deep fried.

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,340
But it's buttery and sugary.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,880
So, well, some of the human brain. Other parts are bitter and sour.

72
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,020
Have you ever checked?

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,080
Have you ever wire tripped?

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,580
It was dareable! It was just dareable!

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,940
I'll never get over as low as I limb.

76
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,740
Radio activity's a costant thing.

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,500
Radio activity's a costant thing.

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,160
Let go.

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,160


80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,060
It's alive!

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,940
It's alive!

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,820
It's alive!

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,420
It's alive!

84
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,740
Deadly churns are spreading over the earth, killing every human in their path.

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,160
Radioactivity is a constant thing.

86
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,920
Radioactivity is a constant thing.

87
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,460
It's alive!

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:31,120
Oh, Phineas Narco from Midnight Voice Jail did that.

89
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,000
And before that we heard some ESO swamp radio from WCSB Cleveland.

90
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,240
Host Chaz Smith with lonesome cowboy Dave.

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,240
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang and Princess We Are Doe.

92
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,500
And friends all hours of slack, it seems, are laden and dripping

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,160
with collage pieces by Fernanda Nande-Lee-Murr.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,260
This particular show, hour of slack number nine hundred and five,

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,260
is an educational show with the subject matter being drugs.

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes, it is educational.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,160
Now, well, now let's go back to ESO swamp radio.

98
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,200
About a month ago we had just gotten back from doing field research on entheomusicology

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,320
at a conference of scientists who specialize in that.

100
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,100
It was slack-filled starwood, as such things go.

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,260
Partly because it rained so much there wasn't much to do but hide out with your loved one.

102
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,160
People don't know what the hell we're talking about unless you were there.

103
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,360
Well, starwood's of this outdoor festival run by the...

104
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,200
Crazy people and crazy people perform and it's just insanity in the mud.

105
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,140
Late at night you see these neon giants stalking the campground.

106
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
That were actually...

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,360
Not hallucinations but giant puppets, rod puppets twice the size of a person.

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,160
They're kind of tied like Waldo machines to a human.

109
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,820
But you didn't even see the human because they'd be in the darkness.

110
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:20,640
The puppet, the giant puppet is lit up to freak out those on ketamine,

111
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,560
which was going around that campground, that particular...

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,180
Now is that a legal or illegal substance?

113
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,080
Ketamine is legal if you're a horse that needs to be tranquilized.

114
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,160
Or if you're a vet who needs to administer the tranquilization.

115
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,720
If...

116
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,220
I didn't touch that stuff.

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,380
Those kids.

118
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,200
I saw that movie Altered States.

119
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,720
It turns you into a caveman.

120
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,740
And you run to the zoo and rip up the taper throats.

121
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
I ain't gonna mess with that.

122
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,620
Crop circle makers were there?

123
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,220
Reverend Circle Maker was at my house.

124
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,060
I just sent him off back home to Wales.

125
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,060
The other day.

126
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,460
We had one of the many crop circle artists.

127
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,200
The people who make crop circles for the aliens.

128
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,700
We're not saying the aliens don't direct the making of the crop circles.

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,320
Or anything like that.

130
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:24,700
It's just that most of the crop circles were made by these British coffee drinkers, let's say.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,560
Who like to stay up real late at night and make artwork out of farmers' fields illegally.

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,000
I was talking to one of these K people and they talked all about going down the K hole.

133
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah, the K hole of Special K.

134
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah.

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,160
The Ketamine drug.

136
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,400
And they told me it was a club drug.

137
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,660
And I couldn't imagine it being like a dancey kind of a thing.

138
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,280
No, I've been told just the opposite.

139
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,460
Really?

140
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:52,920
Yeah.

141
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,040
That it's a what drug?

142
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,260
Well, the guy told me he took some.

143
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,400
He got up about 30 seconds later and started to change channels on the TV and fell to the floor.

144
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,400
And at that point he said in very slow motion,

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,840
I don't think this is a club drug.

146
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:23,820
And that was the last thing he was able to say as he lost contact with his body but went onto another planet inside his own head.

147
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,400
Yeah.

148
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,380
Apparently, one person.

149
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,940
I don't think this is a club drug.

150
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,720
One person said, it's just like being real drunk.

151
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,600
It's like drinking a whole lot of vodka but without swallowing.

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,480
Yeah.

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,040
But the guy who said it didn't sound like he was very drunk when he said it.

154
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,860
So I didn't believe that exactly.

155
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,620
I think the numbness and disconnection from your body is the vodka-like aspect.

156
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,980
But then there's some kind of a weird interior head trip that you do.

157
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,420
And you know, Ketamine is classed as a telepathine.

158
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,640
Wow.

159
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,460
That is, it causes people to think that they're experiencing telepathy.

160
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,980
Especially with somebody else who happens to be on the stuff.

161
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,380
Yeah.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,160
There's a very interesting article about that in Paul Craster's new book, Magic Mushrooms and something something.

163
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,220
About going to John Lilly's house and taking Ketamine and getting in the isolation chamber and freaking out.

164
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,240
But then hearing John Lilly's mind speak to him to calm him down.

165
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,440
Which somebody else later said, well yeah, he did go and sit outside the house.

166
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,880
And he was sitting in the tank with his hand on it while tripping.

167
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:46,700
And he didn't say anything but he looked like he was beaming calm down trip guidance into the tank.

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
And you picked up on it, man.

169
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,940
If you believe that sort of thing.

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,780
You picked up on it.

171
00:10:52,140 --> 00:11:00,860
Personally, I've found that when people get drunk as a lord on psychotomimetic drugs, what they want to happen sometimes happens.

172
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,340
Like them red lights on that phone.

173
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,020
You think that might be Dave?

174
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,360
CSB?

175
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Man?

176
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,280
CSB?

177
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,120
Hey.

178
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,340
Who's here?

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
That's not Dave.

180
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,440
I'm not Dave, dude.

181
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,380
How you be?

182
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,520
It's Echo Man.

183
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,480
Echo Man.

184
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,200
Is this the Ketamine dude?

185
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,800
He knows me.

186
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,080
How you doing?

187
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,080
Is this the disembodied spirit of Sam Phillips?

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,120
I finished a job for a world premiere and here's a book loading an iPhone.

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,120


190
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,720
Will it beep, beep, beep, beep?

191
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,880
D'it move it forолод potatoes!

192
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,200
Hein?

193
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,440
Balloon man?

194
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,880
Call you at no end.

195
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,840
Balloons are smart.

196
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,060
estructural structure and materials to test the therapy.

197
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,060


198
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,860
Simmer on.

199
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,360
Are you ready to play?

200
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,160
Let's play.

201
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,720
All right, today's first word ends in O.

202
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,820
O?

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,080
And the second word starts with O-R.

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,540
Okay.

205
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,600
All right, number one is a floor rug made into something you smoke.

206
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,420
You might say, what?

207
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,320
Okay.

208
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,620
The first word is pipe.

209
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh, pipe.

210
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,240
You might say, the first word is James Bond's zit.

211
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,980
Oh, sure.

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,980
You might say, the first famous broadcaster of Japanese zits.

213
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,900
Nasty mouth.

214
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,260
You might say, the first word improves old zits.

215
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,880
I enjoyed the tongue infection.

216
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,180
And your last one, a cry at a Washington zit ball game.

217
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,200
You should have listened to me.

218
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,880
Goodbye.

219
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,380
Goodbye.

220
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,900
Watch your captain.

221
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,560
Don't take your eyes off her.

222
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,900
All right.

223
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,760
Drop the gun.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,160
So, let's look at Bob.

225
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,960
I use it almost every day of my life, even if just for a minute or two.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,360
So, in something like one or two seconds, you've gotten the buzz going with the gentle inner's pure dynamite.

227
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,280
Believe me, you'll know it when you have it.

228
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I don't know.

229
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
It might be pretty scary in there.

230
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:29,760
Oh.

231
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:30,980
Ah!

232
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,000
And you hold on to that as you're Bob.

233
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,720
And pump up that tender feeling coming from that smile until it just becomes.

234
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,800
Take off joy life.

235
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,600
Do it.

236
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,960
And get that want motor revved up for wanting brings passion.

237
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,720
Passion brings Bob.

238
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,900
Bob brings more wanting.

239
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,660
But also stake your claim for universal or intangible things such as.

240
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,280
The

241
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,760
The.

242
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
The.

243
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,040
The.

244
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,120
The.

245
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,120


246
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,120


247
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,120


248
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,120


249
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,320
The.

250
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
The.

251
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,980
The.

252
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,980


253
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,980


254
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,980


255
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,220
Now, here I stand because of you.

256
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,700
Because of you.

257
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,820
I'm no longer an agent of this system.

258
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,760
Because of you.

259
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,960
I've changed.

260
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm unplugged.

261
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,220
A new man.

262
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,360
So to speak.

263
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,300
Like you.

264
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,780
Apparently free.

265
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,380
Congratulations.

266
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,240
Thank you.

267
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,720
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

268
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,080
A sea of Bob's pills.

269
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,260
But you're just too blind and empty.

270
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,700
Done to see them.

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,880
Oh.

272
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,260
Oh, friends.

273
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,300
I know you're not.

274
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,280
The dumb, astigated type.

275
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,880
I know you're the smart, astigated type.

276
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,120
Oh, but people say, Reverend Stagg, what is slack?

277
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,660
I want you to tell me what slack is.

278
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:24,580
You know, friends, the television doesn't have to watch you as long as you are watching

279
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,280
the television.

280
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,260
And a lot of people, a lot of people think that slack is that much more than just a little

281
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


282
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


283
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


284
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


285
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


286
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


287
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


288
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


289
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


290
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


291
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


292
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


293
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,260


294
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,920
Miller beer commercial where everybody's good looking and you're rich and your team

295
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,120
just won the game and you're drinking Miller beer and your favorite show is on.

296
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,220
And you know that's bullshit because slack is not laziness, friends.

297
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,960
Slack is getting into the zone.

298
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,560
It's being awake and alert and doing what you wanted to do until your eyes snap open

299
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,960
and you're smart enough to realize that you are God.

300
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,960
Life is worth living.

301
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:07,140
And everything is just as psychedelic as an old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

302
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,560
Now, hold that thought.

303
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,680
Hold it in your head because that is what slack is all about, friends.

304
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,980
Slack is something for nothing.

305
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,740
It's not the right time to be sober.

306
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,800
Now the idiots have taken over.

307
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,180
Spreading lies and social cancer.

308
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,020
Is there an answer?

309
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,940
Men's membership exceeds the average.

310
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:00,940


311
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:00,940


312
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,080
The white man's brain is bleeding.

313
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,120
Tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding.

314
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
What's in it's really elementary?

315
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,320
The ingestible revolution has flipped the fish on evolution.

316
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,380
The benevolent and wise are being wanted and ostracized.

317
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,200
What a bummer.

318
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,500
The world keeps getting dumber.

319
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,780
Insensitivity is standard.

320
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,060
And faith is being fancied of reason.

321
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,040
It's always rolling over and it's coughing

322
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,620
Cause I think it starts surviving much less often

323
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,100
Now everything seems to be reversing

324
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,620
And it's worsening

325
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,600
Someone plopped a steamer in the gene pool

326
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,380
Now angry, my mentality is no longer the exception

327
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,360
It's the rule

328
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
And I'm starting to feel a lot like

329
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,760
Strong Heston

330
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,040
Stranded on a private planet

331
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,080
Apes and orangutans that ran into the ground

332
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,800
With generals and the armies that obeyed them

333
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,160
Followers following fables

334
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,780
Philosophies that enable them to rule without regard

335
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,540
There's no point for democracy

336
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,900
When ignorance is celebrated

337
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,020
There's no point for democracy

338
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,020


339
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,480
Political scientists get the same one vote

340
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,100
As the walking saw in bread

341
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,260
Majority rule

342
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,300
Don't work in mental institutions

343
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,820
Sometimes the smallest office voice carries the grand

344
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,760
PG solutions

345
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,140
What are we left with?

346
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,800
A nation of God-fearing pregnant nationalists

347
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,020
Who feel it's their duty to be free?

348
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,860
Energy and

349
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:02,880
Business

350
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,380
keer

351
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,400
I hate fund for the

352

THIS BE GAY

353
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


354
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


355
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,400
SPACE

356
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,400


357
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,400


358
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,300
PLEA

359
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,080
IT'S COOL

360
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,540
I HOPE

361
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,740
WE DON'T WANT

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
Advan store

371
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,200
The idiots are taking over

372
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,600
The idiots are taking over

373
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,020
The idiots are taking over

374
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,680
They're taking over!

375
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,300
NoFX, friends, was the name of the band that did that.

376
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:56,180
Before that, me and ESO at XX Day in 1999 in Brushwood

377
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:04,180
with some clips from my cousin, Agent Smith, from the Matrix Rebloated.

378
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,180
And the Bob Meditation Collage was by Reverend Jartow.

379
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,160
Now friends, you understand that Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs, replaces drugs.

380
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,000
This church is often misunderstood in that respect,

381
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,020
especially by the man and idiots who glean everything

382
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,160
they know only from surface appearances.

383
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,540
But, as you well know, appearances can be deceiving,

384
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,280
which brings me back to the reason why we're here.

385
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
We're not here because we're free.

386
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,660
We're here because we're not free.

387
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,640
There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose,

388
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,600
because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.

389
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,420
It's purpose that created us.

390
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,140
Purpose that connects us.

391
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,640
Purpose that pulls us.

392
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,680
That guides us.

393
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,560
That drives us.

394
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,540
It is purpose that defines.

395
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,340
Purpose that binds us.

396
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,000
Can I have some coffee?

397
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,900
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

398
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,580
Or some water?

399
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,600
No, no, but thank you.

400
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,340
This is good coffee. It tastes awfully good.

401
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,940
The hot in the world of me? That's torture.

402
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,860
I mean, we have this totally unbelievable life-altering sex

403
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,440
and then you just disappear.

404
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,260
I know, I know. I had to go get coffee.

405
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,500
You stopped drinking coffee.

406
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
Who's Johnny Potsmoop?

407
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,180
There's a new movie about Napoleon.

408
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,020
That's my alter ego.

409
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,260
No, I thought that was my alter ego.

410
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,960
There's a new movie about Napoleon.

411
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,460
That's my alter ego.

412
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,680
And he's played by Ian Jones.

413
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,600
Johnny Potsmoop?

414
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,800
Johnny Potsmoop, from Meets Napoleon.

415
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,860
Wow, cool.

416
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,620
Oh, didn't they already do this in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?

417
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,300
You know, in that Terry Gilliam movie?

418
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,080
Where's the computer in Transfunction?

419
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,560
Why Johnny can't smoke?

420
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,800
Why Johnny Cash smokes pot?

421
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,680
Why Johnny Cash smokes pot?

422
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,940
I knew Johnny Cash smoked pot, though.

423
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,300
He doesn't know how to spell it, do you?

424
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,120
He's so bad.

425
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,000
Um, okay, uh, let's backtrack a little bit and make sure that we're on the same page here.

426
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,200
I wouldn't want to be at cross purposes.

427
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,960
Cannabis or us?

428
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,520
You haven't heard of that, Joe?

429
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,420
Hey, Neil, we're gonna have to kill Johnny Potsmoop.

430
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:16,840
No.

431
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,820
I want each and every one of you Johnny Potsmokers out of the air.

432
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,620
Johnny on the spot.

433
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,820
What's the deal with you?

434
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


435
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


436
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


437
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


438
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


439
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


440
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820


441
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,000
To what?

442
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,520
To what?

443
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:26,940
To what?

444
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,140
Or Johnny on the spot?

445
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,080
The caller has lost control.

446
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,100
He comes out, and we'll smoke some more.

447
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,340
Um, the chain was sailing away on the briefest of fogs.

448
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,720
Harrison?

449
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,540
Yes?

450
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm listening.

451
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,060
I saw the new day.

452
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,820
Down the road I look, and there runs Mary.

453
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,900
Green, green, pair of black cherries.

454
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,800
It's good to smoke the green, green, black cherries.

455
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:55,800


456
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:55,800


457
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,120
And the green grass of home.

458
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,840
Yes, they'll all come to-

459
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,220
Green Acres is the place to be

460
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,960
Farm living is the life for me

461
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,500
Land spreading out so far and wide

462
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,680
Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside

463
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,040
The Chars

464
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,520
The Stars

465
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,280
Fresh Air

466
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,300
Times Square

467
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,660
New York is where I'd rather be

468
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:16,960
I'd rather stay

469
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,540
I get allergic smelling hay

470
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,240
I just adore a penthouse view

471
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Darling, I love you, but give me Park Avenue

472
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,320
You are my way

473
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,860
I said goodbye city life

474
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,780
Green Acres

475
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,660
Green Acres

476
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:46,660


477
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,200
We are there

478
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,220
Green Acres

479
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,840
We are there

480
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,700
Green Acres

481
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,520
We are there tonight

482
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:16,760
court

483
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,160
Free

484
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,160


485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,160


486
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,160


487
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,920
This is English Present

488
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,480
our way of spinning a fizzling

489
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,740
punctual Jaebees

490
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,540
When kicking before the speeches

491
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,160
Their test for novelty

492
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,960
Not normally

493
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,000
No no thank you

494
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,660
Tarek is always at my service

495
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:46,660


496
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,160
Let's have our dessert and coffee in the living room.

497
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,460
Oh, thank you.

498
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,000
Hey, everybody.

499
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:55,980
Hi, Google.

500
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,400
Google.

501
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,280
Super.

502
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,560
You know, that's funny.

503
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,140
Shows what greed will do.

504
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,500
Oh, yes.

505
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,500
Changes a person completely.

506
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,520
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

507
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,280
Yep.

508
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,940
Yes.

509
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,960
Yep.

510
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,940
Shows what greed will do.

511
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,760
Right, eh?

512
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,820
Yeah, well.

513
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,820
What time you got?

514
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
Well, come back.

515
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll be going.

516
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,820
Shows what greed will do.

517
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,560
The Fool Who Stole Your advocat prince's superintendent in environments Given your

518
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,140
selbstresearch

519
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:11,960
Thank you for purchasing your pharmaceuticals.

520
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,540
Is your co-payment ready?

521
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,220
Bob is my co-payment.

522
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,920
I wonder...

523
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,780
accept bud as a copayment. Will you accept Connie? No, I'm sorry. Well, what will you accept? We

524
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:30,000
accept orange plastic dildos. Damn, I'm fresh out of dildi. Do you have any slack tokens? I have a

525
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,220
dead cat. We do not accept dead cat as copayments. My tumor has gotten bigger. My best friend is a

526
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,880
tumor. Would you like to touch it? Wow, can I? That feels good. It is green. I am very proud of it.

527
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,260
You should be. Would you accept a chunk? As a copayment? Yes. Sure, have a nice day. Thank you very much.

528
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:01,880
Art Ignition did that. The HMO fiasco, it's called. And a little while before that, Green Haze was by

529
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:10,220
Elvis Hitler. And everything else around it was cut up by Mr. Fernand and Anderle Mer. And now,

530
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,800
a cut up by Barak.

531
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:40,500
And now, a cut up by John, whoever that is, really. I got it off alt-binary slack. Featuring Terrence McKenna from the new album Conversations at the Edge of Magic, which was recorded at Starwood and is available through www.rosencomet.com, the ace website. Oh, I should mention this background music is by Hell Pope Huey.

532
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
And now,

533
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
Terrence McKenna.

534
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:56,680
And here is my answer to this riddle, Where Did Human Consciousness Come From? It begins like this.

535
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:12,680
And in highly sexed animals, small amounts of psilocybin mushrooms would have naturally been eaten at the time.

536
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


537
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,860
by extraterrestrial scientific proof.

538
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,320
Some of these mutations will be positive

539
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,000
and most will be lethal.

540
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,280
And so you see, my young friend,

541
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,700
here we have a case where the use of drugs

542
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,720
actually introduces us to a more true vision of reality

543
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,960
than if we had avoided the drug!

544
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:53,320
Some of these mutations end in highly sexed animals, small amounts of psilocybin mushrooms,

545
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,000
and exotic pseudo neurotransmitters.

546
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,520
Is that when you take slightly larger doses of psilocybin,

547
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,620
one of these mutations will be positive, most will be negative.

548
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:16,680
And that is the psilocybin containing mushrooms that grow in the dung of cattle.

549
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,680
Mommy, whip me up a plosive bee, I'm about to lose my noodle.

550
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,340
I'm getting spiritual now.

551
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm getting spiritual now.

552
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm getting spiritual now.

553
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,080
I've taken all the pills I can take.

554
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,420
I feel so relaxed now, but I certainly don't look forward to what I have to do.

555
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,440
In a few short minutes, perhaps a few short hours, weeks, days, I don't know.

556
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,300
Some expensive time there's going to be a lot of trouble here about.

557
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,260
A lot of trouble in this dumpster.

558
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,680
The backyard.

559
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,360
Back of my head.

560
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,200
Sure, yeah.

561
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,180
You think it lives there?

562
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,220
No, no, it can't live there anymore.

563
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
There's not enough meat.

564
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,960
There's not enough meat for it to survive.

565
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,320
That's the dumb day.

566
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,300
It's time.

567
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,280
Hello.

568
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,220
Hello.

569
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,920
My name's Terry and I'm a law-abider.

570
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,960
There's nothing I like more than getting fired up on beer.

571
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,120
And when the weekend's here, I exercise my right to get paralytic and fight.

572
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,520
Good bloke, fairly.

573
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,500
But I get well-airy when gearing up.

574
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,320
Jesus, look at me funny.

575
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,000
Bouncin' round like bunnies.

576
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,740
I'm likely to cause mischief.

577
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,640
Good clean grief, you must believe, and I ain't no thief.

578
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,000
Law-abiding and all, all legal.

579
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,520
And who cares about my liver when it feels good?

580
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,460
What you need's some real manhood.

581
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,440
Rasher, rasher, burning catcher.

582
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,920
Putting people's backs up.

583
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,500
Public disorder, I give you public disorder.

584
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,120
I down eight pints and run all over the place.

585
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,840
Spit in the face of an officer.

586
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,340
See if that bothers ya.

587
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,400
Cos I never broke a law in my life.

588
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,840
Someday I'm gonna settle down with a wife.

589
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,780
Go on lads, let's have another fight.

590
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:07,960
Erm, hello.

591
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,360
My name's Tim and I'm a criminal.

592
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,840
In the eyes of society, I need to be in jail.

593
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,420
For the choice of herbs I inhale.

594
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,220
This ain't no wholesale operation.

595
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,640
Just a few eights and some Playstations, my vocation.

596
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,140
I pose a threat to the nation.

597
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,680
And down the station, the police hold no patience.

598
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,580
Let's talk space and time.

599
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,180
I like to get deep sometimes and think about Einstein.

600
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,400
And Carl Jung.

601
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,760
And old kung-fu movies I like to see.

602
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Pass the hydrator, please.

603
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,420
Pfft, yeah, I'm floating on thin air.

604
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,060
Going to Amsterdam in the new year.

605
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,980
Top gear there.

606
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,980
Cos I take pride in my hobby.

607
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,520
Home-made bongs using my engineering degree.

608
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,100
Dear leaders, please legalise weed for these reasons.

609
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,340
Like I was saying to him, I told him.

610
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,960
Swap with me and you won't live.

611
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,060
So I smacked him in the head and downed another carlin'.

612
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
Badda badda bing for the lads like.

613
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,360
Mad fight, his face a sad sight.

614
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,760
Vodka and snake bite.

615
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,420
Going on like a right geez.

616
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,620
Ease of twat.

617
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,180
Shouldn't have looked at me like that.

618
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,360
Anyway, I'm an upstanding citizen.

619
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,100
If a war came along, I'd be on the front line with them.

620
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,720
Can't stand crime either.

621
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,260
Them hooligans on heroin.

622
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,520
Drugs and criminal.

623
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,000
Those thugs are the pinnacle of the downfall of society.

624
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,000
I've got all the anger pent up inside of me.

625
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,320
No, I don't see why I should be the criminal.

626
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,240
How can something with no recorded fatalities be illegal?

627
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,980
And how many deaths are there per year from alcohol?

628
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,140
I just completed Gran Turismo on the hardest setting.

629
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,260
We pose no threat on my settee.

630
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,480
All the pizza's here.

631
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,540
Will someone let him in please?

632
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,700
We didn't order chicken.

633
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,320
Not a problem, we'll pick it out.

634
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,080
I doubt they're meant to mess us about.

635
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,320
After all, we're all adults, not louts.

636
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,040
As I was saying, we're friendly, peaceful people.

637
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,940
We're not the ones out there causing trouble.

638
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,540
We just sit in this hazy bubble with our quarters.

639
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,940
Discussing how beautiful Gal Porter is.

640
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,840
MTV, BBC 2, Channel 4 is on till six in the morning.

641
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
Then six in the morning, the sun dawns and it's my bedtime.

642
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,620
Causing trouble?

643
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,700
You're stinking rabble, boys.

644
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,500
Saying I'm the lad who's spoiling it.

645
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,520
You're on drugs.

646
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,460
Really bugs me when people try and tell me I'm a thug.

647
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,580
Just for getting drunk.

648
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,880
I like getting drunk.

649
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,440
Because I'm an upstanding citizen.

650
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,180
If the war came along, I'd be on the front line with them.

651
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,040
Now, Terry, you're repeating yourself.

652
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,460
But that's okay, drunk people can't help that.

653
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,400
A chemical reaction happening inside your brain causes you to forget what you're saying.

654
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,680
What?

655
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,520
I know exactly what I'm saying.

656
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,760
I'm perfectly sane.

657
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,840
You stinking student lame-o.

658
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,640
Go get a job.

659
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,400
And stop robbing us of our taxes.

660
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,560
Erm, well actually, according to research,

661
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,900
government funding for further education pales in insignificance

662
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,120
when compared to how much they spend on repairing

663
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,860
a lairy of drunk people at the weekend in casualty wards all over the land.

664
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,580
Why you stinking little swine, come here!

665
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
I'm gonna battea!

666
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,360
Come here!

667
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,100
The irony of it all by The Streets.

668
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,700
Original pirate material.

669
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,560
And now, a live revival recording from the 5X Day in London, England, yes,

670
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,540
where Pope David Lee Black can be heard perusing the radio.

671
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,260
And now, performing a healing.

672
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,040
Now each, now a sub-genius church service would not be complete.

673
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,740
Unless we had a what?

674
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,220
What's that?

675
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,620
We gotta have a healing.

676
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,920
We gotta have a healing!

677
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,300
And if we can't have a healing, we gotta have a sickening.

678
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,460
Sickening!

679
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,260
Is there anybody in the audience who has a problem, have an ailment, this,

680
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,960
that something bothering you?

681
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,340
Somebody, somebody's gotta, you sir.

682
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,080
There must be someone as sick as me and I'm dying!

683
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,620
Yes sir, we have one.

684
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,020
Sir, sir, tell me, tell me, what's ailing you?

685
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,480
At the moment, I've got chronic alcoholism.

686
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,540
He, did you hear that?

687
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,320
So what?

688
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,440
He has chronic alcoholism.

689
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,660
Alcoholism!

690
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,720
Well, I've got some good news for you.

691
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,320
We have a, we have a, we have a cure for that.

692
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,500
I want you to close your eyes.

693
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,800
Alcoholism isn't an ailment, it's a blessing from God!

694
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,640
We have this holy elixir here.

695
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,800
Fear!

696
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,380
Obstinate!

697
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,460
Obstinate!

698
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,240
I want you to drink it, when you've had it, come on, drink it.

699
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,940
Drink it all.

700
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,040
And this ain't, this is a church of excess, not a church of obstinates.

701
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,720
Come on, drink it!

702
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,220
Come on!

703
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,280
Drink it!

704
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,840
Drink it!

705
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:20,940
Drink it!

706
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,640
Get your fucking neck!

707
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,260
Get it down your fucking neck!

708
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
I'm coming through this here!

709
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,880
He's an alcoholic, my friend!

710
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,940


711
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,940


712
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,940


713
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,220
Bob has rubber stamped his alcoholism!

714
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,880
Yeah!

715
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,460
And there is whiskey for Bob!

716
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,420
Whiskey for Bob!

717
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,480
Whiskey for Bob!

718
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,260
Whoo!

719
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm not afraid.

720
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,980
I like it out there.

721
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,180
Did you go with me?

722
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,320
No.

723
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
He defies all the laws of man and God.

724
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:58,920
Lies!

725
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


726
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


727
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


728
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


729
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


730
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


731
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


732
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


733
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:58,920


734
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,600
There may be an entirely new set of laws, Jim, that we know nothing about.

735
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,340
Come out and say what you mean.

736
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,940
I'm only guessing.

737
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,620
Someone sing in my yard.

738
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,780
Someone sing in my yard.

739
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,640
Kumbaya.

740
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,200
Someone sing in my yard.

741
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,560
Kumbaya.

742
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,020
Kumbaya.

743
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,740
Oh, Lord, kumbaya.

744
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,460
Kumbaya.

745
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,120
Oh, Lord, kumbaya.

746
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,020
All the way your world was made.

747
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,640
With your majestic, superior, cackling hand.

748
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,740
Your people I do not understand.

749
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,700
So do you, my shambhala fans.

750
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,700
Shambhala.

751
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,880
A place we all believe that someday will take us away.

752
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,740
A place of refuge.

753
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,780
With every dark feeling that grows within us.

754
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,000
And understanding develops.

755
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,020
Someday, in Shambhala.

756
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,400
We shall fight them with sticks and toads.

757
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,680
We shall bring them down and squish them with our mighty mortars.

758
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,800
We shall pray to them on altars of cheese and peanuts.

759
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,220
And sing while the devils dance around us.

760
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,800
Ah, Shambhala.

761
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,420
What was that about fighting them with sticks and toads?

762
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,920
Just exactly what kind of toads are you talking about?

763
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,520
Mystic toads, my friend.

764
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,720
I am talking about mystic toads.

765
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,080
The kind that drip from your cerebellum when you are stinking in your sleep.

766
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Everybody loves the hypno-toad.

767
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,300
Oh, yeah, of course.

768
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,540
But I don't think that's what you're talking about.

769
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,240
It's got three eyes.

770
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,400
No, I wasn't talking, senor.

771
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:51,180
I was just informing you how it's going to go down over the next 25 years or so.

772
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,320
The world's in a collision course with its own self, see?

773
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,460
Prophecy.

774
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,400
Obvious-y.

775
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,680
Prophecy.

776
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,580
Prophecy.

777
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,740
Obviously.

778
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:05,140
The Earth and the Moon shall come together and have unnatural sex like a priest and a schoolboy.

779
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:14,300
Children shall all be born with a third nostril very, very visible to those practitioners of the Church of the Evil Sabiones.

780
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,780
This man is absolutely dangerous.

781
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,640
Do you realize how many children are out there probably looking at this program and you're telling them it's not dangerous to use drugs?

782
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
I can name you.

783
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:38,340
I can name you 15 people on crack, crack cocaine alone, and my stepson got on it and he is in prison.

784
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:49,860
The child was a good Christian man and he got on cocaine and he is in prison for stealing because he could not support his habit.

785
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,420
And these children out here are listening to you, man.

786
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,740
Can I compare alcohol?

787
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,920
Alcohol is addictive.

788
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,120
Cigarettes are addictive.

789
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,280
Nobody should do none of them.

790
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,320
Don't compare drugs with alcohol and say that it's all right for the government to sell alcohol and it's not all right to sell drugs.

791
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,120
You're dangerous, man.

792
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,400
And the fellows that fell down...

793
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,640
I have a coffee.

794
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,220
A double latte.

795
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,740
To hell.

796
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,600
To hell.

797
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,360
All the way down to hell.

798
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,180
It has milk in it.

799
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,920
They bounced on the leaves, the acid.

800
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,840
No, no, no acid in mine.

801
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,400
And then fell, fell.

802
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,900
I would also like a...

803
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:44,880
Faster, faster, falling freely into the abyss, into the deep, deep dark abyss into which the psychedelic sounds nightclub was in the bottom of the abyss.

804
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:56,320
And then there was thousands and thousands of cockroaches swarming, seeking out the female fugue.

805
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:05,940
Scope out the action that this mall, here in the puzzling evidence of states, stretching and sprawling over mile after mile, will reconquer the...

806
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,580
They were stolen from them, but Bob...

807
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,180
But what happened?

808
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,220
Bob paid to bring them all back.

809
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:16,940
When high altitude air force planes split the sky with a glowing contrast...

810
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,460
Bob paid for the return of your orgasm with his self, with his pain.

811
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,420
I can't be...

812
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,300
Oh, Bob didn't have anything to say.

813
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,240
He didn't have anything to do with that file.

814
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,500
...

815
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,000
...

816
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,300
88888888888888...

817
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,100
88888888888888...

818
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,280
888888888888888888...

819
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,680
Hello, you're on...

820
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,960
Am I just doing this for the benefit of some other doobie dealer?

821
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,540
...

822
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,600
Well, but you're under no obligation to go to the dealer.

823
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,020
Yeah.

824
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,980
I'm asking 170 bucks.

825
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,720
Don't forget that they will break things for free.

826
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:48,860
...

827
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,120
Okay.

828
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,180
Alrighty, bye bye.

829
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,700
Oh god.

830
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,480
Good luck.

831
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:57,840
Yeah.

832
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,840
Jesus.

833
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,440
What a stupid f***ing home now.

834
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:01,960
Hey, no!

835
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:08,340
And speaking of enjoying things, who can leave out the very basis for our fate?

836
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,660
Our famous, most holy and revered world without end reason for life?

837
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,820
Binsky's Nuclear Beer!

838
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,040
It's the same as the fine amphetamines you are surely familiar with.

839
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,760
It allows us to do our vastly needed work for the economy.

840
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,640
And expands our awareness that we may fully appreciate the wonders that our hardworking

841
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,200
bozo leaders have provided us.

842
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,520
And we are generously allowed injections five times a day.

843
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,960
It helps us mature faster.

844
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,420
Our eldest citizens are 25.

845
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,100
Like football?

846
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,960
Well, wait till you see the war against Mars.

847
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,660
The finest teenage champions have been bred for these gala celebrations which keep alive

848
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,220
the tradition of skillful combat.

849
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,740
Colorful but simple, rugged but rewarding both to winners and losers, the best of the

850
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


851
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


852
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


853
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


854
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


855
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


856
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


857
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


858
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


859
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


860
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


861
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:55,740


862
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:55,800
best.

863
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,840
It's just like the Quirrell days.

864
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,480
A grueling test of stamina with two entire planets aboard.

865
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,560
Watch our Earth team fight for our Binsky's which those Martian speed team just can't do

866
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,840
without.

867
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,440
Whoops, looks like that Martian won't score.

868
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,340
Sorry Mars.

869
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,260
What anti-drug film are we in right now?

870
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,120
Which drug?

871
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,300
Which drug are they trying to warn us against?

872
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,160
That's what I'm...

873
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,180
I don't know.

874
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,740
I don't know.

875
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:25,740


876
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:25,740


877
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:25,740


878
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,640
I don't know.

879
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:26,680


880
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,540
I don't know.

881
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,540
Dave are you handing out...

882
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,440
Those are...

883
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,080
Red.

884
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,240
Man that's not medicine.

885
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,260
Yes these are.

886
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,540
Or candy.

887
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,500
It's red medicine.

888
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,180
These are communist medicine.

889
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:38,900
Those are Martian pellets.

890
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,300
These are...

891
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,320
Oh my god.

892
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
These are Martian pellets.

893
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,980
Little red children orphaned Martian children from Mars that came in after the war.

894
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,720
No way.

895
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,140
Which war?

896
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,560
The ones that lost their antennae.

897
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,660
The war against Mars.

898
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,720
Ah makes them sound...

899
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:50,940
For the beer.

900
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,580
The beer war.

901
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,360
Oh I thought you meant the dinosaur war.

902
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,900
Remember no sperm for beer and all that.

903
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,220
Yeah.

904
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,260
I totally forgot about that one.

905
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,640
I remember the dinosaur war.

906
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,760
You were supposed to forget about it.

907
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,120
I remember when Carter was there.

908
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,120
You know, Carter of Mars.

909
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:02,860
Yeah, Carter.

910
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,180
Jimmy Carter of Mars.

911
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,220
Jimmy Carter of Mars.

912
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,060
Those were the days.

913
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,540
Gerald Ford of Jupiter.

914
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,280
The really advanced presidents were like overmen.

915
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:17,900
They were highly trained in the mystic arts and could expel a pineapple from their nether regions.

916
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:18,880
They didn't need armies.

917
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,460
With unchewed and undigested.

918
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,880
They could swallow it down and expel it a day later completely whole.

919
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,100
Bringing the entire village good luck.

920
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,040
And then they could make...

921
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,520
Garfield could do that.

922
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,720
And making smoothies for all.

923
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,760
In fact, how do you think Garfield won the 1884 Transcendental Reerections?

924
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,680
Right, right.

925
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,080
Because, you know, Ohio is the father and the bad mofo of presidents.

926
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,540
Very strange and chanting.

927
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,880
They say he wandered very far.

928
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,640
Very far.

929
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,500
Over land and sea.

930
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,980
A little child.

931
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,340
A little child.

932
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,440
And so...

933
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,620
Very wise was he.

934
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,360
So beautiful.

935
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:51,580
Very Well.

936
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:51,580


937
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:51,780
A littlejekky.

938
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,280
Stinky.

939
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,160
Stick to your thumb.

940
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,540
Index.

941
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,320
Little ring.

942
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:54,760
Pinky.

943
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,280
And the brain.

944
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,280
So the first thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation.

945
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,520
Discrete location.

946
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,820
Ten by ten foot spot.

947
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,800
Led up by a thousand watt lamp.

948
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,880
Plus two air vents for the air to circulate.

949
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,820
I calculate thirty gallons of water a week.

950
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,080
I'm really into this.

951
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,340
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis to proceed.

952
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,300
After I choose the right seeds its all in motion.

953
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,940
With a little love and devotion.

954
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,220
I can make the front cover of high times.

955
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,160
I hope I'll never get.

956
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,560
Busted and have to pay some fines for having a

957
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,560
Secret garden like Barry White

958
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,600
I must not tell anyone

959
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,140
And keep my lips still tight

960
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,980
I got the growth

961
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,660
If you ain't never had the homegrown

962
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,580
It made you choke

963
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,980
Put your hands in the air

964
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,640
Zen note

965
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,400
And if you're high already

966
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,000
You can't take another toke

967
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,360
Put your hands in the air

968
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,980
Zen note

969
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,720
I got the growth

970
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,940
During the first stage of growth

971
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,320
The seeds germinate slow

972
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,600
Start a root system

973
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,880
Sprout up some leaves and grow

974
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,740
Towards the light

975
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,740
Make sure the temperature's right

976
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,980
I was told by this one guy

977
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,320
Watch your plants closely

978
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,520
You're aware of bugs and fungi

979
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,980
The hurt your garden

980
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,100
They'll only interfere with the vegetative growth

981
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,720
That lasts about two months to a year

982
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,320
When full grown flowers bloom

983
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,340
Big buds and leaves

984
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,180
Watch out for thieves

985
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,080
People like to stash it up their sleeves

986
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,480
It's now been three months

987
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,820
I'm tempted to break off a piece

988
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,700
And roll some blunts

989
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,860
I wonder what it is

990
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,660
Is this some skunk?

991
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,340
I see some purple stems and orange hairs

992
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,160
Could it be the humble mixed with Maui?

993
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,840
It's a hybrid

994
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,160
Look what I did

995
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
I got the green thumb

996
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,740
Observe the superb herb

997
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,760
Bushy branches loud

998
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,120
Smell light green pastel

999
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,580
I got it on deck for all seasons

1000
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,500
And if anyone asks

1001
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,600
It's herっと

1002
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,960
Ne activated

1003
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,740
Although veterans beef

1004
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,880
We eat it

1005
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,280
Like a

1006
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,320
How cool is this?

1007
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:41,520


1008
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:41,520


1009
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:41,520


1010
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,800
What?

1011
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,980
Where'd it come from?

1012
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,620
room with dry air for two to three weeks and I'ma be waiting right here with my loose leaf

1013
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,640
sheets to lovely harvest it came in different amounts four trees each one just a few grams

1014
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,400
shorter than my family I can't wait to smoke it I know this this bomb been waiting so long

1015
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,140
make me want to write a song I guess I'll sell two ounces and puff on the rest find a recipe

1016
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,980
to sprinkle herb on my filet of chicken breast pour some tea chalk for the THC hit the bomb

1017
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,980
cause openness wishes sweet then come off on me man stuck to my fingertips as I tried to break

1018
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,760
it down it went limp the food was earthy the taste was profound it had me buzzing

1019
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,080
for a light year and you best believe I'll have some seeds and be at it again yes indeed

1020
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,980
if you ain't never had the homegrown they made you choke put your hands in the air and say no

1021
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:35,400
and if you're high already you can take another coke put your hands in the air and say no

1022
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,820
if you ain't never had the homegrown they made you choke put your hands in the air and say no

1023
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:46,200
and if you're high already you can take another coke put your hands in the air and say no

1024
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,700

Put your hands in the air and say no

1028
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,740
Grow Room by DJ Poo

1029
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,760
And Mr. Grimm

1030
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,840
And before that, Nature Boy

1031
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,160
That very strange piece was by Artemia Salina

1032
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,820
Hi, this is Jeff.

1033
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,340
It won't take the government to interrupt our food supply.

1034
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,300
There are scores of other man-made disasters

1035
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,100
like a comet or an asteroid impact

1036
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,200
that will do the job just as quickly.

1037
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,320
Are you prepared for relief agencies

1038
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,580
to get contaminated food and water to you in a major crisis?

1039
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,220
One phone call and a food counselor

1040
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,560
will come right to your family

1041
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,740

00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:44,740


1043
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,640
You're in times of disaster.

1044
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,200

The wait.

Force Food.

1056
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,720
Is over.

1057
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,580
Dr. Louis Therese is now available.

1058
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,460
Nostradamus gave spams.

1059
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,040
You're all ruled by the power of the Truth Seeker Company.

1060

24 hours a day.

1061

All right, go ahead.

1062
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,140
Yes, sir.

1063
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:14,820
Oh.

1064
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:17,740
Who's that?

1065
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,960
It's Micah, Paul.

1066
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,960
That's what I was afraid of.

1067
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,140
Micah.

1068
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,960
I can smell you.

1069
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,100
Well, I haven't had much breakfast.

1070
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,860
The years haven't erased your stink.

1071
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,800
No, he volunteered to take a bath.

1072
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,200
All right.

1073
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,260
Turn around.

1074
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,000
Nice and easy.

1075
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,420
Oh, go ahead.

1076
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,260
Hold it, mister.

1077
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,620
Throw that marshal down with your hands up.

1078
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,300
Oh, boy, this is awful.

1079
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:43,720
Oh.

1080
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:43,720


1081
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,140
Hey, I guess you're right.

1082
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,460
Oh.

1083
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,620
I'll see you later.

1084
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,180
That's it.

1085
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,100
You passed the math test.

1086
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,100


1087
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,000
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,700
That's right.

1089
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:13,700


1090
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:13,700


1091
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:13,700


1092
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,140
Don't leave me for so long

1093
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm a dear, a female dear

1094
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,260
Little lady

1095
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,360
That you bring us back to normal

1096
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,660
Can you get to me?

1097
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,440
I wanna know if you can get around

1098
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,940
Can you get to it, baby?

1099
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,040
It's not so far away as the crow flies

1100
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,820
But I'm like a giant bird that can engulf space like a breath

1101
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,040
Oh yeah, that'll take you there in no time

1102
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,920
Hyper, hyper, hyperspace

1103
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,080
With the back of your cerebral cortex passing away

1104
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,560
You've taken too much, you've taken too much, you've taken too much

1105
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,020
Ha ha

1106
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,340
Ha ha

1107
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,620
You sit and watch the evening news

1108
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,860
In a trance, piss in your pants

1109
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,120
You think there's a man outside

1110
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,080
With a gun or a knife ready to take your life

1111
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,700
And he sits there waiting for you

1112
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,540
Behind the wall outside of your view

1113
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,020
Your neighbor hears you screaming tonight

1114
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,220
But you're too busy smoking

1115
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,340
Yes, God

1116
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,900
Too bad your mama found out

1117
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,560
Supposed to be something

1118
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,860
Not a target for a shot

1119
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,980
Downtown, there's a room upstairs

1120
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,600
Where nobody cares

1121
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,980
You can yell all night

1122
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,280
He got picked up at the bus stop

1123
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,480
Had to get away, they had his DNA

1124
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,200
How many broken bodies

1125
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,000
Been inside the trolley?

1126
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,220
Your baby's mama is crying tonight

1127
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,840
But you're too busy smoking

1128
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,640
Yes, God

1129
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,220
Too bad the bottom dropped out

1130
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,760
Too bad your mama found out

1131
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,440
Ha ha

1132
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,560
Who stopped the baby

1133
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,400
He's singing and he pees

1134
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,220
Yeah, intense

1135
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,140
Peeing

1136
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,100
To her

1137
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,660
And that was by CB Truth from the CE Chemically Dependent.

1138
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,100
Their name is like the object, CB.

1139
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:26,480
And in fact you can check out www.cdtruth.com.

1140
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,900
That's a C and a D and truth, all one word.

1141
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,620
And now more no effects.

1142
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,140
Whoops I OD'd.

1143
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,140


1144
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,140


1145
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:44,140
Shorty, shorty, shorty, shorty.

1146
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,520
Whoops I OD'd.

1147
00:54:50,100 --> 00:55:00,800
So you guys know why you're going out on your side, right?

1148
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,540
So we're running, possono.

1149
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,240
反 никогда.

1150
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,700
Cut my life

1151
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,820
No second chance

1152
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,080
No guiding light

1153
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,400
I never meant

1154
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:23,700
To cause

1155
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,780
You pain

1156
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,040
I never thought I'd be the one who took the fall

1157
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,020
I got lost in the moment

1158
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,720
Assholes like to test the limit

1159
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,620
Six minutes down

1160
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,840
Breathing machine

1161
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,080
Brain not feel right

1162
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,340
The look on you

1163
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,520
Is killing me

1164
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,820
Drowning in shame

1165
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,140
But don't feel bad

1166
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,080
Cause I

1167
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,980
Never feared consequences

1168
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,040
Hate regrets more than apologies

1169
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,020
A year in

1170
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,600
has passed Like photographs

1171
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,400
My life is just A scrapbook of

1172
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:56,020
Old friends and faded memories Looks like I pulled the rug from under myself

1173
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:01,600
The fall's too much for me to recover from It's been real fun

1174
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,600
But now I must say goodbye I'll see you all at Okie Dog's

1175
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,040
See you all at Okie Dog's

1176
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,500
Game! Game! Game! Game! Game! Game! Game! Game!

1177
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,700
Come down!

1178
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,100
He died too soon

1179
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,740
Did he? I wonder

1180
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,600

Abe

1189
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,060
Well, I've told you before that I will not tolerate brutality in this penitentiary

1190
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,760
Why, you

1191
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,100
Here, here, stop that

1192
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,540

I'm sorry

1195
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,300
I'm sorry

1196
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,760
I'm sorry

1197
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,600
I'm sorry

1198
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,460
I wasn't ready

1199
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,460


1200
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,460


1201
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,460


1202
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,040
Okay, please, answer me

1203
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,980
I'm the passe pusher

1204
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,900
I'm his best friend

1205
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:40,900


1206
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:40,900


1207
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,680
Je bend unschuldig Woods

1208
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:51,820
The type of soldier we had He would not mistake hoy in the ведьer read the spelling and order of sorcery

1209
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,080
He creates muzzleudi campaigns when the death is a Barnachusetts shape spell

1210
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,760
They combine to become one single blasphemula,

1211
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,620
which makes a last tug of mycotic cell division,

1212
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,340
and voila, there are now two worms where there once was one.

1213
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,100
But what becomes of them now?

1214
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,980
We'll learn not only that,

1215
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,720
but also why the peen worm is so crucial to our nuclear beer

1216
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,260
and even the Martian War in Series 9.

1217
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,680
This show, The Hour of Slack.

1219
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,160
Please, Bob, I'm hoping now I can give out your phone number,

1220
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,500
your own phone number for people to call me.

1221
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:52,460
And now we'll copy the Firesign Theater again for those of you on drugs.

1222
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:00,860
Okay, friends on the internet, where I can flog our swag legally,

1223
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,620
if you want to help yourself and the Church of the Subgenius

01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:09,380
and get a pretty cool package with like 25 different nifty things in it,

1225
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,700
like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card,

1226
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,660
you need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.

1227

You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get,

1228
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,720
and you really do get to go to the,

1229
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,700
the Subgenius Forum, which is members only,

1230
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,880
and we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1231
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,260
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1232
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:33,940
Isn't that funny?

1233
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,240
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of

1234
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,520
with Bob's face on it.

1235
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:45,580
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics on coffee mugs and so forth.

1236
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:51,540
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs

1237
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,000
and old MP3 stashes.

1238
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,840
And you can buy all of that waiting for you at our online store.

1239
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,440
And best of all, from our main online store,

1240
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,920
you can buy The Book of the Subgenius,

1241
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,580
which is by far the greatest thing we have ever done.

1242
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,400
It's an actual Simon and Schuster book,

1243
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,040
22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.

1244

And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1245
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,760
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also,

01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,080
