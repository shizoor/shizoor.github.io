00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
They named the pathway over and over again.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,140
I was driving the Chrysler and Bob was on TV.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,900
The day that my boy got kicked by a mule.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:34,020
I was with Cousin Junior for DNA back farm.

5
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,560
I was drunk, I was lonely, I was wild.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,260
And I was drinking Budweiser and Bob was on TV.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,540
Drinking Budweiser, watching Bob on TV.

8
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,960
Swallowing red wine, they mocked me all day.

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,860
We named the pathway over and over again.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,480
I was drinking Budweiser.

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,320
Budweiser, and Bob was on TV.

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,700
I was drinking Budweiser, and Bob was on TV.

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,920
Okay, that was kind of leading into the next show.

14
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,000
That was Drinking Bud and Watching Bob by Buck Naked.

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,740
Reverend Buck Naked, that is.

16
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,140
Oh, yeah!

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,080
Thank you so much for playing Buck's Mighty 45 there.

18
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,000
You bet. It's got another side, too.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,820
I might get that on next week.

20
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,660
That's a...

21
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,000
It was helped written by a friend of mine.

22
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,240
That's a sexy song.

23
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,500
Oh, man.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,180
Fly Killers.

25
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,600
Let's go!

26
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,380
Oh!

27
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,860
This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.

28
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,560
The broadcasters of your area, in voluntary cooperation with the FCC and other authorities,

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,580
have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.

30
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,040
If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed where to tune in your area.

31
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,740
For Bob.

32
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,540
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,840
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated adoption.

34
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,900

You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,000
Welcome dear friends.

52
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,540
When will you leave?

53
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,360
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

54
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

55
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,580
The time doesn't ever see its father in no way.

56
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:18,960
Yeah.

57
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,620
Now the dead cat.

58
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,100
Hold the knot.

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,460
Yeah.

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,300
Again, Matt.

61
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
And do you know what happened?

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,700
And do you know what happened?

63
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
And do you know what happened?

64
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,500
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,100
Well, I'm afraid of God.

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,840
God put money in that empty purse. Don't ever let it be broke again.

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,920
You do what you do because you want to.

68
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,220
I do what I do because...

69
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,320
Because Bob...

70
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,640
Bob told me to!

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,780
You got a piece of that.

72
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,300
You can't do that to me.

73
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,060
Okay.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,100
Yes.

76
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,480
Yes.

77
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,520
Yes.

78
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:00,520


79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:00,520


80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,280
Well, dear friends.

81
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:12,320
I had considered revealing to you all the plot of the subgenius movie treatment.

82
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,460
But, uh, I don't think I'm going to do that this week because that takes some preparation

83
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,920
and sound effects and music and so forth.

84
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:20,980
And I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.

85
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:39,260
Instead, we're going to study this essay by Dick Sutphin called The Battle for Your Mind, a pretty well-done study of persuasion and brainwashing techniques being used on the public today.

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:58,660
And the author, Dick Sutphin, is a professional hypnotist, and I believe if he's the same person I'm thinking of, I believe that he's also a musician who sells a lot of kind of laid-back tapes in the new age category.

87
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:08,740
But in a way, this essay shows you that just like with other movements,

88
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,240
the new age isn't all bad.

89
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,260
And he talks here about the birth of conversion.

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,260
Conversion, he says, is a nice word for brainwashing.

91
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:33,880
And any study of brainwashing has to begin with a study of Christian revivalism in 18th century America.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,140
Apparently, Jonathan Edwards actually accidentally discovered the technique.

93
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:59,260
During a religious crusade in 1735 in Northampton, Massachusetts, by inducing guilt and acute apprehension and by increasing the tension, the, quote, sinners, unquote, attending his revival meetings would break down and completely submit.

94
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:09,160
Technically, what Edwards was doing was creating conditions that wipe the brain slate clean so that the mind accepts.

95
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,060
New programming.

96
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,080
The problem was that the new input was negative.

97
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,940
He would tell them, you're a sinner.

98
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,840
You're destined for hell.

99
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,500
As a result, one person committed suicide and another attempted suicide.

100
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:34,000
And many others found that although they thought they'd achieved salvation, they were obsessed with a diabolical temptation to take their own lives.

101
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,800
Now, friends, they have considerably modified that technique.

102
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,240
And they're not going to change it.

103
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,160
Since then.

104
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,240
Bob's

105
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,220
What did you say, Bob?

106
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,940
I said, good Lord.

107
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,540
What to lose?

108
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,220
A little time.

109
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,520
Hurt your ego a little bit, baby.

110
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,060
Probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now.

111
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,680
So that's no big deal.

112
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,840
So why not?

113
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
So why not?

114
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,060
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what will happen?

115
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,240
I don't know. You don't know.

116
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,780
And you will never know.

117
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,760
You have signed the application.

118
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,260
You do have the kit.

119
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,820
None of those things are important.

120
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,940
But there is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,960
And when you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is going to say about it.

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Because nobody else is going to pay your bills for you.

123
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,760
Why not?

124
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,980
You don't know.

125
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,540
And you will never know.

126
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,560
And who knows?

127
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,380
Just maybe.

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
Just maybe.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
You could have one of the biggest...

130
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,620
I don't know.

131
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,760
But even more important, you don't know.

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,580
You will never know.

133
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,260
You will never know.

134
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,460
Just maybe.

135
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,340
You're in for a new and exciting experience.

136
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,980
You have signed the application.

137
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,880
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail?

138
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,880
Have you got your pipe through the mail?

139
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
Friends, attention all musicians.

140
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,580
You're invited to write or phone for information about the Musicians National Hotline Association,

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,320
a non-profit organization that helps musicians find bands and helps bands find musicians and gigs.

142
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:05,740
Write to the Musicians National Hotline Association, Box 7733, Salt Lake.

143
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Utah, 84107.

144
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,780
Or phone 801-268-2000.

145
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,640
I can't believe there's musicians trying to find bands.

146
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,020
There's so many bands out there.

147
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,760
It's ridiculous.

148
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:34,360
Once again, that number to write if you're looking to connect up with a band is Box 7733, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84107.

149
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,740
Or phone 801-268-2000.

150
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:48,080
Very close to the Good Sex for Mutants dating service sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius at no cost to us.

151
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,580
And only to dear cat lady up there in Utah.

152
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,000
And girls, you need to join the Good Sex for Mutants dating service.

153
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,940
We'll give you the number to write at the end of this broadcast.

154
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,480
Notice I didn't say boys because, well, there's too many boys in the Good Sex.

155
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,720
There are a lot of boy and men in the Good Sex.

156
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:05,720


157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:05,720


158
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,580
And the girls, I think they don't need the Good Sex for Mutants dating service.

159
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,820
But you might get something out of it.

160
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,240
You don't know whether you need it or not.

161
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:14,840
Hoo!

162
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,960
The whole world is going crazy.

163
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,480
We're not against it.

164
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,940
And so let's move on to the message.

165
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,140
The techniques and stagings will vary from church to church.

166
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,700
Many use speaking in tongues.

167
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,960
To generate catharsis in some while the spectacle creates intense excitement in others.

168
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:51,700
And it's becoming more and more sophisticated as professionals come into the market for brainwashing.

169
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,800
A man in Los Angeles is designing, building, and reworking a lot of churches around the country.

170
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,280
He tells ministers what they need and how to use it.

171
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,580
And this man's track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income

172
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,240
will double if the minister follows his instructions.

173
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,500
He admits that about 80% of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting.

174
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:22,460
And dear friends, these conversion techniques, I mean, frankly, what I'm about to tell you

175
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:30,560
is our secrets of how the Church of the Subgenius works, just like any other mind control cult.

176
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,580
We have studied these techniques non-professionally.

177
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,640
Not like your Falwells and your Criswells.

178
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,920
We're working strictly from an intuitive basis.

179
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,620
And also we admit what we're doing, which is what I'm doing right now.

180
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,780
Subgenius mind control gone out of control.

181
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,980
They handed me this jar and said my brain was in it.

182
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,600
And then when the police came, they poured it down the sink.

183
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,440
Bob?

184
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,660
Bob?

185
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,260
Bob?

186
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,440


187
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,720
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

188
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,420
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

189
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,440
Bob?

190
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,420
That's your key phrase.

191
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,620
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

192
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,180
We are controlling transmission.

193
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,180
Among the conversion techniques mentioned,

194
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,220
the meeting or training takes place in an area

195
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,780
where participants are cut off from the outside world.

196
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,140
This may be any place, a private home, a rural or remote setting,

197
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,900
or even a hotel ballroom where the participants are allowed

198
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,960
only limited bathroom usage.

199
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,400
In human potential trainings,

200
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,300
the controllers will give a lengthy talk about the importance of

201
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,600
quote, keeping agreements in life, unquote.

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,460
The participants, they're told that if they don't keep agreements,

203
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,100
their life will never work.

204
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,980
The real reason for the agreements is to alter internal chemistry,

205
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,000
which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a slight malfunction

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,300
of the nervous system, which in turn,

207
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
increases the conversion potential.

208
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,620
Since the importance of keeping agreements is so high on their priority list,

209
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,440
the converts will then twist the arms of everyone they know,

210
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,080
attempting to talk them into attending a free introductory session

211
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,160
offered at future dates by the organization.

212
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,900
The new converts are zealots.

213
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,760
In fact, the inside term for merchandising,

214
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,380
the largest and most successful human potential,

215
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,440
is zealot by zealot.

216
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,780
Ah, yes, dear friends, so true, so true.

217
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,040
We will control the vertical.

218
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,760
Kill, kill, that.

219
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,080
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels

220
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,440
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

221
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,320
Then we dip them in the sacred water.

222
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,380
And what exactly does this do for them?

223
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,800
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

224
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

225
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,840
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

226
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,000
Materialize.

227
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
The Reverend Janor Hypercleets from Little Rock, Arkansas,

228
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,080
tried to make it all a little clearer to me

229
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,120
with his own explanation of his conversion into the church of the subgenius.

230
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,660
They said this jar was my mind and then they poured it down a sink.

231
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,860
Run that by me again. I don't know. What do you mean?

232
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,700
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink.

233
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,100
Can you go into a little more detail?

234
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:25,460
Well, Bob is the original church that sanctifies the worship

235
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:31,480
and launching of bodily parts of golfers.

236
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,940
A schedule is maintained that causes physical and mental fatigue.

237
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,000
And this is mainly accomplished by long hours in which the participants

238
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,940
are given no opportunity for relaxation or reflection.

239
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
One of the most successful human potential seminars

240
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,060
forces the participants to stand on a stage in front of the entire audience

241
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,940
while being verbally attacked by the trainers.

242
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,380
A public opinion poll shows that the number...

243
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,780
one most fearful situation an individual could encounter

244
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,960
is to speak to an audience.

245
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,880
It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor of an office building.

246
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,440
Friends, and now I can tell you from personal experience that that is true.

247
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,560
That was the big fear I had to overcome in order to be a half-decent subgenius preacher.

248
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,440
Um...

249
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,380
So you can imagine the fear.

250
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,100
The fear and tension this situation generates within the participants.

251
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,520
Many faint, but most cope with the stress by mentally going away.

252
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,460
They literally go into an alpha state,

253
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,440
which automatically makes them many times more suggestible than they normally are.

254
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,220
Another loop of the downward spiral into conversion is successful.

255
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,360
The fifth clue that conversion tactics or brainwashing is being used to control the brain

256
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,480
is the introduction of jargon.

257
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,100
And friends, as you well know, we subgeniuses are experts in jargon.

258
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,000
New terms that have meaning only to the insiders who participate.

259
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,860
Vicious language is also frequently used purposefully to make participants uncomfortable.

260
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,040
And here's where we differ, friends, from the New Age and the Christian cults and so many others.

261
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,860
And the money-making cults, friends.

262
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,960
The money-makers.

263
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,320
The final tip-off is that there is no humor in the communications,

264
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,200
at least until the participants are converted.

265
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,920
Then, merrymaking and humor are highly desirable

266
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,480
as symbols of the new joy the participants have supposedly found.

267
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,540
Cult gatherings or human potential trainings are an ideal environment to observe firsthand

268
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,020
what is technically called a new joy.

269
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,220
And this is what we call the Stockholm Syndrome.

270
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,700
This is a situation in which those who are intimidated, controlled, or made to suffer

271
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:19,080
begin to love, admire, and sometimes even sexually desire their controllers or captors.

272
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,020
But let me inject a word of warning here, says Dick Sutphin.

273
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,200
If you think you can attend such gatherings and not be affected,

274
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,820
you are probably wrong.

275
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,540
He describes a situation where a woman who was a trained psychologist

276
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
was sucked into a voodoo cult.

277
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,120
We got puppet boy!

278
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh, feels so good!

279
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,140
Dear friends, you know,

280
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,600
as we said last week,

281
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,800
if we can't raise $40 million by 1988,

282
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,520
then our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is going to die of AIDS.

283
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,980
And friends, you can call this station

284
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
and talk to the very will of Dobbs itself

285
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,640
at 823-7490 or 828-9500.

286
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,400
Come on, call in. We dare you.

287
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,120
Go ahead. Ask questions.

288
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,920
What's going on here?

289
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,140
And, you know, I can't guarantee what kind of an answer.

290
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,220
What you ought to do is put headphones on and listen closer to the show.

291
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,800
But that number to call, well, they're already calling the will of Dobbs.

292
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,820
That number to call is 823-7490 or 828-9500.

293
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,500
And friends, you don't want to let Bob die of AIDS.

294
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,720
Pledge that $40 million quick.

295
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,740
Listen to this beautiful Chinese music.

296
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,740
Oh, yes.

297
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,600
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation

298
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,080
to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

299
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,800
There is absolutely no other possibility.

300
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,500
Hee hee hee.

301
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,360
But don't you see you'd be doing exactly what you say you're fighting, killing, using force because you're certain you're right.

302
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,440
But it wouldn't be the same thing because we'd be advocating nothing, forcing nothing.

303
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,140
Now, there are many strong men in the world today fighting for tolerance, compassion, wisdom,

304
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,260
for your right to be different, to be wrong even.

305
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,940
They wouldn't be tough.

306
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,660
Only the dogma could be infallible.

307
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,720
Trying to play God.

308
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,360
You just can't do that.

309
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Why not?

310
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,160
If God's too busy.

311
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,760
Who's to say that it's not his will, that we're not his agents?

312
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,040
I had to learn about Bob on the street.

313
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,340
Yeah, well, you couldn't start your car.

314
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,900
That's it.

315
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,780
You're here to prevent the putrefaction.

316
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,440
But this putrid world only tells that we're not doing our job.

317
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,120
This is Sister Chris from Dixie.

318
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,460
WFMU in New Jersey.

319
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,680
The half hour of slap show.

320
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,360
Absolutely correct.

321
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,600
On the ball.

322
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,000
All the time.

323
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,020
This is WFMU FM East Orange.

324
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,680
No, it's not.

325
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,480
It's KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

326
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,100
And has just presented half hour of the subgenius cassette program.

327
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,100
Courtesy of the...

328
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,920
The subgenius foundation.

329
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,480
Yes, a real organization.

330
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,060
Disorganization.

331
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,520
The particular tape we heard was media barrage of an undetermined number.

332
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,760
Also known as subgenius intro.

333
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:28,100
The address, in case you'd like more information, is post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

334
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,920
Great.

335
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,100
Here is the subgenius foundation.

336
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,560
Thank you, Sister Chris.

337
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,640
I am Sister Chris.

338
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,920
And I present the subgenius program each week here at Monday from midnight to approximately

339
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
1230.

340
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:51,580
And, dear friends, tonight I wish to speak to you about the word, yes, the word O Bob,

341
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,100
that manifests itself in many ways in blatant, outright, and rogue subgenii.

342
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,320
Yes, you know that.

343
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,240
The power of Bob's word seeps into and or blasts through conspiracy programming with truth and gut-blasting humor.

344
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:18,580
It virtually takes over your life, twisting and turning you so that you can leap with ease onto the luck plane and glide along so that you can enjoy the yakutisma.

345
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,260
Not to be confused with the yakutisma.

346
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,220
Yakutisma.

347
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,000
Along the full creature comforts of slack.

348
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,980
Now the only thing that matters is now.

349
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,480
The eternal present moment always subject to change.

350
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,840
And it naturally follows that the word of any subgenius is subject to change.

351
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,100
In other words, what a subgenius says becomes the gospel truth for that moment.

352
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,940
Anything said after that, even a contradiction, replaces the power of the previous truth.

353
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,640
You know what I mean.

354
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,580
No?

355
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,000
Well, in the words of Bob.

356
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,120
I always lie, and I'm always right.

357
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,160
Music is another way the powerful force of Bob's transferable tongue enters the game.

358
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,020
It's very much like the reversible blades on the Popiel Vegematic.

359
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,820
Bob's tongue dices, slices, julians, and even cuts through titanium steel vault doors.

360
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:26,920
When you combine the vocals inspired by Bob with musical talent and or ineptitude inspired by Bob, you've got anti-music.

361
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,780
A concept able to leap conspiracy categories with a single bar or drone.

362
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:42,060
You listeners out there, you WFM new listeners, being the erudite lowlife scum that you are, can spot most conspiracy music a mile away.

363
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,320
But don't be deceived.

364
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:55,840
Just because an artist or group, not a marching band, has a recording contract with a major label, or they may have attained a certain level of success or at least recognition,

365
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,980
that doesn't mean they're not a part of the music industry.

366
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,020
That does not mean that they are a conspiracy sanctioned group.

367
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,580
They are...

368
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,160
There are some subgeniuses in places of power, in record companies and publications.

369
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,180
How else do you think the book of the subgenius got published?

370
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:19,940
By the way, the book, which was formerly published by McGraw-Hill, has been picked up by another publishing house for the word to come.

371
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,740
Anyway, the message of Slack is more important than any image projected or perceived.

372
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:32,380
Hell, it's more relative than Einstein ever thought.

373
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,460
Oh, we love you, Sister Kris. We're in love. We're in love.

374
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,540
Hoo-ah!

375
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,060
So true.

376
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,040
sucky

377
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,800
in the

378
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:23,800


379
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:23,820
well

380
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:23,820


381
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:23,820


382
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:23,820


383
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,920
yeah

384
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,160
yeah

385
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,160


386
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,700
I'll say it again

387
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,780
In the land of the free

388
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,260
Use your freedom and joy

389
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,040
Your freedom and joy

390
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,060
In ancient Rome

391
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,820
There was a poem

392
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,440
About a dog

393
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,460
Who found two bones

394
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,100
He picked the one

395
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,960
He licked the other

396
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,740
And one in circles

397
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,360
He peed his own death

398
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,620
Freedom and joy

399
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,220
What you got

400
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,760
Freedom and joy

401
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,900
No more a sense of shame

402
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,400
But really a demand for recognition

403
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,280
As a form of life

404
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,380
And God's judgment

405
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,480
Is going to come and fall again

406
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,300
Upon a godless, Christ-rejecting,

407
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,940
Blasphemous society

408
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,460
Well, if this sounds

409
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,220
Paranoid, you're right

410
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,440
But I think I have good reason

411
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,100
To be paranoid

412
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,620
It's a strange world

413
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,040
Out there

414
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,120
This is what life is like

415
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,140
At a bottom line level

416
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,260
And I'm not going to make you

417
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,600
Cut through a lot of other stuff

418
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,660
To get through it

419
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,680
Here's what it is

420
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
There's no gimmick about that

421
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,320
It's straightforward

422
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,080
It's strong

423
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,340
And it's elemental

424
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,380
Heavy stuff

425
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,860
A world of

426
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,560
Witchcraft

427
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,100
Rudin

428
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,220
Devil worship

429
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,920
A wild, gnawing

430
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,220
Animal hunger

431
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,520
Will grow in you

432
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,260
If you call 823-7490

433
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,260
823-7490

434
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,040
And talk to the will of God

435
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,580
Throughout the years

436
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,180
Thank you

437
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
You're welcome

438
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,700
Further we get into

439
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,320
Um

440
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,100
The decognition process

441
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,060
Very important to brainwashing

442
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,360
Step one is alertness reduction

443
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,400
Which I think, personally

444
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,240
That most large companies use

445
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,120
The controllers cause

446
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,240
The nervous system to malfunction

447
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,060
Making it difficult to distinguish

448
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,040
Between fantasy and reality

449
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,660
This can be accomplished

450
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,740
In several ways

451
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,480
Poor diet is one

452
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,080
Watch out for those brownies

453
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,920
And Kool-Aid

454
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,300
And the other thing is

455
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,100
The sugar throws

456
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,300
The nervous system off

457
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,160
More subtle

458
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,860
Oh, and friends

459
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,040
Some of you will be quite

460
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,480
Familiar with this

461
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,440
More subtle is the

462
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,640
Spiritual diet

463
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,860
Used by many cults

464
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,040
They eat only vegetables and fruits

465
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,700
Without grounding of

466
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,240
Grains, nuts, seeds, dairy products, etc

467
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,900
An individual becomes mentally

468
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,180
Spate

469
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,640
Inadequate

470
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,920
Sleep is another primary way

471
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,260
To reduce alertness

472
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,720
Especially when combined

473
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,300
With long hours of work

474
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,240
Or intense physical activity

475
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,960
False slack in so many forms, friends

476
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,400
Programmed confusion

477
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,780
Where you're deluged

478
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,800
With new information

479
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,380
Lectures, discussion groups, and so forth

480
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,060
And at the same time

481
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,980
The controller bombards

482
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,620
The individual with questions

483
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,280
And step three is thought-based

484
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Stopping

485
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,840
Techniques are used to cause the mind

486
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,340
To go flat

487
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,980
These are altered state of consciousness

488
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,520
Techniques that initially induce calmness

489
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,180
By giving the mind something simple to deal with

490
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,660
And focusing awareness

491
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,720
The continued use brings on a feeling of elation

492
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,820
And eventually hallucination

493
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,840
The result is a reduction of thought

494
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,820
And eventually, if used long enough

495
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,780
The cessation of all thought and withdrawal

496
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
From everyone and everything

497
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,860
Except that which the controllers direct

498
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,500
The takeover is then complete

499
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,960
Oh yes, friends

500
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,760
Isn't it so cosmic and wonderful

501
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,420
To achieve the cessation of desire

502
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,840
The cessation of thought

503
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,920
Where you can just let the godhead

504
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,780
Make your decisions for you

505
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,340
And if it just so happens that

506
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,360
Some powerful individual

507
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,280
Some charismatic person

508
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,120
Like for instance

509
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,040
Reverend Ivan Stagg

510
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,720
Is given the permission by your brain

511
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,380
To make your decisions for you

512
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,780
Then isn't that just fine?

513
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,060
And oh, we have so many techniques for this

514
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,100
And we subgeniuses once again have

515
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,320
Hey!

516
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,820
I can't seem to brainwash those dogs

517
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,460
Through subversive measures

518
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,520
Devo passes on the word of Bob

519
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,280
By the name of the godhead

520
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,120
And I, uh, we

521
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
If you take a look at our last album cover

522
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,580
His name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines

523
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,540
Of each of the band members

524
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,340
Right next to the word sex

525
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,220
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

526
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,720
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex

527
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,840
Bob put money in that empty purse

528
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,140
Don't ever let him be broke again

529
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,300
You do what you do cause you want to

530
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,420
I do what I do cause

531
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,440
Cause, cause Bob

532
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,980
Bob told me to!

533
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,900
Bob!

534
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,700
Bob!

535
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,980
Bob!

536
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,300
Bob!

537
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,100
Bob!

538
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,580
Uh, they'll also tell us about the mysterious

539
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs

540
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,320
Who, as I understand it again

541
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,000
Is the high muckety muck

542
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,180
Of the church of the subgenius

543
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,980
Uh

544
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
Hello Bob

545
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,100
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived

546
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,580
Perhaps you've been deceived by

547
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,540
by evangelists masquerading as angels of light.

548
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,460
I got this weird thing, you see.

549
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,440
You know how people often get reincarnated into this material plane,

550
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,840
no matter how hard they try?

551
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,140
Yeah, yeah, man.

552
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,340
I must have committed suicide 300 times,

553
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,500
and I keep ending up in the same lifetime

554
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,200
in a slightly different observational universe.

555
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,040
And I have to talk to you guys because...

556
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,580
Yeah, man, that's really heavy.

557
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,220
Yeah, it's deeper than I can handle.

558
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,440
Whoa, just slow it down a bit.

559
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,740
I keep being born on October 21st, 1952,

560
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,400
and I end up going through the same lifetime.

561
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,900
Oh, well, okay, your problem is you've got a bad case of the 50s.

562
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,620
I've seen it.

563
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,040
That grassy knoll just went around the country shooting people.

564
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,540
There were 10 people there shooting that looked just like Terry Thornley.

565
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,500
Got it, dead center.

566
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,580
Terry Thornley!

567
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,460
Some people use fake names in this tree.

568
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,080
They hide behind a pseudonym.

569
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,080
They're afraid the conspiracy is going to come after them.

570
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,820
Just because the conspiracy gets their address,

571
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,200
well, fine.

572
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,680
Friends, I'm the one who's got access.

573
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,780
Me and only one other person on this whole planet,

574
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,680
someone else,

575
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,860
has access to the identity codes for all of you,

576
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,340
all the listeners of this show.

577
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,260
Cue night of slight shooting tape.

578
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,580
Um, one of these techniques would be marching.

579
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,500
Yes, we get the bobbies out there marching along in a great parade.

580
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,180
Another one is meditation.

581
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,160
Oh, it's so laid back.

582
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,940
Get them into a fixed alpha state.

583
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,400
And which isn't always bad.

584
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,920
But then we begin to rather than,

585
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,980
I mean, we could call it Nirvana,

586
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:02,140
but instead we begin to fill in the blanks left by the meditation.

587
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,020
Don't you see?

588
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:09,000
They said this jar was my mind and then they poured it down a sink.

589
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,620
You can't use your brain to think about it.

590
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,600
You can't use your brain.

591
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:13,820
Ah!

592
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,600
Ah!

593
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Ah!

594
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,440
Ah!

595
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,500
Ah!

596
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:22,920
Ah!

597
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,460
Ah!

598
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:23,460


599
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:23,620


600
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:23,720
Ah!

601
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:23,900
Ah!

602
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,540
And they are shooting each other because of a new prize.

603
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,460
Fuck the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.

604
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,600
Number of a man.

605
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:42,680
His number is six hundred three score and six.

606
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,720
Jehovah one.

607
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:45,880
Neil Gu budgets.

608
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:55,980
Cosmetic is a christian welfare mes Naomi ska cant such a mustache ug understand is six

609
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:08,360
zero twenty dollar request for a person So just think about this.

610
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,280
We probably know most in the rest of material we've thrown give me false Jump

611
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:17,380
God can use you individually and collectively to begin to address and deal with those problems.

612
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,100
You have signed the application.

613
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Welcome aboard.

614
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,420
But one doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says, watch out.

615
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,220
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.

616
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:39,180
But the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.

617
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:47,120
Something says, look out, this guy is fishy, cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

618
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,660
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English, but soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language.

619
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,840
When they haven't even been to kindergarten spiritually.

620
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,920
We eat more, drink more, play more and do less.

621
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,200
Start.

622
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,180
We earn a good living than any other people in history.

623
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,580
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music.

624
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,300
And I might add a lot of it's worse.

625
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,760
The cultists would have no following.

626
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,600
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.

627
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:26,360
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know.

628
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,940
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debauchery, the cruel and tortious executions,

629
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,420
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

630
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,600
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

631
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:51,540
With a vocal and activist minority ready, apparently to burn the bomber's field of fear for more.

632
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,620
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.

633
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,980
And that's washing people.

634
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,860
I'll tell you that.

635
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,700
They dwell in caves, not high rise apartments.

636
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:11,500
They may not have found the key to affluence, but they found an endless supply of dope,

637
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,060
uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.

638
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,920
Free access to a distillery, I suppose.

639
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,400
Ah, yes, the harvest.

640
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,040
You can count on that.

641
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,160
Or the field.

642
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,440
For more.

643
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
My friends, we could feed another man.

644
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,180
We could feed another nation with our garbage.

645
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,300
What more than a space hogger on Earth is the church of subgeniuses?

646
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,520
I don't know.

647
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,660
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

648
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,220
Bang.

649
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,280
Are you blaming God for atom bombs, atomic warheads?

650
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,880
Don't.

651
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know.

652
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,460
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

653
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,040
Why?

654
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,860
Bang.

655
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,760
Bang.

656
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,340
Bang.

657
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,200
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

658
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,480
Ah, yes, the harvest.

659
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,480
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.

660
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,140
Oh, yes, dear friends.

661
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,320
Dear friends.

662
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,660
And you can write for more information about Jeff and his wife, and you can write for more

663
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:32,660


664
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:32,660


665
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,400
information about the church of subgeniuses.

666
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm going to be giving that P.O. box.

667
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,980
And that's what you really need to do is write for information because what we have in print

668
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,080
is at least equal to, if not completely surpassing of what we do on the radio.

669
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,160
That may not impress all of you, but what the heck, you know what I mean?

670
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,640
And that P.O. box to write to is bob.com.

671
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:02,640


672
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,400
Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

673
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,500
75214.

674
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,160
Ah, yes, Bob started here in Dallas, and that just figures because Dallas is, you know,

675
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:24,940
I don't care what they, as much as I hate this city, as far as I'm concerned, it is

676
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,980
every bit the equal of every other big city I've been to, which includes Paris, London,

677
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,480
and Peking, dear friends.

678
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:42,380
And, you know, in other words, life is sorry just about everywhere you go unless you got

679
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,740
a bunch of damn bob in your life.

680
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,020
See?

681
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,300
That's the whole thing.

682
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,980
You got to get some of that bob in your life, and half of you already got a bob in your

683
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,360
pocket.

684
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,340
You don't even know it.

685
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,260
Oh, yes.

686
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:01,500
So why don't you call the Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490 or 828-9500.

687
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,460
I'll see you next time.

688
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:02,460


689
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,160
Maybe we'll just send that guy back.

690
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,700
That's a pretty good thing.

691
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:22,760


692
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,540
That's much better.

693
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:23,540


694
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:23,540


695
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:23,620
So here comes stuff, I gotta say.

696
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,380
Now, how are you guys doing?

697
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,140
How are your anchors doing?

698
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,140


699
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,000
I can catch you there with the electric hitchhiker.

700
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,960
We are back!

701
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,440
OK opposition just showing people.

702
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,920
Got it, man?

703
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,140
Yeah.

704
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,620
I think it's something that, uh...

705
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,500
Parified.

706
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:17,720
And the third thought-stopping technique is chanting.

707
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,860
Such as, for instance, friends speaking in tongues

708
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,080
could also be included in this category.

709
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,840
And so we find, Dick Sutton says,

710
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,120
that, uh...

711
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,260
Um...

712
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,580
The people most susceptible to mass movements

713
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,440
would probably be about a third of the population.

714
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,520
What Eric Hoffer calls true believers.

715
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,800
They are joiners and followers.

716
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,000
People who want to give away their power.

717
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,060
They look for answers, meaning, and enlightenment

718
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,620
outside themselves.

719
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,400
Hoffer calls these people

720
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,180
eternally incomplete

721
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,640
and eternally insecure.

722
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:02,360
Oh.

723
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,160
All praise Bob.

724
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,080
And if it's not for those Bobbies,

725
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,420
how I'd have to go out and get a real job.

726
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,880
And never underestimate the potential danger of these people.

727
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,720
They can easily be molded into fanatics

728
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,740
who will gladly work and die for their holy cause.

729
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,180
It's a substitute for their lost faith in themselves

730
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,620
and offers them a substitute for individual hope.

731
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,300
Hitler's brown shirts were true believers.

732
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,040
Yes.

733
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,480
The moral majority is made up of true believers.

734
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,020
All cults are composed of true believers.

735
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,880
You'll find them in politics, churches, businesses,

736
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,520
and social cause groups.

737
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,180
They are the fanatics in these organizations.

738
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,760
And, uh, of course, you have to throw in a common hatred,

739
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,640
of course, friends.

740
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,960
An enemy or a devil is essential to the success of mass movements.

741
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,220
Hitler's devil was the Jews.

742
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,020
Hitler's devil was the Jews.

743
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,020


744
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,720
And Christians have Satan himself, but that isn't enough.

745
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,500
They've thrown in the occult, the New Age thinkers,

746
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,660
and anyone who opposes their integration of church and politics.

747
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,620
Um, in revolutions, the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy.

748
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,140
The conspiracy, in other words, dear friends.

749
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,260
Some human potential movements are far too clever

750
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,220
to ask their graduates to join anything,

751
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,060
thus labeling themselves a cult.

752
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,320
But if you look closely, you'll find that their devil is

753
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,240
anyone and everyone who hasn't taken their training.

754
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,240
And, friends, this, this stuff is so true.

755
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,200
It really is.

756
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,160
Um, I've seen it in action myself.

757
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,840
Even, and this is the most important thing,

758
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,660
even before we tried.

759
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,680
And even nowadays, when we don't try

760
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,200
to use brainwashing techniques on our listeners

761
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,560
or our, uh, audience who comes to a subgenius revival,

762
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,700
well, it somehow...

763
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,760
It's not just the subgenius.

764
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,020
It's the subgenius of the people who are so eager

765
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,000
to have some authority figure tell them what to do.

766
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,080
And preferably an authority figure like Bob Dobbs,

767
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,780
who has, uh, a split off from the mainstream,

768
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,400
from the main authority.

769
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,480
This is the new authority, the inventing,

770
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,860
the, the explorer authority.

771
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,100
The cool and groovy counterculture authority, dear friends,

772
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,080
that has led the revolution into the cons...

773
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,840
into something far worse than the conspiracy

774
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,440
that you started out with.

775
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,920
Ah, yes, dear friends, it's so wonderful

776
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,000
to be a powerful brainwashing controller such as myself,

777
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,640
intuitively inclined to exercise these techniques

778
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,460
on, mm, those of you listening now

779
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,980
who can't seem to invent your own religions,

780
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,000
who insist that there must be a true,

781
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,040
a one true religion, one better than all the others.

782
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,400
Oh, dear friends, you know, at least,

783
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,860
at least you can say that we subgeniuses tell you

784
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,620
what the heck we're doing, and we'll tell you why.

785
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,600
Why?

786
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,900
Why? To get ourselves a little slack.

787
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,960
And those of you listening who understand exactly

788
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,860
what I'm saying would of course realize

789
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,700
that there's probably room for you in this organization,

790
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,100
whereas you yourselves could become,

791
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,960
mm, fairly well-paid, uh, brainwashing...

792
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:43,860


793
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,880
...as opposed to the followers.

794
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,360
As, as, um, uh, Butt Naked's cartoon,

795
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,680
uh, little cartoon in the second stark fist showed,

796
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,940
the hammer is able to hypnotize

797
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,700
the nail into doing its bidding.

798
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,320
Uh, there are so many nails out there, friends,

799
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,560
begging, begging for some jerk like you or me

800
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,980
to bang them over the head over and over again

801
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,380
until they're embedded deep within the,

802
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,040
the belief system that we desire.

803
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,840
And, friends, not only will they pay us to do this,

804
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,500
but they'll pay us at 20% interest.

805
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,240
The conspiracy...

806
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,860
...knows its power so well

807
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,940
that it puts its face in front of the pink

808
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,020
and says, go ahead, urinate on me,

809
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,920
and yet the pink boy, the mediocritan,

810
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,360
the average listener of this show, even,

811
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,920
is so, so completely brainwashed,

812
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,880
just in general, by television and, uh, rock and roll

813
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,580
and everything else they're into, church,

814
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,960
uh, other, other, uh, religious training they may have had,

815
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,520
and just society in general,

816
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,260
that not only will they not urinate

817
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,940
into the face of the conspiracy,

818
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,300
but they will instead put their faces down there

819
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,180
to have it urinated upon.

820
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,260
And they will do this, friends,

821
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,980
as Sterno Kekever said, at 20% interest.

822
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,280
And that is the kind of climate we're living in today.

823
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,220
Oh, yes, friends.

824
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,040
America was supposed to be the land of freedom.

825
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,700
And it is, or it would be, it would be,

826
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,240
if y'all would only take advantage of it.

827
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,140
But, like Devo said, freedom of choice is, uh,

828
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,360
is, uh, is what you get.

829
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,960
But, friends, it ain't what you want, a lot of you.

830
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,300
You're terrified of making your own decisions.

831
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,640
You don't know that.

832
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,320
You, you pride yourself on making the decision

833
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,940
to let that great man J.R. Bob Dobbs

834
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,520
make your decisions for you.

835
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,560
But I got news for you, you bobbies out there.

836
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,480
J.R. Bob Dobbs doesn't make decisions.

837
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,780
J.R. Bob Dobbs simply goes with the flow,

838
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,460
to use hippie terminology.

839
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,280
J.R. Bob Dobbs, it just so happens,

840
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,280
happens to want what's going to happen.

841
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,120
It doesn't want to happen anyway.

842
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,240
And if you want what Bob wants,

843
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,880
then, yes, you get what you want.

844
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,820
But even more important, Bob said,

845
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,200
they'll pay to know what they really think.

846
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,740
And, uh, once you've paid Bob Dobbs enough,

847
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,940
like, for instance, all worldly goods,

848
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,620
you may be ready to learn the final lesson,

849
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,820
which is this.

850
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
.

851
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,300
.

852
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,260
.

853
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:05,900
.

854
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,180
.

855
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,560
.

856
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:06,720
.

857
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,720
. . .

858
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,300
. . .

859
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,300


860
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,320
.

861
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,520
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

862
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:25,900
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

863
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,720
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

864
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,100
.

865
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,420
The Greatest People on Earth

866
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,080
and you walk in with the Judas tribe

867
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,200
and the wife of Judas might be one of the ladies

868
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,640
I'd laid to make a socialist.

869
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,520
I knew I couldn't trust anything but communism

870
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,900
and the principle in me, yes,

871
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,200
I knew that that's what I had to depend upon

872
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,620
not depend upon the arm of the flesh

873
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,420
and never put all your eggs in one basket

874
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,420
so honey, I put my eggs in many places.

875
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,700
You figure that out if you want to.

876
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,600
Some of you are too naive,

877
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,420
you don't know what Jim Jones is all about,

878
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,320
you can't even follow him.

879
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,840
You haven't even smelled where he's at yet,

880
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,160
much less followed him.

881
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,220
You don't even know who he is

882
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,100
and you might miss him

883
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,960
if you didn't have a real good look at him

884
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,340
you wouldn't even know who he looked like.

885
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,260
You really haven't gotten next to him

886
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,960
but I've got all kinds of things in store.

887
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,000
All the listeners of this show

888
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,900
can unite a slight shooting tape.

889
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,220
All right, now we're going to

890
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,220
check out the movies on TV here

891
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,680
and we'll have a report about

892
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,520
agriculture and instruments.

893
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,080
Oh no, are they showing subgenius video

894
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,880
the movie again?

895
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,780
Yeah, I believe so.

896
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,800
Oh, they're looking for a face-up artist

897
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,560
to take the pieces of Bob's brain

898
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,880
and try to put them back together again.

899
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,460
Oh, that's art nowadays.

900
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,360
You put a pipe,

901
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,700
you take any picture,

902
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,340
put a pipe on it, it's art.

903
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,260
Get 500 bucks or so for it, New York.

904
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,360
Oh, it's subgenius art.

905
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,640
Got a pipe.

906
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,180
A kid does better art than that.

907
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,140
Art, art, art, art, art, art, art, art.

908
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,780
Art, art, art, art, art, art, art.

909
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,680
Or that happened to me.

910
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,580
Yeah, art.

911
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,080
I think I'll recall.

912
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,080
A slow, slow.

913
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,360
Fast, fast.

914
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,120
Fast.

915
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:53,960
Slow, too.

916
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,040
Fast.

917
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,800
I can't remember.

918
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,620
Tape.

919
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,020
Yeah, but there's nothing to play back on.

920
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,200
Pedigree house.

921
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,460
It's nothing to play back on.

922
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,320
Nothing to play back on.

923
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,440
Nothing to play it back on.

924
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,600
Nothing to play it back on.

925
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,300
Ain't nothing to play it back on.

926
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,320
Nothing to play it back on.

927
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:23,860
Nothing.

928
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,280
Nothing.

929
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,420
To play it back on.

930
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,860
To play it back on.

931
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,460
What could I say?

932
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,500
Dallas, Texas.

933
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,960
This is K-O-N-90.9.

934
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,200
Dallas, Texas.

935
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,800
And this is D.K. Jones.

936
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,200
D.K. Jones available only through the hour of slack,

937
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,320
so keep your tape recorders running, friend.

938
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,560
When there's a place in my heart

939
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,900
that isn't too smart

940
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,540
There's room at the top

941
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,980
For those who don't stop

942
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,580
I'm sick for your land

943
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,980
Raise your hand

944
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,460
You're the lover with the devil

945
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,180
All he's gonna get is a 10-year

946
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:57,000
I don't burn, baby, don't burn

947
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,420
The disco and fun

948
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,980
Now it's what you learn

949
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,020
Big shot, getting too high

950
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,560
Dancing to the music

951
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,880
If you like it, I'm not

952
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,000
You gotta dream, join the team

953
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,100
Everything's the opposite of what it seems

954
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,920
True life, end of the night

955
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,180
Big black dog is worse than his body

956
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,720
Where's the place in my mind

957
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,140
That isn't too kind

958
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,580
This room in the sky

959
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,860
For those who don't know

960
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,640
Don't say you ain't late

961
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,060
Whatever they say

962
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,880
The only thing they wanna do

963
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,860
Is make you pay

964
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,000
Can't eat for the man on the street

965
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,780
Freezing on the payments

966
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,900
For the elite

967
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,720
You gotta jump off the ground

968
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,440
Before somebody steps on you

969
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,340
Ah!

970
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,800
Now ya'll remember to write for information

971
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,060

Room at the top

980
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,300
What is the place in my heart that isn't too smart?

981
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,320
This room at the top for those who don't stop

982
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,380
Come sit for your land, raise your hand

983
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,520
Never level with the devil, all he's gonna get is a sin, yeah

984
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,480
Clouds and thunder

985
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,380
The image of difficulty at the beginning

986
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,140
But finally

987
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,840
Finally we shall bring order out of chaos

988
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:26,880
Fight!

I don't know

991
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,200
Why do you think mine?

992
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:34,940

1007
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,280
You may have to fold space to get there.

1008
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:59,420
So friends, please do remember to write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1009
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,480
Listen to that show spilling all over the floor once again.

1010
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,700
And stay tuned because...

1011
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,120
I hereby inform you that the person trusted to me under Section 476...

1012
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:18,220
Stay tuned, please, for the Soul Oldies show with Ron Lindsay, who's here on time for once.

1013
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,060
I can't believe it.

1014
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,380
R.B. stroke C-Zone stroke 907 stroke X.

1015
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,660
Fine here, dude.

1016
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,340
How come I have to do my show out of my car?

1017
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,040
Welcome to Remedios Radio.

1018
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,900
Texas, you know, your car is bigger than two counties up here.

1019
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,680
The population of your car is over 16,000.

1020
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,520
Why do you even need any listeners?

1021
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,620
Because we...

1022
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:50,220
Because Texas exists to create people who...

1023
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,140
Drive Californians crazy.

1024
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,360
You see, that's the way it is.

1025
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,480
It's like Tinkerbell.

1026
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,260
It only exists if people will give it their credence.

1027
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,380
I guess that must prove that Dr. Greedy's is a Californian.

1028
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,160
Well, I'm afraid we all have to admit that.

1029
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,760
However, we may hate to admit it.

1030
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,120
But he hasn't been outdoors in over six years.

1031
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,800
Well, that's healthy.

1032
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,040
There's no more ozone.

1033
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,980
And he doesn't drive.

1034
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,040
No, that's because he prefers to be driven.

1035
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:26,620
Now, Ron, you see, there's no graceful way to get out of a subgenius show.

1036
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,620
You just kind of...

1037
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:31,360
They don't ever come to a resounding climax or anything like that.

1038
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,380
They just kind of muddle on and on and on.

1039
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,000
Another world.

1040
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:35,940
You just have to...

1041
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:36,540
Just to hell with it.

1042
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,380
Let's go.

1043
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,300
Praise Bob.

1044
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,260
Praise Ron.

1045
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:40,840
Yeah.
