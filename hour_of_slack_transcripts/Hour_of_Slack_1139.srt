1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,540
We're friends? Yeah?

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,160
Yeah.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,480
Hey there! Open up! Come on out! We're friends!

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,220
Is that right?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,580
We welcome you!

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,700
We're friends? Yeah?

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,700
The subgenius power of swag!

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,060
Listen, you find compulsion nuts all over.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,000
Their senses could be quite different.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,240
They may, for instance, be able to smell more than one brain.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,860
Just think of that, folks.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,960
They're probably controlled by Bob.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:37,900
Okay.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,980
There's only speculation.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,100
Okay.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,620
Any news from abroad?

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,060
No!

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,200
Cuckoo, I wish I could put my arms around each and every one of them.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,340
And let them know that everything's going to be okay.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,420
Why don't you see?

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm not bizarre enough.

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,520
Who is?

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,220
Bob.

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,760
Is he the one?

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,920
He's got to be the one. Who else could it be?

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,660
I'm very disappointed.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,340
So am I.

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240
What's your business here, lady?

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm on my way to Jerusalem to be an actor. Excuse me.

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,200
Excuse me.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
If you feel you're healed.

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,800
If you feel you're healed.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,300
Dad, I was swimming in a rainbow with millions of babies.

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,640
And I was naked.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,440
And then all of a sudden I turned into a perfect smile.

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,280
Put a roof on this son of a bitch!

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,660
What's going down here?

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,980
Do not make us doubt and speculate.

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
Say to us why you are here.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,540
What is the message to these people?

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,980
What is the message to these people?

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Dungeons and Dragons.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,280
Dungeons and Drag-

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,460
Dungeons and Dragons.

45
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,380
Marijuana.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,080
Hello, I'm Green Green Green Green Ministry.

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,220
Rock and roll music.

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,040
Marijuana.

49
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,600
Dragons.

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
The New Age Movement.

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,940
And now we feel Dungeons and Dragons, Marijuana, and even the New Age Movement.

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,380
And now we attack society.

53
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,520
Wicked witches and demon clouds and it's been Bell Books.

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,980
Scooby Doo. What do you think?

55
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,740
And even the Zone of Eternal Evil.

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,440
Scooby Doo.

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,220
Fil-fil-fil.

58
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,720
He has now felt cartoons and children's toys.

59
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,980
And now he's a baby.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,600
And even TV.

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,860
Fil-fil.

62
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,820
What's going on?

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Do you feel me?

64
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,060
Tell me.

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,340
Tell me.

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,940
Do you feel a lot of children?

67
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,200
Oh yes.

68
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,020
Oh yes.

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,600
Thirty-one times a week.

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,280
Oh yes.

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Oh yes.

72
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,140
Oh yes.

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,620
Levitation, mind control, ass rejection.

74
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,720
Yes.

75
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,280
Yes.

76
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,580
Yes.

77
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,420
Oh yes.

78
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,020
Let's go into another Scooby Doo.

79
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,400
We're looking at a cult.

80
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,120
Fast.

81
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:50,920
No.

82
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,140
That's plastic.

83
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,780
Yes.

84
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,700
Very much so.

85
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,220
So.

86
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,820
Mm-hmm.

87
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,440
Mm-hmm.

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,480
Hmm.

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,480


90
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,480


91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,480


92
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,480


93
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,480
Oh.

94
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,840
Hello?

95
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,840
Happiness and greatness and truth and dessae-o.

96
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,400
Your restaurant torque went up 20 times today.

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,400


98
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,400


99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,400


100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,400


101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,400


102
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,940
I'll leave the很standard at the end.

103
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,300
Okay.

104
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,900
Enough was enough.

105
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,700
So we're gonna return to scientifically cool stuff.

106
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,920
It's not very attractive.

107
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,120
It's not very expensive.

108
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,560
I wrote it too.

109
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,560


110
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,560


111
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,560


112
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Let's go.

113
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:19,880
What are your feelings?

114
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,640
B veterinary drugs.

115
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:20,800
What was it again?

116
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,160
Mm-hmm, not too much.

117
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,740
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained. That's a real find.

118
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,180
Girl, my name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie,

119
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,060
because I like things that have only one thing instead of two things.

120
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,840
I am not worthy of this, but I thank you from the depths of my heart.

121
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,600
This is what Bob can do for you.

122
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,680
And now a word from Reverend Bleepo Abernathy and the Duke of Madness, Jerry Goodwin.

123
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,300
You've seen the crazy antics that drunk girls get into during Mardi Gras.

124
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,820
And when those co-ed spring breakers start partying.

125
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,500
Ho ho, get out of town!

126
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,960
But you've never seen girls get as crazy as this.

127
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,900
It's wilder than any Girls Gone Wild ever.

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
Now, Ramco Productions presents Girls Gone Feral.

129
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,040
Forget about those girls so drunk they'll do anything for booze.

130
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,220
Now, you'll see what happens when girls are so hungry,

131
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,420
they'll do anything for food!

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,060
Girls Gone Feral.

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,620
Wishing girls tearing apart animal carcasses with their bare teeth.

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Girls Gone Feral.

135
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Girls reverting to a primitive state of tribal hunter-gathering.

136
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,620
Girls Gone Feral.

137
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,980
Girls smeared with the blood of their enemies, vying for alpha superiority.

138
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,220
Girls Gone Feral.

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,940
Girls so hungry, they eat hunger.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
They eat hunger for breakfast.

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,760
Girls Gone Feral.

142
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,360
Girls Gone Feral is a special TV offer not available in the United States.

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Postage or telephone transmission.

144
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,440
Not for adults with children over or above the age of 18 to 21 years of age.

145
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
To order, see Murray or Vinnie under the bridge.

146
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,480
Cash only, please.

147
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,640
Girls Gone Feral.

148
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Girls Gone Feral.

149
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,580
Girls Gone Feral.

150
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:16,700
Girls Gone Feral.

151
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,340
Girls Gone Feral.

152
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,860
Girls Gone Feral.

153
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:26,620
Girls Gone Feral.

154
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,660
Girls Gone Feral.

155
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,000
Girls Gone Feral.

156
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,340
Girls Gone Feral.

157
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,480
Girls Gone Feral.

158
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,220
I was determined to stay out of them buffalo robes.

159
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,900
Three young and healthy women with no man for who knows how long.

160
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,860
Mmm.

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
The very idea kind of shrunk me like a spider on a hot stove.

162
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,640
Beware you men, where'er you go

163
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,500
The cherry tree must stand

164
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,880
The glory of your fatherhood

165
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,760
Is threatened near at hand

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
The maiden who is smiling

167
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,920
So is one to all your seed

168
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,360
And never was a maiden born

169
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,140
To never know your need

170
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,620
She'll wink her thoughts and let you know

171
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,520
The lust that's on her mind

172
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,400
And use the devil's thrust to show you

173
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,720
What you dream to find

174
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,700
Save your flower for tomorrow

175
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,240
Oh

176
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,040
You never know what's apt to go

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,660
Through a tender maiden's head

178
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,840
So save your flower for tomorrow

179
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,520
Many men have felt the ruin

180
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,100
Of the harlot's bed

181
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,840
As you can see, so few like me

182
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,540
Remain unspoiled and pure

183
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,900
By virtue of the power of God

184
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


185
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


186
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


187
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


188
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


189
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,820
And respect I am intact

190
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,640
Unsoiled by passion's lure

191
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,060
So when temptation calls to you

192
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,720
You must remember well

193
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,400
Adultery is the devil's tool

194
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,160
For bringing you to hell

195
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,980
When in the end

196
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,560
Desire's road has led you to its fork

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,220
It won't be hard

198
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,880
If you just let it go

199
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,120
You're on guard

200
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,800
And always salt your pork

201
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,940
Save your flower for tomorrow

202
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,260
You never know what's apt to go

203
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,660
Through a tender maiden's head

204
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,380
So save your flower for tomorrow

205
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,380


206
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,320
Ah!

207
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,740
Ah!

208
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,640
Ah!

209
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,740
Ah!

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,940
Ah!

211
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,400
Ah!

212
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,800
Ah!

213
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,140
Ah!

214
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,180
Ah!

215
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,200
Ah!

216
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,500
Ah!

217
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,500


218
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,500


219
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,720
Ah!

220
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,740
Lady, shall I lie on your lap?

221
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,360
No, my lord.

222
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,940
I mean my head upon your lap.

223
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,040
Aye, my lord.

224
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,420
Do you think I meant country matters?

225
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,280
I think nothing, my lord.

226
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,180
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

227
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,420
What is, my lord?

228
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:44,820
Nothing.

229
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,620
You are Mary, my lord.

230
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,020
Who, I?

231
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,640
Aye, my lord.

232
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,720
Oh, God, you're only jig maker.

233
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,100
Try what you're a man do, but be merry.

234
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,720
For look you, how merry live my mother looks,

235
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,500
and my father died within two hours.

236
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,500
Nay, it is twice two months, my lord.

237
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,460
So long.

238
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
This sluts.

239
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,460
Oh, you are a pig.

240
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,140
Pig.

241
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,680
Pig.

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,200
You're a...

243
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,060
You sluts.

244
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,940
You right-wing bimbo.

245
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
You sluts.

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,040
You're a sluts.

247
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,400
You'll come this old bitch.

248
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,700
Not because you are...

249
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,620
You still eating, mom?

250
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,060
Mom?

251
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,580
Stakes a man with a truly sick mind

252
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,600
to do something like this.

253
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,740
Something like this.

254
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,820
Oh, I lick you two boats.

255
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,160
I lick boats all over your body.

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,880
Oh, I lick you two boats.

257
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,900
I lick boats all over your body.

258
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
And I will have my way with you.

259
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,860
Bimbo.

260
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,840
Bimbo.

261
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,720
Powerful new physical energy.

262
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,120
Orgone.

263
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,700
Orgone.

264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,660
Now, now, mother, nothing was left.

265
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,940
Sexuality.

266
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,680
Neurosis.

267
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,660
Sexual instincts.

268
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,580
Libido.

269
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,500
Increase.

270
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,160
Decrease.

271
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,620
Displacement and discharge.

272
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,360
And which extends itself.

273
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,520
Sexual energy was more than just sexual energy.

274
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,640
The orgasm.

275
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,340
Equilibrium.

276
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,080
Builds up.

277
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,580
Builds up.

278
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,080
Builds up.

279
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,620
Builds up.

280
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,060
Builds up.

281
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,780
Stagnating.

282
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,420
Reich's orgasm flow and discharge.

283
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,840
You have to revamp your whole way of thinking.

284
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,500
Don't think.

285
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't think.

286
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,260
Turbulent political climate.

287
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,880
Pleasure.

288
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,360
Pleasure.

289
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,080
Pleasure.

290
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,740
Pleasure.

291
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,340
Phenomenon.

292
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,140
Phenomenon.

293
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,720
Look.

294
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,500


295
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
The rat- Tay sin.

296
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
And you have to intentional

297
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,080


298
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Fleece up.

299
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,200


300
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,880
Gaze.

301
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,500
All the time.

302
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,260
Sleep.

303
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,260


304
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,260


305
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,260


306
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,260


307
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,380
Sleep.

308
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:50,760
The only trouble with snake women is they copulate with horses, which makes them strange to me.

309
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,060
She says she doesn't, that's why I call her, doesn't like horses.

310
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,120
But of course, she's lying.

311
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,760
Seaweed head, tomorrow night I'm going to get me a horse and ride up to Four Corners to see Red Snapper.

312
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,740
I know she's waiting for me because ten minutes ago she sent me the finest smoke signal I've ever seen.

313
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,360
She said, Vernon, you are the only man who ever made my bell ring.

314
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,880
All my love, Red Snapper.

315
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,320
P.S. Ugly old honey hole says hello.

316
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,300
Take a card, Mr. Greaser.

317
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,400
All right, put it back anywhere.

318
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,860
This is.

319
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
This one.

320
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,040
That one.

321
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
This one.

322
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,420
That one.

323
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,980
That one.

324
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,720
This one.

325
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:54,720


326
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
This one.

327
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,580
This it?

328
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,280
Oh, no, no, no, no, that's not it.

329
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,640
That it?

330
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,140
This one.

331
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,900
Close.

332
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,340
Here it comes.

333
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,760
Oh.

334
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,560
No cigar.

335
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,440
This one.

336
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,100
Oh.

337
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,400
That one.

338
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:15,840
Oh.

339
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,400
This one.

340
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,080
Uh-uh.

341
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,420
No.

342
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,500
No, no, no.

343
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,040
Oh, friends.

344
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,980
Oh, friends.

345
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:32,160
Hey, welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,139.

346
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,940
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

347
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:42,120
And this is some of Reverend Angry Larry's strange music in the background from his, what's it called?

348
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,880
Automatic Robot Fish, The Running Gods.

349
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,680
Speaking of Reverend Angry Larry and the great band, The Amino Acids, they are going to be out and about touring.

350
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,940
And you might look at TheAminoAcids.com or MySpace, The Amino Acids.

351
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
They're going to be in San Francisco and Oakland.

352
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,240
And what, next weekend?

353
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,540
Yes, next weekend.

354
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
And we may fly out there just to see it.

355
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:22,920
Well, in the meantime, friends, we're here to warm you up because it's cold, cold, cold outside here in Cleveland, Ohio,

356
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,580
which is not where you necessarily are, nor even at this time.

357
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,840
But I assure you, it is cold.

358
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,920
And getting to the station showed how dedicated we are.

359
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,360
We are to the Hour of Slack.

360
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,700
Dave is on his way.

361
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
He's still broken.

362
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:47,720
And if anybody wants to help, you know what to do at subgenius.com on the Hour of Slack page.

363
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,300
But it's like one degree Fahrenheit.

364
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,060
And 25 below with wind chill.

365
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:03,640
Which means beauty and danger on the road with snakes of blowing snow.

366
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,140
Waving in front of you when you can see.

367
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,740
And, you know, friends, it's so good to be able to drive.

368
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:26,320
I want you all to know that I appreciate the gifts that I was given that allow me to do a thing like drive.

369
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,240
Me too.

370
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,260
Because, you know, there's people who can't even pass a driver's test.

371
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,080
Talk about subgenius.

372
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,800
Anyway, yes.

373
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,940
And on the way here, we saw snow devils.

374
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,460
Like dust devils that you see in the desert.

375
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,380
Miniature tornadoes of snow.

376
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,100
They're beautiful.

377
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,120
Very otherplanetary.

378
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:54,360
You know, the little baby robots on Mars, the shuttle creatures that go around and take pictures of Mars,

379
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,880
have captured pictures of dust devils that I suspect, well, that's what they call them.

380
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,440
If you ask me, those are the Martians.

381
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,920
That's exactly the way Ray Bradbury.

382
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,820
Ray Bradbury described them.

383
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:15,340
But it's, yes, it's a strange, strange drive in the deep dead of winter in Cleveland.

384
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,740
It's so, the snow is like fog or like a sandstorm.

385
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,580
Wispy, ethereal things slipping across the road in front of you.

386
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,360
Yeah, so it's like Burning Man or only a snowing man.

387
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,680
It's almost like fog.

388
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,420
But it's snow, just this fine mist of snow all through the air.

389
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,060
Now, speaking of snow and winter and the stars of winter,

390
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,860
there is an event coming up, which I guess we could tell you about,

391
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,200
because some of you might really be interested.

392
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,500
Winter Star.

393
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,080
Princess, you have all the information over there.

394
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,640
I have all the information.

395
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I don't know when it is.

396
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,180
Well, it's at the end of, it's a leap star this year.

397
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,920
It goes from February.

398
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:04,920


399
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:04,920


400
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,560
February 28th to March 2nd.

401
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,220
And there's going to be lots of interesting people there from Steve and Ina May Gaskin,

402
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:22,380
those famous folks from The Farm and Midwife, amazing midwifery books and work.

403
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Yeah, if you want a good whiff, check out Ina May Gaskin.

404
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,440
Now, now.

405
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,040
For midwifery.

406
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,720
And there will be Voodoo Priestess, Priestess Miriam.

407
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,760
Chamani from New Orleans area.

408
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,320
It's a healing winter star.

409
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,200
Yes, yes.

410
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,660
And so they're going to heal the Katrinas and the Kachina dolls.

411
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,800
And we'll be there healing and sickening.

412
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
We'll be explaining the difference between healing and sickening.

413
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,820
Yes, yes.

414
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,080
And she will be bringing several other people with her from that area, drummers.

415
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:10,160
And it's something Chaz, the late Chaz Smith used to always run the Space Jam Cabin.

416
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,100
And this year we're going to have to do the Space Jam Cabin without Chaz.

417
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,400
However, we will have Ron Slabe and Sadie LeMarin, who used to be on this station here.

418
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:26,040
And I will bring the Cyclodelico video mind control things that I always do.

419
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,160
And so that's an exciting party somewhere in Ohio.

420
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,060
Yeah.

421
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:40,380
You'd have to look for information at Rosencomet.com or just go to Subgenius.com,

422
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,400
which is slightly easier to spell for subgeniuses.

423
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,240
And look at the events button, which is like the second word at the top of the page.

424
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,540
You'd be amazed how much trouble subgeniuses have trying to get through to something.

425
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,060
Like, for instance, they'll go, well, how do I get to our Slack on Subgenius.com?

426
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,020
To download the archives of the shows going back 25 years.

427
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,900
And I have to go, well, it's that third word that you come to on the front page, radio.

428
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,240
Now, friends, speaking of radio, this is where and when I should give credits for what we've been playing.

429
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,720
Only one person in Cleveland will recognize the Greaser's Palace songs.

430
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,140
That's Dr. Mr. Sister.

431
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,100
Would remember them from recently.

432
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:39,880
It's Greaser's Palace is a 1972 underground movie that truly captured the spirit of the stoner age,

433
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,740
even though it was a Western.

434
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,880
Well, it's the story of the New Testament set in Western times.

435
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,300
It sort of begins with Jesus parachuting into the Old West with wagon trains going by.

436
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
He's wearing a zoot suit.

437
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,760
And a lot of the lines, the bizarre and not bizarre.

438
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,360
Enough lines that I was playing earlier in the show were from Robert Downey Sr.'s movie, Greaser's Palace,

439
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,760
which you probably can't rent and will never find.

440
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,760
Only subgeniuses know how to get copies of stuff like that.

441
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,380
And, of course, we've also played several collages by the great Reverend Norell Preff.

442
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:29,780
And you can get his collages and also his music from HeavyConfetti.com.

443
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,520
Or.

444
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,340
Norellpreff.com.

445
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,680
We heard Laurence Olivier as Hamlet.

446
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,260
We heard quite a bit of Fernanda Nandi of Lemuria,

447
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,280
who lives even deeper in the snow and higher in the mountains than any of us.

448
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,760
I'll tell you for the first time, friends on the air,

449
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,940
that Fernanda Nandi Lemur, who does so much great editing on the show,

450
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,600
lives in Idaho Springs.

451
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
Now, let's see what happens.

452
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,020
Really?

453
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,680
I believe Fernanda Nandi of Lemuria.

454
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,600
Push this button.

455
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,680
Lives in the cold.

456
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,280
Push hold.

457
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,460
And then push speaker and air and turn this on.

458
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,980
What happens?

459
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,960
Torture is what happens.

460
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,220
Hey, it worked.

461
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,020
Wow.

462
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,600
Did I tell you that torture is what works in all circumstances?

463
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,860
I was reading that in a horror novel the other day about Vietnam.

464
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,880
Never mind your amusements on the side.

465
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,780
674-3295-90.

466
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,700
I have received the message and will comply.

467
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,480
All right.

468
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Hey, what?

469
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,180
Oh, man, I feel dizzy.

470
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,480
What just happened?

471
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,480
The same voice.

472
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,620
We can't tell you.

473
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,900
I just, I feel weird.

474
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,160
They say it's a disconnected phone voice from the beyond

475
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,360
that taps in every once in a while in connection to people's brains directly.

476
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,720
Hal needs a gal.

477
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,440
Hal needs a gal.

478
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
Hal had a gal.

479
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
You're deprogrammed now, Dave,

480
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
and you'll see things as they go.

481
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,620
They really are.

482
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,460
You'll finally see how hot the plumpers are, baby.

483
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,620
You'll see the rats licking at your feet.

484
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,380
You'll know they're just giving you a little manicure.

485
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,620
Pedicure, yes.

486
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,100
Now, we've been playing romantic, romantical type sexy cuts,

487
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,780
and you told me earlier today that you had, you scored.

488
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,240
Yeah, Winsome bulled out a girl, Davina.

489
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,060
I did.

490
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,120
I think I met her.

491
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,560
And I'm not sure if I met her or not.

492
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,740
I think we actually cannabulated our confunctions and stuff.

493
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,860
Wait a minute.

494
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,960
You think you met her?

495
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, it could have just been another disturbance in bed.

496
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,320
But I was told that the creature, the person, the entity didn't exist.

497
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,020
But I'm still occasionally tortured once in a while.

498
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,420
She humps my leg.

499
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm just saying.

500
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,300
Hey, look, man, if she exists for you, then that's all that really counts.

501
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,620
Right.

502
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,100
And, you know, I could never, you know, literally prove it anyway that such a person exists.

503
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,800
Oh, no.

504
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,280
Oh, wait a minute.

505
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,880
Oh, Christ.

506
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,520
Here she is.

507
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,620
That's her?

508
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,780
You don't hear her, do you?

509
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,760
Yeah, I do.

510
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,000
I hear her like a...

511
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,860
She's on my leg.

512
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,320
She's kind of bright purple.

513
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,440
And got like little yellow fronds of hair sticking out.

514
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,040
Your girlfriend is purple?

515
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,060
Please, please.

516
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,160
Is she colored?

517
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,680
Do you mean?

518
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,580
Is she human?

519
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,500
Is she humping your leg?

520
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,640
How is she?

521
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:37,920
How?

522
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,220
What?

523
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,180
She must not be very tall.

524
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
She's only 45 centimeters long.

525
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,800
I had to hold up a copy of the Bob Leografon to keep her down just like a sacred sacrament or something.

526
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,040
She's got to be.

527
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,040
That's the only way I can keep her at bay.

528
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,060
At dockers or whatever they call it.

529
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
That's the only way I can keep her off me.

530
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:53,920
Man.

531
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,580
I'm sorry you couldn't make it bring her over to the show tonight.

532
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,060
Wow.

533
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,400
Geez, you wouldn't have wanted that to happen right in the middle of the show,

534
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
especially since it didn't really happen.

535
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,920
She got plasma all over.

536
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,380
Well, you did.

537
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,480
You're not imagining things, Dave.

538
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,300
I heard her.

539
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,920
You heard it?

540
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,340
Yes.

541
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,260
Absolutely, I heard her.

542
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,920
We've just been discussing it.

543
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,580
You could like...

544
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,480
It or her, I mean.

545
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,100
Like on a future show, you could probably prove it was true by replaying it or something?

546
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,440
She's not a Fig Newton of your imagination whatsoever.

547
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,540
Let me put it this way, Dave.

548
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,900
If we play this CD back and don't hear it, I'm going to be freaked out.

549
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,360
No kidding.

550
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,780
Me too.

551
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,020
Because I definitely heard it.

552
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,360
I heard her again just then.

553
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,900
I just heard it again.

554
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,240
So this plasma on my leg is real.

555
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,740
I mean, it's not just...

556
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,700
The what on your leg?

557
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,100
She leaves plasma like this fluid, this viscous fluid all over my legs.

558
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,300
There she leaks.

559
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,660
When she humps my leg.

560
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,700
The dog gets jealous.

561
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,680
The cats run.

562
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,940
Man.

563
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,060
You know, as Pope David Meyer once said, probably with good reason,

564
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,760
some life forms have ironic sex lives.

565
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,700
It's called irony?

566
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,580
Yeah.

567
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,820
I may have used that line in the last couple of weeks on the radio.

568
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,040
I'm starting to worry about that.

569
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,820
My dad tells me the same joke every time I talk to him.

570
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,760
Although, aside from that, he still sounds smarter than anyone else in the world.

571
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,920
But I've been listening back to tapes, you know, like when I call Rob's show.

572
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,100
I've told him the exact same thing two shows in a row.

573
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,260
And I think I'm about to do it again.

574
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,580
But your father is an octogenarian, dear, and you're only about a syncogenarian.

575
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,140
Yeah.

576
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,480
An octogenarian sex is really ironic, wouldn't you say?

577
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
I mean, you said, did you say sex was ironic?

578
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,340
Well, for some life forms.

579
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,180
Oh.

580
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
You know, for the sea slug, for instance, they all are born with a penis,

581
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,340
and one has to bite the penis off the other one.

582
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,360
Now, see, I've already said that on the radio, haven't I?

583
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,340
Didn't I already do this routine?

584
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,000
Am I doomed to a deja vu feeling forever,

585
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,240
or is it that I'm just doomed to repeat the same gag,

586
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,540
over and over again?

587
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

588
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,900
Stang, we, it's, it's not the irony of the situation.

589
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,780
It's the fact that you've taken the weight of the world off your shoulders

590
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,420
and put it on your backside.

591
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,900
That's the first part of it.

592
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,580
And the second part is, um, I forgot what the second part was,

593
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,820
but it was, oh yeah, if instead of using those words that you just words to describe that,

594
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,640
say, um, erectile cartilage,

595
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,280
and that'll just completely, clearly,

596
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,700
clear the slate.

597
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,260
Uh-huh.

598
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,380
Magic.

599
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,620
Just like magic.

600
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,840
Like whales have enormous erectile cartilages.

601
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,920
It's, it's called a...

602
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,540
I'm trying to remember the word, too, um,

603
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,940
because my dad has a collection of those penile cartilages.

604
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,320
He does not.

605
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,960
Yes, he does.

606
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,660
Yes, he does.

607
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,700
That's not a lie.

608
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:56,000
Whales and walra-, walruses have such large bones or bone-like cartilages in their peni

609
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,580
that, uh, the natives up in that part of the world,

610
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,300
the Inuits and Eskimos and so forth,

611
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,360
use those as weapons,

612
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,720
or, as in the case of my dad,

613
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,880
they carve scrimshaw on the penis bone and sell it to lawyers from Texas.

614
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,060
And no, in a way...

615
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:22,900
And also bears have a bone large enough to use as a Texan's swizzle stick at his bar.

616
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,220
Uh, Princess Wee laughs because she knows it's true.

617
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,660
She is, sir. I've seen it.

618
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:35,100
And because my, my dad used to show those bones off every single time we came over.

619
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,600
Yes, he did.

620
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,680
See, now, when I used to go to my grandpa's house,

621
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,260
he used to show off his private parts,

622
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,220
and he got in trouble with the neighborhood police and the local authorities and stuff

623
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,000
because he would actually go out in the yard and start yelling at people and say,

624
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,280
look at this, look at this.

625
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,280
So it's not just you. It's your whole family.

626
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,240
The whole family, yeah.

627
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,240
You guys have always, you were raised that way.

628
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah. We're all plasma-laden, uh,

629
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,620
over-filtered, too big, too small, too everything, you know.

630
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,380
That means you can do anything you want.

631
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,640
Well, genetically, perhaps.

632
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,400
But you gotta think of the social situation here.

633
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,460
You know, we're, this is an armed camp.

634
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,900
Well, no, that's what I'm saying.

635
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,880
Because it's a disease, that means you can do it, it's not your fault,

636
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,200
you know, people shouldn't put you down or in jail for doing it because it's not your fault.

637
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,520
No.

638
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,900
You can't help it. You were born that way. It's a syndrome.

639
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,620
Ha ha ha.

640
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,200
Ha ha ha.

641
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,560
It was that way for a long time until, um, you know, what's-his-name got in control there,

642
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,580
the new president, the old, new, the guy that's been in here for a while.

643
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,580
Well, and also they ran out of money for, for straight jackets and rubber rooms.

644
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,380
Yeah.

645
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,120
And so now they just use 7-Eleven, or liquor store parking lots, I believe,

646
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,800
are what have replaced rubber rooms.

647
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,200
And also the big warehouse.

648
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,800
And psychologists.

649
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,740
Yeah.

650
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,500
Yeah, psychiatrists have been replaced by liquor.

651
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,520
Ha ha.

652
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,780
And the little kiosks with the, with the, uh, Jesus.

653
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,980
Now, what does Dr. Dobson have to do with Bob Dobbs?

654
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,360
I, you know, there's some whispering going on.

655
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Dr. Dobson, the family, the Christian family, uh, expert?

656
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,580
There's some whisperings that they're, uh, genetically impaired and in bed.

657
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,540
Dobbs' son.

658
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,160
That, you know, he...

659
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,400
The rebellious son. You know how preachers' kids are always the ones that are the biggest gang criminals?

660
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,500
Well, uh, in the case of J.R. Bob Dobbs, his son...

661
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,500


662
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,760
...is the most holiest, pious, conservative, uh, family values.

663
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,800
Not that Bob Dobbs himself, uh, J.R. Bob Dobbs is not against family values.

664
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,600
He's up against every family he can get his hands on.

665
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,140
Yeah.

666
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,720
Young, old...

667
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,500
Familiarity.

668
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,720
He don't care.

669
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,500
He loves...

670
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,920
He loves older gals, too.

671
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,560
And I mean really older gals.

672
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,980
Family jewels that are really, really hard and calcified.

673
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,740
Give him an inch of wiggle room and he'll be wiggling for hours and days.

674
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,700
You know, I'm still looking for my family jewels, which theoretically, I can't prove this, but, uh, in...

675
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,560
...uh, supposed to be the Russian crown jewels.

676
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,680
The stuff that was stolen from the Romanovs during the Russian Revolution.

677
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,040
That stuff all really belongs to me, since I'm the last surviving...

678
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,060
...uh, I'm not really Romanov, but, uh, Rasputin.

679
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,280
Well, yeah, Rasputin...

680
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,700
My great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother was the Tsarina.

681
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,960
Yeah, the illegitimate child of, uh, the Tsarina and Rasputin, right?

682
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,140
No, I'm not like some kook who's running around going, like, saying, I'm Anastasia.

683
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,640
You know, I'm the last of the heir to the Russian throne.

684
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,460
No, no, no.

685
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,360
It's so unfair.

686
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,800
Yeah, I'm not saying that.

687
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm saying I'm the illegitimate heir to the Russian throne by way of the great...the mad

688
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,940
monk Rasputin.

689
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,860
Well...

690
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,480
Gregor Rasputin.

691
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,260
Gregor?

692
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,160
Gregor.

693
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,560
Gregor.

694
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
Boy, they tried real hard to get him, didn't they?

695
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,220
They drowned him, they stabbed him, they sent him, they put him in the attic for three

696
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,520
days without, uh, tubs, and they left him, uh, to his own alacrity.

697
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,740
And they chopped off his wee-wee.

698
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,620
They did?

699
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,020
Yes, they did, and it's in a museum in Russia.

700
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,820
Well, that's the perversity of all these societies and stuff.

701
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,660
Looks like an old...a really old banana skin.

702
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,420
That's not a lie.

703
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,240
They're parts of Rasputin.

704
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,960
Rasputin still, uh, exists.

705
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,960
In fact, one of the guys who helped kill him only died about 20 years ago.

706
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,020
So you could still interview the dude about, you know, what was it really like?

707
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,460
He was one of the noblemen.

708
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,080
The noble...the noble class in Russia knew that Rasputin was having an unhealthy influence

709
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:52,980
on the royal family because he alone was perceived by the, uh, by the Tsarina as being the only

710
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,140
person who could cure their son's hemophilia, which was not well understood in those days.

711
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,880
Yeah, they used to try and bleed you to cure your hemophilia.

712
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,320
Yeah.

713
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,940
Oh my God.

714
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,680
Right.

715
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:02,740
Right.

716
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,140
They...yeah.

717
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:10,120
And, um, Rasputin had such, uh, mental...mentalist powers that he was able to calm the boy down

718
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,580
enough that in...his bleeding would stop.

719
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,400
Or so they say.

720
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,920
Anyway, the kid survived.

721
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,500
However, uh, there were bad...you know, Rasputin was a hippie.

722
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,380
He...he was, uh...he was a...kind of like the Stang of the royal court.

723
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:32,200
He had all these...girl...he was smelly, disgusting, horrible, talk-crazy, and so, of course, all

724
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,740
the married rich ladies had to have him.

725
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,300
Had to go to bed with him.

726
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,580
Well, it was the psychic powers that enamored most of them.

727
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,980
The idea, you know, the weird...the Rasputin eye.

728
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,480
He had the guru genie eye.

729
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,420
He could look at, you know, a woman and...and, uh, they would come hither and yonder.

730
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,080
How do you think I got here?

731
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,480
I don't know how you got here.

732
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,060
With these eyebrows and this beard.

733
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,920
They'd come hither and do more than yawn.

734
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:54,900
Oh.

735
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,860
Well, don't wanna...

736
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,400
Never heard that before.

737
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,380
...go into that part.

738
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,400
It's cause I just made it up.

739
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,500
I don't know, those Romanovs really...they really slay me, man.

740
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,100
They were so powerful and all they left behind was noodles and...and shrimp, you know?

741
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,820
Yeah, that is.

742
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,400
That's amazing.

743
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,740
That's...that's all they're known for now.

744
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,200
Right.

745
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,060
The...the skull or parts of the skull of the...of the family.

746
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,480
The skull.

747
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,940
The skull parts were dug up a few years ago.

748
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,900
I'm a big fan of Russian history.

749
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,840
That's why I know all these super facts.

750
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,120
Oh, I...I am too.

751
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,660
I...I remember the October Revolution quite well.

752
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,080
I was...

753
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,380
Oh, you...you're such a commie.

754
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,400
You probably wrote half of their marching songs.

755
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,200
No, it's marching...well, they said I marched to their songs.

756
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,880
I thought it was the silliest thing I ever heard.

757
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,220
You get your marching orders from Moscow.

758
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,980
And I thought they were talking about Idaho at first.

759
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,340
And I'd seen the movie too, you know?

760
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,880
And it just still didn't make any sense to me until they did point out the...the majorette uniform.

761
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,740
Which I didn't even know was real.

762
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,540
Like the plasma, I just assumed it was a figment.

763
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
Well, I know what you mean.

764
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,520
And it's often safe...safest to assume that you're just imagining things.

765
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,800
Like if you're at a job interview, for instance, and there's a thing humping your leg, you don't want to go,

766
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh, excuse me, I always have this sort of ghostly thing humping my leg.

767
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,100
But don't worry, when I'm at work...

768
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,000
It won't be there.

769
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,100
That doesn't usually go over.

770
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:30,920
But, you know, if you're not in a situation like that, you might be missing something if you're assuming it's just another hallucination.

771
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,400
Yeah, I guess that's true.

772
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,080
Like in this case, you have this hot new girlfriend.

773
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,460
You were about to ignore her, except that we validated your hallucination.

774
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,280
Well, that's what I've been going for.

775
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,080
You know, I was hoping that it wasn't just, you know, another problem emerging in the way of...

776
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,080


777
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,100
Problem?

778
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,140
Problem?

779
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:02,880
I've never had any problems ever since I did the right thing with J.R. Bob Dobbs and became an ordained minister.

780
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,680
I've never had any sort of a problem.

781
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:13,660
In fact, it's like my life has been an endless wallowing in a pigsty of pure slack.

782
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,260
And now, for a limited time only,

783
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,220
videos of returnings,

784
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,300
limited time-only imaginings,

785
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,020
and actual replaced memories of Bob's demagulation,

786
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,040
watch him fry in front of the television set as he goes,

787
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,220
ow-ow-ow-ow.

788
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,660
Oh, those were such wonderful times.

789
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,120
The slaves used to sing. They weren't actually earthly slaves.

790
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
They were kind of like...

791
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,840
Boldovina, Boldotto, Div...

792
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,220
Progressively...

793
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,620
Ledger's...

794
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,640
Big Dink.

795
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,320
And the other format, I guess, was in there, too.

796
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,720
Well, I guess in a way, I have...

797
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,920
My computer is sort of like a popular bull...

798
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,180
Bullgirl Daveena is to you.

799
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,220
You said your computer was Christ-like.

800
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,420
And that you refused...

801
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:06,820
It saves.

802
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,180
It saves?

803
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,420
Yes, we have a saying.

804
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,300
If you don't hit save, you'll lose it.

805
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,820
We got that from the old saying,

806
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,300
if you don't hit Dave, he'll lose it.

807
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,100
Remember?

808
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,620
Yeah.

809
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,380
How we used to hit you to get you back on track.

810
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,340
Oh, boy, that was fun.

811
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,800
Those were the days.

812
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,860
I could actually feel something in my legs then.

813
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,040
That was the problem.

814
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,720
When you were in that kind of a daze,

815
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,580
we had to kind of slap you out of it.

816
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,340
You've gotten a lot better, I must say, and congratulations.

817
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,400
Yes, Dave.

818
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,820
Yeah, well, thanks to the cauliflower ears,

819
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,640
that's actually helped pick up girls.

820
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,620
But outside of that, I would say, you know, it's been a good thing.

821
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,800
I know a subgenius who has a cauliflower ear,

822
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,040
but I don't think it's a good thing.

823
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,120
I think it's a good thing because it's a part of your neck.

824
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,000
Well, no, I think that's not a,

825
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,040
it's part of the cerebellum has actually slipped down

826
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,200
and is protruding out of the neck area,

827
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,680
and it's got like little convolutions on them.

828
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,840
The convolutions, yeah.

829
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,520
All I know is it's gross.

830
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,260
Huh?

831
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,040
If that's brains hanging out the back of the guy's heads,

832
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,500
he's got too much and it's gross.

833
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,160
So he has just like a ruffled neck?

834
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,640
This guy looks like he's got cauliflowers all over his neck.

835
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,120
Man.

836
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,620
I do know who I'm talking about.

837
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,720
I do know who you're talking about.

838
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,180
Okay, let's just leave it alone.

839
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,260
You're talking about me again, right?

840
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:19,620
No.

841
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,020
No.

842
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,420
Let's just leave that alone.

843
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,760
Poor guy.

844
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,020
And be nice.

845
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,380
Let's be nice, everybody.

846
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,960
But we don't even know who we're being nice to or not.

847
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,220
I always thought that was a symptom of yaws,

848
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,020
which was once a deadly disease and now is a kind of a,

849
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,200
produces a yawn.

850
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,520
And, you know, people go off that yawn.

851
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,400
As in hither and yawg?

852
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,600
Well, you know, go to the doctor.

853
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,220
You know, call 911.

854
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,580
Are you talking dirty again?

855
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,160
Dave, I was telling you to go to the doctor and call 911.

856
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,780
Okay.

857
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,580
I thought when you...

858
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,680
And you didn't do it, did you?

859
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,460
Instead, you called the station.

860
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,300
No, I called Homeland Security and they referred me to this number.

861
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,140
Really?

862
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,640
Yeah.

863
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,140
They're still doing that.

864
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,580
I put 911.

865
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,120
Oh, my God.

866
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,820
I told them to use my toll-free number and not the station's number.

867
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,460
Unbelievable.

868
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,620
There is a subgenius toll-free number.

869
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,180
And I guess in a couple of shows, I'll play a nice collection of recordings from that number.

870
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,200
I have done that in the past.

871
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,080
And, you know, you can imagine running.

872
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,860
Running an organization, a disorganization, disorganized religion like Church of the Subgenius,

873
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,140
and with a toll-free answer machine, we get some calls.

874
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,160
You harvest some wild ones.

875
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,720
I haven't played those in a while.

876
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,460
And I've got a nice collection of new ones.

877
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:38,120
There's this one guy who's always calling me up wanting to talk about, you know, get it coming on the show or something.

878
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,660
He has a different name and voice every time.

879
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,120
I never can understand them.

880
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,800
So you're saying an actual telephone number has a personality?

881
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,140
Not only that, it's a naughty personality.

882
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,020
Wow.

883
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,340
It's 888.

884
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,800
That's the number of Jesus.

885
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,120
888-6969.

886
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,400
2323.

887
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,340
And that's a magic number of Robert Anton Wilson and the Discordians.

888
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,220
What's the secret number?

889
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,620
The only reason we used that was we couldn't get 273, which is the magic number of subgenius.

890
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,540
And it's obviously a lot more special than 23.

891
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,600
A lot.

892
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,660
Because 23 comes up every 23 numbers.

893
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,560
But 273 is a lot harder to come by.

894
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,460
Ask St. Byron Warner.

895
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,920
That's been his sexual fetish for a long time, and it's never completely worked out.

896
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,760
So you're saying that he's been having encumbrances or...

897
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,820
You've heard of number...

898
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,600
...relational overtures with a number.

899
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,140
Right.

900
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,440
And he's actually doing it with a demon.

901
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,780
Apparently.

902
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,500
Is that what you think?

903
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,520
Your new girlfriend is a demon, you think?

904
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,040
Well, who else?

905
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,660
Well, I know it's not...

906
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,860
Now, Dave, you've had girlfriends before you even were married one time.

907
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,380
I think it was even to a human.

908
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,780
One of them was, right?

909
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,840
One of them was human.

910
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm pretty sure.

911
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,520
And there was a while when you had the hottest-looking girlfriend in the entire subgenius church, except for me.

912
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,500
I don't think you're the prettiest girl in the church, Dave.

913
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
That's the chillest thing I've ever heard.

914
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,720
But I...

915
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,360
Yeah, but...

916
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,560
You have nice hair, though.

917
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,220
I mean, everybody knows you do have nice hair.

918
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,040
The walks polish every day.

919
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,940
You know.

920
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,000
That's kind of silly, but outside of that, you know, you've shown results anyway.

921
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,500
I wish I could depend on my hair, Dave.

922
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,400
You're having a bad hair, Dave.

923
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,980
You might say.

924
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,620
I think...

925
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,860
Well, this is all in the past for you.

926
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,360
This isn't something that happens to you very often anymore.

927
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:51,540
But when I run a brush through my hair, which goes about halfway down my back, as you know, all five of them...

928
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,300
Boy, do I.

929
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:01,380
There's like a pound of hair is left behind in the brush, and there's still five hairs running down, hanging down my back.

930
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,480
Five individual hairs?

931
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,440
It's the most pathetic hippie mullet, poe-bucker haircut.

932
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,700
Because there's hardly any hairs to cut.

933
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,380
But, man, when the comb-over time comes, I'll be ready.

934
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,980
Well, you know, the Indian people, what they said, five hairs, you know, they said about, you know, the Native American people said about five hairs.

935
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,680
No.

936
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,480
Said you were like two hearts.

937
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,860
You wanted to live in the part animal world and part human world.

938
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,580
You were bored with the human world and you wanted to become part wolf or part snake or something.

939
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,420
And that's why, you know, the five hairs, when somebody sees you, they can tell you're a wolf.

940
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:37,420


941
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:37,540
You're a witch.

942
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,060
Which one, I don't know.

943
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,540
I said it finally.

944
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,820
One hair for each point of the pentagram?

945
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,880
Supposedly that's the idea.

946
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,860
Well, actually, it's the four corners plus the center.

947
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,700
My dad has five hairs out in a hutch in Warren.

948
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,740
Little Warrens. Tiny little Warrens.

949
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,980
No, in Warren, Ohio.

950
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,520
Oh.

951
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,420
He's got those hairs in a hutch.

952
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,860
Oh.

953
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,380
Uh-huh.

954
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,720
He's got the bunnies.

955
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,180
Yeah.

956
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,140
Like the kind of...

957
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,280
Well, actually, I bet there's not five anymore.

958
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,340
He's probably had bunny dinner since then.

959
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,380
They're very cute.

960
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,540
He goes out and feeds them.

961
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:20,120
And then when they get nice and fat, he takes one out and in front of all the other ones,

962
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,840
snaps its neck very quickly and then skins it and guts it and all that.

963
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,100
I used to watch him do that when I was a kid.

964
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,920
Now, I think you're watching that Michael Moore film.

965
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,700
I haven't seen that one yet.

966
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,260
Well...

967
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,740
I have.

968
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,300
There's a nice lady who's petting a bunny rabbit.

969
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,460
And then she splits its hair.

970
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,340
Oh, right, right.

971
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,620
The old Michael Moore.

972
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,620
I thought you were talking about the Make Me Sick one, the new...his latest health-related

973
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:45,860
one.

974
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,440
Oh, Sicko.

975
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,300
Yeah, you're his first one.

976
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,440
Whatchamacallit of Flint, Michigan.

977
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
Yeah, you're right.

978
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,520
Travel to Charlie Nutt.

979
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:53,900
Travel to Charlie Nutt, too.

980
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,420
Well, we're all going to be doing that, man.

981
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,700
I mean, there's going to come a time in about three weeks when the dollar is so ruined,

982
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,480
the gas is so expensive that they can't drive our nice cellophane-wrapped meat to the store

983
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,560
anymore, and we'll be going out and making dinner out of the varmints in our backyards.

984
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,920
Boy, that's for sure.

985
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,280
I imagine you've got plenty out there in Ashtabula.

986
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,780
I have rats in little cages.

987
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:25,240
Well, we have in Cleveland Bluffs, where I live, we have rabbits, possums, skonks.

988
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,040
Skonkins?

989
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,400
Lots of skonks and raccoons.

990
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,120
And squirrel.

991
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,260
Squirrel is good.

992
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
If you fry it just right, squirrel is good.

993
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,380
You going to be at that squirrel dinner, Dave?

994
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,240
Squirrel?

995
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:36,680
Squirrel gravy.

996
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,760
It's what's for dinner.

997
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,060
Dave, you going to be able to make us down that squirrel dinner?

998
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,940
Squirrel supper?

999
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,320
I had squirrel gravy and grits one time.

1000
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,860
It was good.

1001
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,640
It was good.

1002
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,120
That's good eating.

1003
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,640
Well, it depends on who's cooking it and how it's cooked and so forth.

1004
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,940
And, you know, it tends to be a bit gamey.

1005
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,840
Well, it makes you better at math, though.

1006
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,480
It is gamey, that's true, but it's like eating rattlesnake.

1007
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,240
It makes you better at complex, like calculus and algebraic stuff.

1008
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,460
Now, just to make you feel worse, Dave, if you had made it into town tonight, we would

1009
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,040
have given you some venison jerky that Potter Nostril left here.

1010
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,600
He has these little deers that he plays around with and, you know, he jerks them around and

1011
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,360
we ended up with a big bag of deer jerky.

1012
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,720
That is good stuff.

1013
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Actually, it is.

1014
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,700
I've had deer jerky that I did not like much.

1015
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,900
I think I did, too.

1016
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,280
It was like, oh, it was repugnant.

1017
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,900
What I'm looking forward to trying someday is kangaroo jerky.

1018
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,900
Pretty much anything that Potter Nostril has anything to do with is pretty tasty.

1019
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,980
He's a pretty skillful...

1020
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,380
He's good with that cook pot.

1021
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,700
That's why I call him Potter.

1022
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
Potter Nostril.

1023
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:54,340
Well, they have buffaloes and ostriches and other, they call them game meats around here

1024
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,720
in big farms and cages and they...

1025
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,940
My sister used to raise ostriches, Dave.

1026
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,720
She did?

1027
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,540
Yes, she did.

1028
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,440
They have long necks, don't they?

1029
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,880
They have long necks and they have...

1030
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,040
They have long claws on the end of long legs that they use to disembowel humans.

1031
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,300
Well, yeah, they could take care of a human, I guess, with them feet, yeah.

1032
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,140
And I've had ostrich meat and I'm not real fond of it.

1033
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,100
It's rubbery.

1034
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,680
It's good for one thing, though.

1035
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,720
It's good for convincing stupid poe-buckers that if they start an ostrich and emu farm,

1036
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,540
they'll soon be rich, they can quit their jobs and it'll be really easy.

1037
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,640
That's not what my sister was doing.

1038
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,860
Some veterinarian had decided he was going to do it.

1039
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,120
He was going to get rich with an ostrich farm and he hired my sister to take care of them

1040
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,440
in her backyard, which is 700 acres.

1041
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,120
I don't think vets should be carnivores.

1042
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,520
I think they should be like Taoists or something.

1043
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,820
Well, this guy might have been.

1044
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,000
He just wanted to make money off the ostriches and sell them to the Japanese,

1045
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,780
who I think actually do eat them.

1046
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,220
Well, they render the fat and they use them to make those sobu chips sometimes.

1047
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,860
They use them for a lot of different things.

1048
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,960
Things like whale blubber and stuff.

1049
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,880
At least, so I've heard.

1050
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,180
That's on a subgenius chat line.

1051
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,980
Dave, you've never been on a subgenius chat line.

1052
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,920
You just dreamed you were on it.

1053
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,780
Well, you told me that was the way for me to do it, that I didn't have to go to the material grid.

1054
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,720
And you believe me?

1055
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,640
Ha ha ha!

1056
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,880
Hee hee hee hee hee hee!

1057
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,200
Reverent Stang, that is so mean.

1058
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,500
Why is it mean?

1059
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,300
It works.

1060
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,580
He's mean.

1061
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,700
Is it this one?

1062
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:37,980
No.

1063
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,860
It works.

1064
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,880
This one?

1065
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,160
No.

1066
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,260
Oh man, are you looking at them again?

1067
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,200
They'll never go away if you keep looking at them, Stang.

1068
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,800
Um.

1069
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,060
Are you like.

1070
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,460
Oh no, I was just looking at the clock.

1071
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,780
We have another five minutes or so.

1072
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:58,540
In the last few minutes of the show, I want to leave time to play a few more cuts from Greaser's Palace.

1073
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,520
Because one of them is a sermon on the mount by Jesus.

1074
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,100
It's only a minute and a half long, but it's really good.

1075
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,760
Do you think that's how long the actual sermon was?

1076
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,860
It could have been, right?

1077
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,740
The sermon about bingo motel cheeseburger gas station with a side of aircraft noise and you have Gary, Indiana.

1078
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,580
Yeah, that was the one I was talking about.

1079
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:17,840
Yeah.

1080
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,300
Yeah, I have a really good tape of Jesus doing that.

1081
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,540
And followed by a nice song, a western song.

1082
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,240
Now was that when he.

1083
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,420
That's very subgeniously.

1084
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,920
Was that when he was giving fish sandwiches to the epistles?

1085
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,420
And the other slackers?

1086
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,540
I was there when Jesus did that the fishes and the loaves miracle at X Day.

1087
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,620
It started out, he goes, we got to feed everybody.

1088
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,520
We promised there was going to be this huge feast.

1089
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,240
So the Lord went around from camp to camp at X Day.

1090
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,660
This was X Day drill, of course, in the 90s.

1091
00:46:53,660 --> 00:47:00,020
And to each person he would go, give unto me a loaf and a fish.

1092
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,440
And they would.

1093
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,900
And at that moment.

1094
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,980
At the end of an hour.

1095
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:10,440
By some sort of miracle, Jesus had tables full of loaves and old soggy fish sticks.

1096
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,800
Enough to feed the entire camp.

1097
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,920
Now that is what we call a subgenius miracle.

1098
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:24,860
That's why Jesus was our business manager until they took his child away and he had to get a real job to pay for lawyers.

1099
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,480
Which he's still paying for, but he did get the child back.

1100
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,720
You know, you know, that's the so far happy ending of the Jesus.

1101
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
And Magdalene and Convo stories.

1102
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,540
They have.

1103
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,580
They're all back together.

1104
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,840
They're all back in their original house in Georgia.

1105
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,060
And the Cracker Woods.

1106
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:43,560
I could.

1107
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,740
Who could have thunk, you know, that the Lord would actually emigrate to the Cracker Woods, to the Piney Woods.

1108
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,920
It'd be like one of those guys in Deliverance.

1109
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,240
Well, it makes sense.

1110
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,920
You know, he's the Prince of Peace and everything.

1111
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,960
He was in York, England, and really liked it there and wanted to move his family there.

1112
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,660
But see, he.

1113
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,060
Jesus works for the conspiracy now.

1114
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,360
He used to work for the Church of the Subgenius, as everyone knows.

1115
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,420
Yes, Jesus worked for the Church of the Subgenius.

1116
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,600
He's one of the few actual full-time employees the church has ever had.

1117
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,160
Besides, I mean, not counting the slaves and stuff.

1118
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,880
The volunteer bombies and so on.

1119
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,120
But.

1120
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,900
But yes, it turns out.

1121
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,120
Can you believe it?

1122
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,920
The conspiracy of the normals actually pays more.

1123
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,640
Than the Church of the Subgenius.

1124
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:40,180
And you can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius at www.subgenius.com.

1125
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,900
And for those prisoners out there who don't have internet, I'll give that box number.

1126
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,260
That's box 18141.

1127
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,620
What is it?

1128
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,900
Box 181417.

1129
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,580
That's right.

1130
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,280
Box 181417.

1131
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,940
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1132
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:04,920
44118.

1133
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,640
And we ate of his flesh and his soggy fish sticks.

1134
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,240
And he came unto us and preached.

1135
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,100
And Dave, I'm going to have to cut you off now.

1136
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:15,640
Nine.

1137
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,220
Nine.

1138
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,500
Because we're going to do that.

1139
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:18,960
Eight.

1140
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,380
Nine.

1141
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,320
We're going to do that sermon.

1142
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,980
It'll only fit on this show.

1143
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,660
Well, I'll listen to it in my space.

1144
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,600
Okay.

1145
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,980
Okay, on your MySpace.

1146
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,300
In my memory.

1147
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,620
In my mental space.

1148
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,420
Eight, nine.

1149
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:31,980
Right?

1150
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,880
Those are the numbers?

1151
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,460
Yeah.

1152
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:33,860
Okay.

1153
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,400
Okay, pat your little demon for us.

1154
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,800
Is this the one?

1155
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,660
Pat my Venus.

1156
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,980
I'll pat her.

1157
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,420
And I won't smack her.

1158
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:39,980
Okay.

1159
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,420
Okay.

1160
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,440
Mom?

1161
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:41,960
Stop.

1162
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,300
Stop.

1163
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:42,500
Stop.

1164
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:42,580
Stop.

1165
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,480
He has come.

1166
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,480
Put a rope on this son of a bitch.

1167
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,340
One moment, please.

1168
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,420
I bring you a message.

1169
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,280
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain in the Valle de la Valle.

1170
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,280


1171
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,280


1172
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,280


1173
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,280


1174
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,640
There lives an evil devil monster.

1175
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,920
His name is Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise and you'll be

1176
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,620
Gary, Indiana.

1177
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,140
And he loves to hurt people.

1178
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,800
The last time I saw Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise

1179
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,000
and you'll be Gary, Indiana.

1180
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,440
He told me what he wants to do.

1181
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,260
He wants to come down here and kill each and every one of us.

1182
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:36,540
every one of you. But I said to him, bingo, wait a minute. And the reason I said that is because I

1183
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:42,440
believe in you people. I believe you can do the job. I believe you can help each other.

1184
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,260
I believe you can make this world a better place to live in.

1185
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:59,060
That's it. Never mind this how you say bingo. Just tell us whether there is a life after

1186
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:09,700
death or not. If you feel, you heal. I was swimming with millions of babies in a rainbow

1187
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:15,600
and they was naked. And then all of a sudden I turned into a perfect smile.

1188
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,040
I'm sorry I brought you back, but I need your help. Who are you?

1189
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,900
I'm sorry I brought you back, but I need your help.

1190
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,040
I'm sorry I brought you back, but I need your help.

1191
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,040


1192
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,320
I'm on my way to Jerusalem to be an actor-singer.

1193
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,860
It is written that the Agent Morris awaits me.

1194
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,920
Red Amber Mountains

1195
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,300
Navajo guns nearby

1196
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,840
A white cloud is floating

1197
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,760
Over this land of enchantment

1198
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,220
Under turquoise skies

1199
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,820
I hear distant drums

1200
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,500
I hear roaring guns

1201
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,440
I hear indents

1202
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,820
I hear a war cry

1203
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,640
Horse soldiers in blue

1204
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,160
I hear bugles

1205
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,380
Under turquoise skies

1206
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,820
I have a song that I want to sing

1207
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,300
I have a song that I want to sing

1208
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,040
I write songs that, that nobody else has heard before.

1209
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,180
They need to be on the radio.

1210
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,300
They need to be heard by millions of people.

1211
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,920
And I'm a social worker, and I'm sittin' around.

1212
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,420
And I'm a social worker, and I'm sittin' around.

1213
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,960
And I'm a social worker, and I'm sittin' around.

1214
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,380
Mudd in my biz

1215
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,300
Something's wrong and I don't know, and I don't know what it is.

1216
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,200
My girl comes around. She's like, muck in my biz.

1217
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,380
She's an ex-rex

1218
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,600
She starts playing, she starts playing with me, me, me

1219
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,200
All she wants is sex

1220
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,360
But take it from me, from me

1221
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,220
Hear what I say

1222
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,520
I don't need that, there's a better way

1223
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,880
So I promise her love, love

1224
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,540
As she streams along, I promise her love

1225
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,680
Cause sex is weak and love is strong

1226
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,120
Teenagers of the world, no sex allowed

1227
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,620
Teenagers of the world, no sex allowed

1228
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,100
No sex allowed, no sex allowed

1229
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,060
No sex allowed

1230
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,680
I don't wanna be part of your crowd

1231
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,680
No sex allowed

1232
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,720
No sex allowed

1233
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,520
And if you don't like it, get out of town

1234
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,020
Woo-hoo!

1235
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,220
That's right, friends.

1236
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,600
Reverend Noro Pascual.

1237
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,820
Craft says no sex out loud.

1238
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,020
Perverted third-versity.

1239
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,140
Perverted, perverted, perverted, perverted

1240
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,280
You won't regret it.

1241
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,860
Lamey homo!

1242
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,360
My son!

1243
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,420
Welcome to Madway.

1244
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,060
The leading Madway is an opportunity for all people to talk to a Madway distributor.

1245
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,180
You'll notice the kind of programs so many people.

1246
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,060
Around the world, people are more programmed.

1247
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,960
Anywhere you go, you go.

1248
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,400
Madway is about if you own your own man, you're free, biodegradable, and a handful of Madway.

1249
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,340
Grown so large, using massive, strong family values.

1250
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,460
Pinkies, pinkies.

1251
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,340
And helping others to do the same.

1252
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,060
Madway.

1253
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,120
Mother, is there anything I can do for you?

1254
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,180
I wanna go out today.

1255
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,780
You'll go out when I tell you to go out.

1256
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,600
You'll always go out.

1257
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,940
You'll always be my favorite.

1258
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,840
More coffee?

1259
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,800
Is it very bad?

1260
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,640
I'm afraid it is, Maggie.

1261
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,580
Mexican.

1262
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm in jeopardy.

1263
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,300
President Bush is accusing John Negroponte of genocide in Paris.

1264
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,300
On Wednesday,

1265
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,020
the white man vomited the warship out into his room.

1266
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,440
This was for our people.

1267
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,840
Unconversionable young man shrunk in from of a

1268
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:36,840


1269
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,520
This is额

1270
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,500
Dame that had their drunkflank re up to a

1271
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,420
scapegoat begins.

1272
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,320

1274
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:50,800
has been笑 snoozed in the air, as if profoundly

1275
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,260
wounded people did not attempt this weapon.

1276
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,540
Feel like a fed wat ?

1277
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
followers soon carrying out

1278
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,560
France's role in this busy Thanksgiving holiday week.

1279
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,540
This holiday season is also the busiest time for PR news.

1280
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,180
PR offers you the gift of PR.

1281
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,400
Praise God.

1282
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,580
Messiah.

1283
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,560
Most Holy One, let me see.

1284
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,980
Most Holy Messiah.

1285
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,620
If you feel you're here.

1286
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,380
Messiah.

1287
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,460
Let me see.

1288
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,760
I can crawl again.

1289
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,140
Most Holy One.

1290
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,460
If you feel you're here.

1291
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,280
I can crawl again.

1292
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,920
I can see.

1293
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,060
I can see.

1294
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,140
Get your hands off me.

1295
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,660
What's going down here?

1296
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,940
Who am I?

1297
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,560
I can crawl again.

1298
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,980
This is blasphemy.

1299
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,640
Blasphemy.

1300
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,560
I can crawl again.

1301
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,520
Give to us.

1302
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,300
Give us something to live for.

1303
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,400
Anything.

1304
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,740
We need hope now, love.

1305
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,580
Bob is all you need, baby.

1306
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:06,960
Puppy.

1307
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,100
Puppy.

1308
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:09,820

00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,340

World Church of the Sick Puppy.

00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,220

Jake!

1326
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:26,720
Horse flu.

Sexually abusing, sexually

I'll end up a loser.

1342
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,640
Ladies and gentlemen, Shakespeare said,

1343
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,620
See your dentist twice a day.

1344
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,520
T.A.S.O. The History

1345
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,700
I don't think I like your tea.

1346
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,440
Makes your teeth look dull.

1347
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,060
It's because tea tastes dull, flat.

1348
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,300
It's always dreary.

1349
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,660
Because tea never tastes brisk or lively and cheery.

1350
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,340
Oh dear.

1351
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:45,220
Oh, what a dreary world of dull tea there is in every cupful.

1352
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,280
Well, I would always tell a dog would tree by its bark.

1353
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,040
Tree?

1354
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,280
There's poor Linda in all that trouble and trouble.

1355
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,660
And here you go making tea.

1356
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,580
I can't help it, Mary. That's my nature.

1357
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,420
I ought to know it's your nature.

1358
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,620
Well, why worry about it?

1359
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,220
You won't come out alive anyway.

1360
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,220
Oh, by the way, this one is tea and soup in the night.

1361
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,740
Starring Bob.

1362
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,220
This is what Bob can do for you.

1363
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,320
It's challenging, isn't it?

1364
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,500
This is a dangerous group, is it?

1365
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,420
Dangerous?

1366
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,080
In the streets.

1367
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,860
A sub-deme's a real dangerous man.

1368
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,400
To ourselves.
