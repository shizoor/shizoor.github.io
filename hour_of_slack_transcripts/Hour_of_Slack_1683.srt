1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,060
Bob's Shoe Service has one of the biggest selections of work in western boots in the area.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,720
Custom holsters and leather work, western wear and hats, shoe and saddle repair, and other western items for all ages.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,340
Come into Bob's Shoe Service.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,720
Either of you men fear what I fear?

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,740
It's funny. They think you're easy to be afraid of, say this beauty comrade.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,780
I'm afraid she's right, Mr. Vandergilt.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,520
But how can we be sure?

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,240
The Self Genius Power of Sack.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,680
That devil.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,040
Good grief. I'm on my way.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,880
From PR news in Washington, I'm plunged into chaos because of alleged corruption.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,500
Spaceships.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,700
The shuttle Atlantis has undocked from the International Slaughterhouse.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,080
The crew has been trying to determine if any beef they've served in their cafeterias could pose a danger on re-entry.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,640
The shuttle has completed a nine-day mission in which astronauts made a public call for the beef grains on Wednesday.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,460
Former First Lady Nancy Reagan is likely to be going into the food supply.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,600
PR news is bad.

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,420
PR is bad.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,380
More than 50 top former Philippine government officials recognized today that this is PR news.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,040
In Washington.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,760
Do I presume that you need no explanation of sexual variations?

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,580
A safe assumption, Lucilla said.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,460
And I do not need to tell you that your robe identifies you as a fifth stage adept in the order of Hormel.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,380
It was Lucilla's turn to scowl.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,600
What if I show abilities beyond this fifth stage?

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,020
Ah, Serapha said.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,420
You will continue to heed my words then?

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,400
Lucilla nodded curtly.

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,620
Very good, Serapha said.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,980
May I presume you can administer vaginal pulsing?

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,580
I can.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,160
From any position?

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,860
I can control any muscle in my body.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,960
Serapha glanced past Lucilla at Buzmali.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,340
True?

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,200
Buzmali spoke from close behind Lucilla.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,500
Or she would not claim it.

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,200
Serapha looked thoughtful, her focus on Lucilla's chin.

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,400
This is a complicated matter.

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,220
I think it's a good indication.

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,320
Lest you get the wrong idea, Lucilla said.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,060
The abilities I was taught are not usually marketed.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,840
They have another purpose.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,200
Oh, I'm sure they do, Serapha said.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,360
But sexual agility is a...agility.

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,240
Lucilla allowed her tone to convey the full weight of a reverend mother's outrage.

47
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,420
No matter that this might be what Serapha hoped to achieve, she had to be put in her place.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Agility, you say?

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,100
I can control genital temperature.

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,380
I can control the temperature of the body.

51
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,380


52
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,380


53
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,380


54
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,380


55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,260
I know I can arouse the fifty-one excitation points.

56
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,900
I...

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,740
Fifty-one?

58
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,440
But there are only...

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Fifty-one, Lucilla snapped.

60
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,920
And the sequencing plus the combinations number two thousand and eight.

61
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,620
Furthermore, in combination with the two hundred and five sexual positions...

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,000
Two hundred and five?

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,860
Serapha was clearly startled.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,520
Surely you don't mean...

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,260
More, actually, if you count minor variations.

66
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,920
I am an imprintor.

67
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,360
I am an imprintor.

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,360


69
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,300
Which means I have mastered the three hundred steps of orgasmic amplification.

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,380
Serapha cleared her throat and wet her lips with her tongue.

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,900
I must warn you then to restrain yourself.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm raping them on the table with non-consensual sex.

73
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,840
The White House says...

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,180
Not only to help PR News, but to ensure it doesn't get to regional distribution centers.

75
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,300
The Dow was seventy-twenty to eight-eight-thirty.

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,740
Sixty-five eighty-seven.

77
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,220
Six twenty-five fifty.

78
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,260
Last year, Mitsubishi and Suzuki both admitted to cheating on PR News.

79
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,400
One of Japan's largest steel makers admits to falsifying PR News in Washington.

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Now I'm not gonna bore all of you.

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
No, I don't hear a thing.

82
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,140
With a lot of technological double talk, I'm sure nobody wants to hear that.

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:23,080
But what I will say is that our position on this...

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,480
The signal is here.

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,240
...subgeniuses virtually demand that we make our virtual demands.

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,300
Signal. Signal.

87
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,460
Thus, we do so.

88
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:43,440
Adding our signal to the noise, we comply in the cosmic spectrum, which radiates outward from X-Day at the speed of light.

89
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,420
As it does from anyone who's broadcasting one of these messages.

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,760
We know they are listening.

91
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,500
Unthinkable things.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,380
Beings created of a different clay entirely.

93
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,780
From a different evolutionary path.

94
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,280
Frightful, huge beings from beyond the stars.

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Uh, yeah, you know, you've heard about them.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,260
And, uh...

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,440
Our own solar system is a happening place.

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Where much has happened on the extrasolar world.

99
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,900
And, uh, even in the remote ones.

100
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,920
The remotest only discovered in the past few years.

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,020
Like the planet Biden, named for the recent vice president, Joe Biden.

102
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,900
Which is so far out among the...

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm hearing it now.

104
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,280
...the gleaming clouds of the outer system.

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
Then there's the planet Sedna, part of our system.

106
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,540
And the planet Quaoar, part of our system.

107
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,660
They are hard names to, um, remember.

108
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,120
Because they don't have to do with the Grico-Roman mythology.

109
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,840
But they come from, I believe, a northwestern...

110
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,980
Now I hear it.

111
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,020
Now I'm hearing it too. It's happening.

112
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,240
Yes, we are persevering.

113
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,460
So there are many who are anxiously awaiting the onset of X-Day.

114
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,600
I'm sure all of you know who you are.

115
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,740
And there are others in the outer world.

116
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,780
Some may not know yet.

117
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,100
The strange, cold, loveless, inanimate world of the conspiracy.

118
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,520
Who also, though they may not know it consciously,

119
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,960
are waiting for the balm, the succydenium of X-Day.

120
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,020
So, Reverend Stang is going to be so proud of us,

121
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,720
we actually put together Tarzan's radio station.

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
The Stang of the free and the...

123
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,940
We've got the DVD player...

124
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,820
Home of the... Yes.

125
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,540
...the player is playing music in the background.

126
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,820
I understand we can actually even bring video into this somehow.

127
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,400
That's right.

128
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,200
And we may indeed be able to have live, on-the-spot organ music...

129
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,700
Now you got it.

130
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,860
...as in the great and golden days of Aunt Bertha and the gang.

131
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,600
Twiddle the knobs.

132
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,340
Our knobs all need to be twiddled with expert assurance.

133
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,440
See what I did with that pipe that was lying around here a minute ago?

134
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,800
And just listen to this even tone that we're able to put in.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:16,800


136
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,080
And I'll play it to you.

137
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,080


138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,820
Surely there's nothing beyond us.

139
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,540
What?

140
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,700
What do you mean?

141
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,940
I have a pipe.

142
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,680
A pipe?

143
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't have it.

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,060
Racine took mine.

145
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,300
I don't have anything.

146
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
It's all gone.

147
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,580
No more.

148
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,460
I don't have any in my pocket.

149
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm bereft.

150
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,900
Deprived.

151
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,280
Do you want to see my pipe?

152
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,480
No, sir.

153
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,680
I do not see your pipe, but...

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
This is my watch pocket.

155
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,660
Have you ever lost anything in there?

156
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:43,820
Ah.

157
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,580
Well, I have a...

158
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,780
Have you ever lost anything in there?

159
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,780


160
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,780


161
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,780


162
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,780


163
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,780


164
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,980
Have you ever lost anything in your watch pocket?

165
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,520
Well...

166
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,240
Look around for hours and hours and...

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
Sometimes I...

168
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,040
And there was a bowl already loaded and ready to go...

169
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,480
I stick some...

170
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,260
Just hiding in your watch pocket.

171
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,480
Yeah.

172
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,960
I do that.

173
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,420
I...

174
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,460
Who's watching you from your watch pocket?

175
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,220
Well, one likes to feel someone's...

176
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,440
Keeping its eye.

177
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
...paying attention to the busy sound of the clockwork.

178
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,340
Now it's still my lighter.

179
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,560
It did.

180
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,240
Why, I ought to...

181
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,640
I'll tell you what.

182
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,000
On this special occasion...

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,920
Oh, you do have it.

184
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,200
I'm going to put it on the table.

185
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm going to put it on the table.

186
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,760
I'm going to put it on the table.

187
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:16,760


188
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,680
Hey, Al, do you know it's been about a year since we were on the radio together?

189
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,620
One year.

190
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,860
Yes, uh, isn't that...

191
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,160
Curious?

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,300
I think my last show was, uh, June.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
Sometime in June of...

194
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,420
2017.

195
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,400
Man, this mu...

196
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,840
Mu...

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,720
Movie...

198
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,860
This music...

199
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,780
It's really...

200
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,740
Playing with my mind.

201
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,340
Well, this music is, uh, showing that there is a continuity here.

202
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,340


203
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,740
We can't, uh, claim to be the most, uh, joyful or energetic on this particular X-Day of X-Days

204
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,560
because we are dealing with anomalous situations and ch-ch-changes in the program.

205
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,280
This episode of the X-Day Festival itself...

206
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll put some more in there for you.

207
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,260
That's kind of cashed out.

208
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,280
...is unusual because X-Day begins more or less at the...

209
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,200
My vitamins stack.

210
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,440
...beginning.

211
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,300
And anything which follows is celebrated either...

212
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,500
I don't forget to take it that way.

213
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:16,740
...on the stage.

214
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,640
...in the saucers or here at the campground.

215
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,200
Can you imagine me forgetting to take it?

216
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,040
One can imagine it so easily.

217
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,260
You can?

218
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,860
You can imagine me forgetting to take my vitamins?

219
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,780
To be confused.

220
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,140
Yes, it's happened to me.

221
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,520
Uh, bamboozled, uh, rocked, uh, distracted, uh, anything is possible.

222
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,420
I'm talking about vitamin fropped, though.

223
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,720
Vitamin F.

224
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,440
Vitamin F.

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,440


226
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,660
Vitamin F.

227
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,300
Which is actually vitamin H, as we know.

228
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,400
Vitamin C.

229
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,880
So, uh...

230
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,200
Vitamin C.

231
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,440
It's got vitamin A and vitamin C, vitamins L-O-V-E.

232
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,120
If you're fat, it's for that.

233
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,920
If you're thin, pack it in.

234
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,180
What's wrong if you're packing a triple drink?

235
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,760
We got the right ingredients, so let's proceed.

236
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,540
Time to get the fropp out, that's all we need.

237
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,500
Do you remember that show we did about, uh, Colonel Sanders?

238
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,700
That was a great show.

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,820
We had a lot of feeling, the measure of company.

240
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,500
Colonel Sanders.

241
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,880
Then we give it to the ladies.

242
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,840
We had a really good show.

243
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,900
Stir it up, stir it up, stir it up, stir it up.

244
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,060
You can hear that show on your own if you want.

245
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,160
Boy, boy, boy, by Obe, Obe, eat them up.

246
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,140
It's on a, it's on a web page.

247
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,820
It's got vitamin A and vitamin C, vitamins L-O-V-E.

248
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
About the last three years worth of shows, maybe.

249
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah.

250
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,620
Three or four years worth of shows.

251
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,820
In an incessant queue.

252
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,700
Just try to stop it rumbling over you like a juggernaut.

253
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,020
Back when I was one of the main stars.

254
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,080
An iron shod polygon.

255
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,680
That was the long-term special guest star.

256
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,060
Hal was there, he was the long-term guest co-host.

257
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,500
I was there to co-host and make classic commentary.

258
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,840
Yeah, we were like wrestling, you know, one of us was the color commentary guy

259
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,500
and the other guy's the guy that sides with the other guy.

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:14,620
Yeah, he was the heel.

261
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,740
Wrestling women versus the Aztec mummy.

262
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,000
I think you know how that one turned out.

263
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,180
I sure do, Hal.

264
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,800
Often on the...

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,620
That Aztec mummy lost his Johnson in that one, I think.

266
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,580
Yes, terrible, humiliating come down for him, but that's what happens.

267
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,840
Those Lucadora babes are really hefty.

268
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,220
That happens to all those guys.

269
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,060
Here's what's going to happen.

270
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,480
If your body is languishing around the world for way, way, way past your doorstep,

271
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,480


272
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,600
you're dying.

273
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,860
The piece of crumbling...

274
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,320
Somebody's going to cut your Johnson off eventually.

275
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,100
It would have fallen off anyway because he's this crumbling Guanajuato-esque...

276
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,800
That's what they did.

277
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,820
They did that to the Iceman, remember?

278
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,220
The guy, they found the Iceman...

279
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,300
Well, that was cruel.

280
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,500
They tore his genitals off, but it was an error.

281
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,800
It was a mistake in that case.

282
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,940
Oh, okay.

283
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,160
I thought he was missing one.

284
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,180
Well, after they ripped him out of the ice, they left his tackle behind.

285
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, no.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,820
The only reason he was missing his tackle, like from...

287
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,500
And it happened at some, you know, intermediate point in the past.

288
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,560
The only reason he was missing his junk is because of the careless way that the body

289
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
was removed from the ice by the original discoverer.

290
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:33,240
And, you know, we discoverers of ancient stuff really believe that not only the thing that

291
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,280
is found has information, but the immediate area where it's found, the place where it's

292
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,440
found, should also not be disturbed.

293
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
We call it the Lagerstadt.

294
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,780
They're smoking a...

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,620
The place where the body of the fossilized creature is found also is full of information,

296
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,300
which we can learn.

297
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,840
They're smoking vapes.

298
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,440
They're smoking vapes?

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,780
Why not?

300
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,060
I'd like to do some vapes sometime.

301
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,980
Well, you just have to get the attention of those vape-smoking characters down there,

302
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,260
and maybe they'd come up and...

303
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,300
Sounds great in here.

304
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,780
Yes, that's right.

305
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,640
We got a good mix here.

306
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,620
So, maybe...

307
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,460
Thanks to Reverend Stang's...

308
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,140
We could have a vape here for...

309
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,300
...unbelievably...

310
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Dr. Drummond wants to vape with the best of them, and now Reverend Mother Dr. Miller

311
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,500
is approaching the podium with the special Vape Master 9000.

312
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,260
Now, this thing is super powerful, and I wouldn't want to...

313
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:31,920
Oh, what's this?

314
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,620
One for me?

315
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,780
Oh, it's my pen.

316
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,360
Yes, well, that also is dangerous.

317
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

318
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,280
So, I'll press the button and suck it up.

319
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,760
I'll suck it up, but a little too far, and you'll start hacking in the coffin.

320
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,300
It's not the cough that carries you off.

321
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm going to go get my device to stare at while I do this.

322
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:53,880
All right.

323
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,660
He's going to get his stereo device for staring, and...

324
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,680
My staring device.

325
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
I see.

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
All right.

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,000


328
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,380
Excuse me.

329
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,380


330
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,380


331
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,400
Thank you.

332
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,060
Love you very much.

333
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


334
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


335
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


336
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


337
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


338
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


339
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


340
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


341
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


342
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,060


343
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,440
Made you a real good sandwich.

344
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,180
Bottle of beer?

345
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,680
Yeah.

346
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,200
Had cheese and bologna on garlic bread, a little mayonnaise, horseradish mustard.

347
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
How's that sound to you, Joe?

348
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm not sure.

349
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,260
It's a very good meal, but I'm out.

350
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,260


351
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,260


352
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,980
Thank you.

353
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,340
Thank you.

354
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
Thank you.

355
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,420
Thank you.

356
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,120
Thank you.

357
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,120


358
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,620
Thank you.

359
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,200
Thank you.

360
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,200


361
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,200


362
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,660
I'll just have a bowl of soup at the apartment.

363
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,520
Thanks anyway.

364
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,280
Now, what band could that possibly be?

365
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,520
Was that U2 or Aerosmith?

366
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,480
I fooled you.

367
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:10,860
It was the Rudy Schwartz Project, a song called Hunky Dunkey off that new album Postal Code

368
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,960
for Ham.

369
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:19,260
And I'm still using my phone's video camera as a microphone and mixer.

370
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,180
If you could see the video, you'd be looking right up my nostril in full HD.

371
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,860
A lot of stalactites up there, huh?

372
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,860
Carl's bad.

373
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,480
Anyway, obviously, praise Bob, Philo sent me the recordings he made with Dr. Hal and

374
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,760
Anna Moll at Tarzan's Radio.

375
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,580
I'm going to have to go to the radio station at the 21X Day celebration in Ohio, which

376
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:54,260
I had to miss while driving back to Texas in a big hurry in a rented car with the dog.

377
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,360
And in Texas, it was 109 degrees today.

378
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,940
Anyway, we also heard lots of lemur cut-ups and PR news.

379
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,760
And that bit with the old man playing two old ladies.

380
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,020
And the other bit he's talking dirty was from the audiobook of Heretics of Dune by

381
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:26,080
Frank Herbert, which audiobook I heard most of while driving south on I-71, 65, 40, 30,

382
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,220
and briefly 35E.

383
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,260
On the other hand, at least Buddy and I were in air conditioning the whole time, unlike

384
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,120
these guys.

385
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
Wine press of love.

386
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,620
Eastward.

387
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,600
Right to the desert of Golgolooza, before the seat of Satan.

388
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Luva laid the foundation and Urizen finished it in howling woe.

389
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,200
How red the sons and daughters of Luva!

390
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,000
Here they tread the grapes, laughing and shouting.

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,080
Drunk with odors.

392
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,040
Many fall o'erwearied.

393
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,680
Drowned in the wine is many youth and maiden.

394
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,620
Those around laid them on skins of tigers or of the spotted leopard.

395
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:19,280
or the wild ass till they revive or bury them in cool grots making lamentation.

396
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,900
This wine press is called War on Earth.

397
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,240
It is the printing press of Loth and here he lays his words in order above the mortal brain

398
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,120
as cogs in a wheel are formed to turn the cogs of the adverse wheel.

399
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,440
Timbrels and violins sport round the wine presses.

400
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:53,460
The little seed, the sportive root, the earthworm, the gold beetle, the wise emmet dance round

401
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,760
the wine presses of Lotha.

402
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:05,660
The centipede is there, the ground spider with many eyes, the mole clothed all in velvet,

403
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,100
the ambitious spider in her sling.

404
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,280
The sullen web, the lucky golden spinner, the earwig armed.

405
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,740
The tender maggot, emblem of immortality.

406
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:28,880
They rejoice in loud jubilee dancing round the wine presses of Lotha, naked and drunk

407
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,940
with wine.

408
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,620
There is the nettle that stings with his soft down and there the indignant thistle whose

409
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,100
bitternesses spin.

410
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
The

411
00:20:50,960 --> 00:21:01,840
But in the wine presses the human grapes sing not nor dance.

412
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,240
They howl and writhe in shoals of torment.

413
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,100
In fierce flames consuming the earth.

414
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,100


415
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,920
In chains of iron and in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires.

416
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,920
In pits and dens and shades of death.

417
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,280
In shapes of formant and wool.

418
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,660
The plates and screws and racks and cords and saws and fires and cinders.

419
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,340
The cruel joys of Lotha's daughters.

420
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,800
Lacerating with knives and whips their victims.

421
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,080
And the cruel sport of Lotha's sons.

422
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,080


423
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,980
They dance around the dying and they drink the howl and groan.

424
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,140
They catch the shrieks in cups of gold.

425
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,900
They hand them to one another.

426
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,140
These are the sports of love and these the sweet delights of amorous play.

427
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,160
Oh boy, special stickers.

428
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,420
This is not a pipe.

429
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,620
No, this is a sticker of a pipe.

430
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,980
Tears of the great.

431
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,780
The death sweat of the cluster.

432
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,180
In places where they're clear.

433
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:23,780
The last sign of the mild youth who listens to the luring song of Lotha.

434
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,520
And you make art by doing that.

435
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,420
Yeah, it's art.

436
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,640
When you stick a pipe on something, it's art.

437
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,600
Look at how much art you got.

438
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,340
So just stick a pipe on something and then you'll be churning out the art.

439
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,840
Art.

440
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,340
Art.

441
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,880
Bobart.

442
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,360
Banana, banana, Bobart.

443
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,740
Is this, we're giving these away?

444
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,160
Yeah, put a pipe on something today.

445
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,360
Never say you didn't do anything, huh?

446
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,400
I have one.

447
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,440
Those are great, yeah.

448
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,740
Are there any other mics, Philo?

449
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,040
We have how many mics available here?

450
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,660
How many mics did you use?

451
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,580
We have three mics.

452
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Three mics.

453
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,660
Okay, this one then.

454
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,940
This is a usable.

455
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Useful mic.

456
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,380
It is possible.

457
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,200
Try to speak in it.

458
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,720
See what it sounds like.

459
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,900
See if it comes out.

460
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,340
Say something.

461
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,560
Well, I noticed how you were talking about making another glory, but I've been dressing them up in suits.

462
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,900
Oh, well, yeah.

463
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,340
So they're kind of in suits to start with.

464
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,380
They're the ones they were born in.

465
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,580
We like their birthday suits is the idea.

466
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,640
It is a suit.

467
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,920
A suit of clothing and an identity.

468
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,960
All right, yeah, we're here.

469
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,180
You don't see show, you hear show.

470
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,480
Tarzan's radio station.

471
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,980
The show is in your mind.

472
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,240
She sells the seashells down by the seashore.

473
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,340
The shells she sells are seashore shells of that I'm sure.

474
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm going to hook up my rig here.

475
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,520
Amidst the mists and coldest frosts.

476
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,560
He beats his fists against the posts.

477
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,160
And still insists he sees the ghosts.

478
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,560
Theophilus, the thistle sifter, sifted six thistles into the thick of his thumb.

479
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:31,380
See therefore that thou, when thou siftest thistles, sift not six thistles into the thick of thy thumb.

480
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,700
Or else you're going to get it.

481
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,140
Oh, uh.

482
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:36,960
Is this on?

483
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,240
So we're marking time a little bit here at Tarzan's radio station.

484
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Now thank gobs and phylo drummonds perseverance.

485
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,380
All will be set right.

486
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,740
We will be sending out podcasts and an occasional odd cast.

487
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,220
Thanks to Reverend Stang's explicit instructions.

488
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,400
Oh, he left them written in the old book.

489
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,520
You know, we're not even finished with them yet.

490
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,620
How we're only on page two.

491
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,340
The secret of life and death.

492
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,200
By Henry Frankenstein here.

493
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,560
He tells how to do it.

494
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,940
Otherwise known as how I did it.

495
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,140
And it's rather simple.

496
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,940
Easy to follow.

497
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,760
It's like a cookbook.

498
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,140
We've got a lot more happening here at X Day 21.

499
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,280
Tomorrow is the assembly on the landing field itself.

500
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,820
Now the question is.

501
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,160
Now I know what.

502
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,740
What's that?

503
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,700
The question is where is the landing field this year?

504
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,480
Is it out here in front of Cofina's?

505
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,180
Or do we go all the way down to.

506
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,040
Old Sequaw's Turtle Mound and stand around out there.

507
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:48,540
We hike down the road in the early morning when the smoky dews are still rising.

508
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,120
You go down the road and you go off a little to the left.

509
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,680
This is on the way to the pond that one would normally go this way.

510
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,500
Only you don't go to the pond.

511
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
You stop at the field.

512
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,320
That's the way we've always done it.

513
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,620
Except.

514
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,740
When.

515
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,160
Stang shot that.

516
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,700
Drone.

517
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,080
Movie.

518
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,800
Right here outside of Cofina's.

519
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,640
Now perhaps by doing so.

520
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,300
He created a new.

521
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,500
Tradition.

522
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,700
And now we have to meet out here outside of Cofina's instead of at the.

523
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,840
So called landing field.

524
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,560
I don't know.

525
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,320
I'm asking.

526
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,980
I'm proposing.

527
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,460
I'm inquiring out of genuine curiosity.

528
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,580
All right.

529
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,400
We'll meet on the field.

530
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:29,960
That's always.

531
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,360
You know, somebody would always be there.

532
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,720
Anyway.

533
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,580
Someone would traditionalist would go there wherever we Johnny come lately.

534
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,220
Decided.

535
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,620
That we didn't want to have it.

536
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,220
So there it'll be.

537
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,560
I have to make our way all the way out there at 7 freaking o'clock.

538
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,160
A.m.

539
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
To the pond.

540
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,720
No to the to the field.

541
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,500
Yes.

542
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,280
The landing field.

543
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,600
No, it's not at the pond.

544
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,560
The baptism will be at the pond.

545
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
Now if you want.

546
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,880
Good.

547
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,440
Unmoving.

548
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,820
Unflinching description.

549
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,140
Of everything.

550
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,920
That's going to happen.

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
It's there in the brochure.

552
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,040
We're just going to follow that.

553
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,620
What time this that and the other happen.

554
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,800
I didn't get a brochure there.

555
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,200
Dr.

556
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,540
How well I'm sure there will be one given to you and you should go and get one from Princess Lee.

557
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,100
She would love to give you a brochure and I would love for you're going to need a brochure.

558
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,140
Now the brochure.

559
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,180
It was highly detailed instructions.

560
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,760
You know everything.

561
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,700
Is she is the.

562
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,400
Yes, kind of a pamphlet.

563
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,700
Well every year we have these brochures as we call them and inside.

564
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,960
Well, it's the wisdom of the ages Jack.

565
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,640
It tells you.

566
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,780
Yes.

567
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,000
A lot of money worth a lot of money on eBay.

568
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,480
Please forgive me.

569
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,940
Let me go.

570
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,720
Thank you for the pamphlet.

571
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,120
The flamphlet.

572
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,540
I hope you enjoy this scientific educational and instructive pamphlet.

573
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,800
I just got a new eyeball.

574
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,060
I'm supposed to be able to read now.

575
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,400
Another high ball and she's got an eyeball.

576
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,040
Audio recordings to a hard drive.

577
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,440
You speak or my laptop.

578
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,100
You never know what that little recorder is going to get lost or stolen or left in the rain.

579
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,080
The recordings will be lost and not backed up.

580
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,820
Once I thought I don't know how to do it.

581
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,060
I would have to do it.

582
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,460
I would have to do it.

583
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,560
Let it wrap.

584
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,520
I didn't do high.

585
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,220
Cogglera.

586
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,020
Me speed.

587
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,240
Read.

588
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,580
Snaps.

589
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,060
Norum.

590
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,300
Cut out his abdomen.

591
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,600
Or.

592
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,520
I will do that.

593
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,840
But now.

594
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,100
After that.

595
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,740
I will do that.

596
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,360
But I will do that.

597
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,460
But I will do that.

598
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,080
Now you see Dr.

599
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,780
Drummond.

600
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,620
And furthermore.

601
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,600
Those will do another.

602
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,460
Now looming.

603
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,000
And imminence of the alien landing is depriving him temporarily of his ordinary three-dimensional

604
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,140
realism and reason.

605
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,920
Now he's thinking multi-dimensionally.

606
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,400
If we could only understand.

607
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,660
What a revelation folks.

608
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,560
Okay.

609
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,320
I'm going to tell.

610
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm going to send a text to Reverend Stang.

611
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,720
Telling him that we have got the sound going.

612
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,640
We haven't done the video yet.

613
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,400
Well, this is a start.

614
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,040
Like one flickering candle flame.

615
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,560
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

616
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,560
Yes, we shall begin.

617
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,920
And on the basis of those service.

618
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,240
If they should ask a thousand years.

619
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,600
What was the finest hour of the old X-Day convocation?

620
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,040
They should say it was this.

621
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,000
X-Day 21.

622
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:45,800
When staying was unable to attend his own party like Moses unable to enter the promised

623
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:54,300
land because of his appropriation of the divine power which animated him to bring water out

624
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,900
of the rock for the troublesome quarrelsome children of Israel.

625
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,460
And so it was just as in the old days as told by the old man in the boat.

626
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,520
By the wine dark sea.

627
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,020
Wadi doodah.

628
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:18,180
No, it strikes me that there's an interesting anecdote that encapsulates this whole thing.

629
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:25,820
But mainly it's that no one never expects what cards when it's going to be dealt.

630
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,000
But what if one is developed a bum hand?

631
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,160
This is phenomenon.

632
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,220
We've often discussed.

633
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,700
We say.

634
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,200
Surf the luck plane.

635
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,560
Be like Bob.

636
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,840
Bob always serves the luck plane.

637
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,340
Be an art bomb.

638
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,520
You don't have to work.

639
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,380
You can surf the luck plane.

640
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,280
But one thing we will also say is that when you're surfing, you're going to wipe out every on there.

641
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,020
I'm like, Bob.

642
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Bob won't wipe out.

643
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,560
But you will definitely be this thing's crunching man.

644
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,120
It's peaking.

645
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,080
It's scrunched along really like going nuts ground along the shingle.

646
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,080
Once I start peaking, you know, it's all downhill after that.

647
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,940
It's all held by large crabs now held under by tons of water.

648
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,880
All of it.

649
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,240
Hey, are you peeking yet?

650
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,920
Yeah.

651
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,600
Well, anyway, this will happen.

652
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,680
But the thing to do is get back up on your board and put on your Bob like so.

653
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,560
Or as Lola Montez said courage and shuffle the cards.

654
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,140
Courage.

655
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,500
Yes.

656
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,800
So you got a bad hand.

657
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
So shuffle them again.

658
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,720
How's courage?

659
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,380
You can shuffle your way.

660
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,020
Out of that one.

661
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,680
Of course, it didn't help Lola that much in her later years.

662
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:51,060
But in her early years, he was the toast of four continents and famous for stripping naked in front of the Mad King of Bavaria Ludwig.

663
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,600
A lot of things.

664
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
He did were remarkable for her time.

665
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,080
She gained titles of nobility and maybe.

666
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,960
She was also viewed as a proto subgenius of which there are many.

667
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,740
There are proto subgenius and we've run programs about like Basil Wolverton.

668
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,940
Is there anybody would say Basil Wolverton was not a proto subgenius?

669
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,460
I say that all the time.

670
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,800
You say he was not.

671
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,840
I say a lot of things.

672
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:33,600
He of course, he was nominally supposedly some sort of fundamentalist Christian, but even that couldn't contain.

673
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,180
The original weirdness and bizarreness of his ideas.

674
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,640
Did he name himself Basil?

675
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,360
Yes, his name was Basil Wolverton and he lived way out in the hinterlands.

676
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,600
So when they wanted a horror comic, he would draw the whole thing and sent it in.

677
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,720
So it his style was not smoothed over into the house style.

678
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,520
It always looked like his own bizarre artwork.

679
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,080
My God.

680
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,380
He's got a lot of

681
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:21,480
his illustrations of the Bible.

682
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,380
They've been printed.

683
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:29,680
I think by Fantagraphics, but he drew a series which allegedly illustrate the book of Revelation.

684
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,420
People actually would and they show a horrible nuclear war.

685
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,440
I don't have my pants down like that.

686
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,100
People burned and starving and bodies piling up and the end of the world.

687
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,120
I like mine way up high.

688
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,580
Extraordinary vividness.

689
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,000
Way up high where you know your package is right there.

690
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,320
With his usual cartoony vigor and thick line.

691
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,140
You know what I'm saying?

692
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm just, you know, I'm just being real.

693
00:33:51,360 --> 00:34:01,600
Other times he drew grotesque faces and goofy cartoons with oddball shapes, faces and bodies.

694
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,580
But he was a realist.

695
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:03,580


696
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:24,180
The sad thing, of course, is that these shadowy beings are not only the figments of imagination of cartoonists attempting to find a way out of their own personal predicament, but an actual reflection of the mysterious malignancy of the cosmos.

697
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
For example, everybody.

698
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,380
Are you talking about?

699
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,420
Are you?

700
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,400
What are you talking about?

701
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,300
Well, it's going to mysterious malignancy of the cosmos.

702
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,060
Well, I was going to segue to.

703
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,400
Talk about the guest list for X-Day.

704
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,240
Oh, okay.

705
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,980
Yeah, segue to that.

706
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,580
That's the malignancy.

707
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:45,440
You know the woman I'm talking about or the women, the two-headed woman, the two-headed girl who has been around for a long time.

708
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,240
When she was a baby, she was on Oprah.

709
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,680
Later on, Time Magazine published a diagram.

710
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,220
I remember her.

711
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,200
A cutaway of her, of how everything works.

712
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,320
Well, recently this other child has come to life.

713
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,640
And this is.

714
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,980
A one-headed, two-bodied child.

715
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,200
That is, the one head has two bodies which issue from it.

716
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,460
And the loving parents are raising them up.

717
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,780
This was profiled in the New York Times Magazine with a cover story.

718
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,000
A strange misshapen head with its many eyes and two mouths.

719
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,760
But the children are laughing.

720
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,980
They seem to be having a good time as they crawl.

721
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,200
Like some eight-legged being around.

722
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,200
Now, they have this.

723
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,540
They have this worked out.

724
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,380
Their locomotion is all worked out.

725
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,940
With the two-headed girl, one interesting thing is the left head controls the left side of the body and the right head the right side of the body.

726
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,480
So when they take a step, the left and right have to be in coordination.

727
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,380
And they are.

728
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,960
It doesn't bother them a bit.

729
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,580
They run around, you know, naturally.

730
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,780
Even though each head.

731
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,280
Each head is contributing to the nervous impulse.

732
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:11,800
The body of the two-headed teenage girl, who by now must be at least a college-age girl, or perhaps married, or maybe even married and divorced.

733
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,740
I think she dropped out.

734
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:23,820
Is large because the upper body of the girl contains two spines, two hearts, four lungs, and two tracheas.

735
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,240
All descending into one digestive system and one reproductive system.

736
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,560
In the part of her body which is below the waist.

737
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,140
Her shoulders have a great width because of all this extra equipment which nature has put in there.

738
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm so lucky that she gets to carry it with her wherever she goes.

739
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,480
I have to keep mine in a box.

740
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,460
Well, she's more lucky than this one-headed, two-bodied kid who was in the Times.

741
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,780
I haven't read the article yet.

742
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,500
I have it.

743
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,640
But I just haven't got around to reading it.

744
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,400
But I skimmed it.

745
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,620
And they put her picture on the cover of the Times.

746
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:07,320
The cover of the Times Sunday magazine had this one-headed, two-bodied kid.

747
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,520
Two bodies?

748
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,140
Yes.

749
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,640
Wow, that's got to be confusing.

750
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,460
The big head and then the bodies.

751
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,220
Yes.

752
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,780
Especially if you were going to say you were going to fight.

753
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,420
They crawl around in coordination with all their limbs are coordinated.

754
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,360
It might be really good if you could get them all going and coordinated.

755
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,900
They do.

756
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,020
Now, just as in the case of the two-headed girl whose name I don't know.

757
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,740
And maybe they've been keeping the name more or less clandestine.

758
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,740
She has many names.

759
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,380
In the case of two-headed beings, one head always dominates.

760
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,260
The other head is always the weaker.

761
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,960
Otherwise, there's an impasse.

762
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:49,560
Did you ever see that movie, Basket Case, where a guy had two heads and cut one of them off and it lived in a basket?

763
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
Well, yes.

764
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,900
That was a classic, you know.

765
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,920
There was a human separation.

766
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,000
But, of course, there was also the human.

767
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,080
The thing with two heads.

768
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,780
If you remember, Ray Moland and Rosie Greer.

769
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,920
An unfortunate operation.

770
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,740
And then the incredible two-headed transplant.

771
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:16,640
In addition, other movies which have featured the perfusion or separation but in continuing animation of a human head are The Head.

772
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:24,060
A very unusual German movie with surprising nudity and bizzare in it that I recommend.

773
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,660
And, of course, everybody knows.

774
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,740
The Brain That Wouldn't Die.

775
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,160
Also called The Head That Wouldn't Die.

776
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
And it doesn't.

777
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,280
Until the end.

778
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,500
Yes, in a terrible fire.

779
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,540
But she cackles maniacally.

780
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,780
Not being desirous of the gift of life.

781
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,000
But, you know the situation there.

782
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,720
The guy is saving the head and he's meanwhile going out and casing the script clubs for script strippers.

783
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,820
And he wants to find one with a good enough body.

784
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,580
To lure her home and transplant the head of his sweetheart onto her.

785
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,380
And he does take some women back and drug them.

786
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,820
But things never work out as they are supposed to.

787
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:16,380
But in The Head, not only is the stripper's body taken and the severed head of the girl put on it.

788
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,720
But it's a perfect combination.

789
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,320
And the girl is great.

790
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,440
And she feels great.

791
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,420
And everything is fine.

792
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,560
And there is no ridiculous punishment written into the script.

793
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,080
Another reason that movie is totally bizarre.

794
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
It's unfortunate.

795
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,640
This other woman had to die.

796
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,120
But at least I've got a body back.

797
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,440
And it looks pretty good too.

798
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,420
In The Head.

799
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,280
When I was a tot.

800
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,180
A toddler.

801
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,940
A child.

802
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,220
Maybe not a child.

803
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:44,840
Well, longer.

804
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,860
Older than a child.

805
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,920
A preteen.

806
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,720
A tween.

807
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,060
I saw in Famous Monsters of Filmland.

808
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,940
A picture of The Head.

809
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,440
From the movie of the same name.

810
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,240
This was the head of the German actor Michael Oud.

811
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,760
Who had been a pioneer in perfusion.

812
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,420
In removing heads of animals and people.

813
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,920
And keeping them alive.

814
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,780
It's all based upon Russian research.

815
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,360
And the original article which is called The Perfusion of a Living Head.

816
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,840
Starting with the heads of dogs and other experimental animals.

817
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,720
But then according to the folklore and legend.

818
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,160
Actually performed in secret.

819
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,760
The attempt to prolong a life.

820
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,840
By providing a blood supply.

821
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,260
And frame.

822
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
And cellular nutrient.

823
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,320
And other things.

824
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,620
To keep a head perfused.

825
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,720
Which is to say.

826
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,260
Continuing to go.

827
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,880
Even though not supported by its parent body.

828
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,840
Others have said.

829
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,840
Some of these people suffered.

830
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,600
Death.

831
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,280
When the head decayed in the ordinary way.

832
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,460
Despite the unnatural activity.

833
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,360
Provided it by the mechanism.

834
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,640
What are the other experimental animals?

835
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,620
I didn't know dogs were experimental.

836
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,480
Well they are in Russia.

837
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,140
They were when they sent Laika into space.

838
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,880
First the Ruskies sent Sputnik.

839
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,700
Then they sent Mutnik.

840
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,520
They sent a dog up there.

841
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,400
And not just one.

842
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,640
Various dogs.

843
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,660
But we sent dogs.

844
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,780
And we sent monkeys.

845
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,340
Up.

846
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,900
And not all of them made it back.

847
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,620
To tell the truth.

848
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,720
Some are still orbiting the earth.

849
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,420
Frozen dog sickles.

850
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,580
And monkey cubes.

851
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,300
They could show up tomorrow.

852
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,120
They could fall back down into the atmosphere.

853
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,400
Probably will eventually.

854
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,580
Their orbits will decay.

855
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,620
Let's hope ours will not decay.

856
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,000
Our planet's orbit.

857
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,340
We don't want it to decay.

858
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,060
They went to space and decayed.

859
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,980
So we wouldn't have to?

860
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,280
Well they.

861
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,160
Are all following that.

862
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,460
Newtonian mechanics.

863
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,300
When something is in orbit.

864
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,740
It is constantly falling.

865
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,140
Toward the parent body.

866
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,020
But because of the mechanics.

867
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,720
The parent body is not there.

868
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,660
When they would strike it.

869
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,960
But eventually they probably will strike it.

870
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,080
As the orbit decayed.

871
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,840
And we are told.

872
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,540
To believe.

873
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,260
A false picture.

874
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,300
That we have a solar system.

875
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,500
With a sun in the middle.

876
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,040
And planets going around.

877
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,120
And around that.

878
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,840
In circles or ovals.

879
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,460
This is quite wrong.

880
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,460
Because.

881
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,660
Let's remember here.

882
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,720
Our central star.

883
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,660
The sun.

884
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,460
And a remarkably steady star it is too.

885
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,400
Is also in motion.

886
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,680
And trucking along.

887
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,240
At a great rate of speed.

888
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,180
Throughout our portion of the galaxy.

889
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,260
Which it circles.

890
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,340
Once every 325 million years.

891
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,780
I believe.

892
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,020
Now.

893
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,480
As the sun.

894
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,580
Chugs along.

895
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,440
The planets.

896
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,920
Are essentially describing.

897
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,660
A spiral.

898
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,500
As they.

899
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,900
Circle.

900
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,600
Just the way everything here.

901
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,520
When you break it down.

902
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,240
Is a spiral.

903
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,040
A spiral of DNA.

904
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,700
The spiral of extended.

905
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,300
Molecular structures.

906
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,880
Where because of the constant infusion.

907
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,920
Of energy.

908
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,560
The usual.

909
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,660
Entropic rules.

910
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,320
Are not.

911
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,200
Enforced.

912
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,240
That's right.

913
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,360
It's supposed to run down.

914
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,660
But it's not going to.

915
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,620
As long as.

916
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,100
We are getting.

917
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,240
Princess Wei.

918
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
Please come to the main.

919
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,460
Mane.

920
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,460


921
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,460


922
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,460


923
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,460


924
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,860
Stage.

925
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,580
And that's what we need.

926
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,460
Not the main.

927
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:23,740
Stage.

928
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,120
The main.

929
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,900
Stage in here.

930
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,800
On this.

931
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:25,980
Main.

932
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,860
Stage over here.

933
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,800
This planet.

934
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,420
This bleeding earth.

935
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,580
That we are about to lose.

936
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,020
To the.

937
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,480
Exist.

938
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,180
Invasion.

939
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,780
This earth.

940
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,380
Of ours.

941
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,140
This island.

942
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,500
Earth.

943
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,200
Has been.

944
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,940
An ideal.

945
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,820
Place for life.

946
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,200
And it can't take all the credit.

947
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,620
Because.

948
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,760
Our sun.

949
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,660
Is unusually.

950
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,160
Steady.

951
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,120
And does not suddenly.

952
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,060
Get hot.

953
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:50,760
Or expand.

954
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,360
Or send.

955
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:51,960
Sleeting.

956
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,680
Radiation.

957
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,580
To some degrees.

958
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,040
It does.

959
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,600
But not in such a way.

960
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,620
That would hurt.

961
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,520
And then all sorts of.

962
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:58,960
Junk.

963
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,780
All sorts of.

964
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,180
Crap.

965
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:00,900
Comes.

966
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,360
At us all the time.

967
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,480
And the sun.

968
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,280
Is charging.

969
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,820
Along.

970
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,280
And the sun.

971
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,940
Can take us.

972
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,520
Into a bad.

973
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,120
Neighborhood.

974
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,320
Full of.

975
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:09,860
Space.

976
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,700
Junk.

977
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,240
Which.

978
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,900
Threatens.

979
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,080
Our planet.

980
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,700
But does it reach us?

981
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,040
Usually it doesn't.

982
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,420
Because.

983
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:20,580
We have.

984
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,080
Huge gas.

985
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:21,920
Giants.

986
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,240
We have.

987
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,620
Jupiter.

988
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,560
Pulling.

989
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,060
That stuff.

990
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,560
Away.

991
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,780
And it doesn't.

992
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,200
Bother.

993
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,760
Our.

994
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,160
Small.

995
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:27,780
Rocky.

996
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,360
World.

997
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,480
Because of this enormous.

998
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,660
Gravitational.

999
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,060
Well.

1000
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:31,840
Back.

1001
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,920
In our.

1002
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,060
Area.

1003
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,300
Our.

1004
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:35,780
What do you say.

1005
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,080
Our.

1006
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:36,620
You mean.

1007
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,080
Us.

1008
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,460
Like.

1009
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:37,780
I mean.

1010
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,200
The humans.

1011
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:38,900
On earth.

1012
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,320
Me and you.

1013
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:50,580
I mean.

1014
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:50,580


1015
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:50,860
Has been.

1016
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,400
Steady.

1017
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,200
But the sun.

1018
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,580
Could.

1019
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,340
Of course.

1020
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,100
Flare up.

1021
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,560
And the sun.

1022
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:54,860
Will.

1023
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,360
Just.

1024
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:55,840
When it.

1025
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,480
Exhausts.

1026
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:56,660
Its.

1027
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,160
Nuclear.

1028
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,220
Furnace.

1029
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,840
Will.

1030
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,620
Expand.

1031
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,400
To a large.

1032
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:00,920
Size.

1033
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,580
A size.

1034
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:01,840
Which.

1035
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,320
Actually.

1036
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,120
Includes.

1037
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,480
The.

1038
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,040
Orbits.

1039
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,460
Of the.

1040
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,220
Planets.

1041
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,460
Of the.

1042
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:05,600
Inner.

1043
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,200
System.

1044
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,320
Including.

1045
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:07,860
The earth.

1046
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:08,900
Mercury.

1047
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:09,780
Venus.

1048
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,360
Earth.

1049
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,000
And.

1050
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,580
Mars.

1051
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,320
Will be.

1052
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,860
Absorbed.

1053
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,380
Into.

1054
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,480
The solar.

1055
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:14,840
Disc.

1056
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:15,580
This is.

1057
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:15,820
Before.

1058
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,040
It.

1059
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,380
Shrinks.

1060
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:16,680
But.

1061
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,100
Still.

1062
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,420
The.

1063
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,420
Procedure.

1064
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,700
Will.

1065
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:18,900
Be.

1066
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,340
Difficult.

1067
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,160
Another.

1068
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,540
Thing.

1069
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:20,820
That's.

1070
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,120
Kept.

1071
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,260
Us.

1072
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:21,600
Going.

1073
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,060
For.

1074
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,300
So.

1075
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,580
Long.

1076
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,020
Besides.

1077
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,420
Our.

1078
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:23,880
Steady.

1079
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,300
States.

1080
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:24,920
Sun.

1081
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:25,600
And.

1082
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:25,700
You.

1083
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:25,820
Know.

1084
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:25,960
All.

1085
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,180
The.

1086
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,620
Suns.

1087
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:26,720
In.

1088
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:26,900
The.

1089
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,260
Galaxy.

1090
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,640
Don't.

1091
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:27,840
Act.

1092
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,140
Like.

1093
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,340
That.

1094
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,560
Some.

1095
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:28,740
Of.

1096
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:28,880
Them.

1097
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,400
Flare.

1098
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,140
Become.

1099
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:30,880
Protos.

1100
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:30,920
And.

1102
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,300
Suns.

1103
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:31,760
Sink.

1104
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:32,820
Do.

1105
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,040
All.

1106
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,240
Sorts.

1107
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,380
Of.

1108
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,540
Things.

1109
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,840
We.

1110
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,180
Also.

1111
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:35,520
Have.

1112
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,660
A.

1113
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,200
Giant.

1114
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:37,860
Large.

1115
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,700
Moon.

1116
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:39,500
Larger.

1117
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:39,620
In.

1118
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,040
Proportion.

1119
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,280
Than.

1120
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:40,540
Any.

1121
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,740
Other.

1122
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:41,620
Planet.

1123
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,360
I.

1124
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:42,560
Will.

1125
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:42,860
Not.

1126
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,280
Include.

1127
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,180
Pluto.

1128
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,000
Because.

1129
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,300
Pluto.

1130
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:45,960
Is.

1131
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:46,780
Considered.

1132
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:46,880
A.

1133
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,180
Dwarf.

1134
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,480
Planet.

1135
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,120
And.

1136
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,300
Some.

1137
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:48,920
Considered.

1138
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,340
Cheron.

1139
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,200
Pluto's.

1140
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,460
Giant.

1141
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,840
Moon.

1142
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,300
To.

1143
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,580
Be.

1144
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,180
Part.

1145
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,480
Of.

1146
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:52,660
A.

1147
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,080
Binary.

1148
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,860
System.

1149
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,260
That.

1150
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,520
These.

1151
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:54,740
Two.

1152
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,220
Things.

1153
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:55,480
Are.

1154
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:56,820
Locked.

1155
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,000
In.

1156
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,240
This.

1157
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,400
Day.

1158
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:57,720
And.

1159
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,360
We.

1160
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,020
Have.

1161
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,400
A.

1162
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:01,620


1163
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,100
Moon.

1164
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:02,660
And.

1165
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:02,820
That.

1166
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,140
Means.

1167
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:03,880
It's.

1168
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,320
Constantly.

1169
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:04,960
Pulling.

1170
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,120
On.

1171
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:05,260
The.

1172
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:05,580
Waters.

1173
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:05,780
Of.

1174
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:05,900
The.

1175
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,160
World.

1176
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,380
And.

1177
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:06,560
It's.

1178
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:06,680
Not.

1179
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:06,820
A.

1180
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:06,960
Big.

1181
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:10,840
Plastic.

1182
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,260
Out.

1183
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,400
Of.

1184
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:11,480
The.

1185
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:11,860
Ocean.

1186
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:12,960
Plastic.

1187
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,380
And.

1188
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:13,540
We.

1189
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:13,780
Put.

1190
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:13,960
It.

1191
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,040
In.

1192
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,160
A.

1193
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:14,320
Big.

1194
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:14,660
Space.

1195
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,080
Ship.

1196
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,240
And.

1197
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:16,460
We.

1198
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:16,700
Shot.

1199
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,040
It.

1200
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,140
On.

1201
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:17,360
To.

1202
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:17,520
The.

1203
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:17,780
Moon.

1204
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:18,220
Well.

1205
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,460
You.

1206
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:18,580
Could.

1207
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:18,700
Do.

1208
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:18,880
That.

1209
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,100
Now.

1210
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,260
The.

1211
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:19,460
Moon.

1212
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:19,760
Is.

1213
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,000
Covered.

1214
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,220
In.

1215
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:20,360
The.

1216
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:20,900
Moon.

1217
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,280
So.

1218
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,660
You.

1219
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:24,360
Can.

1220
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,960
Get.

1221
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,040
Out.

1222
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,460
Of.

1223
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:30,600
The.

1224
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,940
World.

1225
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:31,940


1226
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:31,940


1227
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,000
And.

1228
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,780
The.

1229
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,360
World.

1230
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,300
Is.

1231
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:36,360
Not.

1232
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,660
A.

1233
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,760
Plastic.

1234
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,020
Of.

1235
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,720
The.

1236
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,080
World.

1237
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,120
Of.

1238
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,000
Plastic.

1239
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,000


1240
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,400
Of.

1241
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:48,760
The.

1242
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,440
World.

1243
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:49,980
Of.

1244
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,180
Plastic.

1245
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,280
Of.

1246
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:01,880
The.

1247
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,920
World.

1248
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:06,920


1249
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:07,960
None.

1250
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,240
Of.

1251
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,500
The.

1252
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,000
World.

1253
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,340
Is.

1254
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:10,340


1255
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:10,940
A.

1256
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:12,720
Plastic.

1257
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:13,920
Of.

1258
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:15,640
The.

1259
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:15,860
World.

1260
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,140
Is.

1261
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,160


1262
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,480
But.

1263
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,480


1264
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,480


1265
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,540
A.

1266
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,640
All.

1267
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,000
Matter.

1268
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,000


1269
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,000


1270
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,000


1271
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,160
And.

1272
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,160


1273
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,160


1274
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,720
in warfare, they're going to compete one way or the other.

1275
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,220
Yes, if only they'd listened to we subgeniuses,

1276
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,320
they would now be living in a veritable paradise

1277
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,120
where the deer and the antelope play.

1278
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,260
And seldom is heard a discouraging word

1279
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,400
because what can an antelope say?

1280
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,720
People would have time to walk in wearing long robes

1281
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,500
that apparently were laundered every other week

1282
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,420
and discuss philosophy.

1283
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:54,040
The meaning of life and other Monty Python classics.

1284
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,140
Dr. Drummond and Dr. Howell are such pros.

1285
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,920
After 40 years of doing broadcast radio,

1286
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,040
broadcast, mind you,

1287
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,820
they didn't use offensive language once in this whole recording.

1288
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,220
What fabulous instincts.

1289
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,800
So noble.

1290
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,360
So thanks to them, I was able to get this show out

1291
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,980
before the week was out, unlike last episode.

1292
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,800
I've had an unusual month.

1293
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,840
Death in the family.

1294
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,580
Death and a half, you could say.

1295
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,000
And I'm a little shell-shocked

1296
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,160
and feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.

1297
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,760
Speaking of which, there happens to be, naturally,

1298
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,400
a rainmaker.

1299
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,860
A rainmaker, generally.

1300
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:48,860


1301
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,540
that absolutely hits the nail on the head

1302
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,880
regarding this Twilight Zone feeling.

1303
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,840
It's from the album SKIN

1304
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,520
and it's called A Million Miles Away.

1305
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,400
Like more TikTok and altre fish slack stalks

1306
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,400


1307
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,400


1308
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,720
There was a man named Jim who walked everywhere he went

1309
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,020
Cause he could never quite seem to keep his mind on the road

1310
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,060
One day it occurred to Jim that he'd taken a wrong turn

1311
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,500
Cause he was standing in a place he didn't know

1312
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,000
Jim spun on his heels thinking he'd backtrack for a while

1313
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,100
But before he knew it, the sun was sinking

1314
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,720
And the landscape in the dark, well it could have been New Zealand

1315
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,860
Or New York or New Mexico

1316
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,280
So what else is new, Jim was thinking

1317
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,120
Cause see for a while now, Jim felt like things were changing for him

1318
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,520
Like the skin of the earth was stretching or the continents were adrift

1319
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,760
Jim didn't know if it was so or if it was just him

1320
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,440
Although he suspected it was a bit of both he was dealing with

1321
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,080
And he was thinking, well, I don't know

1322
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,080


1323
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,400
And I feel like I'm tripping

1324
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,280
And I feel my steps slipping today

1325
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,420
Feel the winds of time whipping my coat around my legs

1326
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:37,640
And I feel about a million miles away

1327
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,200
guitar solo

1328
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,020
Dawn broke

1329
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,080
Jim awoke

1330
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,940
He'd been sleeping on his feet

1331
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,040
It was morning now

1332
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,000
But a densely foggy day

1333
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,340
Jim decided he'd just sit

1334
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,420
And wait for the fog to lift

1335
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,240
But when it didn't

1336
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,980
It started up again anyway

1337
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,980
Man, this is like the blind leading the blind

1338
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,780
Jim thought

1339
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,180
About that time

1340
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,820
Down the road came this C&I dog

1341
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,800
It was well fed

1342
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,980
And had a collar

1343
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,000
But no matter how loud Jim hollered

1344
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,520
There wasn't any answer

1345
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,980
So he walked on through the fog

1346
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,540
All right, I'm lost

1347
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,560
Jim said aloud

1348
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,320
Although a bit begrudgingly

1349
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,040
Like things might change

1350
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,680
In light of this confession

1351
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,740
He was both amazed and sour

1352
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,600
That at this late date and hour

1353
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,320
He might find himself in this situation

1354
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,600
And I feel like I'm tripping

1355
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,080
And I feel like I'm tripping

1356
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,080


1357
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,400
I feel my steps slipping today

1358
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,160
Feel the winds of time

1359
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,620
Whipping my coat around my legs

1360
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:01,740
And I feel about a million miles away

1361
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,660
A million miles

1362
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,540
A million miles

1363
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,500
A million miles

1364
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,060
I feel about a million miles away

1365
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,480
A million miles away

1366
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,900
After walking through the haze

1367
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,180
For another night and another day

1368
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,420
Jim seemed to simply cease to exist

1369
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,100
All his panic, hope and thoughts

1370
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,960
Broke up into small dots

1371
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,520
As he gave himself away into the mist

1372
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,160
Back in the town where Jim lived

1373
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Sad to say he was never missed

1374
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,580
And his name was never spoken again

1375
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,180
It's awful, the truth

1376
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,820
Out my window at night

1377
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,540
I think I see Jim standing in the half light

1378
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,320
Saying hurry up

1379
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,480
Suffering's got a job to do

1380
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,360
And I feel like I'm tripping

1381
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,060
And I feel my steps slipping today

1382
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,060


1383
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,060


1384
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,800
Feel the winds of time

1385
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,320
Whipping my coat around my legs

1386
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:30,480
And I feel about a million miles away

1387
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,400
A million miles

1388
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,220
A million miles

1389
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:48,060
I feel about a million miles away

1390
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,060


1391
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,060


1392
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,800
A million miles

1393
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,640
A million miles

1394
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,500
A million miles

1395
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:07,500
I feel about a million miles away

1396
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,320
A million miles

1397
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,800
I feel about a million miles away

1398
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,000
derivate the purest of all

1399
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,320
And if you're if you're if you're

1400

00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,820

00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:39,820

1413
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,060
Because all the more we're here than ever to say, man!

1414
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,220
listening to Tarzan's radio station here at X Day 21.

1415
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,700
And we have some top flight radio personalities here.

1416
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,820
What about this awesome music and this background music?

1417
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,960
Isn't it just...

1418
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,680
Yes, those are awesome bells in the background.

1419
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,000
It's grooving.

1420
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,240
Look, people are out there nodding their heads.

1421
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,320
Well, you see, they are understanding.

1422
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,960
The grooviness is just overwhelming.

1423
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,860
They're taking over everything.

1424
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:21,840
Everything, so much it is of what everybody wants

1425
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,680
and where everybody wants to be.

1426
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:30,220
What is that primary motivator in the affairs of human beings?

1427
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,460
We've had many analyses over the years,

1428
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,140
and many of them saying which would be considered

1429
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,920
in the case of reversion to an infantile state.

1430
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,580
This is the Freudian one.

1431
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:49,700
It's all about, you know, the pleasures of the mouth

1432
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:54,760
and the anus of possession of the infantile thing.

1433
00:55:55,860 --> 00:56:03,900
But, of course, even stronger than the sexual aspect of being a motivator,

1434
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,380
there is another one which is scarcely mentioned often enough.

1435
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,100
The desire for what has been called,

1436
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,320
the inner ring.

1437
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,420
The idea that nothing is more important

1438
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,660
than getting into that inner ring of people

1439
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,820
who really know the way things are

1440
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,160
and being a member of that crowd

1441
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,380
better than anybody else

1442
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,340
because you're a member of the inner ring

1443
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,060
and it's worth anything to get in there.

1444
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,620
Whatever you do to anybody else,

1445
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,020
to people you're supposed to love,

1446
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,220
still, if you're in the inner ring,

1447
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,240
you're where you want.

1448
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,560
And this is a strong motivator

1449
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,640
which has been a large part of human history

1450
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,000
on our Teraqueous globe

1451
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,900
right up till now.

1452
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,120
So, I'm going to see if I can find a place

1453
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,780
I can text Reverend Stang

1454
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,240
and let him know that we actually did get

1455
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,180
Tarzan's radio station working.

1456
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,260
I like that, Philo,

1457
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,560
but, of course, we made such an experimental attempt before

1458
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,180
and it seems you can't get out of this benighted area

1459
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:14,980
really easy.

1460
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,660
But I'm not going to try to discourage you.

1461
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,540
Please do go ahead.

1462
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,320
Never say never.

1463
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,760
So, about this inner circle,

1464
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,080
I heard that there was a way to purchase membership

1465
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,400
into an inner circle of some sort

1466
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,900
that might give me access to such wonders

1467
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,560
as a plastic-coated moon.

1468
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,860
Well, you could, of course, form your own...

1469
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,800
I'm telling you, that's the start of it.

1470
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,660
You put the trash up there.

1471
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,940
All this trash is just wasted.

1472
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:44,840
And the ocean...

1473
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,240
Accumulates.

1474
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,180
You can pick it up and send it to the moon.

1475
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:47,700
Status?

1476
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,400
We could coat the moon in a complete plastic coating.

1477
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,100
It would work as well for that as anything else.

1478
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,680
A moon doesn't need a plastic coating, though.

1479
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,080
It does have helium-3.

1480
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,900
And they're going up to try to dig up some water.

1481
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,120
A new expedition they've got going

1482
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,160
to dig up the water from the lunar region.

1483
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:14,580
And it's called the Eucalyptus Eucalyptus.

1484
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,600
And that can happen.

1485
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,620
Why would we want to take water from the moon

1486
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,920
when we could be getting just the finest cheeses?

1487
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,300
Also, aren't we busy mining diamonds off of comets or something?

1488
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,460
No, not quite yet.

1489
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,500
But it might happen.

1490
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,820
We landed on a comet.

1491
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,840
But the thing about the water,

1492
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,880
if it's up there, you don't have to carry it up from here.

1493
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,480
And weight is very important.

1494
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,080
And if it's up there, you can make all sorts of things out of it, including...

1495
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:48,140
fuel and air and all sorts of things.

1496
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,080
Small fountains for your topiary garden.

1497
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah, all sorts of things that you need there in Looneyville,

1498
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,980
where Donald Trump's black uniformed space force

1499
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:06,100
have their major headquarters in the giant dome.

1500
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,120
From NPR News in Washington,

1501
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,900
I'm up against another round of global racial injustice.

1502
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,160
Authorities say they still don't know

1503
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,840
what caused massive tax increases.

1504
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,580
Authorities say the tax policy is unconstitutional.

1505
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,460
Quote, it is about time.

1506
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,080
The Dow is 18.

1507
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,880
Authorities say this is PR News.

1508
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:32,580
Thank you, Leimer, Filo, Hal, Anna, Maul, Cool Hand Chris,

1509
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,900
the Rudy Schwartz Project, the Rainmakers, and everybody else.

1510
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,740
More on the Church of the Sub.

1511
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,160
More on at subgenius.com.
