you something the world is tired of dead preaching preachers dead preachers preaching dead sermons to
dead congregations they're tired of cold services and cold churches this world is hungry for reality
they've had enough of hollywood they've had enough of nashville they've had enough of show business
and now
welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes
with your dear dear host and prayer partner reverend ivan stang
presented to you by the church of the subgenius in the name of jr
don't
here i am placing ads in my one bedroom apartment making more money than i ever dreamed of and my
friend bob calls me up and says don get a 900 line you won't believe how much money you can make
so i call bob up and i say bob i'm too busy placing ads don't bug me
you
well he kept calling and calling and finally just to be a nice guy i told him okay also i thought it
was a mistake but it wasn't i was making so much money i thought i died and i went to heaven
well bob has joined us today he is the specialist that got don involved in the 900 number business
bob last year we talked and you were right so i did two things i paid for an 800 number
to go directly to bob's office anybody who orders the making money package can call bob for free 900
concession money and he'll pay for it for sure so i'm going to tell you what i'm doing right now
Will there ever be a second coming, Bob?
Is that a prophecy?
A second, a third.
Well, it would be the third now.
Actually, we're up to it being about the fifth or sixth.
He does come multiple.
His current life, he's been kicking since 85 now, right?
Bob can maintain a multiple orgasm state for quite a long time, can't he?
Without the use of a ring.
That's why he looks like he does.
Why do you think he has a particular grin on his face?
I know, I'd have.
He's in a constant orgasmic state.
Is that what you're saying?
Right.
Right.
But he only leaks every now and then.
Well, then he'd have to be depleted from his mankind accordion,
from the jismal area expanding so much.
Well, I mean, so to speak.
Wouldn't he?
I mean, he'd be, like, depleted.
That doesn't matter because he's rich.
You know, they said they found a piece of Jesus' skin
on part of a piece of wood that was supposed to be from the cross,
and they're going to try to, like, do a genetic, you know, DNA clone of him.
Clone the cross and Jesus.
Grecian.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That'd be cool.
The tree.
Yeah, the tree that the cross came from.
Grow it.
And then kill Jesus again with the same tree.
You know, that would be so hard to pick up a tree and, like, kill Jesus with him.
They wouldn't do it with a tree.
They'd make him hole up inside of some stupid compound in Texas.
Then they'd go in with flamethrowers disguised as tanks.
They'd do it on a tree, but they'd have Georgia Pacific emblems on it,
and they'd have, you know, warehouses.
They'd have a blower on it or, you know, all these other sponsors.
So is Jesus...
Corporate sponsors on Jesus' 21st century...
Is Jesus really, like, flying around the whole universe,
like, visiting all the planets that are inhabited and getting crucified on each one?
He's flying around wreaking revenge on those planets that crucified him
now that he's got an entire army of exes monsters at his back.
I'm a Christian soldier.
Wait, is that...
I'd like to ask you a question.
Is that in, like, an auto-de-faith thing or something?
Is that the fighting Jesus that you're talking about, or what is that?
There's only one thing.
Fighting Jesus, my friend.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The terror telephone book he'd have with his bare hands kind of Jesus.
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.
They believe in the namby-pamby little old lady Jesus, you know,
with the shaved knees and the little doilies on his fingers.
That was the fighting Jesus that tried to shoot you last time around, wasn't it?
No, he was after Bob.
That was you that was trying to shoot.
You don't need to get down.
Which kind of Jesus are you, my friend?
I'm more of Judas Iscariot.
I'm a black Jesus.
Everybody should think they're Jesus, but they shouldn't think they're the only one.
Then they're kooks.
They're nuts, you know, crazy, like Jim Jones.
I heard he came from the Orient anyway.
Jesus El Pifko?
The yellow Jesus.
Jesus El Pifko.
I thought he came from the Sarge.
Is he...
No, wait.
Jesus El Pifko is the Italian one.
No, that's El Pifko.
You know, you guys, if the Baptists are right, we're in real, real deep trouble.
I'm going to hell!
We've all been immersed in the water.
We've all been taken to the river.
We're going to hell!
I ain't afraid of anything.
I ain't afraid of hell.
I've been there 40 years.
I'm used to it.
I want more slack.
Slack is not for everyone.
You cannot take my slack away.
Slack can be taken by prescription.
You can take my slack.
And you'll break your hand.
You can lay your hand gently upon it and it will sink right in.
Never ever let it go.
That's the first thing I've ever heard of a little slasher.
Instead of the fact that it's a piece of shit.
You'd better watch out for Jim and me now.
We're eating our shots.
What?
Now let it be true.
We're all going to die.
We're all going to die.
We're all going to die.

We're all going to die.
We're all going to die.
We're self-heads.
We turn ourselves on.
I like it.
I never read.
I can't think.
Whenever I try it's a mess.
Sometimes I think I have reasons, but who can follow reasons?
I exist.
That's hard enough.
I'm a person who's been through a lot.
You say the tax man just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off-ramp after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of Nyquil during the Ren and Stimpy Festival and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.
The aliens removed your brain from their pathology studies and you don't even care?
Well, my friend.
you're ready for a big healthy dose of the subgenius hour of slack no one knows how to put
the maha back in christmas like jr bob dobbs and his twisted henchman the reverend ivan stang
your good friends and prayer partners in your bid to secure your place in hell and stop worrying
about all this unapproachable crapola so refuse to take your medication for a week and tie yourself
to the kitchen chair for the next neuron popping episode of the subgenius hour of slack
at last i have control of your radio tubes uh and i do too good this is ran the hock and this
is stimson j cat of the ren and stimpy show and you're listening to the hour of slack on knon
keep listening you idiots yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah else i shall kill you
you
who knew that the fish
is
and it's coming up
oh dear friends and yes yes brother cleve duncan is right

up that that hill of skulls
and uh well i guess i'll give some credits here uh
credits are due um yes that was brother cleve duncan doing bob is my load uh
hell pope huey uh talking about the electric fence there and of course our good friends
ren and stimpy uh prostituting themselves for the show for dobs uh and tonight's hour of slack
is going to be uh largely a combination of a two other
shows mixed with about 40 other shows with mainly these two uh the uh brain rot radio theater
shows from earlier this month at wcsb and cleveland uh where yours truly reverend ivan
stangg was a guest with those
what what do you call the brain rot radio sickness i mean what that's it and uh also a tape uh and uh

Well, we're using a lot of snippets from tapes put together by Puzzling Evidence out there on KPFA in Berkeley.
That's where it was first aired and now is chopped to pieces and interspersed throughout Hour of Slack.
Little movie clips and quotes and things that somehow describe just who we are as sub-geni as seen here.
A key to eternal happiness and peace.
Evil, disease, famine, human despair.
Yeah, but what do you do with the stupid stuff?
Their magic, their power, their potential to benefit mankind is enormous.
Delise, plague, famine, all the evils of the world can be relegated to the pages of history.
They are our greatest resource.
They can determine the future of the universe.
On the set is...
In Cashmere.
A short conversation.
They appear as ordinary, likable, adult fellows.
But emotionally, they remain as dangerous children.
And the legal profession has never really known how to treat them.
I suppose you could call them social misfits.
And being governed by the pleasure principle,
they're particularly dangerous when their desires are being frustrated.
Arsy, farsy!
Pah!
Now, I won't say that I...
understand everything, but it was certainly different and, oh, yes, well, well worth a dollar.
He's Bob. Bob don't ever change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob. His face is the one big assembly
of dots that shine in the dark. His grin is the one that looks friendly, but so does the grin of
a shark. He's Bob. Bob don't ever change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob.
He ain't no human being. He's from Mars.
Last time I was on that...
Them flying saucers, them little men, they told me all about him. They said they had a lot of
fellas like that planning on this earth to observe and take notes. Why, as I tried to tell you a
couple of months ago, these here observers, just like people, little green in the face,
but it ain't too noticeable. Why, you take my wife, Sadie. She has sort of a green tinge.
Wildcat, let's stick to the subject. If I get my hands on you, so help me, I'll break every bone
in your body.
I'm talking to the ionization belt.
Things I prefer not to mention in mixed company.
He's highly radioactive.
Yeah?
Consequently, no one is allowed near him.
Does anyone feel like doing a full job?
His hair is the one with the highlight that shines on the pompadour, that glimmers and gleams in the twilight.
It's clear he knows what it's for. He's Bob.
Bob, don't never change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob.
It's no such thing, perhaps to you, but we've known it for centuries.
This control, do you read?
Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.
But the juvenile minds which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late.
The static in that station.
There seems to be some kind of interference tonight.
There's a radio.
There could be radioactivity coming in the plan over there.
Oh, we stayed up and listened to your show. It's weird.
Yeah, I don't want to admit that most people listen to it and they always say,
well then, why do you do it?
Kill them before they kill you.
This is puzzling evidence to show.
I don't know what my nose is doing to me.
They set up six appeal tests to measure his contact-lismic effect on the female metabolism.
I hate you.
I don't think I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
I'm going to tell everyone that you're the one who's crazy, demented, cruel, evil.
Your conscience is an illusion.
There is merely an...
Instinctive...
Behavior...
Code.
To repress it is to suffocate.
But never forget for a second...
That it is the monster god who allows this.
Who defends it!
For science does not remove the tower of the gods!
His pipe is the one with the dowel
That rains on the roof like fire
His neck is the one with the wattle
Inflaming folks' desire
He's Bob
Bob don't ever change
He's Bob
Always will be Bob
Bob...
Well!
Bobby, take your jockstrap off.
Bobby, take your jockstrap off.
Come on, take your jockstrap off.
Everybody. Take you jockstrap off.
Take your jockstrap off.

Bob, rob, and hula talk.
Bob, rob, and hula talk.
Bob, rob, and hula talk.
Bob, rob, and hula talk.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello.
Hello.
Well, if you plug that thing in there and plug that other thing in there...
The music goes round and round and it comes out here.
Please! You don't want to know what you end up with.
Well, you might end up with a bottoms-up-below-the-belt review.
Something resembling the show, I suppose.
Something resembling an eel, but it might also be a stonefish, that primitive, poisonous creature known to...
You can't eat that thing.
Yes, natives refer to it as a one-, two-, or three-foot stonefish, which puzzled archaeologists for many years.
Stung by a sea urchin, eh?
You can't eat a stonefish and you can't eat the shell.
They say you're supposed to piddle on the sea urchin's sting, but what if you get stung on the piddler?
In the dreaded island of Guam, before diamond stores were extinct,
Diamond stores, yes.
stonefish were known to kill people within one or two feet of the sting.
The porcupine fish could shoot its quills.
Two and one.
A good 70 feet.
Wow!
These strange animals were known...
And some flying fish circled around for days before coming down.
...victims instantly with their lethal sting.
So strong was their toxin, they were turned into stone.
Now put that finger away.
Like the famous, fabled flying snakes of Africa.
And remember, of course, the people that were turned to stone, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, were actually stung by stonefish.
I was scared.
Back in those days were flies, donkeys.
As in the case of People vs. Imago, Statues vs. People, that's docket case number 407.
Donkey case number 407.
Yes, you have to store them somewhere, and these are unique and efficient storage modules for a donkey.
They were found innocent under Judge Pontius Pilate, that's of course the pilot who drove them.
Yeah, but then the series didn't turn out so well.
The pilot was the best.
He was the best thing about him.
Well, that was back in the old flying fish tales.
Everybody in that show was either a pilot or a flying fish.
Oh, nautical Ned as he danced to a hornpipe with his crusted knuckles on the decks of the Nelly.
Yeah, they all got paid union scale back in the old fish college.
We listened and looked sideways up.
You will ask me what I'm talking about, and I will answer you.
I'm sure you will.
I'm talking about...
They are back in their own time.
Sometimes.
His work absolutely destroys him.
It's like there's a whole part of him that I can never reach, I can never get to.
He's a very special American security agent.
Dedicated and ruthless.
This is my home.
No wife would ever understand.
Well, neither can I. You've got all the money in the world.
What's money got to do with it?
You're making money where all there was to business is hard to be worth while going to the office.
Money is a byproduct.
Well, what's the main objective? Power?
Ah, that's become a dirty word.
Look at this stuff.
You'll fly in a plane made of it, you'll wear a suit made of it, and before we're through with it, you'll probably be able to eat it.
His kind of love you cannot buy.
Knowing him, I wouldn't try.
I'm a man, but he's my guy.
Well, they suck the energy from everything around him.
The walls, the wires, the buildings.
And the people.
Yes.
That's what I've been up against from the start.
That's what nobody can see.
I'm telling the truth and nobody believes me.
The trouble is, I know it doesn't sound true.
What good is the truth when it doesn't sound true?
The Pope's out to get us.
The U.S. government is out to get us.
The governments where we have our ministries are out to get us.
Communists are out to get us.
Nazis are out to get us.
Racists are out to get us.
The anarchists, atheists are all out to get us.
And we must combat these evils.
Before too many Christians die.
We must come together, brothers and sisters.
Send money.
Become one powerful force.
United together, we can fight these people.
They're all around us, I know.
But we can do it.
But we must unite.
Send money.
And become part of the CNF family.
So we can combat the devil.
Everybody must die who does not believe.
Kill all who do not believe.
Kill all who are not in the faith.
Who fight the worst of all.
Satanists and the devil.
Satanists and the worst that all can believe in.
God. God will justify all your sins.
You must believe in God.
And then to believe in God, you must join the church.
And become faithful.
And love him.
And to do that, you must prove it.
And you must send money to CNF.
And in that, you will prove your trust and worship in God Almighty.
Follow the path of least resistance.
And you will go about from under the sacrifices he demands.
Of all the big boys around you.
The follies and foibles will show you worse than lies.
And you will be able to relax.
And not get a heart attack.
Jehovah one kills those who dredge their lives away without knowing who he is.
But he rewards the ones who recognize his stark fist.
And carry out his seemingly immoral plan.
While slacking off every chance they get.
Jehovah's special message for the subgenius.
Is that this gross physical plane does not exist.
Uh-uh.

Yes, yes, dear friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack,
the voice of the church of the subgenius.
Actually, one of many, but often the final voice, one might say.
There are many other tape makers out there and subgenius radio shows,
and that's what this particular evening's hour is composed of.
The tapes that I've been playing here, let's say, I'll go back to since the last time I did credits.
That little Firesign Theater media barrage song that you just heard,
it was this music with little cuts of ancient Firesign Theater,
that was put together by, let's see,
old, this is the name on the cassette,
old T. Schickel Gouver and the Happy Philanthropist Orchestra
with their album Dr. Terror's House of Ill Repute
or How I Became One with Myself,
a product of neglect.
There's been little bits of that here and there, sandwiched in between,
and we also have, let's see,
Dr. Houser,
Houser himself was singing his chain gang song, He's Bob.
By the way, that Dr. Howell is the same Dr. Howell who draws the He's Bob strip
in Bob's Favorite Comics number one.
Several people have asked me if that's Dr. Howell,
and yes, Howell Robbins is he who draws,
and he who also is on the KPFA subgenius show,
which we've been playing, an old show,
where he and Papa,
Joe Mama,
were fiddling around there with the callers,
the evil callers,
and puzzling evidence of sound effects
and media edits,
which were also peppered throughout
and re-chopped by myself in some cases.
The two gals that you heard reading from pamphlet number one
in a gigantic warehouse with laser shows going on around them
were Sister Mary Squared and Princess We Are Doe.
N-n ru sry no time else for this levels producers to the
end.
These Fingerlings,
don't you think,

That's what's in it.
So Turner takes several säger,
and whoever present here because I don't understand why,
that was a bad little bullshitter,
vị假 terme예요 We had a Nan weidong play on lifetimes,
subgenius post office box number where you can write for more information friends that's a post

Ready?
Stop
Wink
Shhh
Hey!
Lord!
Lord!
If it pleases your holiness
Holinesses?
Can you speak oh Lord please
Can you speak or may you speak for you see well fulsome Betty that I ought master of that religion
Which grants its peon free will
will. Of course you may speak, though thy tongue stinks of Polish boys and falafel.
Paul, did you wish to speak as well? With me?
Oh, my good friend, my lord, for then may your faithful disciple Paul also speaketh,
for I believe it's Peter and I are of one mindest.
Hmm. Your mighty holiness, messianicist, I are, we are tired of walking up and down
the streets of this city with its vile filth and evil vices, oh, lard.
Yes, lard. Look, a 200-pound bearded lady with a bow-peep costume, turning tricks in
front of the true light Baptist gospel mission. It's too much to beareth, lord.
Truly, master. Fleecing and flying.
Walking are our domain. See how she leads them sheep astray?
Silence. For though thou art of one mind, it still adds up to one half-wit in my holy book.
I granted thou permission to speak, but take care not to piss me off, or I shall relinquish
thy complaining by fusing thy vocal cords.
No problem, lord.
No problem, lord. No, you got it.
You got it. King of kings, baby.
King of kings, no doubt.
Good, for hath I not told thou once before, thou idiots, that we are in this foul Babylon
for one purpose?
To destroy the Satan-spawn mole-people before they destroy mankind. And in this city there
dwells one who breeds these mole-people with his semi-false preachings, a semi-false prophet,
the evil Reverend Ivan Stang and his hell-begotten church of the subgenius.
Lard.
And that is his church.
But, lord, if we enter there, shall not their minion stone us?
I hope they have the good stuff, lord.
And...
Ow!
Ow!
Fools!
We shall go unseen into their midst, disguised as derelicts.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, dear friends! And just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Paying anchovy olive lip service to the musicless dance of prune-faced inquisitors and their
muscle-bombs.
Because I haven't a soul.
I won't relaxing as Anela, Sa referral for Tschar Bob Dobbs, dear album, has said.
Abastras, Traveller of Sorrows, the music that I produce were duluモ and cuidam France

Fruits were bringing thru my arse at Umbaz age, by their
a sinister Schuldahlhe
..
I shoes.
The bitter truth of all...
..
The truth of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
That...
You can't imagine how much that man hates you.
All mental case.
Oh, he hates you.
He hates you so.
But, uh...
All men's room.
But now, Sister Monstrous Dogma...
Dharma will pass the pate and collection dish.
And don't forget, those Political Action Committee vouchers,
your PAC, PAC pledges, are as good as gold.
While the sister reams your wallets,
Brother Brain Sausage and Sister Karaoke Farm Problems
and, uh, lovely Sister Karaoke Farm Problems
and, uh, Brother Forgetful Swineberries
will lead the flockers into the basement for tea cakes and Pepsi
and open forum questions.
Come on.
Peter, Paul, this is our chance.
During this discussion period, we wrap theology like big dogs
and expose the satanic mole pizza front.
Brilliant, Blard.
Yes, brilliant.
Fools, am I not the son of the father of all such smartness?
Shh, quiet.
The question and answer's about to start.
Okay, let's see.
Who are there?
Yes, you, the woman with the welder's mask.
Um, my name's Lolly Lovegarden, uh...
Pippin.
Pickelopium.
My maiden name, uh, Lolly Pickelopium.
Anyway, I'm a membrane of Welder's Local 231
here in Cleaver Ridge.
And my first question, uh, is,
was Bob Dobbs born of virgin birth?
Was he immaculately conceived,
or was he born like the rest of us?
And the second question is,
who is Neagie and why is Neagie?
Are you aware now?
Well, uh, thank you for that, Miss Lolly.
Uh, uh, in regard, I, I don't know if I, we, we...
You should never mention the name of Neagie.
Uh, but, uh, in regards to, uh, Bob's birth,
in this dimension, or in any other, for that matter,
uh, let me say that, uh, now, as you know,
uh, Bob is, uh, born of woman.
That is Jane Dobbs, Jane McBride Dobbs,
uh, somewhere in the Midwest.
And, uh, no, immaculate conception.
I mean, this is subgenius church we're talking about.
That woman.
She wears the welder's mask to shield her eyes from sunlight.
And hide her gruesome countenance.
She is a mole, people.
That's, uh, and, uh, does that answer your question?
Uh, yes, you in the back.
The boy with the exposed skull
and the flattened, uh, worm-like protrusion.
Oh, me?
I thought it was tucked in.
What do you mean, one day closer to X-Day?
What is X-Day, and who are the X-ists?
I cannot believe that a subgenius has asked me the question of who is X-Day and who is X-Day.
As Bob has preached his entire life since before his demaculated birth,
he is, in fact, he who will bring on July 5th, 1998,
uh, 7 a.m. in the morning,
the, those, uh, the ascension of the angelic host.
Yes, the so-called men from Planet X.
Uh, they're obviously, they're not men.
They're gods.
And, uh, they will come and destroy all the normal people
and take we, the subgeniuses, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,
where, well, uh, we, we'll be showing you the slides, uh, the slideshow on that this evening.
And so I hope that answers it for you.
Uh, you, the derelict in the middle.
Uh, bum, uh, bearded fellow down there.
I?
Uh, is it not writ that,
there wherefore goeth the Father, there goest I?
Yet you have said to thine flockers that our Lord is even less than a mighty hot dog,
that he is merely a space bully.
Well, now, uh, Jehovah One, the alien space god from...
Mine!
He is truly one of the more people.
To hell with him!
Jehovah One is a...
Hey, what?
What?
Wait!
What's that blinding light?
I, I can't see!
I, what, what is...
It is I, the light of the world, and your Messiah.
Bend down before me.
Up!
Up!
Bend this, you posturing, spoiled sons of the Archons!
And for, I am a personal business acquaintance of the unknowable and extremely hard to deal
with, J.R. Bob Dobbs, living slack master upon this, this blinded globe!
You, you faker!
Here, take this!
Take this yourself!
I'll show you!
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll show you!
What are the rays?
Send him out of my brain!
Well, it seems old J.C. and Bob Dobbs, and their little brother, have been on the run
for over a year, 18 дDs are now voz-only, a
Wolfie-iful roll-man badge.
They're just gonna stop working.
Oh, my
life.

where the media was God itself, the real God.
It wasn't long before...
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Cult in the Act,
America's favorite religious game show,
where each week our panelists try to answer the unanswerable.
This week's panel, from Sutton Baldspot, Illinois,
Mr. Pumper Smoke Safety.
Who gave you that name?
Never mind. We know all we need to know about you.
And our next contestant is a snooty waitress,
from Alternate Erection, New Jersey,
Mistress Lolly Smoothbottom.
Oh, thank you, Ruffin. I'm happy to be somewhere.
And from Military Base Closure, Nevada,
Sergeant Left and Right Wing Penny Hoser.
Am I driving?
Oh, that's reverent to you.
Fat back, I've got an image to protect.
Right you are, Everett.
An image based on fear and respect.
So let's not pander to the drooling observations of a pack of morons.
Let's play Cult in the Act.
That's right, gay, it's time to play.
So let's go right to Sergeant Peckerhose
for a fast double bonus round
on questions of teleological and theological importance.
First question concerns the gamut of sex hurt
and philosophical syllogisms.
Sarge, for eight million donuts in the naked city
eating lots of naked brunch,
what gives you the freaky rights to come in here
and pretend you know what the hell I'm talking about?
What? Is that the question?
Wrong! Wrong!
Utterly and fatally, I might add, wrong.
Take him away and rip out his heart as a sacrifice to needy.
Ah!
Now, contesticle number two.
If that is your real number, uh, what does it mean, uh,
the Yeti, although considered a mytho-beastie,
is quite at home in which national park?
Also home to some of the finest froplands in America?
Ah, ah, uh, your thumsy Samson,
a plotter and head plopper for the excess?
Give up!
Bad hat?
So do I.
Take her to parallel hell or the pus fountain in the land of Dairy Queer.
I have no further questions.

I'm not going to give you further use for this politically incorrect goose-stepping.
Ah!
Now, um, bilge dropper number one.
Before I condemn you to a beautiful three-bedroom
and sunken sun porch purgatory of your own,
on X-Day, uh, them stinky, stinky pinks will be breasted,
broasted in their own, uh, juices,
all the more fitting because of their collusion,
and then sub-gumped into what now famous Paul Proudhon's culinary tweet?
Oh, well, uh, blackened and red-iron-coat fish.
Amazing!
Wow!
Right you are, Mr. Smoke Safety!
But still, you must die.
I see no reason to continue this.
Hang him by his f-ing bowels.
Uh, no, wait, wait.
Give him one of the Anglo-Saxon raiders used on the Britons,
uh, the Blood Eagle, where the contestable has his lungs ripped,
still breathing from his chest,
then crushed by a stone.
No!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That's too arcane.
Uh, let's, let's just shoot the booger and put him,
make him cry for mercy.
I want him!
I want him!
I mean it!
Okay, give him, take him, give him to the audience.
I'll do it!
He's yours!
Kill him!
Live for them.
But it was worse than that.
It seems J.C., Peter, and Paul were fired from the cast
of the most recent Jesus Meets the Mole People production.
The Actors Union, enraged by their taking on as powerful a lobby
as the Church of the Subgenius, picketed Jesus Meets the Mole People
till it closed.
And J.C., Pete, and Paulie were put on a government-sponsored
work project for out-of-work actors.
Oh, that I have passed this life and not saved one mortal
from the blind and saggy mole people.
Hey, maybe we could turn this into a waiting for good luck
shticket for these living theater people I know at La Mama's
in New York.
Nah, I see this as us doing our bit for the workers.
Our own Hooverville Collective, right here in the ocean.
But if I am who they speak of whom they speak,
is not my job truly that to part the waters?
Eh, sure, man, anything you say.
He'll make good sense again when the food boat comes by.
He's getting kind of skinny.
Woe unto those who doubt, for did not Moses part the Red Sea?
Yeah, poor guy.
Well, I'm getting back to work.
Another year closer to X-Day, a modern radio drama act two,
scene three.
Yeah, me too.
Another year closer to X-Day, a surrealist radio play for three
characters, one endless boring gray set, water from horizon to
horizon, endless, infiniteth, and I will adlibeth infinitum
until ad nauseum infinitumeth, my infinitum ad nauseumeth.
You'll be back on your feet, Laura.
Don't worry about it.
I'll be back.
Still, good luck to fra microorganisms.
Still good luck to my little spermling,
little spermling, little stork, to the kids,
then to your ba-mmaes, -...stin aquele pig liked
Uh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends, rain of brought, uh, brain rot.
Yes, brain rot, radio, theatre, broadcasting there from wonderful,
Wonderful WCSB in DNA level C, also known as Cleveland.
Cleveland.
Ow!
Ouch.
Sorry.
Yeah.
And, yes, that was scripted, I believe, by Lonesome Cowboy Dave and his good friend Dave DeLuca.
And starring, of course, Scabby Days and Chaz Smith and that dirty-mouthed old Dan and Psychopath Finder.
And Princess Wiardo as the special guest star there providing the female voices.
And what else can I tell you about?
Well, I could, I suppose, give you the, you know, some of you may be listening.
For the first time, you might be just a tad curious as to, now, wait a minute.
Now, what is this Bob thing all about, man?
I'm a kid.
Just explain it.
Sure.
It's so simple, but you have to read it.
See, can you read?
Hey, can you write this address down?
I'm about to give.
All you got to do is just tell us you want the free information.
Now, of course, if you were to use a self-addressed stamped envelope inside there.
And, you know, whatever kind of love offering you might want to grant to this radio station and this mighty church.
Which, you know, just write to Bob.
You can just address it to Bob and it'll get to us at post office box.
1-4-0-3-0-6.
In love.
Leave.
Dallas, Texas.
And that zip code is, once again, 75214.
Once again, that's 75214.
You know, I would almost think if you addressed, if you wrote Bob Subgenius 75214 on an envelope.
And if you held it on your lap for a while and just prayed to Bob, I bet it'd get to us.
You got to put that 29 cent stamp on it.
Of course.
And, yes.
I don't even know what's up next.
But I know that it may be more of the different.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Diving there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
There are whole ovens here.
This is Starby.
Starby?
Somebody please ask Bob what I'm supposed to do with all these dwarves.
Send them to post office box.
1-4-0-3-0-6.
What am I supposed to do with them?
What?
You put them in damn.
You guys cut off.
You put them in a box and put a stamp on them and mail them to Dallas.
Well, they'll fold up real good.
Yeah.
They, you, well, you.
I mean, I mean, I got them here.








But I can't control them too much longer.
They're busy at something.
I'm not really sure what it is.
Dump a whole bunch of packing foam on them so they're immobilized.
And then meld it.
Well, they're so, well, they're kind of mobile, actually.
Then call the ATF.
Well, if you dump the packing foam on them and then spray some spray paint on it, it'll
melt the packing foam.
That's right.
And seal them in.
And seal those dwarves in their box.
Yeah, seal those dwarves right in their own juices.
I think that's a tremendous.
Wait a minute, you guys.
And you, can you believe you can get an item that'll actually seal them in?

Yeah.
You can seal them in the dwarf juices and give you triple your salvation back for what
is it?
Only now, it's only 20.
It's $20.
$20.
So next year.
So you get.
Now, what this.
I can't really believe this is true.
But you get the dwarf juicing sealer.
And I like them with the extra juicing.
The sealer of the dwarf juices.
You can have a free dwarf with it.
Pardon?
Well.
I'm sorry.
If you send the dwarves to Dallas, we'll be giving out free dwarves for a while.
Yeah, sure.
We got plenty of them.
But wait a minute.
Now, there's, we got a problem here.
Well, you know, I could use a dwarf.
You're one of the little people, so to speak.
You know, height, dis, uh, uh, de-enabled persons who are listening to this show.
Do you think they would be.
De-enabled.
Well, that's not wrong, man.
You think they would be.
You're not in Dallas.
You're not down in KNO.
And you don't have to be politically correct here.
You're on CSP.
See, in the first place, nobody listens to this station.
Oh, these are both kind of war.
Oh, it's one of those.
Yeah.
It's kind of like, oh.
We're broadcasting to this floor of this building.
Hell, I mean, you can't make fun of anybody anymore.
Except religious nuts.
You know, isn't that sick?
You can make fun of the guy who got his.
One of the few, one of the few little happiness is in life that you can actually make fun
of those monstrous megalithics that you portend to make fun of.
In your dreams.
In your dreams.
Yeah.
But, but, you know, I mean, they did, they made a dwarf tossing illegal in, in Australia.
Well, Australians have their own ideas about things.
We find it.
Hell yes.
In Ohio, hell yes.
We were born out of it.



We're born out of it.

I'd be proud of you.
I mean, if you're someone that's not even born out of it, you can make fun of him.



Call her.
Call her.
Yeah.
Let's go out.
And if they have a big dwarf tossing thing going on tonight, there's like about three

That's why I wanted NAFTA to pass.
So, you know, Mexicans could come up for the dwarf.
Well, I just realized, I can, I can make fun of dwarves.
We can have a cultural exchange.
We can teach them our dwarf tossing.
And they can teach us their cat juggling.
That would be great.
I'm afflicted with Darwin's curse.
I have a back of a baboon and I have a...
I have a bachelor's and a master's.
Yeah, I got divorced.
They can get me anywhere.
You got a master's too?
Yeah, I got a master's.
I went to college for one year.
I've been going for eight years.
Yes, but the college you went to was... what was that?
They call it the College of Cardinals or something?
Dogstown University.
Oh, Dogstown.
Where Father Monsignor... he paddled you regularly.
Didn't he?
Was that part of the...
Yeah, that's how we make subgeniuses.
We have the Monsignors paddle the children.
Spankles.
Do you give out graduate assistantships for like, praying?
Prayering?
Working the prayer tower?
Depends on the level of donation.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's...
When you bring in a good full collection plate, then we know that you're ready to be a doctor
of divinity.
If the portfolio looks real good but your GPA isn't that high, is that okay?
Again, the collection plate...
Yeah, that's...
Sure, you know...
Things can be worked out.
It's who you know, it ain't what you know.
That's all I know.
Really?
I mean, it's true.
That's absolute...
If you know Ben Franklin and...
Thomas Jefferson?
Weasel.
Guys on other big pieces of paper...
Mrs. Grant?
Yeah, U.S. Grant, yeah.
Saxman, Pariah, Vicious Wood.
The victory of ridiculous men, and you can't imagine the relief.
Tell them no more games.
And this is the only thing that's left for you to remember.






Do you have the drug?
Yes.
Movies or music, 24 hours a day.
You're better educated, you have more income, you purchase more cars, VCRs and clothing,
furniture or photographic equipment than those you left behind.
And your army has grown to nearly half of all Bay Area households.
Subjects will surrender their identification modules.
The only thing that's left is the ID card.



Subjects can no longer claim individual status.
Subjects have been reclassified as expendable material.
Material will proceed through the barriers.
Cover this.
Make a small picture layout.
Right.
Oh, so that's it.
What a guy.
Take the truck.
We want sound.
If you've got any cents left, you'll all go home and forget this.
I don't need any money.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't like the sound of any of this.
It's tough to admit you've been a fool, but, well, look at us.
Hi there, phone seekers.
Wildest thing I've heard of.
I ever hoped to.
What about the body?
Not enough time.
The brain is dead.
Dead.
Incorrect.
Access denied.
Do anything about it.
I have access to water.
Please?
Start.
Anyone?

As I keep looking to life, I see non-existentgelat!
It's old.
