00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,480
This is Doug Smith, radio operator. I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,820
You're a joke! A dirty joke from one end of this town to the other!

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,120
The Self-Genius Power of Self-Genius

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:29,100
This is an urgent public service bulletin from your police department.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,260
A dangerous killer beast is at large. You are asked to remain indoors.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
This is an urgent public service bulletin to all citizens.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,340
This whole thing is cockeyed.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,420
Friends, we bid a fond farewell to the great Maynard G. Krebs.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Goodbye, Bob.

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,260
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.

11
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,180
On board were the Twelve.

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,620
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician, and the other self-genius.

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,880
The Self-Genius!

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,660
perseverance

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:44,600
Slash back with his spicy crispy slapjack sandwich a spicy crispy slap with fresh lettuce and tomato only at Slack in the box restaurants

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,240
Yeah?

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,440
Stab me!

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Stab me!

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,860
Stab me!!!

20
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,720
Stab me!!!

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,140
Stab me!!!

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,680
Stab me!!!

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,620
Stab me!!!

24
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,240
Stab me!!!

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,240


26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,720
Stab me!!!

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,100
IMGR

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,100


29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,100


30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,160
IMGR

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,300
IMGR

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,920
IMGR

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,160
IMGR

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,700
IMGR

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,860
IMGR

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,840
IMGR

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm looking the soup in your soul of slugs and say I can't understand what you're saying.

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,060
You can't understand what you're saying.

39
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,320
We cannot understand what you're saying.

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
Price Bob, Price Bob, it's not Price Bob.

41
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,400
From PR News in Washington, I'm sentenced to life in prison for funding Bob.

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,520
President Bush envisions as many as 180 people returning to Beijing.

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,140
At least 21 people have been ordered to stay on their medication.

44
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,160
On Wall Street, 86105564.

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,180
A new study finds that most people with schizophrenia are meeting in Vienna and they've expressed concern about PR News in Washington.

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,380
For 14 hours, Rudy Wells and his team of highly trained specialists painstakingly labor over the battered and broken body of Bobby.

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,660
How do you feel?

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,640
You're now faster, stronger, more durable than you ever were.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,540
Just what did you guys do to me?

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't want any part of any of it.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm getting out of here.

52
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,760
Stay in your bed.

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,020
Wild man, wild man.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,980
This will stop him.

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,600
Then.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,380
I didn't think we'd ever stop him.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,140
How do you feel?

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm stronger, faster, better.

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,900
But you left out one thing.

60
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not a man anymore.

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,820
I'm a friend.

62
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,100
I'm a friend.

63
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,520
Personal diary.

64
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,820
I'm a friend.

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm a friend.

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,500
But somebody ought to Moonpie her.

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,620
What's the problem, boy?

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I've been busting my hump all week for that withered old clam and all I got was 50 cents.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,780
Hey, when I was your age, 50 cents was a lot of money.

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,760
Really?

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,540
Nah.

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,060
Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got 35 bucks.

74
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,820
I am through with working.

75
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,040
Working is for chumps.

76
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,840
Son, I'm proud of you.

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,720
I was twice your age before I figured that out.

78
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm found in home.

79
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,120


80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,560
roads and other sites. The massive Bush administration is now grappling with two

81
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,200
Japanese tourists after an assassination attempt on William Rehnquist. Homeland Security Secretary

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,240
Michael Chertoff says corpses will be home. The third fire in more than a week in Paris

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,600
is blamed for at least 14 deaths. Authorities suspect PR News in Washington.

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,340
And the water gonna come and I have no place to stay.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,660
Well, all that night I sat on the lever and the moon.

86
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, all that night I sat on the lever and the moon.

87
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,620
Thinking about my baby and my happy home.

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,680
If it keeps on raining, the lever's going to break.

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,600
If it keeps on raining, the lever's going to break.

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,100
Can you hear me?

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,160
Can you guys believe how this guy ripped off Led Zeppelin?

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah, it's remarkable what goes on in this country nowadays.

93
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,600
People come up with some idea and claim that they invented the idea,

94
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,280
when in reality the idea was pre-invented.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,120
Well, you would think that...

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,300
Well, by the Ministry of Culture, anyway.

97
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,940
I mean, what has happened to the trademark laws and copyright laws in this country?

98
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,460
It's back to the Ministry of Culture.

99
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,140
A singer can rip off a famous rock band like Led Zeppelin.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,780
He's probably made...

101
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,160
He's probably made $25 dollars off of this thing.

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,740
Well, did you hear about...

103
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,520
This guy was involved with Robert Plant in a sexually deviant manner.

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,460
He was paid off under the table and beside the table by some sort of Rosicrucian, I guess it was,

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,720
from the Legal Defense Department.

106
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
They call them legal aides.

107
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,000
And I guess they're all condemned to hell for their...

108
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,200
Do you think that...

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,560
All witches are condemned to hell, too.

110
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
Yeah, but who does the condemning?

111
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,100
I'd like to know.

112
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,340
God.

113
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,960
Is God?

114
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,700
God.

115
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,060
Well, there's one particular God.

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,020
Let's put it that way.

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,440
Oh, so he is the one in particular that's responsible for all this placebo mess and this garbage.

118
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,980
Well, there's the one that does the hell stuff and there's probably another one that doesn't.

119
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,380
So how many God, God, God, Gods would you say there is?

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,880
None.

121
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,340
None.

122
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,540
But I was told to say that by the Spirit.

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,460
I was seized up and told in the Spirit to go out and preach the word of no God at all.

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,300
The guy in the movie Wise Blood.

125
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,280
I was taught by an elderly Bolshevik.

126
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,800
I got wise...

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,080
Oh, no, that was the crazy guy that said that.

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,760
Well, he was...

129
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, that was the elderly Bolshevik.

130
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,160
The hero said,

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
I am not a preacher.

132
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,520
I'm a festerer of wounds.

133
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm a rubber of salt in the eyes of man.

134
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,920
Well, I had to face it.

135
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm a preacher, all right.

136
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,380
I'm a preacher of Bob's word.

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,060
I'm an undergrown pubish, Stan.

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,780
What shall I do?

139
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,740
Send $30.

140
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,920
I've polished the bump many times.

141
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,100
Send $30 to J.R. Bob Doves.

142
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,080
I bet you never actually...

143
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,020
You never actually did that, did you, Dave?

144
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,540
No, and I wonder...

145
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,600
I've seen that he would have been left behind if the exodus had come as promised on July 5th, 1998,

146
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,640
which may still be happening anytime.

147
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,420
Have you heard the phosphorescent rumors?

148
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:09,920
What?

149
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:18,400
That they're going around picking up subgena individually rather than this mass rupture that you had, you know, hoped to make a couple bucks off of.

150
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,440
I think they've been taking body parts individually, like your hair, my memory, Princess Wee's morals.

151
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,240
No, just kidding.

152
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,080
We have...

153
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,060
We have to throw in that...

154
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,320
We have to get those gags in somehow before we're gagged.

155
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,440
Well, thank God I don't...

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,040
I still don't have any gonads to speak of.

157
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,400
I just wanted to make that perfectly...

158
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
Did you really have to gonad there?

159
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,560
I mean, come on.

160
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
God, God, God, God, God.

161
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,880
That's the German word, you know, but we can't say the Arabic word.

162
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,060
God, God, God, God.

163
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,140
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah.

164
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,020
We can't say that one.

165
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,160
How come God spoke German, Stan?

166
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
I'd like to know about some of this evangelical stuff.

167
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,840
So that we wouldn't be able to understand what he was saying.

168
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah, I think...

169
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Yes, what is the...

170
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,380
If you're off something...

171
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:07,480
Well, we have some collages coming up that condemn the administration's foot dragging

172
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,260
as it dragged its feet off the rowboat through the waters of all the cities that have been flooded.

173
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,100
It sounds like a body dredging or something.

174
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,920
This is really hurricane season.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
You know, the next hurricane is supposed to hit Phoenix, Arizona.

176
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,920
And there's one in China.

177
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,940
Somewhere in China, they're dealing with a typhoon.

178
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,780
Well, I heard...

179
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:27,780


180
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,760
The sixth one to come up after they go into the Omega, you know, the Alpha Omega cycle,

181
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,620
where they use Greek letters instead of funny names like Rita and Jane and stuff like that,

182
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,980
is scheduled to hit Denver on November the 7th.

183
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,940
That's where the eye will cross in the great, bolded, mile-high city of Denver.

184
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,220
For crying out loud.

185
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,840
Loud.

186
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,820
Praise Bob.

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,500
Praise Bob.

188
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,940
I think we have something about that coming up.

189
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:57,720
My daughter called me from Los Angeles to inform me that she was driving straight into one of those giant 24,000-acre Los Angeles farms.

190
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh, Santa Ana.

191
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,880
Yeah, and I got interested in that, and I found this report from...

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,880
I'll go through this real swiftly, but to September 12th,

193
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,440
horror and disbelief swept through the greater Hollywood area this afternoon

194
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,320
as a minor power outage turned the city into a virtual war zone,

195
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,400
and local residents struggled to deal with the devastating aftermath.

196
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,120
Traffic lights fell dark.

197
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,420
Local gyms and sushi restaurants were without power for nearly...

198
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,300
30 minutes, and many businesses were illuminated only by the light of the sun and its blistering 78-degree heat.

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,420
Sugar in the raw? Are you kidding me?

200
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,800
sobbed local homosexual and avid salsa dancer Enrique Santoro.

201
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm on a South Beach diet, and my insulin levels are going to go crazy if I use this.

202
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,560
Why isn't the rest of the country doing something?

203
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,660
At least 2,000 refugees, the majority of them beautiful,

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,300
will travel in a bus convoy to Beverly Hills starting this evening,

205
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,500
and will be sheltered in the...

206
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,040
8-year-old Spago on North Cannon,

207
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,520
where soft omelets with confit bacon and Hudson Valley foie gras

208
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,820
will be airlifted in by the National Guard.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,780
Well, it sounds like paradise staying, but let's get real here.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,060
Halliburton still was given the Los Angeles Reconstruction Contract.

211
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,700
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Halliburton and them will be cleaning up.

212
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,280
They'll get the big money off of these things.

213
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,080
And not cleaning the swimming pools, and, you know, the sushi restaurants will be running again their way.

214
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,920
I mean, come on, man. Nobody escapes the iron fist.

215
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,760
Nobody escapes the tender little baby booty that's filled with...

216
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,980
All this is not anointing me. It's not...

217
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,920
The other thing was...

218
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,020
Well, this is the sad part about all this.

219
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,920
The mayor of Hollywood, Johnny Grant, told a group of embedded reporters

220
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,140
at a Cuckoo Roo chicken restaurant on Larchmont that, quote,

221
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,280
The scope and scale of this disaster is almost too much to comprehend.

222
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,900
Local car washes are at a standstill.

223
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,640
The tram tour at Universal Studios has been on hold for almost an hour now,

224
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,160
and I've been waiting for a rotisserie leg and thigh with a side of green beans

225
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,780
for upwards of a year.

226
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,740
In 15 minutes, this is truly our tsunami.

227
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,560
Jeez, man, you're putting up the barbed wire in Topanga Canyon.

228
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Yep.

229
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,840
And all of those poor, those poor Los Angelinos.

230
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,560
I feel so bad.

231
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,480
Listen to this.

232
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,780
Listen.

233
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

234
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,540
A group of chickens masturbating.

235
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:21,940
Geese.

236
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,600
Geese.

237
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,420
Can the geese masturbate?

238
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,560
Two.

239
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:25,980
One.

240
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,240
Two.

241
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,080
One.

242
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,320
Two.

243
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,140
Two.

244
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,180
Two.

245
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,180


246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,180


247
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,180


248
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,040
These geese aren't bad.

249
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,560
That's honking.

250
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,920
Yes.

251
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
You can honk along.

252
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,640
That is.

253
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,620
Ha, ha.

254
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,640
Ha, ha.

255
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,920
Honk it hard.

256
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,520
Honk.

257
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,800
Ha, ha.

258
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,500
Ha, ha.

259
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,820
Ha, ha.

260
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,520
Honk.

261
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:56,880
Honk.

262
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,680
Honk.

263
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:57,780


264
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,940
The mid-goose does the Mick Jagger dance.

265
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,680
I know that.

266
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,200
He has to lift the legs up a little bit, you know, and he put his one wing on his leg.

267
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,480
Oh, where's my...

268
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,800
Get the coxcomb going, yeah.

269
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,080
Where's my script of the devastatingly cool...

270
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,960
Stang, you're spontaneously among us.

271
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,620
You're not supposed to use a script or refer to any written pieces of paper.

272
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, I have to because I have to say the credits, which is all Fernand and Andy Lee

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,460
Murr and Norrell Preff did pretty much everything.

274
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,700
And there's no sense in trying to tell people which part of what those two guys did, but

275
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,680
they did almost everything.

276
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,160
Well, who sampled the geeks?

277
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,740
That is hilarious and wonderful.

278
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,480
I don't know.

279
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,140
There was a...

280
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,220
We had some Beatles.

281
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,560
We had the Beatle Barkers did some of our background music there, and that was Kansas

282
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,700
Joe, by the way, doing the levee.

283
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,580
Now, he was involved in the...

284
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,540
When the levee breaks.

285
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,440
Ripped off the Led Zeppelin.

286
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,060
Oh, he was involved in ripping the legs off the Zeppels, or the Zeppelay there.

287
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah.

288
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,640
The brazen ripofferage.

289
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,840
Now, I'm going to play this devastating collage in a second here.

290
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,420
Can I ask you a question first?

291
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:04,800
Sure.

292
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,020
Because you're smart, and you remember things.

293
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,640
I forgot one.

294
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,400
Ontology recapitulates ontology.

295
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,160
What does that mean?

296
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,780
What?

297
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,000
I forgot.

298
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
Ontology recapitulates ontology.

299
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,380
Oh, I can tell you, but I'm not going to because it's too boring and it's all bogus, academic

300
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,660
bull pooey anyway.

301
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,180
I'll show you.

302
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,180
I'll show you.

303
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:26,940
I'll show you.

304
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:26,940


305
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,320
Okay, I'll show you.

306
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

307
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,060
That's a med speak.

308
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:41,620
Okay, here's the devastating collage, friends, by Phineas Snarko posted this, and it was

309
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,380
by Stephen McQuillan.

310
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,480
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

311
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,780
They anticipated a serious storm.

312
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,560
These levees got breached, and as a result, much of New Orleans is flooded.

313
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,300
He didn't think...

314
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,620
I don't think anybody had anticipated that.

315
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,040
Liar.

316
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,940
Saturday before the storm hit.

317
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,960
If we had a direct hit of a Category 4 or 5 and maybe even a Category 3, we would be

318
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,900
totally inundated with water.

319
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
We couldn't pump it all out.

320
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,620
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

321
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,400
The levees in Jefferson Parish, with the tidal surge that is presently forecast, will be

322
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:15,700
top.

323
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,000
We can expect our community to be significantly underwater and for a number of days.

324
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,380
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

325
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,000
This is a city.

326
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,500
It's built on the coast in an area that has hurricanes and is built below sea levels,

327
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,760
and that is a super.

328
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,060
People have talked for years about whether it makes sense to have a city like that.

329
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

330
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,700
It looks like Hurricane Sluggo is headed right for us here in America's wetlands.

331
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,360
That's right.

332
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,000
And since New Orleans is below sea level, if a hurricane hit us directly, it could push

333
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,320
the water over the levees and fill it to the top.

334
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,220
Let's act now before it's too late.

335
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,920
This will be a major emergency for American bikers, emergencies, and the future.

336
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,820
And not a time to waste on them.

337
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,780
But instead I will tell you why I'm lowered ourselves, and how we

338
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,160
fail.

339
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,820
It is a dire disaster.

340
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,720
People in the Port of Illinois feel the vulnerability of this damage.

341
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,560
There is a large ciaddadWonbe've facing a guarantee così de rest роль Roaden

343
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,560
I never expected we'd have the risk of having a hurricane country.

344
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,560


345
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,560


346
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,560


347
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,560


348
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,020
Down there.

349
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,960
It must have.

350
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
How are you?

351
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,040
Wake up!

352
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,780
Said, don't you know me?

353
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,020
I'm your native son.

354
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,260
I'm the city of New Orleans.

355
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,260
I'll be gone when the day is done.

356
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,800
New Orleans is sacred land and I don't want to swim.

357
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,720
It keeps on raining, levees going to break.

358
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,740
I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.

359
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,500
When the levee breaks, I have no place to stay.

360
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,580
Welcome to New Orleans.

361
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,980
Federal, state, and local governments are working side by side to sustain lives

362
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,980
by ensuring adequate food, water, shelter, and medical supplies for survivors and dedicated citizens.

363
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,460
Our dislocated citizens.

364
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,980
At that time, he was making a big deal about telling the nation that the convention center had been secured.

365
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,080
FEMA's moving supplies and equipment into the hardest hit areas.

366
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,280
All they had done, as Geraldo Rivera actually reported on Fox, was they locked people in.

367
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,280
This is it. This is it. No sugarcoating. No political spitting.

368
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,920
No Republicans or Democrats.

369
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,320
People suffering. Let them go. Let them out of here.

370
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,900
Let them walk over this damn interstate and let them out of here.

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,760
I want to get some perspective here because earlier today the images were...

372
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:36,900
That is perspective.

373
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,520
Hang on a second.

374
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,200
That is all the perspective you need.

375
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,060
Hang on a second.

376
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,600
Anyone who walks up out of that city now is turned around.

377
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't know, man. I don't... Let them walk the hell out of here.

378
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Let them get on that interstate and walk out to the Walmart on the other side of the river.

379
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,940
To some other town.

380
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,280
Some place where you can help them.

381
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,240
All you got here is thousands and thousands of people six days later.

382
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,040
Same clothes.

383
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,640
Where do you think they're going to the bathroom?

384
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,960
They don't wash their hands. They don't wash their face.

385
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,640
These babies.

386
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,500
There are so many babies here.

387
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,280
What the hell?

388
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,860
Come on and rescue me.

389
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Six feet of water in the streets of Louisiana.

390
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,340
You simply get chills every time you see these poor individuals.

391
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,640
So many of these people.

392
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,860
That child that washed us away.

393
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,980
They are so poor.

394
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,260
That child that washed us away.

395
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,440
They are so poor.

396
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,100
So many people got lost in the flood.

397
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
And they are so blind.

398
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,500
So many people got away on the rain.

399
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,240
I'm alright.

400
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,400
And I'm alright.

401
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,900
I said I'm alright.

402
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,860
I'm alright.

403
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,380
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

404
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,520
Here's Barbara Bush.

405
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,300
So many of the people in the arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway.

406
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,860
This is working very well for them.

407
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,700
They're being drawn to careers of service.

408
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,260
When the manpower of government is not enough.

409
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,180
The government is stretched thin.

410
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,880
So we headed down to finally bring presidential leadership to the disaster zone.

411
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,360
President come down.

412
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,460
President's a little fat man.

413
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,580
He made a shame.

414
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,740
What the river has done.

415
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,200
This poor cracker's lame.

416
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,060
Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house,

417
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,740
he's had lost his entire house,

418
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,860
there's going to be a fantastic house.

419
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,280
And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch.

420
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,420
Michael Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security,

421
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,260
sounds like he doesn't know what's been going on at the convention center in New Orleans.

422
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,660
For the past two days.

423
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,400
I have not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center

424
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
who don't have food and water.

425
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,140
Michael Brown, nominated to the post by President Bush,

426
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,840
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,280
and director of the retarded mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina.

428
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,260
Confirmation hearings for this guy were 42 minutes long.

429
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
And only five senators showed up.

430
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,260
Hey there, people, I'm Michael Brown.

431
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,740
Every person in that convention center, we just learned about that today.

432
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,200
Sir, you're not telling me...

433
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,420
There's those bodies that are there.

434
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,120
Sir, you're not telling me you just learned that the folks at the convention center

435
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,780
didn't have food and water until today, are you?

436
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,960
You had no idea they were completely cut off?

437
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,840
Uh-oh.

438
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,740
The federal government did not even know about the convention center people until today.

439
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,300
You just found out about it today.

440
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,660
Don't you guys watch television?

441
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,240
Don't you guys listen to the radio?

442
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,300
I'm George W. Bush.

443
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,340
Disrupting communications.

444
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,060
And I approve this message.

445
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.

446
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,000
Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.

447
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,640
The FEMA directors were complaining.

448
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,780
Although, Blackie, quite frankly, I've seen you in better shape.

449
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,700
Kill me, Mom!

450
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,620
George Bush ain't a gold digger.

451
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm in need.

452
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,220
But he ain't with no broke niggas.

453
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:34,900
I got a .

454
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,940
George Bush don't like Black people.

455
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,820
Katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability to the federal government.

456
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,020
And the federal government didn't do its job.

457
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,440
And I take responsibility for what went wrong.

458
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,540
Are we incapable of dealing with a severe attack?

459
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,220
Or another severe storm?

460
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,580
It's in our national interest that we find out exactly what went on and what went wrong.

461
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

462
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,420
President Bush says.

463
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,980
The.

464
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,300
The.

465
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,020
The.

466
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,500
The.

467
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,780
The.

468
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,260
The.

469
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,440
The.

470
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,500
The.

471
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,760
The.

472
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,300
The.

473
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,580
The.

474
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,200
The.

475
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,980
The.

476
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,000
The.

477
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,820
The.

478
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,280


479
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,280


480
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,420
The.

481
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,340
The.

482
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:39,800
The.

483
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,040
The.

484
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,040


485
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,100
The.

486
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,180
The.

487
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,180


488
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,180


489
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,400
The.

490
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,920
The.

491
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,920


492
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,920


493
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,960
The.

494
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,240
The.

495
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,340
The.

496
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,280
The.

497
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,300
The.

498
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,600
We have a few tips so you can be prepared for floods, tornadoes, or even a quake.

499
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,160
You gotta be ready so your heart don't break.

500
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,940
Disaster prep is your responsibility, and mitigation is important to our agency.

501
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,960
People helping people is what we do, and FEMA is there to help see you through.

502
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,340
When disaster strikes, we are at our best, but we're ready all the time because disasters don't rest.

503
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,100
All right.

504
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,420
That was for real.

505
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,600
Amidst all the smells, did you get a sense that there was more crack?

506
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,580
I was struck people blame President Bush, blame President Bush.

507
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,720
He's the same guy that was on 9-11 with the white folks.

508
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,440
He hasn't changed.

509
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,180
The white folks.

510
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,240
The white folks, they are blaming President Bush.

511
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,780
They told me directly they're blaming President Bush.

512
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,980
George Bush, haunted by New Orleans to the last day of his presidency.

513
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,460
There are such low expectations.

514
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,500
Tell me something I don't know.

515
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,440
Expectations are so bad right now.

516
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,500
There are 10,000 dead bodies there that this is actually, Howard, going to be a win for President Bush.

517
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,760
A good one.

518
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:41,980
Right.

519
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,880
It's going to be much better.

520
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,980
Amidst all the smells.

521
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,340
So now I'm supposed to roll over like an old bitch dog getting my belly scratched?

522
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,760
Yeah.

523
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:56,620
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but don't you think a man with your talent, that your first obligation is to your gift?

524
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,900
Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?

525
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
What would that be, son?

526
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,520
I don't know exactly, but I do know what you're doing with that drink.

527
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,600
You're cutting yourself off from your gift and from Audrey and from your fellow man and from everything your art is about.

528
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,800
I don't know, son.

529
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,700
I'm building.

530
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm building a levee.

531
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,940
Gulp by gulp.

532
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,220
Brick by brick.

533
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,460
Putting up a levee to keep that raging river of manure from lapping at my door.

534
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,300
So anyway, Bush is in trouble.

535
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,840
Bush is in trouble.

536
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,760

Creepy little Bush is in trouble.

539
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,140
Devil Bill O'Reilly.

540
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,420
Ew!

541
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,500

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:41,680
Yeah.

544
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,940
Ha ha ha ha ha.

549
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,600
Propaganda.

550
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,360
Propaganda.

551
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,700
You know it.

552
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,100
You know it.

553
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,480
You know it.

554
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,840
You know it.

555
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,240
Creepy.

556
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,840
Nudge.

557
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,760
O'Reilly's.

558
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,200
You know.

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,520
Me.

560
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,540
Propaganda.

561
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,880
Now this is great.

562
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,600
Propaganda.

563
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,740
Ha ha ha ha ha.

564
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:55,980
Uh.

Um.

566
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,700
How screwed up.

567
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,220
Um.

568
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

569
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:00,900
Right.

570
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,500
Terrorism.

571
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,040
With affection.

572
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

573
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,260

Creep.

576
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:04,960
Creep.

577
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,680
Some weeks ago, Pat Robertson made a mistake in calling for the assassination.

578
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,200
Calling for the assassination of Bill O'Reilly.

579
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,120
Absolutely.

580
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,380
Most Americans loathe Pat Robertson.

581
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,260
They loathe me.

582
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,580
And that's the truth.

583
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Creepy little Bush is in trouble.

584
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,840
And that's the truth.

Well that's what's happening.

586
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

587
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,260
Put it up.

588
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,960
Turn America into a secular progressive jihad.

589
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,480
Hey, hey.

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,940
Try to look like a random shapie.

592
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,540
Come on.

593
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:38,660
Keep it in.

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,420

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,520
Bush, Bush, Bush, uh.

620
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,660

I know I've got religion.

631
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,920

It's time to play the blame game.

635
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,220
Blame.

Let's see how much time we can waste doing this before Lisa comes back.

637
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,100
Right in the middle of when we were supposed to start doing the blame game.

638
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,080
Who's Lisa?

639
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,860
Actually, that gives me a chance to give credits where credits are due.

640
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,480
We don't know who did the L.A. News thing that I read.

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,040
But it was signed by Joshua Gates.

642
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,180
Actor and victim.

643
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,080
Victim.

644
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,400
And posted by Bike Painter.

That's spelled N-O-R-E-L-P-R-E-F dot com.

Where you can get that and also his heavy confetti.

651
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,860
Heavy confetti-ish music.

652
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,880
Well, pref is also the Croatian word for fart.

653
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,580
No.

654
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,480
Which you're not allowed to say.

655
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,240
No.

656
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,920
But you can believe in such a thing.

657
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,520
You don't have to reiterate it.

658
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,560
That was a stinky thing to say.

659
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,940
Hey, we think it's time to play the blame game.

660
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,860
The blame game.

661
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,540
The blame game.

662
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,660
The blame game.

663
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,120
The blame game.

664
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,020

Bumbo bumba bumba.

677

Brownie.

679
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,280
Brownie.

680
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,880
Don't é!

681
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,080
Mi-my, mi-my original for female.

682
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,360
Banana banana for female.

683
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,020
Bi- Tough before mi-mah.

684
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,420
Female.

685
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,740
Baby boy now.

686
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:33,960


687
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:33,960


688
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,660
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Princess We Are Dough.

689
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,160
Dough.

690
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,920
Greatest.

691
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,680
Greatest show on earth.

692
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,100
Yes.

693
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,460
Oh, yes.

694
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,220
No.

695
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:23,520
No.

696
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,740
I've been...

697
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,120
Well, I've not yet recovered,

698
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,460
but...

699
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,180
When I do,

700
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,660
I promise,

701
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,520
I'll ride those ships.

702
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,080
I'll ride those

703
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,680
X-ing damn freaking ships

704
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,520
off into the blue cosmos.

705
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,280
One day,

706
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,140
Bob's words

707
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,900
will be in my brain,

708
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,500
buzzing the back of my vertebrae.

709
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,140
Hey, did you know I had

710
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,280
a really, really funny

711
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,740
erectile tissue?

712
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,260
Or not.

713
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,700
It's called a cartilage, actually.

714
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,460
No, I didn't.

715
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,540
Everybody has one

716
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:54,980
in their state.

717
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,440
Everybody has one.

718
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,260
Is it really funny?

719
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,100
No, it's not any funnier

720
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,940
than any of the rest of yours.

721
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,700
It's pretty much the same.

722
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,060
Speaking of funny birthdays

723
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,160
and the October subgenius holidays...

724
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,740
What is the October birthmark

725
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,160
for these funny people, Tuesday?

726
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,560
Well, here at...

727
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Crossed Eyes.

728
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,940
Cleveland's beautiful WCSB station studios,

729
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,240
it's October 2nd.

730
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,320
It's probably not when most people hear this,

731
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,360
but the great Reverend Numo,

732
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:39,040
vender and the great

733
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,080
nobody's friend,

734
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,660
is starting to understand

735
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,120
why all these тайline

736
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,540
and all related

737
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,680
things under the

738
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:49,680


739
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,340
Но efforts have to be made

740
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,360
song by

741
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,660
Gomer Pyle. I have

742
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,840
some pictures of Gomer Pyle

743
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,820
in the bathtub. The lattice of coincidence is just

744
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,980
beyond... Well, it is a coincidence because it's also the

745
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,600
birthday of

746
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,120
Gumby and Frank Sinatra

747
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,660
and another song I had

748
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,200
queued up was a song

749
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,840
about Gumby by

750
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,920
Frank Sinatra Jr. How old is

751
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,420
Frank Gumby now? This is way too messed up.

752
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,640
Well, I mean, synchronistically.

753
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,880
The original Frank Sinatra? No,

754
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,700
the Gumby version.

755
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,000
He is, she is, it is...

756
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
How many years now has Gumby been riding the train?

757
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,120
Gumby started shooting in Dallas

758
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,240
in the 60s. He's been a heroin addict

759
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,420
since the 60s? He started shooting

760
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,480
or he was born?

761
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,980
Art Clokey

762
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,700
gave birth to Gumby

763
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,340
in, I believe,

764
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,840
in Dallas. Was that an intro?

765
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,140
A guy named Foggy actually shot

766
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,360
the stop action of that

767
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,040
claymation. I often wondered,

768
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
you know, back in

769
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,340
those days,

770
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,060
they had to shoot Kodachrome,

771
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,540
which was an ASA of

772
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,260
25, which meant you had to have really

773
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,560
bright lights. And I've

774
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,420
worked with claymation, and that

775
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,340
stuff kind of sags and goops up

776
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,200
and melts under those bright lights and

777
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,160
also gives you terrible skin diseases.

778
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,420
So I often wondered, how did

779
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,340
they keep Gumby hard?

780
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,340
Hard enough to model?

781
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,360
Is that what Pokey was there for?

782
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,440
Unlike Icthresh, Gumby had no

783
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,580
wings of wax which to burn

784
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,200
under the heat of the sun. Who was Gumby's

785
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,580
all-in?

786
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,600
You can't shoot him in full sunlight, though,

787
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,460
because his nature begins to drift

788
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,920
and change like a werewolf.

789
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,720
Did you know that, Stan? Of course you did.

790
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,600
Yes, of course I did.

791
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,820
It indicates a possibility of where his name came from.

792
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,600
Well, I'm not going to read

793
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,500
off the entire list of everybody

794
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,940
who has a holiday in

795
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,640
October, but these are reasons why you can

796
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,140
celebrate and

797
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,680
fornicate as if your very heart depended on it.

798
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,440
Because these people were born

799
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,520
in this month. St. Buster

800
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,420
Keaton, St. Genghis,

801
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,540
St. Sonny Bean, I think

802
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,160
Dr. Sinister there would probably be into

803
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,140
Sonny Bean. He was in the same

804
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,580
similar business. St. Groucho Marx, who should be

805
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,840
a subgenius. St. Madeline Murray O'Hare,

806
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,600
the obnoxious great

807
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,560
atheist. The queen of no-god-is.

808
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,840
Sid Vicious and Nenslow,

809
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,720
St. Nenslow, share birthdays.

810
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,320
They both killed each other on the same night.

811
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,900
Alan Turing, who

812
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,960
both Emma Peel

813
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,760
and Lindy England.

814
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,240
Now, isn't that ironically bizarre?

815
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,620
Dean Martin and Jerry

816
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,780
Lewis on the same day.

817
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,160
St. Richelieu, St. Barbarella,

818
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,380
Timothy Leary,

819
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,420
Janis Joplin.

820
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,500
The day to be named later is the

821
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,420
25th.

822
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,320
And the 31st,

823
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,660
Halloween, is also

824
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,000
the birthday of St. Bob Crane.

825
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,880
And it is mandatory,

826
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,060
friends, that you must have a seance

827
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,180
for Bob Crane on that night.

828
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,580
It's also pater nostril.

829
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,740
And also, don't forget to take

830
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,700
a nylon stocking and tie off

831
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,160
your testicular vesicles

832
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,140
as tightly as you possibly can

833
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,220
on Robert Crane's birthday night.

834
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:02,920
That's right.

835
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,700
Is that what happened?

836
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,900
Well, they fell off before he actually fell out.

837
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,140
And that's why he became a Rosicrucian.

838
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,840
Or was first...

839
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,300
Well, he wasn't initiated.

840
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,060
He was kind of rubbed the wrong way.

841
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,640
What? Got rubbed the wrong way?

842
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,460
The rubber bands were applied.

843
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,380
It turned black and fell off.

844
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,720
But, quote, he could still use...

845
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,260
He could still use it, unquote.

846
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,960
Of course he could use it.

847
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,480
As much.

848
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,680
Speaking of tool using,

849
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,440
it was recently...

850
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,900
Gorillas have...

851
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,520
Gorillas have been...

852
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,980
That's the species name is Gorilla Gorilla.

853
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,120
Has been observed

854
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,380
using tools, simple tools,

855
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,980
like sticks, AK-47s.

856
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:45,940
Yeah.

857
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,160
They've been driving 4x4s for years now.

858
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,180
Simple tools.

859
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,940
Golf carts, linoleum rug beaters.

860
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,940
Yeah, golf carts.

861
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,820
The instant egg,

862
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,140
which you just plug into your necro wave,

863
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,700
or your munition thing.

864
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,740
Your necro wave?

865
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,300
Did you see?

866
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,320
Also in the news,

867
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,760
the third of the rich space tourists

868
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,180
took off today.

869
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,680
$20 million for an 11-day cruise

870
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,180
from the Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan,

871
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,020
seen here on slide 3,

872
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,240
via Soyuz,

873
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,700
to the space lab.

874
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,480
And the...

875
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,140
The rich guy gets...

876
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,300
The rich guy gets to come back after 11 days

877
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,000
with the other...

878
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,700
The Russian...

879
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,160
And the American astronauts

880
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
have to stay there

881
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,700
in that smelly box

882
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,420
for six months.

883
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,920
Well, this is what it...

884
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,840
This is what it's like

885
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,360
when you become

886
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,620
the commercial piker nations of the world

887
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,340
rather than the industrial military fornicators.

888
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,640
Well, I'm sure we have that

889
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,580
to look forward to.

890
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,640
You bend over and they work their way now.

891
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,880
You and me will be

892
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,180
caddying for Chinese millionaires

893
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,040
in the Grand Canyon

894
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,740
in five years.

895
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,360
No way around it.

896
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,240
I know that sounds harsh,

897
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,160
but think about it.

898
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,320
Yeah.

899
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,180
That's if we're lucky.

900
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,320
And we won't even be able

901
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,100
to afford one of them

902
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,660
damn new 2007 Sun Tours

903
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,680
or whatever they are.

904
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,740
It's going to take GM's place.

905
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,100
Ah.

906
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,880
I remember the first nostril sound.

907
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,340
The waves were so dense

908
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,900
I could hardly stand up.

909
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,880
When I grew to be a man,

910
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,980
I later understood

911
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,160
the meaning of these dense nasal waves.

912
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,400
Are you a member of the...

913
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,940
Are you?

914
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,800
Well, occasionally I have been a member

915
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
over the time of my life, yes.

916
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,460
Do you know the secret shake?

917
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,780
Well...

918
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,260
Do you know the secret shake?

919
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,260


920
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,300
Do you know the secret shake?

921
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,260
Do you know the secret nose blow?

922
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,940
By nature of being secret,

923
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,480
I can't really say.

924
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,320
Oh.

925
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,260
Well, then you're really

926
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,620
one of the inner circle.

927
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,160
You're not a square,

928
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,920
that's for sure.

929
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,080
Princess Sweet.

930
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,320
What's that point?

931
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,200
Taking advantage of your expertise,

932
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
do you think I should play

933
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,980
that Jim...

934
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,100
the Jim Neighbors

935
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,360
or Gomer Pile song?

936
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,080
Sounds a lot more like Gomer

937
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,640
than Jim.

938
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,140
How about the Orgon Pylon song?

939
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,400
We could like extricate

940
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,060
Jim's neighbors

941
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,020
and kill everything.

942
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,080
You know, just for the pure

943
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,280
bush-like hell.

944
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,840
Hell of it, you know?

945
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,480
Here, listen.

946
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,180
Get into the spirit of things.

947
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,020
Listen at this.

948
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,140
Go, Gomer.

949
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,200
Went walking down the street

950
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,960
one day, said,

951
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,580
hey there, my lady.

952
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,100
You sure look good to me

953
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
and I'd like to make you my baby.

954
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,880
Actually, I don't know

955
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,800
that this is Gomer.

956
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,360
What's he talk?

957
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,140
Sounds like...

958
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,980
He tried to make

959
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,780
Bart Reynolds his bitch one time.

960
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,840
And that's a weird story, Hollywood.

961
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,780
Everybody know that

962
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,940
screenwriters' guilt,

963
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,940
they were having a meeting.

964
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,600
It was on a corner

965
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,560
of Sunset and...

966
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,800
They were there

967
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,960
and there's a bar below there, man.

968
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,020
And all the bartenders

969
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,100
and everybody in town

970
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,140
knows about this, man.

971
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,120
Are you talking gossip

972
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,600
about Jim...

973
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm telling you, Jim...

974
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,260
The late actor and singer,

975
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,700
Jim Neighbors.

976
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,840
He tried to put a love...

977
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,300
A love thing on Bert Reynolds?

978
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,760
On Bert Reynolds.

979
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,800
Known heterosexual?

980
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,600
One-eyed...

981
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,880
What do you call a dog?

982
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,660
A monster.

983
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,460
I don't blame him a bit, man.

984
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,240
Bert Reynolds is a sex god.

985
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,260
Jim Neighbors is a sex god.

986
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,020
You gotta remember...

987
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,040
Dober Pyle is a subgenius god.

988
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,080
You gotta remember

989
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,040
back in the day, man.

990
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,420
Heart, heart, heart.

991
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,660
The deep old coffee woman,

992
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,820
but she had a hot dog heart.

993
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Hot dog heart.

994
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,320
Now I'm not an educated sailor.

995
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,320
I didn't go too far in school.

996
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,200
But I can count and read and write

997
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,980
and tell a horse from a mule.

998
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,320
But trying to judge a woman,

999
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,620
boy, it's bound to bring you fear.

1000
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,260
There's many different ways

1001
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,360
to judge a woman.

1002
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,340
But they all have the same size of ears.

1003
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,540
She...

1004
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,220
Yeah, just grab them and go to town.

1005
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,320
Oh, sorry there.

1006
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,080
Are you saying Jim Neighbors had an...

1007
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,960
He said he had an educated phallus.

1008
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,580
I first thought...

1009
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,620
Prehensile, actually.

1010
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,900
Like them, they're educated phallus.

1011
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,080
He was saying he has an educated phallus

1012
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,900
and that's why he's everybody's neighbor.

1013
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,900
Come on, man.

1014
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,980
It's not a real joke.

1015
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,020
It's not even a joke, but it's...

1016
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,540
What's the worst?

1017
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,140
The meanest...

1018
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,080
The meanest, worst thing

1019
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,120
that you can call a pink,

1020
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,000
a human,

1021
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,340
a mediocrity that moves in next door to you

1022
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,700
that starts with an N.

1023
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,860
Nosy neighbor.

1024
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,720
Nosy neighbor.

1025
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,560
Neighbor.

1026
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,040
Neighbor.

1027
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,040
Noseburger.

1028
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,100
How long have you been a member

1029
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,740
of the nasal forces, Linda?

1030
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,560
And the nasal forces?

1031
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,940
Yes, how long have you been

1032
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,240
a member of the nasal forces?

1033
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,360
Your tattoo is fading

1034
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,640
and I think you're trying to...

1035
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,460
Hypocryfy your way into these quarters.

1036
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,680
Turn back now.

1037
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,480
Turn around.

1038
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,060
Oh, I like that.

1039
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,860
Now turn around again.

1040
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,860
Now point this way.

1041
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,460
Put your leg up here.

1042
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,260
I'm getting dizzy now.

1043
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,560
Now, this is not a circus act.

1044
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,740
Just show me some...

1045
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,260
Okay.

1046
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:36,620
Yeah.

1047
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,900
Oh, wait.

1048
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,060
I'm in the wrong house.

1049
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,820
What does this nasal pornography

1050
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,340
have to do with the word Bob?

1051
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,180
Or then the fight,

1052
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,100
the good fight

1053
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,420
against the bad conspiracy?

1054
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,500
Bob loved having his sinuses

1055
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,080
frisked with sputum

1056
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,140
from many, many different clients.

1057
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,160
There were ladies of the night.

1058
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,880
There were the dogs of war.

1059
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,820
There were the winds of the evening

1060
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,320
that catapulted Bob into his...

1061
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,980
And the things that broke the winds

1062
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:03,980


1063
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,880
...sickening condition.

1064
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,240
The wind...

1065
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,740
The great breaker of winds,

1066
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,620
they called him.

1067
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,220
The cracker of all cheeks.

1068
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,340
He was a fully blown man.

1069
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,180
I mean, fully grown

1070
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,480
when he realized his mission here.

1071
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,240
He was a pilot light

1072
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,380
to those around him,

1073
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,620
those who saw him.

1074
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,080
Ah, enough.

1075
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,360
Every...

1076
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,140
Every emission

1077
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,160
from this great emissionary

1078
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,720
was what we now call

1079
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,860
a lubrifart.

1080
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,780
A preparatory emission.

1081
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,680
Thanks to Mr. Sister.

1082
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,100
To pave the way

1083
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,160
for a greater and thicker

1084
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,780
chunk of knowledge to emerge.

1085
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
I don't understand, though,

1086
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,800
how so many different people

1087
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,540
can understand

1088
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,920
the different tone values

1089
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,500
and the strange rasping sounds

1090
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,900
and make sense out of it.

1091
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,140
I just can't.

1092
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,060
To me, it just sounds like

1093
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,620
an elderly traveling sailor

1094
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,160
cracking wind with his...

1095
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,000
You should know,

1096
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,760
shouldn't you?

1097
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,580
Well, I should,

1098
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,660
but I'd like to be

1099
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
one of those mini-minions

1100
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,120
who, like,

1101
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,940
listen to bombs,

1102
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,000
excretions,

1103
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,780
and know what to do.

1104
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,220
Yes.

1105
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,220
In life, you know what I mean?

1106
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,500
You gotta, like I said,

1107
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,300
send the...

1108
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,600
Send $30.

1109
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,000
If you don't know

1110
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,080
what to eat, try food.

1111
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,060
If you don't know

1112
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,560
what to believe,

1113
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,060
send $30.

1114
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,900
Yeah, I suppose I will.

1115
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,780
To quote the great O-Nan,

1116
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,600
whose birthday is also in October.

1117
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,460
Enlightened,

1118
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,420
I will be enlightened

1119
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,620
when I see you.

1120
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,300
Send the $30.

1121
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,360
I'll be able to understand

1122
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,120
Bob's noises.

1123
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:27,780
Yes.

1124
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,300
Per se.

1125
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,700
Well, you pay to know

1126
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,600
what you really think,

1127
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,200
Bob said,

1128
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,700
and $30 isn't bad

1129
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,300
to fork out

1130
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,240
for what you really think.

1131
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,260
And what you really

1132
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,000
may already know,

1133
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,580
but you think

1134
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,440
you need to be told.

1135
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,880
Well, you know

1136
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,820
you need to be told.

1137
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,440
Let's not beat around the bush

1138
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,880
like we've been doing

1139
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,480
all week.

1140
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,200
Oh, no, that we need

1141
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,920
to be told.

1142
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,540
I need to be told.

1143
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,160
I don't listen.

1144
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,460
We need to be told

1145
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,540
that we need to be told

1146
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,880
and that's what Bob's here for.

1147
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,960
Dang it.

1148
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,360
Long may he wave

1149
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,300
his fractured, dry,

1150
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,520
consenting unity

1151
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,740
in the parched wind.

1152
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,060
Yes!

1153
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,920
Yes!

1154
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,080
Yes!

1155
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,500
Hell, Pope Huey

1156
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,820
did this background music,

1157
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,400
incidentally.

1158
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,880
It's called

1159
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,000
Bob of my thing.

1160
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,340
Version two.

1161
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,580
I must comment right now

1162
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,060
and before I forget.

1163
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,300
That this is some

1164
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,500
of the most wonderful

1165
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,780
ear candy I've heard

1166
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,740
in a week of Tuesdays.

1167
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,840
I think this is just

1168
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,100
a sumptuous feast

1169
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,240
from, um,

1170
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,360
for, for, for, for,

1171
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,980
for, for, for, for, for,

1172
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,820
Well, some would say

1173
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,880
why don't you shut up

1174
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,640
and listen to it?

1175
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,440
But that's not what

1176
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,760
we do on this show.

1177
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,720
Shutting up

1178
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,000
is not an option.

1179
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,820
Now we must just

1180
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,100
gabble and garble

1181
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,880
on and on

1182
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,500
until it's just all done.

1183
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,460
Well, now I do have, uh,

1184
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,880
songs coming up.

1185
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,320
Uh, for instance,

1186
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,040
as I said,

1187
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,900
the strangely synchronistic,

1188
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,300
uh,

1189
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:57,480
uh,

1190
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,720
Zappa Sinatra

1191
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,120
uh,

1192
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,360
collaboration

1193
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,880
on the Gumby theme,

1194
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,380
which was actually done

1195
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,700
seriously

1196
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,820
and with no tongue in cheek

1197
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,320
for the,

1198
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,120
probably,

1199
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,080
Gumby remake

1200
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,760
or something.

1201
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,960
And I've been, uh,

1202
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,860
transferring ancient

1203
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,880
subgenius songs

1204
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,420
from the,

1205
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
from the old,

1206
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,800
really olden days.

1207
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,640
From the 80s.

1208
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,500
It's actually plain,

1209
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,320
it's in, uh,

1210
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,600
I have a, a reggae,

1211
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,500
we have a reggae song

1212
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,360
coming up that,

1213
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,360
that when we play it

1214
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,080
for everyone else,

1215
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,400
it will leave our heads

1216
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,280
and stop playing

1217
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
over and over and over

1218
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,540
and over again.

1219
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,480
Oh,

1220
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,660
oh,

1221
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,000
oh,

1222
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,300
no,

1223
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,220
no.

1224
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,200
Is that Popeye?

1225
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,160
It's Popeye.

1226
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,780
Popeye?

1227
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,060
It's Popeye.

1228
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,020
It's Popeye.

1229
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,360
It's Popeye.

1230
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,940
It's Popeye.

1231
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,600
Popeye.

1232
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,100
The two chestnuts

1233
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,600
right there.

1234
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,740
I'm a Popeye

1235
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,400
the Sailor Man.

1236
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,740
I'm a Popeye

1237
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,220
the Sailor Man.

1238
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,040
Is that what they meant

1239
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,680
by spinach?

1240
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,220
I,

1241
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,400
I am.

1242
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,320
I'm trapped by the

1243
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,360
swollen leg.

1244
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,100
Oh,

1245
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,360
you're the flirty now,

1246
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,540
too,

1247
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,620
for the love of crates.

1248
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,680
Stand back there, sir.

1249
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,640
There's plenty of room

1250
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,180
for everything.

1251
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,340
Now, remember,

1252
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,780
take two of every kind.

1253
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
And let's not be kind

1254
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,640
about it.

1255
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,040
You,

1256
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,000
the ones with the,

1257
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,880
the furry hair.

1258
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,140
Oh,

1259
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,680
but the kind,

1260
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,380
The ones with the very

1261
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,920
coarse,

1262
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,640
coarse brillo pad

1263
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,320
on your heads

1264
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,640
and on your arms

1265
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,220
and on your necks

1266
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,880
and on your legs.

1267
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,640
On your feet

1268
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,120
and your ears.

1269
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,440
Yeah,

1270
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,140
you with,

1271
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,320
oh, wait.

1272
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,460
You're actually

1273
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,180
a piece of shit.

1274
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,660
Well,

1275
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,860
thank you very much

1276
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,500
for joining

1277
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,940
the Tonal Parade.

1278
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,060
Gleam,

1279
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,480
gleam.

1280
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,500
One of the many things

1281
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,320
we have to,

1282
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,580
uh,

1283
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,300
say when the,

1284
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,460
when the flannel

1285
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,200
goes down,

1286
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,880
when the handle,

1287
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,160
when the,

1288
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,360
when the,

1289
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,760
uh,

1290
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,360
when the,

1291
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,100
Oh,

1292
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,060
boy.

1293
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,280
He was once

1294
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,640
a little green

1295
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,000
dab of clay.

1296
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,000
Gone,

1297
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,200


1298
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,280
gone,

1299
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,280


1300
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,280


1301
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,280


1302
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,280


1303
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,760
But you should see

1304
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,300
what Gumby

1305
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,760
can do today.

1306
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,320
Gumby,

1307
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,760
he can walk

1308
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,640
into any book

1309
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,300
with his pony pal

1310
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,640
Pokey, too.

1311
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
And he'll find fun

1312
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,820
where there's none

1313
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,460
if you'd like him to.

1314
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,520
And if he likes,

1315
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,740
he can change

1316
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,600
into something new.

1317
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,220
You know,

1318
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,420
this song really

1319
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,440
sucks,

1320
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,180
I guess,

1321
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,960
would be the best way

1322
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:27,960


1323
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,160
You know,

1324
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,740
when I used to sing

1325
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,040
that song,

1326
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,800
I was living in Benson,

1327
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,780
I used to sing that song

1328
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,340
while I was on the street.

1329
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,160
I beat up every day,

1330
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,400
you know?

1331
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,480
You know what I'm saying?

1332
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,260
Hey,

1333
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:34,500
Stank.

1334
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1335
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,560
Yo, Stank.

1336
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1337
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,020
I was living in Benson.

1338
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,820
I grew up in Benson,

1339
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,200
you know?

1340
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,380
And I was walking

1341
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:39,940
down the street,

1342
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,120
you know,

1343
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,040
singing that snappy song,

1344
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,740
snapping my fingers

1345
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,120
and so forth,

1346
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,400
you know?

1347
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,660
And a guy come up

1348
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,300
and kick my ass

1349
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:44,960
all over the place,

1350
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,180
you know?

1351
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,160
Up and down a boy walk

1352
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,280
all the way to

1353
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,940
Canossie Park,

1354
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,200
you know?

1355
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:48,860
I wouldn't blame him.

1356
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,500
What the hell's up with that?

1357
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,180
I wouldn't blame him.

1358
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,440
I wouldn't blame him either.

1359
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,580
As long as we have to wear

1360
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,700
this strange foreskin

1361
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,660
on the top of our heads.

1362
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,140
It smells horrible.

1363
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,500
Ah, don't mind the smell.

1364
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,620
Soon we'll be through

1365
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,640
that veil of

1366
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,520
innoxious gases.

1367
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,460
Excuse me.

1368
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,060
Gases.

1369
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,320
And we'll be through

1370
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,440
the gaseous walls

1371
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,960
and everything will be...

1372
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,260
Oh, ah,

1373
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,520
we're in the wrong area.

1374
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,520
Jeez, oh my.

1375
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Now there's the usher

1376
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,200
over there.

1377
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:14,860
Uh,

1378
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,080
man,

1379
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,260
ma'am,

1380
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,740
sir, ma'am?

1381
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,340
Ma'am, sir?

1382
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,560
Yes, yes, ma'am, sir,

1383
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:18,940
that's me.

1384
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,880
I'd like to know

1385
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,040
how the hell out of here.

1386
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:21,740
Get...

1387
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,760
Well, uh...

1388
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,440
Can I get out, please?

1389
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes, um,

1390
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,260
just keep following

1391
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,060
the yellow brick road

1392
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:26,900
and pretty soon

1393
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,520
you'll get there.

1394
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,180
Follow that

1395
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,200
wafting smell

1396
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,780
of burning garbage.

1397
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,580
That's the froth

1398
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,960
from Bob's pipe.

1399
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,660
That's not a yellow

1400
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,580
brick road at all.

1401
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,280
Follow that smell

1402
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:36,820
of garbage

1403
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,800
from Bob's pipe.

1404
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,060
It's a yellow brick road.

1405
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,600
It's a smell that...

1406
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,080
Just keep believing

1407
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,980
it's a yellow brick road

1408
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,720
and it'll become

1409
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,480
a yellow brick road.

1410
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,840
I can't do anything

1411
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,800
with my belief system.

1412
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,640
I'm going to have to

1413
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,000
report on what I see

1414
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,560
on the server.

1415
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,320
Yes, sir.

1416
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,060
I don't know

1417
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,120
This is done

1418
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,340
Bhim

1419
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,740
Drunk

1420
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,880
Syrup

1421
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,660
із

1422
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:44,780
Zip

1423
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:44,780


1424
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:44,780


1425
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:44,780


1426
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:44,780


1427
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:44,740
Zip

1428
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:44,780
Stay

1429
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:44,800
Stay

1430
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,800
Shit air, and jet lags like smoking

1431
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,800
Piss your money away

1432
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,360
There won't be no rainy day

1433
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,980
If I will sell you all the sun

1434
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,420
He's unlike with your old old one

1435
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,920
But he ain't no man, he ain't no god

1436
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,420
I don't wanna walk the path Bob's tried

1437
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,900
He ain't no man, he ain't no god

1438
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:19,360
I don't wanna walk the path Bob's tried

1439
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,940
At his desk in Dallas

1440
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,480
When Dread Dab sits smoking

1441
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,000
Behind his mirrored windows

1442
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,460
When Dread Dab sits smoking

1443
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,600
Light up your pipe, let go the smoke

1444
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,160
This is smack, it ain't no joke

1445
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,660
Crispy to pop, lift up your chain

1446
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,200
And you will pay to know what you think

1447
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,860
But he ain't no man, he ain't no god

1448
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,360
I don't wanna walk the path Bob's tried

1449
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,880
He ain't no man, he ain't no god

1450
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:10,280
I don't wanna walk the path Bob's tried

1451
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:37,240
He ain't no man, he ain't no god

1452
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,060
If I will sell you all the sun

1453
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,060


1454
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,060


1455
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,060


1456
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,040
Can you take him to take him to Tupac Mane

1457
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,040


1458
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,040


1459
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,700
My eye-or and I and you

1460
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,780
Your best excuse, Bob for me and Bob for you

1461
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,040
No matter what, a little thumbs up, new buddy

1462
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,980
Ain't no man, ain't no guy

1463
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,440
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

1464
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,100
Ain't no man, ain't no guy

1465
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:08,500
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

1466
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:41,420
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

1467
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:49,840
Well, friends, from the unreleased subgenius album, The Hairs in Bob's Ears.

1468
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:57,120
I think the Lost Souls were part of the Babashanti cult, a sect.

1469
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,620
They're a sect of the Babashanti or the Babadreds.

1470
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,260
A subcult of the Dread Cult, of the Dread.

1471
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,400
The Babadreds.

1472
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,080
The Papadreds.

1473
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:12,580
And like herring, they communicate with each other via a high-pitched raspberry-like sound emitted from their anus.

1474
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,340
And smoke signals.

1475
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,640
Well, yes, of course, it goes along with the high-pitched sounds emitted from their anuses.

1476
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,200
Which came first, the smoke or the sound?

1477
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,040
The herring, which came first?

1478
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,720
But you don't want to tread the path that Bob tried.

1479
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,580
Actually, the herring's not even breathing hard.

1480
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,160
Well, let's give it a little poke here.

1481
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,080
Hey, wait a minute, we can forget this herring.

1482
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,660
We gotta get back on the path to Bob.

1483
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,360
Smoke on there, baby.

1484
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,900
Bob tried.

1485
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,120
Ah, that feels terrible.

1486
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,880
I can't, what's happening to my...

1487
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,480
Oh.

1488
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,180
Follow, just follow the trail.

1489
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,280
The trail of those cotter pins and jello.

1490
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,180
I'm trying.

1491
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,260
Look, they're falling apart.

1492
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,660
It's up to you, Dave.

1493
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,400
Smoking isn't helping.

1494
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,860
You must...

1495
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,780
The jello is slippery and the cotter pins...

1496
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,060
You must find Bob.

1497
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,080
Keep on saying, keep smoking this.

1498
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,180
And look at the cotter pins as the jello molds fold.

1499
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,860
And I can't keep my eyes focused on that pipe in the distance with all this confusion.

1500
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,260
And what's that?

1501
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,140
Why?

1502
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,040
I don't know.

1503
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,860
It's some sort of suspense sound made by an orchestra or some group of people with instruments.

1504
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,580
Something.

1505
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,360
That usually means something terrible is about to happen.

1506
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,360
It could happen.

1507
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,660
Look, there's a cave and there's a sign that says, don't enter, monster inside.

1508
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,840
Oh, man, let's go.

1509
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,800
What a setup.

1510
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,360
Couldn't it have been a little bit more subtle?

1511
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,360
If we don't go in there, everything will have to stop now.

1512
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,860
Well, we don't have to necessarily...

1513
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,000
We can, like, wait around and be scared before we go in.

1514
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,360
Somebody has to go in there and get killed.

1515
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:31,900
All right.

1516
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,540
Otherwise, what have we got?

1517
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,340
Do we have any ethnic people we could send in there so the rest of the white people...

1518
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:36,460
Yeah, yeah.

1519
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,360
Well, first.

1520
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,860
But eventually, eventually, you're probably going to have to get killed.

1521
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,200
Oh, yeah.

1522
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,260
Yeah, there's nobody else.

1523
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,120
And I'll have to save her.

1524
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,520
Well, you could also sacrifice her to...

1525
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,080
Well, it's not one of those...

1526
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,440
No, no, no.

1527
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,140
Somebody has to save her or else...

1528
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,460
Not a virgin, yeah.

1529
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,100
We don't have a show.

1530
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,960
Yeah, not a virgin.

1531
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,700
But anyway, okay.

1532
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,780
What do I do?

1533
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:55,580
What?

1534
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,180
Well, why ask?

1535
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,260
Go in the cave where it says the monsters...

1536
00:51:59,260 --> 00:51:59,880
Okay.

1537
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,760
I don't have to do anything but be coerced into having my head ripped off.

1538
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,220
All right, I'll just...

1539
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,580
Wait, look.

1540
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,960
A pair of brand new shiny booties.

1541
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,000
Look, they've got little points on the end of them.

1542
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,000
I don't have to do anything for any of you people.

1543
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,460
I believe in a new Dobbs.

1544
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,380
I believe in a new word.

1545
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,560
Fool!

1546
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,240
You've fallen directly into my trap.

1547
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,980
What an idiot.

1548
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,520
But I knew he would do it.

1549
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:25,580
What?

1550
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,360
He's so simple-minded.

1551
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,280
He's subgenius-ist.

1552
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,620
Don't look at him enough.

1553
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,040
They're such piddling earth fools.

1554
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,840
Who are you?

1555
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,520
What are you?

1556
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,080
I am the true Ivan Stang.

1557
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,740
Oh, you don't look like the true Ivan Stang.

1558
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,840
Master of the mimeograph.

1559
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,900
The cassette tape deck.

1560
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,840
You're a falsified profiteer.

1561
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:53,220
Under 80s forms of fanzine publication in college radio shows.

1562
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,740
Oh, no.

1563
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
Why are you laughing while I'm in English?

1564
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,740
What's so freaking funny?

1565
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,540
I am so much cooler than Steven Spielberg and his ilk.

1566
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,760
Though they may be wealthy, tall, rich.

1567
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,160
Intelligent, educated, and other useless things.

1568
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,620
They do not have Bob.

1569
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,620
Now do they?

1570
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,680
Yes, but you are as useless as they are.

1571
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,480
And I possess Bob!

1572
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,800
Bob is mine!

1573
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,220
Yes, yes, it's possible to own Bob.

1574
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,800
Why not?

1575
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,300
Why not?

1576
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,500
Did I not serve him long enough?

1577
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,580
Sweating under his grip in that dank cave in Tibet.

1578
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,180
As he instructs me to do my job.

1579
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,660
And he instructed me the so-called initiation.

1580
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,960
I'm still hurting and sore down there from that.

1581
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,340
Yes, I've paid enough.

1582
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,720
And now I, Stang, shall rule Dobstown!

1583
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,460
Ah, Master.

1584
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,480
In my iron pinky.

1585
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1586
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,960
Ah, Master.

1587
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,160
Master, there are these forms from the uniform code ministry.

1588
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,140
Oh, those again.

1589
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,240
There are these forms of the torturing forms.

1590
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,760
Oh, yes, all right.

1591
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,720
Go ahead and...

1592
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:15,580
If you are going to torture this victim, you will have to sign this release and this release there.

1593
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:24,400
And I hereby swear that any strange activities created on the back of this man's skull, although they may emit the nauseous gases and...

1594
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,740
Don't you...

1595
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,120
Don't we have a rubber stamp for this?

1596
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,320
...proporial eventuality of another cosmos...

1597
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,720
This is ridiculous.

1598
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,820
Move right on to this document here.

1599
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,200
Is this professional?

1600
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:31,480
Yes.

1601
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,840
There's nothing professional about this.

1602
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,520
I understand, sire, but it all must be uniquely and triplicate.

1603
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:36,580
Oh, wait, no!

1604
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:36,880
What is...

1605
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,600
What is this?

1606
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,620
What could it be that he has returned?

1607
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,180
Is it...

1608
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,260
Is it truly...

1609
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:42,680
Am I...

1610
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,740
Is it truly Bob himself come to...

1611
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,920
To destroy me?

1612
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,500
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Bob.

1613
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,720
My guest today is Bob, the art of positive persuasion.

1614
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,760
Bob is a writer.

1615
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,000
Bob is also a staunch supporter and defender of...

1616
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,740
Stereotypical, fast-walking, slick-talking sales guy.

1617
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:03,400
You know, the one who sort of sticks their hand out and glad hands and back hands and slaps hands and shakes hands and...

1618
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,640
Right.

1619
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,820
Bob, thanks for being my guest.

1620
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,520
And he is somebody that practices what he preaches.

1621
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:07,820
Give.

1622
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,540
You can see Bob's heart come right through it.

1623
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,460
Bob, this is what I like most about Bob.

1624
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,340
It's giving.

1625
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,780
Just so darn wonderful.

1626
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,180
Now...

1627
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,700
Now you're in a position...

1628
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,040
And is it something that...

1629
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,260
That I can do effectively in a five or ten minute time frame?

1630
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,100
Oh, absolutely.

1631
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,520
It's a one-on-one in a...

1632
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,200
A group, at a party, at a...

1633
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,380
Most people think it's worthless.

1634
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,860
Well, it is.

1635
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,520
If we're doing this correctly...

1636
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,660
Now, get this.

1637
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,980
We're being, you know, pushy or obnoxious.

1638
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,280
And it always blows me away.

1639
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:34,620
Mm-hmm.

1640
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,780
Bob, you talk about...

1641
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,020
Wonderful.

1642
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,580
Extraordinary, neat, feel good.

1643
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,140
Feel good.

1644
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,540
You're out of line.

1645
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,260
I've got ten of them in my arsenal.

1646
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,320
You should devour.

1647
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:45,660
Absolutely.

1648
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,000
And you should devour it again and again and again.

1649
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,920
Thirty seconds.

1650
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,300
They're not necessarily ready for it yet.

1651
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:51,900
Big shot.

1652
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,080
Flies in the face.

1653
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,200
Find this person's pain, you know.

1654
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,720
Let's find their joy.

1655
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,960
Let's make them feel good.

1656
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,000
How about this wretched excuse for a life?

1657
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,180
Bob, you know, Bob...

1658
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,380
Absolutely a tremendous, tremendous look.

1659
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,000
We're gonna talk about...

1660
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1661
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1662
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1663
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1664
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1665
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1666
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000


1667
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,580
We're gonna talk to Bob.

1668
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,200
Hi, this is Jack Trout, author of Trout on Trout.

1669
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,560
You're listening to Bob.

1670
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,920
And you can contact Bob at www.bob.com.

1671
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,140
Oh, my absolute pleasure.

1672
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:17,540
Thank you.

1673
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,780
Could go on for days and days and days.

1674
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,200
Now...

1675
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,600
Feel good.

1676
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,540
Feel to the rim and...

1677
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,200
That's wonderful.

1678
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:24,960
Come see me.

1679
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,220
Right.

1680
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,260
It may be time to consider, right?

1681
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,180
All right, Bob.

1682
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,340
I'm gonna put you on the spot.

1683
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,880
Well, Bob, thank you so much.

1684
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,820
I'm fine.

1685
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:35,980
I'm fine.

1686
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:35,980


1687
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:35,980


1688
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:35,980


1689
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,460
You know, the good news is that he is a catatrophre.

1690
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,440
I can't believe it.

1691
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,300
I just can't.

1692
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,880
You know, in a way, they're better off than we are.

1693
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,300
There's no sense.

1694
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,260
There's no feel.

1695
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1696
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,340
My grandmother used to always say that every time she hit her head, she'd say, oh, don't

1697
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,200
worry, there's no sense.

1698
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,980
There's no feeling.

1699
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,980
Do you remember when we had given second short, the other day?

1700
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:05,980


1701
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:05,980


1702
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:05,980


1703
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:05,980


1704
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,260
Afterwards, that was a bloody ball smack.

1705
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,220
I'm my grandmother's daughter.

1706
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,400
I'm my grandmother's granddaughter.

1707
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,240
Do you remember when we divisected and removed her breasts?

1708
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,740
No, I have no memory.

1709
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,960
I blacked that completely out.

1710
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,260
Shouted the fruit trees in the yard.

1711
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,260
There's too many crows and ravens and things flying around my head.

1712
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:34,180
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1713
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:40,320
I feel like my mind has been corrupted by something much smaller than myself.

1714
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,140
Episode number 1015.

1715
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,580
Violent shows may be episodic.

1716
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:59,900
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius, feel free to visit www.subgenius.com.

1717
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,400
For more disinformation on the...

1718
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:04,800
Subgenius?

1719
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,440
I could give the P.O. box, but nobody ever writes to hour of slack.

1720
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,480
That's where the disinformation comes from, right?

1721
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,160
181-417-Cleef and Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1722
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,220
I'm just saying, some people would rather get the disinformation than the information at the...

1723
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,120
What other address would you like not want to give?

1724
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,460
Do you prefer the disinformation?

1725
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,300
Perhaps they like to be lied to.

1726
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,480
Well, part of the game is figuring out which is the info and which is the disinfo.

1727
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,180
It's all a game, isn't it?

1728
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,800
Is it dis or is it dat?

1729
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
Is it blind girls?

1730
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,460
Is it a sad story?

1731
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,200
And these fine dat recordings are brought to you by the Subgenius Foundation.

1732
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,220
Now that's what I call sad.

1733
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,640
And recorded at the studios of WCSB.

1734
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:57,220
And at the studios, which probably means the computers, of Reverend Norrell Preff and the great Fernanda Nandi Lemur.

1735
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,420
Under the watchful gaze of Hector Berlioz in a lady's undergarment.

1736
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,300
And the way Polka Chorus.

1737
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,180
Ladies and gentlemen, this is his finest...

1738
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,160
And now...

1739
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,760
And now...

1740
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:16,980
This!

1741
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,720
Quit your job!

1742
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,060
Slack off!

1743
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,900
We're gonna fix ourselves a tray.

1744
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,840
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1745
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,820
Oh, what a day.

1746
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,740
It's a damn good day.

1747
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,800
What a day.

1748
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,700
Oh, it's a hot flying day.

1749
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,620
If I don't find heaven funny, you're gonna give me back my money.

1750
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,760
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1751
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,460
Well, it's a damn good day to be talking to my savior.

1752
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,340
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1753
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,160
We got a lot of...

1754
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,220
A lot of bread to break.

1755
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,120
We're gonna walk out on the lake.

1756
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,080
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1757
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,800
And it's a damn good day to go to heaven.

1758
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,620
And it's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1759
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,280
He keeps the rain off my back and he fills me full of slack.

1760
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,320
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1761
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,080
Oh, what a day.

1762
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,960
It's a damn good day.

1763
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,920
What a day.

1764
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,760
Oh, it's a hot flying day.

1765
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,480
If I don't find heaven funny, you're gonna give me back my money.

1766
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,400
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1767
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,200
Yeah, I remember one night in this card game in Vegas.

1768
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,900
I was down to my last dollar bill.

1769
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,660
And Bob blew into town, laid four aces down,

1770
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,500
and made away that night with a kill.

1771
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,140
Yeah, now my eyes are open and I'm walking on the water.

1772
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,980
Got a roll of cash as big as my hand.

1773
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,720
Got a guarantee for slack.

1774
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,420
Triple money back.

1775
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,260
More joy than I can stand.

1776
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,020
Yeah, and when I get to heaven, I'm shouting hallelujah.

1777
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,660
And the angels, they have carried me away.

1778
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,540
Oh, what a joy I will share.

1779
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,260
I will need my underwear.

1780
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,080
What a damn good, damn good day.

1781
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,020
Yeah, and now I'm on my knees.

1782
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,880
The spirit is upon me.

1783
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,420
And the angels, they join up with me to say,

1784
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,120
Will I?

1785
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,220
And I'll begin to sing.

1786
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,040
Bob will tune the old six-string.

1787
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,760
And he'll play it in his own special way.

1788
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,660
Oh, what a day.

1789
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,640
What a day.

1790
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,220
It's a damn good day.

1791
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,220
What a day.

1792
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,860
Oh, it's a high-flying day.

1793
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,720
If I don't find heaven funny,

1794
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,620
you're going to triple back my money.

1795
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,560
It's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1796
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,220
Oh, what a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1797
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,880
Oh, it's a damn good day to talk to Bob.

1798
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,240
That was Reverend John from the album

1799
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,440
Haters and Bards, Ears, Precious Bows.
