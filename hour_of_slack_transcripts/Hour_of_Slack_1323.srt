1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Like, drop, I'd love to test it back. Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:16,980
Praise Bob, Gold, and Connie's rack. Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,600
Thank you and welcome to the Hour of Slack number 1,323.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Friends, in this particular episode, we'll pick up exactly where we left off last week.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,140
Continuing a detailed discussion, minus the songs, of the Port-A-Potties, or chem toilets,

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,440
at Wisteria Campground Community in Southern Ohio, where the Church of the Sub-Gene was held

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,180
the 14th, actually the 16th, X-Day Drill.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,060
Live participants on the Caffeinus Cafe stage, using equipment from Tarzan's radio station,

9
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,540
which I finally set back up in my home office,

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,820
include Dr. Howland Owl, Father Joe Mama, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,980
The discussion, recorded July 1st, 2011, meanders all over the place, and as I mentioned,

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,740
it begins with a fearlessly detailed discussion of the campground toilet facilities.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,620
You know, for sissies, we could hold X-Day drills inside hotels, like a comic book convention,

14
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,680
but X-Day is meant to be a...

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
a little bit more than that.

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,620
A life-changing event, and the real-life experience of the endless struggle of man,

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,600
or rather, subgenius against nature, is critical to separating these subgenius drills from

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,060
any other mock-religion, fanboy, diddly-puss, nerd cons, making ours truly not merely more

19
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,900
passive entertainment for an increasingly obese and inactive slave population, but as

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,520
initiation ceremonies, one might say.

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,780
Gauntlets and survival tests that do, indeed, effectively separate the trend-following coattail

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,380
riders from the true subgenius sons and daughters of the Yeti.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,980
I'm not saying you have to be some kind of pink-boy health nut.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,900
Many of our most active subgenius X-Day goers are what the conspiracy might call morbidly

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,720
obese, or at least a bit pudgy.

26
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,360
Big deal.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,160
Um...

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,400
So now, back to...

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,520
Um...

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,140
Back to Father Joe Mama and naturalist Dr. Howell.

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
Oh, I should mention the music in the background here.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,780
It was recorded at X-Day the first night by, I think it's Bishop Stick and Reverend Frodo

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,100
Suds-Pasha on guitar.

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,320
Anyway, back to Father Joe Mama and Dr. Howell on the zoology of the sacred subgenius campground

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,280
sweat lodges, also known as chem toilets.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,760
Well...

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,140
And the other thing to watch out for is, you know, you can go in there with your flashlight

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,020
and examine every little inch of that little stall for mosquitoes.

39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,960
If you're like me, you don't want to get bitten by mosquitoes, only to discover that they

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,280
are all hiding underneath the body.

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,980
That's right.

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,920
They are waiting for you to sit down.

43
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,120
Then when you get up, you'll discover just how many were in there.

44
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,800
That shouldn't be, because the chemicals ought to freak them out.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,320
In fact, they should be about the most bug-free spots out here.

46
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,520
Well, that's true.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,520


48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,660
But you never know.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:35,380
Now, in classic rural outhouses, that's where most black widow spider bites in rural areas

50
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:44,820
occur, from scrotums dangling down into webs built by Lactrodecta, because she finds that

51
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,420
this is the ideal place to catch insects flying in down to the pit.

52
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,500
Also, in Arizona, I have observed giant scorpions the size of small lobsters, which fly in

53
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,500


54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,760
the middle of the ground and run about actively over the surface of the crapola down there,

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,380
orange in color and covered with hideous bristles standing out.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,180
So here you got it easy.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:16,700
Why, in rural Arkansas and in the Ozark Mountains, outhouses are full of gigantic huntsman spiders,

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,260
which are most disquieting to watch when you realize that you can't see all of them.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,420
Few people realize, according to Stanley, that the original manuscript, Spider-Man,

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,480


61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:35,720
was a black widow spider biting the scrotum of Mr. Parker as he sat on one of these outhouse

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,140
toilets.

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,580
But they figured that was a little...

64
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,780
Well, that would be an ordeal.

65
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,880
One wouldn't want to go through it.

66
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,960
This is a point where I could make a personal inside story joke, and I'm going to resist.

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,500
Do you want to?

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you weighing the pros and cons?

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000


70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,580
No, I'm going to resist.

71
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,580
He doesn't want to.

72
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,500
For the first time ever.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,760
I know about that predicament.

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,380
If we're talking about scrotums and black widow spiders looking for something to mate

75
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,960
with...

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,160
A harmless prank that went awry.

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,080
We're already dangling on that edge as to whether or not this portion could be broadcast

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,560
or not.

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,100
Stang wants to take it completely over the edge.

80
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,380
Yeah, we have to be on the air with this stuff, you know.

81
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, I know.

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,140
Every time I say a bad word, I know I'm going to have to bleep it out for the stations,

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
the actual stations that play it.

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,600
On the other hand, on pirate radio, I can play it as long as I want and as completely

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
as I want.

86
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,940
Yeah, but I can't replay it without cutting it.

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:25,940


88
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,720
I think you're blocking the...

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,820
You've got a delay, right?

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,340
It's not so much the words anymore, now they're after you about the ideas, the concepts.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,120
Obscenity doesn't necessarily mean a four-letter word, but a four-letter concept, you might

92
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,180
say.

93
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,440
An offensive...

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
All you need is one complaint, actually, in the terrible way things have gotten ever

95
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,220
since they put Michael Powell, the son of Colin Powell, in charge of the FCC.

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,740
But...

97
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,400
But, of course, you need that bastard out there not only to make the complaint but to follow through.

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,000
And didn't Al Gore's wife, Man Bear Pig, cause a lot of hassle for musicians?

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,220
She objected, but this was in the nature just of a public movement, not of something done on the official level.

100
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,840
That's the difference with the restructuring of the FCC in the last administration.

101
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,560
Oh, they just were recommending that people look at the lyrics on these terrible CDs.

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,280
What? They buy CDs? No, they don't. They download everything.

103
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,820
They don't read the outside. They don't read, you know, go home, Tipper, go to bed.

104
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,900
You just need to put on your sign on screen, you know, that what you're looking at may contain offensive material.

105
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,060
If they have that at the beginning of every time you log on, there'll be no more problems.

106
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,820
Now, see, this would be my cue in editing to cut to...

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,740
You know, the copy of Cop Killer by Ice-T, which I happen to have in this little bag here.

108
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm never without my copy of Cop...

109
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,900
You know, and the sad thing, I mean, that's so tame compared to what you hear on the common radio today.

110
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,340
You know, just average everyday rap songs, music videos.

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,680
It's South Park. What happened?

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,040
Well, you need to have that on CDs so that when you get pulled over by the highway patrol

113
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,320
and you open up the front fumes pouring out, you have the front...

114
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,420
You turn it up. Cop killer, fuck the police! Cop killer, fuck the police!

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,180
Yes, sir, may I help you?

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,240
But tonight we get even!

117
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,140
I'll show you how to handle a fucking pig. Hey, pig!

118
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,680
Well, you could do that.

119
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,860
Actually, we have a great subgenius, Puzzling Evidence,

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,840
who just has the right stuff to be able to put cops at their ease no matter what.

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,860
It's just from his body language or his mustache or something.

122
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,800
He rolls down the window and immediately all the cop problems go away.

123
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
He's a hypnotic unibrow.

124
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,180
He just makes those movements that...

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,640
I don't know. You know, he was in military intelligence.

126
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,400
He grew up in a military family.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,400
He used to broadcast radio out of Gooney Bird over the South China Sea.

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,740
Some say he has...

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,960
Other connections.

130
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,540
Of course, these people are what we call loony.

131
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,920
This is why he was the Manchurian candidate for Bob

132
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,500
and ended up being the one who first killed Bob.

133
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,440
He was a sleeper set in motion.

134
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,960
We've completely forgiven him because of all of his other wonderful, notable works and undertakings.

135
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,380
Besides which, killing Bob was a great thing for us.

136
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,280
We couldn't do it ourselves, but our religion demanded that he die and be resurrected.

137
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,560
We still insist, though, that if you see puzzling evidence over in the corner somewhere playing solitaire,

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,900
that you remove all the queens.

139
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,540
Puzzling evidence is here, but we just missed him.

140
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,480
He ran into town for beer or something.

141
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
It's like camouflage. You can't really see him even when he's there.

142
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,320
But he's a good person to have if you're ever stopped by a cop or any authority figure

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,000
because he will just cause all that to go away simply by sitting there

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,780
even before he starts babbling about his favorite subjects.

145
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,780
Guam.

146
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,740
Custer's Last Stand.

147
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,820
Vietnam.

148
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,620
The Kennedy assassination.

149
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,920
Harvey Oswald.

150
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,780
Yeah.

151
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,380
And they all flow together, you know.

152
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,160
They all become part of the same thing.

153
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,040
He'll talk to some bewildered security guard who shuffles out to see what he's doing there in the middle of the night

154
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,500
and be telling him about conditions on Okinawa or Guam or something.

155
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,660
It's like the Cylons.

156
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,080
They always recognize another Cylon and never fire on them.

157
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,720
So anyone in a position of authority recognizes the Wellman slash puzzling evidence gene.

158
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,980
They do recognize it in some strange way.

159
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,800
Absolutely no kidding.

160
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,820
And it just must be that he unconsciously projects the signals which indicate that you're squared away,

161
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,780
you know, and you're the real deal.

162
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,200
And not a civilian.

163
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,820
In fact, he's usually guilty as hell of something.

164
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,420
He's always. He's totally.

165
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,040
He's broken every human law.

166
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,400
He breaks the law of gravity.

167
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:30,420
When I travel around this great free country of ours, I always look like this.

168
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
It's the whole reason for my hat.

169
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,940
Mr. Smith from Ohio.

170
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes, I'm now Mr. Smith from Ohio.

171
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Doesn't he look normal, friends?

172
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,620
When it's all tucked in.

173
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,580
The perfect neighbor.

174
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,680
And, you know, I...

175
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,560
Like a good neighbor.

176
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,400
Like a good neighbor.

177
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,400


178
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,400


179
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,040
You're so much more polite when you have a haircut.

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,000
But you take out the hat and you say, imagine that.

181
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,320
Me working for you.

182
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,760
But if with my hair down, I figure, oh, he's just a retired construction worker redneck.

183
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,920
You know, a meth head.

184
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,720
And treat me like garbage.

185
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,180
Second class citizen.

186
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,960
You know, with the hat on, you look more like someone who would be buying the drugs.

187
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,060
But when you take the hat.

188
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,380
Do the other thing.

189
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,640
With the hat, you look like someone who would be selling.

190
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,800
It's creepy.

191
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,300
Confound their knavish tricks.

192
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:37,140
Well, luckily, friends, cheap bathtub methamphetamine has taken the cops' attention off of harmless things like marijuana.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,060
And they still bust you for a frop.

194
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,560
But most of them don't know what it looks or smells like.

195
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,320
But if you have...

196
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,560
You know, pot on you.

197
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,160
Luckily, these days, the dogs, either they're not really trying to smell anything.

198
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,980
They're just trying to run around and look excited so that you'll get paranoid.

199
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,620
And the cops can then scare you into searching, giving them permission to search your car.

200
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:15,140
Or as the policeman told my friend, Doc Frop, the other day, when Doc Frop had said, would you have searched my car if I was a little old lady?

201
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,860
They said, well, now we have a methamphetamine problem over here.

202
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,620
We realized that the dogs were trying to sniff for meth chemicals now.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,160
Because, I mean, this was Doc Frop we're talking about.

204
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,760
He's made of illegal substances.

205
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,740
Well, in essence...

206
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,300
I mean, his DNA is the same as that of Jack Harer crossed with G1.

207
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,480
Everyone has their place, though.

208
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,040
I mean, the little old lady's going to get their adult diaper examined at...

209
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,460
Yeah, at TSA.

210
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,040
So, you know, it just depends on where you are.

211
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,440
The babies, the elder people, they get strip searched at the airport.

212
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,140
That's true.

213
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:04,860
And then everyone else gets it if you're a male or maybe a decent looking female that they want to feel up alongside the road.

214
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,940
And the whole idea is to keep everybody off balance.

215
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,120
You always want to feel like you really are in their hands and they have control.

216
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Because that's what it's all about is the conspiracy wants to keep control.

217
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,660
And that means that you must succumb to them.

218
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,500
Command and control.

219
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,900
It goes all the way back to the days of Scottish rights and English rights where they can actually

220
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,120
have sex with the ladies who are about to get married and be the first one to deflower them.

221
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,460
The Droit de Seigneur.

222
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,880
This is what the conspiracy wants to work its way back toward.

223
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,820
The conspiracy?

224
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,860
Hell, why aren't we doing that?

225
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,100
Well, they're not.

226
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
They want to do both sexes though.

227
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,080
They also want to do the males.

228
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,820
I mean, I've performed an awful lot of weddings and it just now occurred to me.

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
Shouldn't I be claiming the first right of sacred scrubs?

230
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
Well, if we did that, that would be one way of preventing the conspiracies from doing

231
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,300
it because they want to be the first.

232
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,480
So if you succumb to a subgenius preacher, you don't have to worry about him.

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,380
I think you have to be a feudal lord and invest fiefs and so forth.

234
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,260
Now, at some point this weekend we'll have a mass short duration marriage.

235
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,080
Obviously, right now is not.

236
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,900
Not the time to do that.

237
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,300
No, this is, the stars are not right.

238
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,580
And the audience is not here.

239
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,660
This is a typical hour of slack at X Day.

240
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,440
They wouldn't be in the proper mood to constantly.

241
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,780
They all have fun things to do and so do we.

242
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:35,840
When released from having to be behind this lectern, we will all find inordinately entertaining

243
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,420
things with which to occupy ourselves.

244
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,300
You know, a lot of people don't realize that standing up here behind these microphones

245
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,580
is almost as painful.

246
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,080
It's beautiful.

247
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,960
It's like being on the other side with the speakers, but it's our cult duty.

248
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,880
It's like David.

249
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,780
It's worse than digging post holes in the hot sun.

250
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,740
I got to tell you.

251
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,440
You have to sit there and just endure it.

252
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,300
It's it's.

253
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,340
Oh, and what's even worse is having to edit it after you've already heard it once.

254
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,000
Sweating blood.

255
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,160
Then you have to go through and listen to it again and again.

256
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,800
Backwards, forwards.

257
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
Christ's blood streams in the firmament.

258
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,240
That's what I meant.

259
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,600
Show host syndrome.

260
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
You know, we, we.

261
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:21,320
Chew up, damage some of our slack just to bring slack to others, to the unknowing herd.

262
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,180
Yeah, that means you should bribe us more.

263
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,560
Some believe that the whole purpose of these shows isn't to clarify and enlighten the subgenius,

264
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,720
but to help confuse and confound him more.

265
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,020
Well, he might need that because the conspiracy provides that in the form of distraction boxes,

266
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,620
which everyone carries around to keep them from looking at the world and having individual

267
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:43,940
thoughts.

268
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,860
We also provide a distraction to ease the pain of thought because nothing hurts like

269
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,280
thinking.

270
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,500
And the purpose of thinking is not to have to think at all.

271
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,980
Once you've solved a problem, then you don't need to think.

272
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,220
Just like the purpose of drinking is not to have to drink.

273
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,900
Once you have drunk, you are no longer thirsty.

274
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,380
Then you could just have the religious ecstasy waif over you like fumes and you not even

275
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,280
have to worry about what it means anymore.

276
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,080
It's just there.

277
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:13,980
You can feel it.

278
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,540
No, there is a pain involved in intellection.

279
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:25,160
And I'm reminded of the epigraph to the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas from Dr. Samuel

280
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,180
Johnson which says that the reason a man acts like a beast is so he can forget the pain

281
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,680
of being a man.

282
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
That's a good excuse.

283
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,400
That goes along with too much is always better than not enough.

284
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,920
Oh, there are some great ones down there in the Cracker Barrel.

285
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,920
Again, I had one on my mind.

286
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,600
I had one on my mind.

287
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


288
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


289
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


290
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


291
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


292
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


293
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


294
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


295
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,600


296
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,760
I had one on my mind.

297
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,320
It's on the tip of my tongue and it's gone now.

298
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,320
It'll come, just don't strain too hard to retrieve it.

299
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,100
Oh, I know what it was.

300
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,060
It was a quote from Little Big Man.

301
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,820
I find myself saying this about once a month.

302
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,860
By Charles Portis.

303
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,760
It is true.

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,040
There is a thing here I do not understand.

305
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,520
There's a pain between my ears.

306
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,080
Amen.

307
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,120
Yes.

308
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,540
It's probably caused by this broadcast.

309
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,580
In fact, it's not.

310
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:13,580


311
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,260
In fact, I'm part of a large family.

312
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,620
There's a lot of Stangs.

313
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,740
We're a big clan.

314
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,020
We're a Stang clan, I guess you could call it.

315
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,640
Like the Sawney Bean family.

316
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,140
Or the Addams Family.

317
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,400
Or the Munsters.

318
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,700
Or Rasputins.

319
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:42,220
But oddly enough, my daughter grew up with the hour of slack and she claims that to this

320
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,400
day, it gives her a headache.

321
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,160
To listen to it for more than five minutes, it gives her a terrible headache.

322
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,960
I have one, out of all of the Stang clan, I have one niece who regularly listens to

323
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,820
the hour of slack.

324
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,500
Do they know that you put in the subliminal fear monitor that actually creates that headache?

325
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,940
The uneven sonic waves?

326
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,260
To keep my daughter from knowing what her dad really does for a living.

327
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,060
Maybe I did.

328
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,300
A high and lonely destiny.

329
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,200
I don't know.

330
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,200
You want to not only confound and confuse the subgeniuses, you want to alienate the

331
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,340
conspiracy monitoring and all those who might otherwise join the Church of the Subgenius.

332
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,100
This isn't a cult that's looking for numbers.

333
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,140
We're looking for quality, not quantity.

334
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Yeah, I had to force ordain most of my nephews and nieces.

335
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,340
They'll thank you in the end.

336
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,060
Right.

337
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,460
If the church were free, then you'd get all these hanger-ons and wannabes that would just

338
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,300
sign up just because it was free.

339
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,420

340
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,180
So, yeah.

341
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,180
So, the whole idea is to make it something that you...

342
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,960
It looks hip at the beginning, but then with the slightest bit of investigation, you think,

343
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,340
no, no, I don't think I want to be associated with them.

344
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, you know, there's been some subgeniuses that I didn't want to be associated with anymore,

345
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,180
and they were unpersoned.

346
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,620
Well, it's like in 1984.

347
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,480
Just like in 1984.

348
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,360
You don't have to associate with them anymore.

349
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,460
They've been uncreated.

350
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,840
Well, it's a delicate balance.

351
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,220
Think how you...

352
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,640
How dumb you'd have to be to be too dumb for the church of the subgenius.

353
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,820
I mean, it's almost unthinkable.

354
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,860
It takes all the intellectual power just contemplating it.

355
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,620
It hurts my head just to think about how dumb one would have to be to be kicked out

356
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,020
of the church of the subgenius.

357
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,660
Well, think about how dumb the average person is, and then realize that everyone,

358
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,020
that half of everyone, by definition, is dumber than that.

359
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,040
Dr. Howell, do you know who originally said that quote?

360
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,200
I don't know.

361
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,200


362
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,780
I'm not sure.

363
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:45,780


364
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:45,780


365
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:45,780


366
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:45,780


367
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:45,780


368
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:45,780


369
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,800
I thought that it was J.R.

370
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,520
Bob Dobbs.

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,760
He said, think how dumb the average person is.

372
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,240
Well, by definition, half of them are dumber than that.

373
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,420
Dr. I'm sure it's a thought that has occurred to many.

374
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,700
The reason I ask is that I heard someone attribute it to George Carlin the other day.

375
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,420
Someone on the radio.

376
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
Dr. Great minds roll in the same group.

377
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,780
And frankly, I thought that that was channeled by yours truly.

378
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

379
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,180


380
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,040
Stubbs channeled that one through me, if I recall correctly.

381
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,020
Maybe George got it from you.

382
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,620
It's not always possible to tell where something comes from,

383
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,560
and it's more of a pedantic library science-like thing to trace it back.

384
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,040
The important thing is to mix it into the synthesis.

385
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,940
Oftentimes the person who's credited with the famous saying is the one who simply made it famous.

386
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,140
Or the person who the saying is even about,

387
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,760
as in the case of the spurious thing about W.C. Fields and anybody who hated dogs and children can't be all bad,

388
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,360
which he certainly never said.

389
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,640
No, and it was said about him in any case.

390
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,600
But usually the saying about half the people being stupid,

391
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,240
you may think everybody says that, but really only half the people have said that.

392
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,680
The person who originally said anyone who hates dogs and children can't be all bad,

393
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,960
that was referenced.

394
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
Susie the floozy.

395
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,020
I thought it was Leo Rosten.

396
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,440
She's the origin of that.

397
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,080
She looks a lot younger than she is.

398
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,860
I really have seen it attributed to Leo Rosten, the Yiddish writer.

399
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,620
Well, he swiped it from Susie.

400
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,700
It's quite possible.

401
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,140
But once again, I don't care who got what from who, you know.

402
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,660
You just want to turn around and slap them all in the back seat and make them watch the scenery.

403
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,300
Sadly, my only quote that I'll be remembered for is the one that says,

404
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,260
Life?

405
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,120
This is life.

406
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,460
Sexually transmitted terminal disease.

407
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,040
Well, that one's not bad.

408
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,300
In fact, it's sterling in the catalog.

409
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,760
That would make a great bumper sticker.

410
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,320
Don't tell it to anyone.

411
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,680
Or the next thing you know, you'll be seeing it on a bumper sticker.

412
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,820
Wait a minute.

413
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,520
It's too late now.

414
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,620
We just blew it.

415
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,780
It's a lot like the hour slack.

416
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,540
You have to be very careful with you.

417
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,380
Just that squelch dial.

418
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,300
You're trying to get just enough people to listen, but not too many people to listen.

419
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,120
Just the right amount of people.

420
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,900
The right number of people to join, but not too many people to join.

421
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,540
Enough people to pay in to keep the church going, but not enough people to pay so the church becomes corrupt and a giant tick on society.

422
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,460
Well, it is a tightrope.

423
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:36,580
We are an anti-business business, an anti-religion religion, an anti-art art project, and an anti-science scientific experiment.

424
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,560
We are going to be a proverb religion that's always on the very edge of the world coming to an end.

425
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,020
And it's always going to then pull the rug out and say, well, not this year, but next year.

426
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,820
And to do that just the right number of years, but to not keep doing it on and on.

427
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,000
Just to find that perfect balance.

428
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,500
Where is it?

429
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,480
Is it this year, friends?

430
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,860
I think it's this year.

431
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,640
It's like playing a thierman.

432
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,620
You have to have your hands just the right distance to elicit the right note.

433
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,160
Not by putting...

434
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
crude physical touch

435
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,220
on the instrument. And it's the same

436
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,400
with the intuitive

437
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,800
feelings and

438
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,100
procedures that

439
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,620
a minister of Bob

440
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,140
must do, intuiting

441
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,600
one's way along by

442
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
slack emanations.

443
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,640
Well, it's not a completely

444
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,080
original thought. I mean, the Soviet Union

445
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,880
mastered this

446
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,800
concept themselves, where they would

447
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,880
amass all their forces and

448
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,740
converge on the very border of the

449
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,360
country in which they wished to invade.

450
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
And of course, the country that they were about

451
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,620
to invade would react and bring all their

452
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,360
forces forward. And then

453
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,780
the Soviets would retreat. And then

454
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,640
another time, they would build up forces

455
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
and again, they would be met with a counterforce.

456
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,640
And they would do this over and over

457
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,580
and over until finally the other side

458
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,760
said, oh, it's just a military

459
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,840
maneuver. We don't have anything to worry about here.

460
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,700
And that's the time the tanks just kept

461
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,520
rolling in. And this is what

462
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,600
X-Day is all about.

463
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,140
The false alarms, constantly

464
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,300
pulling that fire alarm for Bob.

465
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,180
The living Lipton tea trademark.

466
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,300
The moment the fire trucks stop coming,

467
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,920
that's when the saucers arrive.

468
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,880
In Soviet Russia,

469
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,500
Bob gives you $30.

470
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,160
It's like the boy who cried

471
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,900
wolf.

472
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,460
Wolf.

473
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,240
Werewolf.

474
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,600
He turned into the wolf.

475
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,000
They didn't realize that. They thought he was

476
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,960
calling the wolf, but he was

477
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,040
the wolf the whole time.

478
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,000
So he was always there. He never really

479
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,120
cried wolf. The wolf was always

480
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,640
there when he cried. An early

481
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,900
evidence of lycanthropy.

482
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,120
You know, one time I was doing

483
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,600
my stage act and

484
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,720
somebody sent up in...

485
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,980
People give me envelopes

486
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,160
with money in them to answer

487
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,780
questions that they need answered.

488
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,980
And sometimes they put other things in the

489
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,220
envelopes. And

490
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,260
at one point, I opened the envelope

491
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,900
and I poured out a stream

492
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,500
of small caliber

493
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,960
bullets into my

494
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,540
hand. But my golfing

495
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,220
and prayer partner, Chicken John,

496
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,320
said, give me those things. I hate guns.

497
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,160
I hate bullets. And he threw them

498
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,320
and most of them went through cracks

499
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,680
in the stage. But I retrieved a few

500
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,360
and these were actually

501
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,400
silver bullets

502
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,940
for shooting werewolves

503
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,380
and will also slow down

504
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,600
vampires. But now I only

505
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,920
have four of them.

506
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,120
They're very hard to come by.

507
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,660
But I've got them.

508
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,620
And if you are ever in the position of having

509
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,340
to move these, to use these,

510
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,640
you have to stand very close to your

511
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,220
werewolf or vampire

512
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,500
because silver bullets will not fire

513
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,320
true. The silver ends

514
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,660
melt and they tumble through the air.

515
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,560
But if you stand close

516
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,360
enough so that you can't miss, they

517
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,140
are effective at close range.

518
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,200
Well, the good news is that now

519
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,680
any future tap dancers on that stage

520
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,340
perform at their own risk.

521
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,580
Well, that stage is no longer

522
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,120
our stage. That was a

523
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,260
some time ago and we're in

524
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,960
a completely different building now.

525
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,980
So those silver bullets, if they're still there,

526
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,240
are below the stage of

527
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,060
a third-rate, cut-rate

528
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,140
Mexican bar called The Knockout

529
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,120
with a picture of a Mexican wrestler on the

530
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,020
outside. Oh, how

531
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,160
times have changed.

532
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,760
Why, we used to be gold in there.

533
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,020
By the way, Dr. Hell,

534
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,300
I don't know if you've noticed, but by chance, the music

535
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,640
in the background is from

536
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,040
The Wolfman.

537
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,100
The 1940s Wolfman.

538
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,380
Yes.

539
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,800
Claude Rains. And is there anyone

540
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,020
less likely to be Lon Chaney Jr.'s

541
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,720
father? And Maria

542
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,760
Usenspikaya,

543
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,880
or whatever her name was, who utters

544
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,980
the immortal words,

545
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,180
even a man who is pure of heart

546
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,980
and says his prayers by

547
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,820
night may become a wolf

548
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,200
when the wolfman blooms

549
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,940
and the autumn moon

550
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,720
is bright.

551
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
You know, I just

552
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,320
had a sad thought.

553
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,080
My fellow

554
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,660
hour of slack

555
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,240
blabberers.

556
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,080
I was looking at that picnic table

557
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,160
over there full of subgeniuses, and I

558
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
had the terrible fear that

559
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,200
they're funnier

560
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,980
over there. Maybe we should just put the

561
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,380
microphones over there.

562
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,700
They're not trying to

563
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,260
impress anybody. You know why? Because they don't

564
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,000
have to do this. They're just

565
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
slacking. See, Dr. Le Guin

566
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,740
could be over here talking.

567
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,780
I've just decided to slack

568
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,140
off and talk over here.

569
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,720
He's the autocrat of the breakfast table, or whatever

570
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,300
meal they're having over there.

571
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,900
And also all the girls

572
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,980
are over there, you notice.

573
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,660
It's a sausage fest

574
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,580
over in this corner.

575
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,460
He so has it all he can.

576
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,720
I'm more interested in what's going in their mouths

577
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,500
and what's coming out of it that looks pretty good

578
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,720
from this distance. Don't let me keep

579
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,180
you back. Now,

580
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,400
tomorrow, Saturday,

581
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,660
we will not be

582
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,240
doing an hour of slack live

583
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,260
on stage. Instead,

584
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,140
at two o'clock,

585
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
is the book club

586
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,640
discussion. Reverend Chris Lee

587
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,500
had decided everyone

588
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,080
should bring their copy of

589
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,900
King James Bible?

590
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,780
Cyclopedia

591
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,340
of Slack? No,

592
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,380
James George. Finnegan's Wake.

593
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,640
Yeah, yeah. Every year

594
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,700
we used to have this beer tasting party

595
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,460
sponsored by the

596
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,620
Queegee Bow Cartel, and that

597
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,040
beatnik, Reverend Chris Lee.

598
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,500
This year, he decided that

599
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,420
that was rather vulgar, and so

600
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,280
we should have a book club and discuss

601
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,260
the works of James Joyce. However,

602
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,260
people are still urged

603
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,280
to bring their local homebrew

604
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
and local

605
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,320
brewery stuff and get

606
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,480
completely plastered. Reverend Stang,

607
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,720
where is this beer guzzling,

608
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,260
I mean book reviewing party?

609
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,460
That goes on for an hour and a half,

610
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,700
and then it's the Ask Dr. Howell

611
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,500
show. Well, it must be here, then.

612
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,940
3.30.

613
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,240
Then it's got to be here? I guess, yeah,

614
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,880
almost everything happens here. The beer drinking

615
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,380
thing happens here. That's good.

616
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,400
Everything during the day happens here.

617
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,540
Almost every night

618
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,440
there's a great bonfire,

619
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,220
and down in the Pawpaw Patch, the

620
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,960
pagans are drumming and

621
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,840
dancing with their shirts off.

622
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,400
Some of their heathen rites.

623
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,880
Unfortunately, there's two reasons why that may

624
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,860
be hard to get a lot of people at that

625
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,780
book club. First, you're going to require

626
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,020
that they all,

627
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,260
read Finnegan's Wake,

628
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,820
and the others... They can look at other people's copies.

629
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,980
Yeah, and the other reason, of course,

630
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,000
being they'd all have to know how to

631
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,440
read, so...

632
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,900
That has slowed things down

633
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,940
in book sales. The beer makes your eyes

634
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,060
watery and wobbly. You can't make

635
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,040
sure what hieroglyphs

636
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,760
are dancing across the page. You can do what I do, just place the

637
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,500
book underneath your pillow and

638
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,080
osmose it, yes.

639
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,940
Well, in the case of Finnegan's Wake, it

640
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,000
probably helps to be plastered. I think

641
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,420
that was how it was mostly written.

642
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,640
It was probably how it was written. It reeks of

643
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,620
Guinness stout. I'm still waiting for the

644
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,780
Classics Illustrated comic book version.

645
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,620
Yeah.

646
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,180
That would be something.

647
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,940
Did you ever see the Classics Illustrated

648
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,880
version of Faust? One of the most

649
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,240
surreal... Faust!

650
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,660
Goethe's Faust. No! One of the most

651
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,960
surreal comic books

652
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,560
ever created because of its

653
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,520
incredibly unimaginative

654
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,320
application to an extremely

655
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,640
imaginative subject. I heard that

656
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,200
they were working on the Classics Illustrated

657
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,460
version of the book of the subgenius. Is there any truth

658
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,520
to that? None whatsoever. There was

659
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,460
in fact a company working

660
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,380
on that and the artists and script

661
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,220
writers have...

662
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Seven of them have committed suicide

663
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,800
so far. The others went on strike.

664
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,300
And it's not a Classics

665
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,980
Illustrated. It would have been a...

666
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,500
You could call it a graphic

667
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,360
novel. It would certainly be graphically

668
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,460
novel. By fool's press, I imagine.

669
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,440
Well, it doesn't have a

670
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
story in it.

671
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,480
It's the greatest non-story ever told. That never stopped.

672
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,480


673
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,480


674
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,560
Jack T. Chick, who would

675
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,620
start one of his lengthy comic books

676
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,360
and then it would

677
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,520
turn into

678
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,720
print covering the page denouncing

679
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Roman Catholics or Mormons or whatever

680
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,240
in tinier and tinier boxes

681
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,680
with the characters squeezed down to the bottom

682
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,760
of the page until finally the characters

683
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,780
disappear entirely. How many

684
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,640
out here are familiar with the

685
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,360
works of Jack T. Chick?

686
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,620
Good. I see

687
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,500
that the Classics have not been entirely

688
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,240
neglected. Yes, Jack

689
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,460
T. Chick wrote all those religious

690
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,360
comic books that grinning

691
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,680
zombies hand you in bus stations

692
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
to try to convert you to

693
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Jesus. And they always end

694
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,620
as the critics have pointed out in a sort

695
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,580
of orgasmic moment where

696
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,400
sweat drops or pludes

697
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,860
as they are called in cartoonist lingoes

698
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,700
burst out of the bodies

699
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,140
of people who are ecstatically

700
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,620
receiving Jesus for the

701
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,320
first time. Others are

702
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,460
sadistically depicted as frizzling

703
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,380
and frying in a

704
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,840
very literal hell

705
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,880
into which a large muscular

706
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,300
angel with hillbilly sideburns

707
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
flings you off a cliff. So either way

708
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,240
you either cry or you sweat. There's

709
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,100
going to be water leaving your

710
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,160
body one way or the other. Yeah, so that water

711
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,240
is earthly and you're going to be dried out

712
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,720
in the supernal realm. Is this where we do a certain

713
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,240
plugola for a certain book and movie

714
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,220
collection? That might be a

715
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,160
good idea. But we do have

716
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,180
a Bull Dada auction coming up, but

717
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,280
not for quite a while. I just checked the chronometer.

718
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,360
There's still eons of

719
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,840
hours of slack to get through.

720
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,660
I don't know if they did a

721
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,180
chick version of the Book of the Subgenius

722
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,760
that they'd be able to fill up all

723
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,280
24 pages with relevant

724
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,760
information. They might kind of

725
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,980
peter out every page. Well, look, here's two

726
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,100
of them. Why didn't you bring the collector?

727
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,920
Here's two that might as well be the

728
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,880
Book of the Subgenius. Bad Bob.

729
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
That's a pretty damn

730
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,640
good one, actually. And the empty tomb.

731
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,780
The main character looks more like Dr.

732
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,980
Legume. He looks like Legume,

733
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,920
but he acts like Bob. This was your life.

734
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,620
Which begins with

735
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,200
Bob being struck

736
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,820
by the angel of death. Bob dies

737
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,360
in the second panel. His pipe

738
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,900
flies out of his mouth. As he falls to the ground,

739
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
his pipe remains

740
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,140
in the air. Then there's the

741
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,080
cutaway view of him in his coffin

742
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,120
underground with people standing

743
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,060
overhead. Very disturbing,

744
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,100
but not so disturbing as when an enormous

745
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,840
angel swoops down and

746
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,160
shoots him through space to the

747
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,900
celestial throne room

748
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,960
where he is not only mocked and

749
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,020
wild by the giant faceless

750
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,800
god with a light bulb for a head,

751
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,020
but a huge movie is shown

752
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,960
for all the universe to see

753
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,900
of every private, dirty,

754
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,900
nasty little thing he ever did

755
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,680
as a human on Earth.

756
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,780
In CinemaScope,

757
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,720
sense around Todd Ayo

758
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,160
and VistaVision. And everyone

759
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,140
in the universe sees it and comments

760
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,880
on it. And at the end, he's guilty

761
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,800
and made to march down

762
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,080
a suspiciously low tunnel with

763
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,100
a little wisp of smoke coming out of it.

764
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,740
Whosoever was not found

765
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,700
written in the book of life was

766
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,640
cast into the lake of fire.

767
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,120
Revelation 20.15.

768
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,540
Interestingly enough... This one ends

769
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,280
the final statement of

770
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,660
This Was Your Life is

771
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,060
this quote from the Bible.

772
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,620
The Lord is not slack

773
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,600
concerning his promise

774
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,640
as some men count slackness

775
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,580
but is long-suffering

776
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,760
to us, ward, not

777
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,560
willing that any should perish

778
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,840
but that all should come to repent.

779
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,820
We will auction this

780
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,180
pamphlet.

781
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,860
Oh, he only had two Peters. I feel so sorry

782
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,740
for the uni...

783
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,800
That will be available in the Bulldada auction

784
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
because Jack Chick's work is Bulldada.

785
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,920
He's really an underground cartoonist.

786
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,700
If you want to consider the matter

787
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,260
dispassionately, you may dislike

788
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,440
his underlying philosophy.

789
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,840
He drew the more crude and

790
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,420
scratchy ones himself, but

791
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,820
the more academically rendered ones are

792
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,800
by a black guy named Fred

793
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,940
Carter. But he also produces

794
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,780
the large, sumptuous, full

795
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,660
color Crusaders

796
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,780
series of religious

797
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,580
comics. And in these,

798
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,860
a huge, muscular white

799
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
guy with long sideburns and a

800
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,940
big chin like a toilet bowl

801
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,640
and a huge, muscular

802
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,860
black guy who's exactly like him

803
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,480
except dark-colored

804
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,520
who somehow live together

805
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,660
in some strange menage

806
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,680
and who are always whipping off

807
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,480
their shirts to reveal

808
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,500
impossibly buffed

809
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,260
torsos. These are actually

810
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,420
the Crusaders who go around the world

811
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,220
for God, doing

812
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,980
God's work. And they work at

813
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,240
some place like

814
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,480
Bemco. I don't think

815
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,280
that's the right name. And they always talk in

816
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,060
1970s lingo.

817
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,380
And they all wear bell-bottoms. Yeah, Fred Carter

818
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,800
never got beyond drawing the 1970s stars.

819
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,420
Now, here's a little detail that even you might not know

820
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,180
Father Joe Mama, but in

821
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,360
two of those Crusaders

822
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,440
books, some

823
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
of the villains are

824
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,680
based on real

825
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,120
people. In fact, they're named

826
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,940
Isaac Bonowitz,

827
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,720
who's the, you

828
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,860
might say, the head of the American Druids.

829
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
that couple's name,

830
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,520
the witch, they

831
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,680
started a witch school. The Wiccan couple.

832
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,740
Yeah, the Wiccan couple. His name

833
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,700
will come to me in a minute. The funny thing

834
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,200
is, I knew the late

835
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,320
Isaac Bonowitz. He

836
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,360
was a regular speaker at Star

837
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,280
Wood every year.

838
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,420
And

839
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,280
Gavin and

840
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,220
Yvonne Frost. That's right.

841
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
Yeah, Gavin Frost and

842
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,480
Isaac Bonowitz were depicted

843
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,540
in these comic books as

844
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,260
being big, tough

845
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,340
gangsters with armies of minions.

846
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,520
Now, in real life,

847
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,400
Isaac Bonowitz was

848
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,520
a wimpy little filk-singing

849
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,580
nerd. A strong wind could

850
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,060
blow him away. He was a funny fellow.

851
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,400
And he did know a lot of,

852
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,380
about ceremonial magic and all that,

853
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,220
and wrote a book about it when he was very young.

854
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,220
But basically, had about

855
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,140
maybe

856
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,560
one or two minions,

857
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,380
and those were his kids.

858
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,560
But what about the millions of dollars at his disposal?

859
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,480
Well,

860
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,060
you know, that was the thing.

861
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,380
As I told Gavin Frost, I said,

862
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,300
you know, it seems like if you had

863
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,620
so many minions in this whole satanic

864
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,520
army, you'd be driving a better car.

865
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,440
Well, who ever heard of a rich witch?

866
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,140
It doesn't work that way.

867
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,860
Um, by the way,

868
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,360
friends, I can, uh,

869
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,960
personally,

870
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,480
uh, say

871
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,780
that the story about the temperature

872
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,420
of witches' breasts

873
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,300
is true,

874
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,520
not true at all. It's completely

875
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,720
false. The breasts of a witch are just

876
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,640
like the breasts of a regular

877
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,660
human. It's not even a little hotter.

878
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,760
Or at least the few examples I ever

879
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,680
got a chance to. Because the ones you know,

880
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
the ardor burns brightly in

881
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,300
their breasts.

882
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,820
I know quite a few witches.

883
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,580
Yes. They're mostly very,

884
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,600
very nice. Reverend Stang

885
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:07,720
sees the witches dance every year.

886
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,200
If they've ever cast any spells on me, it was to keep them from

887
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,760
being rude to them.

888
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,600
The only sad thing about them is that they too will be

889
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,660
cast into the eternal abyss unless

890
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,820
they send in their $30 love offering.

891
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,800
Well, there are quite a few subgenius

892
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,780
witches. And maybe they can go

893
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,640
to the subgenius equivalent

894
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,620
of Limbo, where the virtuous

895
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,400
pagans hang out in

896
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,960
Christian,

897
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,460
mythology. That's where you hear the best drumming.

898
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,900
They haven't fully

899
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,600
embraced Bob and the church of the

900
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
subgenius, but they think in

901
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,680
such synchronicity that

902
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,480
they won't receive the full

903
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,320
stern treatment

904
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,600
that is meted out to everyone

905
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,440
else. Well, that's one of the reasons why

906
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,760
subgeniuses need to make a conscientious

907
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,640
effort and not be afraid to be

908
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,780
Bobnoxious. They need to

909
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,740
apostolicize. They need to

910
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,880
reach out. If you truly love those witches,

911
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,480
you need to bring them in.

912
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,220
You need to bring them into the fold if you want to get into their fold,

913
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,460
if you know what I mean. So the bottom line is

914
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,320
get in their face.

915
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
Make sure they send in their $30 love

916
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,540
offering. Let them know if it's pissing them off.

917
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,020
All they got to do is pay the $30.

918
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,940
It'll all be over. It's for their own sake.

919
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,160
I get paid pretty well

920
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,880
every year to

921
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,260
make fun of the pagans

922
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,880
and witches to

923
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,580
buy the pagans and witches.

924
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,240
That's a healthy thing.

925
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,060
In fact, the whole reason that we're here

926
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,080
together at this campground

927
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,900
is because I was invited to a

928
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,380
Starwood in 1990.

929
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,980
I thought, what the hell?

930
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,980
I'm like,

931
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,080
you know, I make fun of

932
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
everybody's most

933
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,040
beloved beliefs.

934
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,080
They're going to ambush me. It's a setup.

935
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,080
Yeah, it's a lynching.

936
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,540
They're going to lynch me.

937
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,180
My friend,

938
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,920
Bleepo Abernathy, who I'm hoping

939
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,900
will show up any

940
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,740
second, but I'm beginning to doubt it.

941
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Bleepo said,

942
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,880
I said,

943
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,620
I never mentioned this to you,

944
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,460
but I've been to some of those

945
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,620
Starwoods. What he hadn't mentioned

946
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,360
was that he was a heavy-duty

947
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,760
pagan and

948
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,080
was married to one. He said,

949
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,600
I think you should go to Starwood.

950
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,980
I think you'll be

951
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,320
very surprised and you'll have

952
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,720
a really good time.

953
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,520
I am now one of the

954
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,380
co-organizers of that

955
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
festival. I'm married into

956
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:27,860
it.

957
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,800
I have

958
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,280
along with the Book of Life

959
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,040
with every subgenius listed,

960
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,220
I also have the names, addresses, and

961
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,300
credit cards of all the pagans

962
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,220
who've ever been to Starwood in the last few

963
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,700
years.

964
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,840
That was how we knew about Brushwood.

965
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,840
That was where the Lord, Jesus,

966
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,280
had the idea of having X-Day

967
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,960
drills because

968
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,280
it was the best place in the world to have

969
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,340
a party. You could make noise all night long.

970
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,080
Girls could take their shirts

971
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,260
off, which was a big

972
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,640
attraction for bringing

973
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,640
more lads.

974
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,940
The pagans,

975
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,760
let's face it, know the

976
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,880
secret of fire, something

977
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,960
that the subgeniuses have not

978
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,760
all mastered.

979
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
We're still trying to learn

980
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,200
how they do that.

981
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,020
In fact, I get to Princess

982
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,960
Wee and I usually lead the parade to light

983
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,700
the giant sacred bonfire

984
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,200
even though I'm like the mascot

985
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,240
skeptic.

986
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,040
It just goes to show

987
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,920
how open-minded they are.

988
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,020
So naturally, they want to relax

989
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,500
and laugh and be teased

990
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,140
and twitted by you.

991
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,060
Usually, all I have to do is

992
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,740
read the program book.

993
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,960
Is it true that they just kind of throw

994
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,060
their fingers towards the faggots?

995
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,460
You can't do it with loose fingers.

996
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,640
Is there like a miniature

997
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,160
Zippo lighter somewhere in the mix that we're not

998
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,280
seeing?

999
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,620
The Starwood organizers

1000
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,880
carry these huge, specially

1001
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,000
blessed torches that have been

1002
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,340
hand-decorated by

1003
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,440
a team of very earnest

1004
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,500
believers. I always feel

1005
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,660
awful taking these

1006
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,580
things from them.

1007
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,500
The blessing runs off.

1008
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,200
Anyway, and we

1009
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,600
do a little ceremony and we lead everyone

1010
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,800
out there and they chant

1011
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,520
the names of the goddess and we

1012
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,680
plunge, at a certain

1013
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,980
mark, we plunge our

1014
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,800
torches into this huge

1015
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,340
bonfire stack

1016
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,800
of wood and it miraculously,

1017
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,100
the whole thing bursts into,

1018
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,120
flames, just from a few, you know, from

1019
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,740
eight people poking a torch.

1020
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,040
I'm going to give away

1021
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,280
a secret of witch magic.

1022
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,480
There's actually some rocket

1023
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,720
scientists behind the scenes

1024
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,440
who have prepared

1025
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
explosives and things inside that

1026
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,620
bonfire stack to make it

1027
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,920
into a more spectacular

1028
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,960
lighting thing.

1029
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,800
I don't think that everyone who watches

1030
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,580
it knows just how

1031
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,100
much of it is fake.

1032
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,180
But it works. I mean, boy,

1033
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,040
it's an impressive bonfire

1034
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,700
and we'll be doing

1035
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,320
it in a week and a half right down

1036
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,300
the road. My brother used to do that

1037
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,240
at parties at his house. He would

1038
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,300
make the fire green and so

1039
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,100
on. Some say that's where science

1040
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,320
comes from, from the witches doing things just

1041
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,100
like that. Well, I got it the

1042
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,240
first time I went

1043
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,220
to a Starwood Pagan

1044
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,280
gathering and saw those people drumming and

1045
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,980
dancing around the fire, I thought,

1046
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,860
this seems so familiar.

1047
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,180
And not that I personally,

1048
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,200
have ever done that, even to this

1049
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,920
day. You were on an ancestral

1050
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,000
memory trip. My ancestors

1051
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,780
did, that's what they did for

1052
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,300
100,000 years until radio

1053
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,080
was invented. And stage

1054
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,920
magic. We had to kind of leave that

1055
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,600
ritual out of the subgenius.

1056
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,740
Yeah, we didn't know how to start the fires.

1057
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,460
Too many people would walk into the fire.

1058
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,080
Yes, we had fire walking some years.

1059
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,280
But without the Huna magic,

1060
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,740
which makes it effective.

1061
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,760
Trying to create their own Wicca man routine.

1062
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,220
Actually, last Starwood, we had a

1063
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,060
fire walking teacher. Oh, yeah.

1064
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,580
And he,

1065
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,900
a couple of people got their feet burned.

1066
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,080
And boy, he was so angry at us because

1067
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,180
we hadn't supplied exactly the

1068
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,320
right kind of wood.

1069
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,900
The kind that burns with almost no

1070
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,840
heat whatsoever.

1071
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,960
And helps the faith of

1072
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
the person to overcome

1073
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,100
the flames, you know. The fact that

1074
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,920
there isn't really any real heat there.

1075
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,060
If they move along at a brisk

1076
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,640
pace, there's no way they're going to get hurt.

1077
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,980
But they're convinced that

1078
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,200
when they come away, they know that

1079
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,320
they've got the power of mind over matter.

1080
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,360
And that's all that counts

1081
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,440
really, you know, friends.

1082
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,540
Placebos work

1083
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,300
better than the real medicine

1084
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,100
in some cases, such as

1085
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,180
antidepressants. Because after

1086
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,960
all, it's you who heal

1087
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,040
yourself. And the placebo simply

1088
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,180
makes you feel that you can heal

1089
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,100
yourself. In other cases, you

1090
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,060
need the real medicine. I'd much rather

1091
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,380
have the hydrocodone than the sugar pill.

1092
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,940
But even the medicine only,

1093
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,860
it assists the body to

1094
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,220
repair itself. It probably didn't help

1095
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,940
either that somebody broke up. The doctor,

1096
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,160
a priestly figure, doesn't really do anything,

1097
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,280
any work of healing. The idea

1098
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
was that we were going to break some glass and mix

1099
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,020
it in with the coals to provide some

1100
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,060
insulation from the coals. That didn't

1101
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,120
actually help, though.

1102
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,140
The problem with it is you end up

1103
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,960
getting hooked on placebos.

1104
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,120
And what a waste of money,

1105
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,120
you know. But as long as you feel that

1106
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,160
that placebo is going to work, that's all that counts.

1107
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,260
Besides, everything is a placebo.

1108
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,520
Your television, your radio,

1109
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,800
your iPod, your iPad.

1110
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,720
A present company

1111
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,320
excluded. Everything is sort of

1112
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,720
a pacifier, a big

1113
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,180
nipple, a teething ring.

1114
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
The real gurus are able to get rid of all that,

1115
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,920
though, and just focus on the religion itself.

1116
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,100
Just the very subgeniusness

1117
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,380
of being a subgenius is enough to get you high

1118
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,300
at all times. Or like Phineas Narco,

1119
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,260
you can endlessly journey

1120
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,200
into the self and marvel

1121
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,340
at all you see there.

1122
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,300
You can project subgeniusness

1123
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,240
through your eyes, onto the ceiling,

1124
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,320
onto the wall, into the clouds,

1125
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,220
so that the

1126
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,280
exes don't even have to break out

1127
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,460
their sonic finders

1128
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,240
to find the landing spot. They just look for

1129
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,020
the giant bobshead on the cloud.

1130
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,160
On the other hand, this stuff takes

1131
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,260
unerring, unbending concentration,

1132
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,360
which is always

1133
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,180
difficult to summon or find

1134
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,340
a space to act in.

1135
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,340
For years, they didn't realize that's what

1136
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,240
the projection was. It was a sign,

1137
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,000
a sign to the exes, and then someone noticed

1138
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,060
that the pipe was actually pointing

1139
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,280
out to the right instead of to the

1140
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,340
left, and they realized, well, that's

1141
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,060
because the projection is on the cloud,

1142
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,260
and if you're approaching Earth from the other

1143
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,380
direction, you would want the bobshead

1144
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,160
in the proper direction

1145
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,120
as well. Or they could flip the slide

1146
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,480
around.

1147
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,300
Either way it works.

1148
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,300
We'll find out in living

1149
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,800
color here in just a couple of days.

1150
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,020
In ominously pulsating color.

1151
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,680
Who wants another cup of coffee?

1152
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,680
I haven't had one, so I can't have another, but I'd like one.

1153
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,020
I will get us both.

1154
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,920
Papa Joe, do you take drugs?

1155
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,940
No, that's too druggy for me.

1156
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,200
I want green in mine.

1157
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,580
I'm a discovering alcoholic.

1158
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,360
Or that white lard-like powder.

1159
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,700
As a discovering alcoholic, I can't engage in any of that because I...

1160
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,160
Yes.

1161
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,820
Very well.

1162
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,320
I traveled

1163
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,780
through a land of men,

1164
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,000
a land of men and women,

1165
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,020
too, and heard and saw

1166
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,640
such dreadful things

1167
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,280
as cold earth wanderers

1168
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,200
never knew.

1169
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,180
For there the babe is born in joy

1170
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,080
that is begotten in dire

1171
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,940
woe, just as we

1172
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,060
reap in joy the fruits which we

1173
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,660
in bitter tears do so.

1174
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,080
And if the babe is born a boy,

1175
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,000
he's given to a

1176
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,140
woman old,

1177
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,240
who nails him down upon a rock,

1178
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,140
catches his shrieks

1179
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,360
in cups of gold.

1180
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,720
She binds iron thorns

1181
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,440
about his head.

1182
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,880
She pierces both his hands and feet.

1183
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,800
She cuts his heart out

1184
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,140
at his side to make it feel

1185
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,940
both cold and heat.

1186
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,300
Her fingers number every

1187
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,600
nerve, just as a miser

1188
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,760
counts his gold.

1189
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,540
She lives upon his shrieks and cries

1190
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,480
till she grows

1191
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,940
young and he

1192
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,220
grows old. Till he

1193
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,680
becomes a bleeding youth

1194
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,040
and she becomes a virgin

1195
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,360
bright. Then he

1196
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,100
rends up his manacles

1197
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,240
and binds her down

1198
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,680
for his delight.

1199
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,640
He plants himself

1200
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,360
in all her nerves,

1201
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,160
just as a husbandman

1202
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,800
his mold.

1203
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,380
And she becomes his

1204
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,100
dwelling place

1205
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,980
and garden, fruitful

1206
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,300
seventy-fold.

1207
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,840
An aged shadow—

1208
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,400
soon he fades,

1209
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,820
wandering round an earthly cot,

1210
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,420
fulfilled all with

1211
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,120
gems and gold which

1212
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,100
he, by industry, has got,

1213
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,340
for these are the gems he has

1214
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:05,400
gems of the human soul, the ruby and pearl of the lovesick eye, the countless gold of the aching

1215
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:14,500
heart, the martyr's groan, the lover's sigh. They are his meat. They are his drink. He feeds the

1216
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:21,700
beggar and the poor and the wayfaring traveler. Forever open is his door. His grief is their

1217
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:28,240
eternal joy. They make the roofs and walls to ring till from the fire on the hearth a little

1218
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:37,200
female babe does spring. And she is all of solid fire and gems and gold that none his hand dare

1219
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:45,640
stretch to touch her infant form or wrap her in his swaddling band. But she comes to the man she

1220
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,680
loves. If young or old or rich or poor, they soon drop her in the air and she's all of solid fire.

1221
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:59,740
Drive out the aged host, a beggar at another's door. He wanders weeping far away until some other

1222
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:10,040
take him in, oft blind and age-bent, sore distressed, until he can a maiden win. And to allay his

1223
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:18,320
freezing age, the poor man takes her in his arms. The cottage fades before their sight, the garden

1224
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,500
and its lovely charms. The guests are scattered

1225
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:21,660
themselves. The garden and its lovely charms. The guests are scattered themselves. The guests

1226
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:21,660


1227
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,540
are scattered themselves. The guests are scattered themselves. The guests are scattered

1228
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,140
themselves. The guests are scattered themselves. The guests are scattered themselves. For the eye

1229
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:30,900
altering alters all. The senses wrap themselves in fear and the flat earth becomes a ball. The

1230
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:39,540
stars, sun, moon, all shrink away. A desert vast without a bound and nothing left to eat or drink

1231
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:49,340
but a dark desert all around. The honey of her infant lips, the bread and wine of her sweet smile,

1232
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,080
the wild game,

1233
00:50:51,080 --> 00:51:01,200
the flame of her roving eye, dull him to infancy beguile. For as he eats and drinks, he grows younger and younger every day.

1234
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:11,740
And on the desert wide, they both wander in terror and dismay. Like the wild stag, she flees away. Her fear plants many a thicket wild,

1235
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:21,000
while he pursues her night and day by various arts of love beguiled. By various arts of love,

1236
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
she nestles under the

1237
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,380
Account and hide, utteres no the

1238
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,960
ir

1239
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:50,800
castings.

1240
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,720
For who dare touch that infant form

1241
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,000
His arm is withered to the root

1242
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,380
Lions, wolves, boars all howling flee

1243
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,720
And every tree does shed its fruit

1244
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,800
And none dare touch that infant form

1245
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,340
Except it be a woman old

1246
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,940
She nails him down upon the rock

1247
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,460
And all is done as I have told

1248
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,460
Dr. Howell, Keeper of Church Secrets

1249
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,800
and I am now about to give away a church secret

1250
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,900
I've known Dr. Howell for almost 30 years

1251
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,560
and I've always wondered how he, the hell he did that

1252
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,380
How could, first off

1253
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,240
of course, how can he remember these things

1254
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,280
and why does he even know them

1255
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,120
and yesterday or maybe the day before

1256
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,720
I said, well, wasn't your father a college professor

1257
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,740
and he goes, well, yeah, but he was a professor of romantic poetry

1258
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,840
No, he wasn't

1259
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,940
If this helps explain anything

1260
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,860
It's not true, didn't say it

1261
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,780
My father is a lawyer

1262
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,820
So you learned to argue, to be argumentative

1263
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:13,520
I learned how to, shall we say, to put it politely, bullshit

1264
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,060
To make your case

1265
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,880
A thick jargon that's incomprehensible to others outside of the profession

1266
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,660
See, all these years I never had that explained to me

1267
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,340
I asked Howell how he did this and he would never tell me

1268
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,800
It's not, what Stang says is not true

1269
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,760
Stang is mistaken

1270
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,040
My father was not a professor of romantic poetry

1271
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,200
His specialty was the 17th century poets

1272
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,000
Specifically John Milton

1273
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,360
Oh, hate poetry

1274
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,420
The pre-classical poet

1275
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,840
After the pre-classical come the classical poets

1276
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,040
like Alexander Pope

1277
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,820
And then, finally, you get the romantics

1278
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,100
And what's the point?

1279
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:50,100


1280
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,100
And William Blake, who's the mental traveler I just recited

1281
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,080
Was a precursor of the romantic movement

1282
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,040
The romantic poets, in many ways, are proto-subgenius in their thought

1283
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,520
Particularly some of the wilder ones

1284
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,920
For all these years when I was asking Howell

1285
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,280
How do you remember all that stuff?

1286
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,820
He would always change the subject and not answer it

1287
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,640
It's not hard

1288
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,520
It was almost like the magicians and the prestige

1289
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,700
This terrible rivalry

1290
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,680
How can I possibly learn this material the way he did?

1291
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,840
So I'd have to experiment

1292
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,500
And I tried

1293
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,840
The only idea I came up with was tattooing it all

1294
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,420
On the inside of my eyelid

1295
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,380
A Kafka-like method

1296
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,920
And then staring at the stage lights

1297
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,420
And blinking repeatedly so that I could see the message

1298
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,420
But then how does he get it to scroll?

1299
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,960
How can he?

1300
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,400
It was very frustrating

1301
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,760
And not scroll too fast

1302
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,360
Well, it's just like picking up songs on the radio

1303
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,360
Because he only had one eyelid and then the other eyelid

1304
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,820
And then you were out of material

1305
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,620
You know, it's funny

1306
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,640
The potations you take

1307
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,700
The substances you take

1308
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,840
Can create interesting shows on the inside of your eyelids

1309
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,900
Have you ever noted the many different patterns that you see there?

1310
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,840
Not only pop art and op art

1311
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,240
Checkers and flares

1312
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,660
Or growing blobs like a 1960s light show

1313
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,720
Well, if you stare at the image of Bob for 30 seconds

1314
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,000
Just stare at it and then turn away

1315
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,620
It's like looking into the sun

1316
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,500
We were talking about that yesterday

1317
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,860
That is a fact

1318
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,100
That is not a myth

1319
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,460
His image will be carried in your subconscious

1320
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,980
I remember one time when I was exhausted after too much fun

1321
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,260
And the patterns on the inside of my eyelids

1322
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,000
Resolved into Wally Wood spaceship details

1323
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,920
Have you ever seen those staying?

1324
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,220
Oh, yeah, sure

1325
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,280
Like you close your eyes and you see all these mysterious machines

1326
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,620
Oh, no, not when I closed my eyes

1327
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,480
Only when I was looking at a Wally Wood comic

1328
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,600
Well, but I'm saying this is like a

1329
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,020
It's a version of the op art patterns

1330
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,540
That you can get on the inside of your eyelids

1331
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,700
And most entertaining it is, too

1332
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,780
I always thought it was just the little excess pieces of the zip

1333
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,480
Zippo that you cut out when you were placing in there

1334
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,420
And they're getting caught in your little eye ducts

1335
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,260
It could be an acid flashback

1336
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,280
Except I don't believe in the acid tone, yeah

1337
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,960
No, what I usually see when I close my eyes

1338
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,120
Are like an incredibly fast slideshow

1339
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,320
Of every pornographic photograph

1340
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,720
I've ever seen

1341
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,440
And you can't stop?

1342
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,460
You can't hold them?

1343
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,420
Why would I want to?

1344
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,140
Oh, well, you might want to stop at one of your feet

1345
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,840
Well, every now and then you might land on one

1346
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,220
That was a particular favorite

1347
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:31,880
Exactly

1348
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,440
And run with that one

1349
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,700
That's why Ivan Stang doesn't get to be just an older man

1350
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,740
He gets to be a dirtier older man

1351
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,360
Yes

1352
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,200
Yes, but remember

1353
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,320
The conspiracy is what classifies dirt

1354
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,000
As something that is bad

1355
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,500
Without dirt

1356
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,560
There's nothing

1357
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:49,940
There's no life

1358
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,360
This planet could be a sterile

1359
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,620
Naked rock

1360
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,840
And be completely clean

1361
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,300
Because it would have no organics involved

1362
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,840
But we are such stuff

1363
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,520
Ourselves

1364
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,260
Our ectoplasm is simply organic matter

1365
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,400
Cells which at the present time are alive

1366
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,020
Which is why we'd rather swim in a swimming hole

1367
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,980
Than a swimming pool

1368
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,220
You want those contaminants

1369
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,400
You want the little protoplasms floating around with you

1370
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,580
You want the organic matter

1371
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,360
You want the oils on the top

1372
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,840
I was swimming in that swimming hole the other day

1373
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,720
And I was somewhat disturbed by the fact that

1374
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,660
Brown bubbles rise to the surface

1375
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,860
And before I put my head completely under

1376
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,560
A brown meniscus formed around my neck

1377
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,880
So you did get in the pool

1378
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,740
Oh yeah, it's great

1379
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,760
I still haven't

1380
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,560
It's quite good

1381
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,920
I do recommend it

1382
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,620
I'm sure everybody here has been in the pool

1383
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,440
It's just hard to get away when you have things to do

1384
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,280
Actually, a lot of people are scared to get anywhere near that thing

1385
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,320
Because of the old moss-headed lungs?

1386
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,580
Yeah, because of the old sea-quah down there

1387
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,500
The brown bubbles are nothing more than coffee bubbles

1388
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,560
It's part of the...

1389
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,080
I didn't want to taste them

1390
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,760
But the water is very refreshing and fun to swim in

1391
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,900
And another thing about it is

1392
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,120
It's damn deep

1393
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,940
After you get away from the bank

1394
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,180
It gets so deep

1395
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,840
I tried to get down to the bottom

1396
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,540
I had to give up to have enough air to get back to the top

1397
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,860
It really drops off

1398
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,560
Maybe that's the famous myth

1399
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,680
It's the McKelligot's Pond

1400
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,660
Of Dr. Seuss

1401
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,200
Connecting to the ocean through various underground...

1402
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,300
Yeah, with unimaginable surrealist fish of all kinds

1403
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,220
That's how old Nessie makes her way up here

1404
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,140
Yes, you feel the slimy body

1405
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,720
The coils brushing against your naked legs

1406
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,320
She's a source

1407
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,640
Sticks her head through that hole

1408
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,420
The baptism is on Sunday?

1409
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,080
Yeah, the baptism is...

1410
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,140
We're going to baptize everybody in that self-same filtered lake

1411
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,040
But don't worry, folks

1412
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,200
It'll be in the kiddie pool area

1413
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,060
You won't have to go into the deep unless you want to

1414
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,080
And of course, we don't recommend at all

1415
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,620
Going beyond the farthest bobbing line of floats

1416
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,860
Because there you run into snags and underwater stumps

1417
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:10,020
And probably a couple of moss-headed lunkers

1418
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,780
Alligator gars, huge snapping turtles and other things

1419
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,100
But don't worry about those animals

1420
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,320
We're going to have a rather large hook and line

1421
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,020
Attached to each of those animals

1422
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,020


1423
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,980
And we'll be able to bait each of the bobby attendees

1424
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,440
Just in case someone does take the bait

1425
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,740
You can be in charge of that

1426
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:24,960
Naturally

1427
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,180
And friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack

1428
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,740
From the Church of the Subgenius

1429
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:33,000
Come back next week for more music next time

1430
