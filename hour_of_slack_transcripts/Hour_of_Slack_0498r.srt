1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And that somebody is me.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:23,200
And that somebody is me.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,740
Yeah, it kind of blew my mind.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:36,280
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,660
Thank you.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,940
Now for the umpteenth time never before heard on any radio speaker.

7
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,480
Again, the radio motion showed that they had to wait till now.

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,340
There are less than five minutes left in the show.

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,700
The Subgenius Foundation presents in omnisound, phonoscope, and radio color,

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,720
The Subgenius Foundation.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,300
The Subgenius Show.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,000
More than an hour, less than a show.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,060
The Subgenius Show is assembled and edited by the doctors of the air,

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,880
using every trick from the voluminous bag of modern science.

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,020
Hear the immortal words of Bob,

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,060
together with the opinions, curses, and imprecations

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,220
of his dearest friends and bitter enemies.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,560
In other news, child molesters were discovered to be frequenting

19
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,300
the Subgenius program.

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,220
Yes, child molesters were on the air.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,240
When found.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,280
They molested children by broadcasting their evil message into their ears.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,140
Here was the vivid imaginary universe that existed alongside our mortal world.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,940
It sounded like this.

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,040
That magical realm of witches and wizards, ghosts, goblins, geeks,

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,600
gooks.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,580
And gnomes, fairies, elves, giants, ogres, and nerds.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,380
Where valiant knights battled fearsome dragons.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
Mermaids splashed in sunlit seas.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,360
And mystical unicorns appeared to the pure of heart.

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,960
Yes, the whole world of enchantment that has bewitched the human mind and spirit

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,700
since the dawn of time is now available to you in the 27 volume book of The Subgenius.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
Well, that's all for tonight, folks.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
We hope you've enjoyed listening to our Subgenius Show

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,760
as much as we've enjoyed bringing it to you.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,160
Thank you.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,020
We have enjoyed it.

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,300
Thank you.

39
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,280
And our guest, Milo Duggan, on today's famous...

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,700
Thank you.

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,900
I enjoyed it very much.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,240
Thank you.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,800
Thank you for listening to the show and saving energy.

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,780
Goodbye.

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,440
Bye.

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,600
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,760
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,780
which reaches from the inner mind to...

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,440
The Subgenius.

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,980
Power of Swag.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
The Subgenius.

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,840
That's my praise bar.

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,920
Praise bar.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
Praise bar.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,300
Praise bar.

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,400
Praise bar.

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,360
Praise bar.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,360


59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,260
Thank you.

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,260


61
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,620
Yes, we are back.

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,940
Hi-ya.

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:37,860
So relax in your own delusion.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,860
Find a place to hide and reach your confusion.

65
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,160
Save me from the clutches of confusion.

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,000
Save me.

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,400
From the chains of time

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
To the sand of the earth

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
From the men and the blind

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,720
To the slings of genius

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,540
The stars fly

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,520
Praise God

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,500
Oh, yes, and praise Bob, friends,

74
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,120
and praise the walk-ins

75
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,420
who did that fantastic gospel song there.

76
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,400
Oh, yes, we're going to get down tonight.

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,120
We're going to get into the spirit.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,000
We're going to get so deep into the spirit

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,220
it's going to be like walking through molasses

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,860
in a Nightmare on Elm Street movie.

81
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,760
You'll love it.

82
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,600
You'll love it, dear friends.

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,140
And you can love it even more

84
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,800
if, when you become puzzled,

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,040
you call in.

86
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,420
Talk to Will Adobes here.

87
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,580
Not me.

88
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,700
Will Adobes really has the harder job here,

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,900
I think, in a way.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,220
But he hasn't paid as many dues as I have.

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,200
When he's...

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,700
He's racked up enough radio dues

93
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,880
while he'll have his own pathetic

94
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,280
or crippled assistant working there.

95
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh.

96
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,400
And where would we be without him, dear friends?

97
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
Dr. Will Adobes.

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,400
Reach him and ask your questions

99
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,720
at 823-7490.

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,720
Well, he already got one

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,440
before I even finished saying the number.

102
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,180
Praise Bob.

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,160
Bob, they're telepathic out there.

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,820
Uh, yeah.

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
Yeah, call 823-7490

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,040
for information

107
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,220
on the Church of the Subgenius

108
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,100
radio ministry hour of slack.

109
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,600
Thank you.

110
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,180
But if you don't like it,

111
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,140
well, there's probably something else on TV

112
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,960
you can look at.

113
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,620
I used to play ball.

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,320
He was my coach.

115
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,280
Ah.

116
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,180
Listen, there's a big musical special

117
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,440
on Channel 4 at 7.30,

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,640
Hall of Corridors.

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
A musical?

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,180
Yeah, Hall of Corridors.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, that's the...

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,900
I think that's the overall title.

123
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,580
That's the series.

124
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,400
That's the series.

125
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:54,900
What's the name of the act?

126
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,620
The Littlest Marine, it's called.

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
It's got to be a real charming...

128
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,060
Oh, wonderful, yeah.

129
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,640
It's a chalk show.

130
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,720
Yeah, right.

131
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,520
Charles Everett Wilson Gump's

132
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
ideal all-people's family show.

133
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,560
Little Squeezy Whitaker

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,000

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,940

136
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,400
stars as Hideo Bumstead.

137
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,300
Hideo Bumstead!

138
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
It's the Japanese cassette

139
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,260
That's right.

140
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,940
pre-show that they won't let us have for a year.

141
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,600
The Little...

142
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,500
He plays the littlest marine

143
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,880
on a Christmas Eve...

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,100
on X-mas Eve, sir.

145
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,380
They must be saving space here.

146
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,240
On X-mas Eve's

147
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,340
search-and-destroy mission

148
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
in the Holy Land.

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
As the patrol nears

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,960
Hollywood Boulevard,

151
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,040
Hideo remembers

152
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
that he's forgotten his heart.

153
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,620
Directed and coached

154
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,060
by Dr. Carl Schickelgruber,

155
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,160
Secretary of Health, Education, and Sickness,

156
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,540
choreographed by General Ivan

157
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,720
the Terrible Gruber.

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,280
Original songs include

159
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,540
Who Am I,

160
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,700
What Time Is It,

161
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,980
and Where Is Your Passport?

162
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,780
Oh, good.

163
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,100
That's a great one.

164
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,260
Those are all musical questions.

165
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,300
That's a great one.

166
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,560
What time is it?

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
At the same time, though,

168
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,500
Phil and Peter,

169
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,400
you'll be glad to hear

170
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,740
there's a movie drama,

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
Lame Duck, 1966.

172
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,900
We can watch that

173
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,060
while the guys are watching the other one.

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,300
Yeah.

175
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,660
Right?

176
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,160
What's Lame Duck?

177
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,660
What's it about?

178
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,840
A detective is killed

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,780
by his three sons

180
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,500
and rich uncle

181
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,960
in a battle over motion picture rights.

182
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,100
Daisy is portrayed

183
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,240
by Lark Albatross,

184
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,680
and Donald is portrayed

185
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,760
by Andrew Gump.

186
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,360
Oh, yeah?

187
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,980
That's 90 minutes.

188
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,160
But at the same time,

189
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,900
there's a movie on,

190
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,600
a western scalp,

191
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,160
The Schnifter, 1935.

192
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,060
Oh.

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,460
That's a good old one.

194
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,140
Listen to this.

195
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,080
I'll take that one.

196
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll take that one on videotape.

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,380
We can watch it later.

198
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,540
Well, I think this is the one.

199
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,400
Rancher Dick Nixon

200
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,020
has to make up his mind soon.

201
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,680
Oh, I've been wanting

202
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,360
to get that one.

203
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,880
I'll take that

204
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,940
on the new cartridge machine.

205
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,320
Great.

206
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,880
Okay, go ahead.

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
Either drop that bomb

208
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,680
on the sheep man

209
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,580
or lose his daughter

210
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,620
to jazz musicians.

211
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,420
Oh.

212
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,780
In a gloomy report,

213
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
Morley took a dim view

214
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,060
of history,

215
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,060
recalled the tragically

216
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,160
repetitious story,

217
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,860
the decline and fall

218
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,820
of all past civilizations.

219
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,400
Said Morley,

220
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,740
modern civilization

221
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,300
could,

222
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,060
by the way,

223
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,400
a phenomenon

224
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,480
of atomic fission,

225
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,900
be brought to dust

226
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,480
and ashes.

227
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,620
For example,

228
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,800
if an A-bomb

229
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,560
were detonated

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,060
at the Empire State Building,

231
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,600
the area of total destruction

232
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
would cover an area

233
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
of two miles.

234
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,180
Now,

235
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,740
since the A-bomb

236
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,940
is already obsolete,

237
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,320
consider the area

238
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,380
of total destruction

239
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,740
of an H-bomb.

240
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,880
And science

241
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,920
has promised us

242
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
bombs a thousand times

243
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,600
more powerful,

244
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,740
poisoning with radioactivity

245
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,560
all the air and water

246
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,180
of this Earth.

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
This could mean

248
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,280
not only the end of our own civilization,

249
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,560
but the very possibility

250
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,360
of any future civilization.

251
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,540
What are we going to do about it?

252
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll tell you what I'm going to do about it.

253
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,100
I have a plan.

254
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,540
A plan to preserve human life

255
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,380
on this planet.

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,440
I hope you will join with me

257
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,400
in carrying it out.

258
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,660
I hope you will join with me in carrying it out.

259
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,480
And you can join with us

260
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,520
by calling 823-7490.

261
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,880
The response to Dr. Morley's appeal

262
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,000
was immediate and enthusiastic.

263
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
The Society to Save Civilization

264
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
was set up.

265
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,100
To its headquarters

266
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,080
flocked amateur do-gooders

267
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,660
and professional scientists.

268
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,040
Humanity can escape annihilation,

269
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,720
can find a temporary haven,

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,840
a promise of hope

271
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,060
that come what may,

272
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,660
life can be a little easier.

273
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


274
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


275
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


276
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


277
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


278
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


279
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


280
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


281
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


282
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


283
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


284
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


285
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,660


286
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,700
We sustain deep within the Earth itself.

287
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,580
Far below the surface,

288
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,800
we shall seek a natural,

289
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,380
a geological shelter.

290
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,720
We have a team ready for the effort.

291
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
All we lack are funds.

292
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
Can we get them from your foundation?

293
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,440
Dr. Morley,

294
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,720
I believe it would expedite

295
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,440
metas if I were to ask the questions.

296
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,680
We're, uh, labeled, you know.

297
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
First of all,

298
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,620
isn't the inside of the Earth solid?

299
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,040
The interior of the Earth

300
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,660
is made up of vast caverns,

301
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,060
air piles,

302
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,540
joined by natural avenues

303
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,440
leading from the surface.

304
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,340
Natural avenues,

305
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,280
funnels, and fissures.

306
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Such a fissure lies within

307
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
the world's largest extinct volcano

308
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,800
at Mount Nellie.

309
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,420
That is where we intend

310
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,600
to start our journey.

311
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,780
Over these furrows,

312
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
up our delta they go,

313
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,800
hundreds of miles,

314
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,500
thousands to the very core

315
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,640
of the Earth.

316
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Isn't the inside of the Earth,

317
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,440
the very core,

318
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,760
a molten, fiery land?

319
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,800
An encounter.

320
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,180
The latest body of theory holds

321
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,920
that the inside of a sphere

322
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,300
touching the Earth

323
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
is cooler than the temperature

324
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,240
at its surface.

325
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,020
And how do you traverse

326
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,140
these thousands of miles?

327
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
Dr. Coleman,

328
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
the perspective drawing.

329
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,020
This is a cyclotron.

330
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,180
A what?

331
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,560
It's an amphibious conveyor

332
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,700
based on the principles

333
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,400
of ovoidal atmosphere.

334
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,140
A what?

335
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,520
Like a submarine.

336
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,160
With the mobility of a tractor.

337
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,800
Its head contains a burrowing device.

338
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,520
Its walls can withstand

339
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,760
extremes of temperature and pressure.

340
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,300
But even with the cyclotron

341
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,260
or the atmosphere of the whatnot,

342
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,500
how do you know you'll be successful

343
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,180
in finding this underground haven?

344
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
We don't know.

345
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,100
We'll never know.

346
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,460
Without the what?

347
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,720
Without the what not,

348
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,480
my friends,

349
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,580
without the what not,

350
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,840
we won't know nothing.

351
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,720
And neither will Arnold Mathis.

352
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,520
Arnold Mathis,

353
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,320
who did that tape there.

354
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,460
There's a lot more to it.

355
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
We're always chopping people's work

356
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,660
down to fragments of what it was.

357
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,120
But you know why that is?

358
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,160
It's because of the book

359
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,020
of the subgenius.

360
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,500
It's because of the book

361
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,680
of the subgenius.

362
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,440
We can't help it.

363
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,780
It is our destiny,

364
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,660
our duty.

365
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,360
To present to you,

366
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,920
the listener,

367
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,320
that which will hurt you the most.

368
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,140
And we'll just go to a random page here

369
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,300
in the book of the subgenius.

370
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,100
I just want you to know

371
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,440
how great this book is

372
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,020
by the fact that I will just flip it open

373
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,060
to a random page.

374
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,260
You don't even know what I'm going to.

375
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
Okay, here we go.

376
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,880
There!

377
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,000
If you can't get slack for yourself,

378
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,640
you should be careful.

379
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,640


380
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,600
You sure as hell aren't going to be able

381
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,240
to give it to somebody else.

382
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,020
And that's just what they've got you trying to do.

383
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,080
You can't think.

384
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,740
Everything's gone wrong.

385
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,320
You're so tired.

386
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,000
The kids are driving you crazy.

387
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,800
Your spouse lost another job

388
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,980
and is drinking again.

389
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,820
You're supposed to have an operation.

390
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,820
You don't know where the money's going to come from.

391
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,840
It doesn't seem worth it anymore.

392
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,260
There's no one to talk to.

393
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,380
You don't know if you can hold up under all this.

394
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,160
And you're not sure if you want to.

395
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,380
You're ashamed of the things you haven't done.

396
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,000
And you keep thinking about those pills.

397
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,480
Friends, put a dog in a cage

398
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,800
and he'll run in circles.

399
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,240
Put a man in a cage and he'll run for president.

400
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,620
And it's the same thing.

401
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,240
All problems, all problems, my friends,

402
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
result from paralysis

403
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,340
caused by their game

404
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,740
in which they keep changing the rules.

405
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,940
It's like the robot monster

406
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,000
in 30 different sci-fi movies

407
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,180
being ordered to kill

408
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,760
contrary to his prime directive

409
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
of protecting humans.

410
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,800
He goes into a cycle of,

411
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,200
I must, yet I cannot,

412
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,700
and shorts out in an explosion of sparks.

413
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,380
But instead of shorting out,

414
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,760
humans have the choice

415
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
of ignoring the paradox within their orders.

416
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,260
The choice of,

417
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm going to sleep.

418
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,500
Oh, public apathy is a disease, certainly.

419
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,660
The con itself complains of it.

420
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,480
But it isn't apathy to begin with.

421
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,420
It's just that nobody wants

422
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,260
what they're trying to push.

423
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,960
They push rules.

424
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,080
But no rules for behavior can work for long.

425
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,480
Oh, they can sound good enough

426
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,940
for each new political fad to become epidemic

427
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,400
before its side effect of positive thinking brain cancer

428
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,540
sets in.

429
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,140
The conspiracy either wants you either

430
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,620
to think about only the nice things,

431
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,760
sweetness, cuteness,

432
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,740
Pollyanna crap in general,

433
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,620
or to be frozen by total helplessness.

434
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,080
Either way, you're kept from resisting

435
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,240
the unspoken rules.

436
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,060
The rules which don't have to be spoken

437
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,700
because so many people live them,

438
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,580
think them,

439
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,180
that they can't stand back and see them.

440
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,380
Those in the room,

441
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,680
in the system,

442
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,740
can't see anything except from the inside.

443
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,800
They didn't know there could be an outside.

444
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,940
They never ex...

445
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,420
They never suspected

446
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,920
how much larger their cage might be.

447
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,180
Praise Bob.

448
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,840
That will overcome Satan's power.

449
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,940
It's the anointing that will break the yoke

450
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,660
of Satan's bondage.

451
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
And I want you to know that I

452
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,120
had just been experiencing an attack

453
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
on all sides.

454
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,240
It seemed like on every foot

455
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
where we tried to advance,

456
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,920
the devil would just unleash,

457
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,060
literally,

458
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,600
hordes of demonic forces to stop us.

459
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,320
And after a few weeks of this,

460
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,600
I just began to feel a deep hurting

461
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,300
in my belly,

462
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,480
way deep down in my spirit.

463
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,300
And some people say,

464
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Brother Pop, of what?

465
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240
You mean you experience pain too?

466
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,020
Yes, I do.

467
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,540
I hurt just like you do.

468
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,960
I feel the pain of a satanic attack

469
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,120
just like you do.

470
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
That's why I'm concerned about you.

471
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,400
That's why I feel for you.

472
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,120
I feel in the spirit your pain

473
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,880
and your suffering and the sickness

474
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,480
that Satan throws at you

475
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,300
to try to overcome you.

476
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,020
But, bless God,

477
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,620
Satan is a defeated foe.

478
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,320
But while I felt this pain,

479
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,840
it seemed almost as if

480
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,940
a spontaneous thing happened.

481
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,140
As I finally came out of the cage,

482
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,160
I didn't know what to do.

483
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,880
I didn't know how to pray

484
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,020
because I didn't know

485
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,200
exactly what was coming at me.

486
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,660
Satan was bombarding me

487
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,720
from so many sides.

488
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,280
Actually, I felt kind of dumb.

489
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,540
Step in to the wonderful world

490
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,380
of autodynamics.

491
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,840
Step in to the swept-wing dodge

492
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,980
of 1957.

493
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,100
Here is Magic in Metal,

494
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,740
a motor car just four and a half feet low.

495
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,580
A long, lean master of motion

496
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,200
that unleashes a hurricane of power.

497
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,640
Its thundering aircraft-type V-8 engine

498
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,540
will give you a thrilling new concept

499
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,160
of automotive performance.

500
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,900
And the swept-wing dodge

501
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,760
breaks through the vibration barrier

502
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,200
into a new realm of silence

503
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,060
to almost completely shield you

504
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,020
from outside sound and shock.

505
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,080
If the last 50 years made such a change,

506
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,640
just imagine the New York of 1980,

507
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,840
when everyone has a number

508
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,480
instead of a name,

509
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,920
and the government tells you

510
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,020
whom you should marry.

511
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,080
Just imagine 1980.

512
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,680
Here, dear, take your medicine.

513
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,380
Come on, dear.

514
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,860
Let me have some more pills

515
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,800
before you go.

516
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm sorry, sir.

517
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,080


518
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,080


519
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,700
There you are.

520
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,140
Now take care of yourself.

521
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,820
Yeah, take care of yourself.

522
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,200
And if you want to get hold of some of those pills,

523
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,080
go ahead and call 823-7490,

524
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,160
because we'll send you free information

525
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,580
about the Church of the Subgenius

526
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,380
if you dare,

527
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,360
if you really dare,

528
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,520
to call in.

529
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,160
Leave your address.

530
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,280
It's all free.

531
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,680
First hits free, friends.

532
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,560
Just imagine the pills in 1990.

533
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,720
Whoa.

534
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,340
Yeah.

535
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah.

536
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Like I said, I'm back from the dead.

537
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,420
Perfect guitar to take on crusades.

538
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,980
Everybody can have one.

539
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,860
Yeah.

540
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,200
Okay.

541
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,740
Alright, everybody,

542
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:57,740


543
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,460
But Bob,

544
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,040
if you see me in my naked glory,

545
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,960
glorify me that I might glorify you.

546
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,280
To me, to me.

547
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,960
low if you say i'm ashamed of you bob and on the day of judgment bob shall say i'm ashamed of you

548
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,340
and ye shall come down off the mountain

549
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:39,380
ye who wants to be ye ye who shall soon be ye the same as they who once were as both spoken by the prophet and this is important the glory the faded glory

550
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:50,140
that shall not be recovered not by bob me ye by the pink smiling false prophets that once

551
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,160
this

552
00:19:51,340 --> 00:20:00,520
spoken that which was not peed in the river of blood and yet was somehow not involved

553
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,700
in the later slaying of john lennon i ran into a man called himself bob

554
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,840
you know i mean i plumb forgot about the fact that i had no money in no time

555
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
well bob is hot

556
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:30,700
and bob is cold and bob is young bob is old but i forgot forgot i needed to know anything else

557
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,740
i just took my own personality and put it up on the show

558
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,020
bob's brain so damn big he'll make you look like a greasy little pig oh

559
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,140
oh you'll forget about your whole personality

560
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,820
as soon as you give your entire brain to bob and me

561
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:08,040
oh give it to bob and glass madness dear friends and you're looking for a job just look for a guy

562

563
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,000
because you won't have to worry about getting that job

564
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000


565
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000


566
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000


567
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,760
You have no money, but you have, Bob.

568
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,980
Is it really?

569
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,040
Yeah, yes, it is.

570
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:32,320
I recently bought a new Atari 520SP computer.

571
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,700
Uh-huh, I know what you're going to ask.

572
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Did you know about that?

573
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,360
Yes, that is Bob in the new Atari.

574
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,780
A subgenius minister, Reverend Householder, was employed by Atari at that time

575
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,580
and was using a Bob image as a test pattern.

576
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:56,680
And they loved it and worked it into whatever that hieroglyphic font that you get with the Atari.

577
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,760
So Bob is in over 5 million homes now without those people knowing about it,

578
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,300
and he's locked onto their souls now.

579
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,140
They can't get away.

580
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,220
We'll get that check sooner or later.

581
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:14,320
All they have to do is print character strings 28 and 29 and one line and 30 and 31 to their screen,

582
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
and they will see Bob.

583
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,640
Right.

584
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,640
Take down those numbers, all numerology experts call in.

585
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,420
Yeah, we need to hear from somebody who hates us, though.

586
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,780
Yeah, we need some more hate calls and some numerology.

587
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,000
That's what religion is all about most of the time.

588
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,080
I'm sure there's no shortage of those people here, so I'll get off the line and let them call me.

589
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,040
Glad you are.

590
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,440
Thanks for sharing that with us.

591
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,620
There shall be slack.

592
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,760
Bye now.

593
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,940
Thanks for sharing that.

594
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,600
Hi, 94.1, you're on the air.

595
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah, I've just been listening for a few minutes.

596
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,980
And, I mean, this is, I've been searching for a church or something.

597
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,220
I've looked at a lot of things.

598
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,100
And I'm already just real interested in this.

599
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,100
And I just, I mean, I've only heard a few things.

600
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,040
I mean, I've only been listening for about two minutes.

601
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,380
So I would just like an address or whatever to write or...

602
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,040
Sure.

603
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,600
Oh, we're good.

604
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,660
We're good at giving our address.

605
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,440
The what?

606
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,020
We're good at giving that address.

607
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,100
Folks, get a pencil.

608
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes, do you have your pencil?

609
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,440
The thing is, I just turned the radio on.

610
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,680
Put your hands on the radio.

611
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,420
Okay, it's there.

612
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,640
Now feel, feel Bob.

613
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,200
Feel the healing power come through.

614
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,320
While you're holding on to the radio, we're going to hold a picture of Bob up so everyone can see.

615
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,040
Okay, look over there on camera four.

616
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,200
See that smiling face with the pipe in his mouth?

617
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
And that neat hair?

618
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,560
Right there on the left on monitor three.

619
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,200
That is Bob.

620
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,820
That is Bob Dobbs, the man with the pipe whose face you see on...

621
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,640
And you can reach that man with the pipe at the sacred post office box.

622
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,640
That's right, just right.

623
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:07,040
Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

624
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,620
That's P.O. Box 14...

625
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,580
Yeah, yeah, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

626
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,900
All right, and I'm sorry that, you know, you have to keep repeating this and everything.

627
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,620
It's just...

628
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,220
Oh, Bob and the fighting Jesus, we're talking to you now.

629
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,900
And we can feel it coming through in the spirit.

630
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:38,060
And we know there's a lot of special laid up members and people with genetic things that are all different.

631
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,500
And they're needing to feel the power of you.

632
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,000
And they got...

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
Some of them got tumors.

634
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,080
Some of them got cancers.

635
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,080
And some of them got...

636
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,660
Got things in their brain that won't go out.

637
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,260
And some of them see little bitty men everywhere that they don't think are real.

638
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,140
But we know they're real.

639
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,600
And we want you to make them feel right with all of this.

640
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,880
We advocate peaceful solutions to world pandemics.

641
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,600
We're ready, we're ready.

642
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We don't know why else, no more holding us down.

643
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,960
This program is trying to duplicate that.

644
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,880
I cut my hair off to spy my fate.

645
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,760
I cut my hair off to spy my fate.

646
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,840
Did you grow wiser from the experience?

647
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,760
Uh, we do not require proof of subgeniusness at all.

648
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,460
Sire, the situation is...

649
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,540
Sire, the situation is...

650
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,800
Is...

651
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,140
Is...

652
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,520
We're here at the...

653
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,900
International Festival for those who have gone too far.

654
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,520
Below us, the band serenades the fools as they dance on the empty glass sea of mystery.

655
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,400
Yes, it's an exciting day here at the Fool Symposium.

656
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
Uh, here comes...

657
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:15,760


658
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:15,760


659
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:15,860
Here comes...

660
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,420
The President's Limousine.

661
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Dumping the dirt on the freeway of success.

662
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,580
Dumping the dirt on the freeway of success.

663
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,880
And there's his curly-headed wife playing the bass drum.

664
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,920
And the small but polite audience...

665
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,060
And the small but polite audience...

666
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,060


667
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,560
...of those who don't know any better.

668
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,180
...of those who don't know any better.

669
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,520
We are Obama!

670
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,900
We are Obama!

671
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,640
The relating of spiritual declension is never a pretty sight or a pretty picture.

672
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,660
Because as foolish as Bob gets, as foolish as Bob gets, it's the wisdom of the ages.

673
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:25,580
It's the foolishness and the idiocy that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot in life.

674
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:36,420
It is that stupidity which has caused man to build his great monuments, his mighty gas-powered engines, his nuclear reactors.

675
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:44,260
It is that which has given man his urge to master the entire earth.

676
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,960
No matter how nice it was before.

677
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:59,100
And it is this mighty sacred archetype of an urge that's in Bob and in all of us that makes us want to smite our brothers.

678
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,600
And friends, if it weren't for that, where would us subgeniuses be?

679
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,020
We'd be like everybody else.

680
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,580
We'd be no different.

681
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,540
We'd have nothing.

682
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,500
We'd gripe about.

683
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,520
And without the mighty grunt power and the mighty hate, the hate for the normal that we can feed,

684
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,520
the hate that can make us go out and earn something for nothing,

685
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:44,280
the hate that will make us overcome every last conspiracy attempt to hold us down that there's ever been.

686
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,860
In the long run, we may stay poor and broke.

687
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,340
We may stay neurotic or whatever we started out as or whatever we may fall into.

688
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,720
But by God, we've got Bob and Annie.

689
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,160
And for that, we can hate them.

690
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,740
Hate them.

691
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,180
Hate them.

692
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,940
Call us and talk about what you'd wish.

693
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,520
Hey, you guys, come close.

694
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,860
Did I tell you I was at the Republican National Convention?

695
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,460
Because I'm studying evolution.

696
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,020
89.3 FM.

697
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,240
If you're close enough to someone to have intimate relations with them, you're close enough to discuss AIDS.

698
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,580
Embarrassment is a real poor excuse for risking your life.

699
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,220
There are over one million intravenous drug abusers in this country.

700
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,740
Every single one of them is at risk of getting AIDS.

701
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,860
So are their sexual partners.

702
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Don't put yourself at risk.

703
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,440
Every time I shot up, I thought about getting AIDS.

704
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,440


705
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,500
Because sharing needles or works can give you AIDS.

706
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,800
And the truth is, skin popping is just as dangerous as mainlining.

707
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,420
Now I'm in drug treatment.

708
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm not using drugs anymore.

709
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,660
Treatment's better than walking around scared of AIDS.

710
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,280
Misinformation is as dangerous as no information.

711
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,000
And there's no reason not to have the facts about AIDS.

712
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,020
You can call the National Institute on Drug Abuse toll-free for more information.

713
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,440
That information could save lives.

714
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,440
Call 1-800-662-HELP.

715
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,200
If you're shooting drugs or sleeping with someone who does, you may get more than you bargained for.

716
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,260
AIDS.

717
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,480
AIDS is an equal opportunity killer.

718
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,140
The risk comes not from who you are, but from what you do.

719
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,860
Get the facts about AIDS.

720
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,620
It could save your life.

721
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,720
Call 1-800-662-HELP for more information.

722
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:51,780
This message is a public service announcement brought to you by KNON 89.3 FM.

723
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,280
The voice of and for the people.

724
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,940
Oh, yes.

725
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,880
But I bet you most of you subgeniuses don't have to worry about that quite so much for yourselves.

726
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,920
Because you're getting high off a bob.

727
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,920
You don't need drugs when you got bob in your life.

728
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,980
You hear me?

729
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,060
You hear what I'm saying now?

730
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,220
Because bob is the one high that you never, ever come down from, dear friends.

731
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
You want a little whiskey?

732
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,380
Uh, yeah, I'll have another whiskey.

733
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,820
Well, it's a quite a nice place, isn't it?

734
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,840
Yeah, isn't it?

735
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,440
Yeah, I didn't know they had any tapas bars.

736
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,380
Oh, yes, we have topless bars in Europe, of course.

737
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,200
What do you think?

738
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,260
This is a whole chain set up by Nixon himself.

739
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,200
Oh, yeah.

740
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,960
It's a business.

741
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,080
Hell, tricky dick.

742
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,240
Here's the dick.

743
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,160
Yeah.

744
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,460
Oh.

745
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:37,460


746
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,500
Like, uh, well, there's the bad side to it all, you know.

747
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,120
Oh, there's a bad side, too.

748
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,720
Yeah.

749
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,540
What kind of bad side, my boy?

750
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:59,660
Well, you know, all this, there's, of course, the evil pet dog of Jehovah, you know, that old, the old, unmentionable pet dog of Jehovah.

751
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you mean me, yeah.

752
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
Hey, hey, wait.

753
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
Shh, shh, don't say that.

754
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,380
Uh, Nicky, why can't I say Nicky?

755
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,420
You said it again.

756
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:19,740
Look, I'm gonna sit here at this table with you, but I gotta promise not to keep invoking all these evil demons, you know.

757
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:34,700
Uh, but, uh, Bob always said to me when we got something like a real-life nude girl or something like that, he said, let's do some Nicky Nicky.

758
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:34,700


759
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you better watch it. You better watch it, okay?

760
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,560
Because, you know, I mean, I have to sit here by you. I don't wanna, I don't wanna be caught when the sh...

761
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,020
Do you see the bill?

762
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,180
Oh, my God.

763
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,980
Four million dollars?

764
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,240
Four million dollars? That's quite an expensive buy.

765
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,600
But I only had three drinks of whiskey.

766
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah, it's amazing, but I can never pay four million dollars. It's going to ruin me.

767
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,340
Oh, why did you ever have to mention that?

768
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,480
That...

769
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,600
What?

770
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,280
I'm not going to say it. Things are bad enough.

771
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:18,160
Uh, you mean the dog? The dark side of Bob, is it true?

772
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:33,100
You know very well it's true. You brought me here yourself. You tricked me. You made me come here to follow the path of this strange, weird Bob who we knew nothing about.

773
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,220
Oh.

774
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,800
Oh, why did I ever leave America? Oh.

775
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:43,300
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Don't you start whining now.

776
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:52,280
Look, the evil forces can be attacked very easily.

777
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:03,660
Look, I open my pants, and I take out my big Bob glands. See?

778
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,300
Whoa. Huh.

779
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,780
And I wave it around here, and see what happens?

780
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,380
Yeah.

781
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

782
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,340
Ah, the bill is dissolving.

783
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,520
The bill is dissolving, and we can just leave without any problems. Come, my boy, let's go outside.

784
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,780
Yeah, let's get out of here.

785
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,560
Here is my car. Get in.

786
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,900
Okay. Hey, are you sure you should drive?

787
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,240
Oh, yes, I'll drive, of course. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

788
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,980
Yeah, you drive.

789
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,480
So, here we are.

790
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,720
Yeah, nice place.

791
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,840
In my home. Here is a cup of coffee.

792
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,320
Boy, I need it.

793
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:57,260
Oh, yes. Let me show you something very important. See this photograph?

794
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,260
Yes.

795
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,680
Do you recognize the man in the middle?

796
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,940
Of course, it's Bob.

797
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,040
You see his pipe?

798
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,860
Yeah, yeah, and there's two men standing there with him. One to the right, one to the left.

799
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:18,560
Yes, the one on the right is Joseph Stalin, and the other one you will recognize for sure.

800
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,120
Oh, it's Roosevelt.

801
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,180
Yes.

802
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,180
And they're slicing a pie.

803
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,820
Bob is actually slicing a pie, yes.

804
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,500
But it's the strangest shaped pie I've ever seen.

805
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,820
It is a pie in the form of Europe, my boy.

806
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,780
Ah.

807
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,340
He made a great, great sale in America by getting fluoride in the water.

808
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,760
But here in Europe, he outdid himself.

809
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:56,840
He sliced Europe in two and sold one half to Joseph Stalin and the other half to Roosevelt.

810
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,480
Ah, it is so good to find something like that.

811
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm going to ask somebody from the Empire here in Europe interested in the real story.

812
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
How is the Emperor doing?

813
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:18,340
Well, you know, ever since that operation on his third nostril, you know, then there was that pyroflagellation incident.

814
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,860
They found that microfilm up there.

815
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,920
The whole Iran scandal just blew up.

816
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,220
Yes, it backfired badly, didn't it?

817
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,800
Yes, it did.

818
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,340
It was a tragic incident.

819
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,700
Yes, the entire country was looking up his third eye, wasn't it?

820
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,120
Yeah.

821
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,400
Yeah.

822
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,220
So, here we have the beginning of the conspiracy.

823
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,020
This is where it actually all began.

824
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,200
How am I sure you are not from the conspiracy, my boy?

825
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,200
Well, well, I...

826
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,480
Hey, wait a minute. What about you?

827
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,680
Let me show you something else.

828
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,240
Okay. See these little kids here?

829
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,000
Did you know that Bob made children?

830
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,480
Huh?

831
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,440
Oh.

832
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,740
It is quite a story.

833
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,600
But this is actually his grandson.

834
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,180
Huh.

835
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,260
And I am raising him.

836
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,980
And I guess you are not with the conspiracy.

837
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:44,840
If you act like a dumb , they will treat you as an equal.

838
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,660
How true.

839
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,600
True.

840
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,440
But it is time to go, my son.

841
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,520
It was nice meeting you.

842
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,020
Yes.

843
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,200
I guess this little interview will do.

844
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,740
It will change your history.

845
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
See you later.

846
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,580
Goodbye.

847
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,900
So, there you have it.

848
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,260
We began on a search for Bob.

849
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:28,280
The things we discovered, well, none of us may know for sure whether or not they really happened.

850
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,920
But one thing is true.

851
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,380
The destiny of the subgenius has been changed forever.

852
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,080
Nothing can ever remain the same.

853
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:55,040
And now, as a new generation of the Dobbs family reaches its maturity, I have to leave you now.

854
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:04,000
and hopefully you will find your own true

855
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:13,840
thank you very much and good night thank you inhibiting factor and Willem de

856
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,180
Ritter

857
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,860
Amsterdam radio in Holland oh yes and this is Oingo Boingo also talking about

858
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,620
the conspiracy

859
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,120
yeah

860
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,700
This is fairytale.

861
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,380
Are you deserving, Joyce?

862
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,700
It's time to die.

863
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm fighting with the world.

864
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,540
You're the only things I ever trust in.

865
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,460
We're scattered, living in a city.

866
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,100
I'm just a member.

867
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,040
Single, red, love, under, cold, and ice.

868
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,180
Better for life than jail.

869
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,280
War is coming.

870
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,420
There's not so much that we can do.

871
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,540
Stay to the people.

872
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,600
The operator will knock me through.

873
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,880
It's the first.

874
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,100
The memory is burning my brain.

875
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,020
I'm in.

876
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,020


877
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,060
I'm going insane.

878
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

879
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,220
You're the winner.

880
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,620
There's no excuse.

881
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm just a person.

882
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,060
I'm just a person.

883
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,140
I'm not the one to go home.

884
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,300
Since the wind, we're all my friends.

885
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,440
Stay in bed until the world ends.

886
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,060
So please go home.

887
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,360
I can't just speak.

888
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,840
Single, red, love.

889
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
You're the only things I ever trust in.

890
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,980
Go home.

891
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,860
I'm just a member.

892
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,040
I'm just a member.

893
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,240
Better for life than jail.

894
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,000
Single, red, love.

895
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:03,840


896
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,620
I can't just be single.

897
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,340
Single, red, love.

898
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,340


899
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,800
I can't just stay.

900
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,720
I can't.

901
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:20,720


902
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,960
I think I'm going insane

903
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

904
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,420
This is a fairy tale

905
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,060
This can't be real

906
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,320
They're sliding all around

907
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,020
They're screwing in the fields

908
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,580
They say their values change

909
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,180
When hunger or ambition strikes

910
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,840
So what of this ascension?

911
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,260
And it comes for any price

912
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,660
The cartoon animals

913
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,120
Are over at Donald's farm

914
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,240
I'm nodding off

915
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,040
The hotel rooms

916
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,320
With eaters in their arms

917
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,160
The seven dwarves

918
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,640
There's only four alive today

919
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,940
Cinderella

Is working for the CIA

00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,940
Cinderella

922
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,200
The fairy tale's over

923
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,040
You should know you've got

924
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,260
The scars to prove it

925
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,020
And the skills and

926
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,600
The strongest you're used to

927
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,760
I don't care

928
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,320
Come on, jump in

929
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,820

How our hearts

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:05,660

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:05,660


942
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:05,660

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:05,660

Swoosh

947
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:06,860
In

948
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,420
Well

949
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:10,920
Sigh

950
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,420
That sure makes total sense

951
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,680
We just got the

952
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,380

953
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,180

956
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,340
than for this limitation.

957
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,420
Then a small brown hawk passed by.

958
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,740
Small brown hawk passed by for me to up and through it.

959
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,440
Hawk passed by, and Gog rocketed up and through it.

960
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,360
Gog swooped low over me before flying off to battle.

961
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,140
For me before flying off to battle.

962
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,260
Gog swooped low over me before flying off to battle.

963
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,840
Soon my Gog exploded in a similar way through a dove.

964
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,760
Through a dove.

965
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,620
Through a dove.

966
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,960
Through a dove.

967
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,280
O'

968
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:47,440


969
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:47,640
O'

970
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:47,920
O'

971
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,240
O'

972
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:48,600


973
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:48,900
O'

974
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:48,940
O'

975
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,020


976
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,560
O'

977
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:50,580


978
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:50,580


979
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:50,680


980
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:50,680


981
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:51,660
O'

982
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,460
O'

983
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,980
being shown in the baptismal font.

984
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:28,580
Oh.

985
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,920
Yes, sir.

986
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,140
That was Onan Canobite.

987
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,160
Dr. Onan Canobite.

988
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,740
The youngest subgenius doctor.

989
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,180
And he continues.

990
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,700
And so does Robert Anton Wilson here, who said that,

991
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,240
quote,

992
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,300
the late Lawrence Labade once told me a parable about a king

993
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,880
who decided that every time he met somebody,

994
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,820
he would kick them in the butt just to emphasize his power.

995
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,680
Since this maniac wore a crown and had an army,

996
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,200
people soon learned to tolerate being kicked fairly often

997
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,000
and even began to accept it philosophically or stoically

998
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,160
as they experienced it.

999
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,660
Except taxation and other impositions of kings and governors.

1000
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,140
They even learned to bend over as soon as they saw the king coming.

1001
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,400
Oh, well, friends.

1002
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,800
Have you already bent over?

1003
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,560
I hope not.

1004
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,740
Get out there and vote, please.

1005
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,680
I hear from New Orleans.

1006
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,180
Is this satire?

1007
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:44,280
This is satire.

1008
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,900
That's all.

1009
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,420
Nobody.

1010
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,820
How much is a bucket of pills these days?

1011
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,520
Like, just on the street price.

1012
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,800
Like, we just want one bucket.

1013
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,500
I'm not talking about a whole bathtub.

1014
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:53,940
What do you get?

1015
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,840
The bathtubs of pills that are rumored that we demand before we go on.

1016
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,780
That's just, you know, a little bit.

1017
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,720
Stretching it a bit.

1018
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,100
We would like a bucket of pills.

1019
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,000
That's what we call Rolling Stone.

1020
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,360
They gave us a court just before we got here.

1021
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,960
But that's just...

1022
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,000
A little champagne glass.

1023
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,940
Tiny champagne glasses of pills.

1024
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,960
And they weren't the irreversible pills.

1025
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,500
Either.

1026
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,380
That was the problem.

1027
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,100
They weren't the ones that you come down.

1028
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,400
They were the flat on the inside.

1029
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:19,720
They were the ones that you came down.

1030
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,380
Yeah.

1031
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:20,900
Yeah.

1032
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,240
Yeah.

1033
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:27,960
Well, I still need to have, for my dressing room, a coffin lined with mirrors and a recording

1034
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,600
of a...

1035
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:29,180
A...

1036
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,240
A...

1037
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,400
At all times playing a distant roar of applause so all reality except for my ego is blotted

1038
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:36,720
out.

1039
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,080
And, I mean...

1040
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,680
This is not some church where we try to get you to do this song.

1041
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,980
Oh, your ego.

1042
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,960
You live up to the new age whips of the unicorn-riding dragon cucks.

1043
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,420
Here, he shines.

1044
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,320
Don't sound...

1045
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,800
Twinkle-cold, kindness bastards out there.

1046
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,520
Northwest fire.

1047
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,580
You can blow everyone outside of this room.

1048
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,400
Praise God.

1049
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,860
Praise God.

1050
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,820
Praise God.

1051
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,420
I didn't say you got no legs.

1052
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,560
But I ain't got no legs.

1053
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:07,740
Let's roll.

1054
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,320
Fire.

1055
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,260
Dear Dr. Ello, Purdy is our six-year-old parakeet.

1056
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,320
My only concern about him is that he's spending so much time fussing with his preen gland.

1057
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,420
I think that's what he's doing.

1058
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,960
Anyway, it's in that area.

1059
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,400
You know that area at the base of his tail?

1060
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,480
That kind of smelly area?

1061
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,040
Dr. Ello, do preen glands itch in parakeets during the fruiting season?

1062
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:49,880
Or what?

1063
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,520
How can I read?

1064
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,960
Sign me RC in Manitoba, Canada.

1065
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:53,940
Wow.

1066
00:49:54,040 --> 00:50:00,720
Dear RC, Purdy's putrid preen gland, that is to say, preen gland rather, could itch,

1067
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,480
certainly, but it could be a more significant problem than that.

1068
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,600
Your budgie may have Sherman's disease.

1069
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:13,300
This will require that your entire home be sandblasted and flame-tested with temperature

1070
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,800
above 7,000 degrees.

1071
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,440
And you yourself must be quarantined for an indefinite time period while forced to watch

1072
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,520
driver's education videos.

1073
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:26,940
But it's all part of the wonderful thrills of owning a petite, puffed-up parakeet,

1074
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,160
twittering its way into your heart.

1075
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,860
He's talking over there more than my mind when I'm talking, which I don't like that.

1076
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,280
I need some more over here.

1077
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,400
Hey, is that, yeah, okay, I see.

1078
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,940
Just switch it down, switch it off.

1079
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,620
Oh, it's the both doing it. Okay.

1080
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,180
The one that really gets me is that one that's like an oscilloscope.

1081
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:52,200
If you could be here, folks, I think you would really appreciate the wonders of modern radio communication.

1082
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,660
Yes, and you can be here if you want to call 823-7490 and find out what's going on.

1083
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,920
It's kind of like a, I don't know, I'm just going to do this.

1084
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,860
Whatever it's doing, I don't know, but it's doing it.

1085
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,920
Please, don't just tell me how you are, Mom.

1086
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,520
Tell me how you are.

1087
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,480
How are you?

1088
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,200
I'm sick.

1089
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,080
I'm sorry to hear it.

1090
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,600
I really am.

1091
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,160
What's wrong?

1092
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:18,920
Nothing.

1093
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,880
You know what it is, honey.

1094
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,320
Yeah.

1095
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,680
It's the same thing it's always been.

1096
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,500
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1097
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,340
It's my nerves.

1098
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1099
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,240
And I went to the doctor.

1100
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,700
Yeah.

1101
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,680
He told me right out.

1102
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:31,860
Yeah, yeah.

1103
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,020
He said, listen, Mrs. White.

1104
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,700
Yeah, yeah.

1105
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,020
Who are you fooling?

1106
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,520
You are a very nervous.

1108
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,440
Very high strung.

1110
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:41,500
Yeah.

1111
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:41,880
And you're a very strong woman.

1112
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1113
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,900
Well, God knows that's true.

1114
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,560
Yeah, yeah.

1115
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,020
And you cannot stand the slightest aggravation.

1116
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,800
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1117
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,620
I said, Doctor, I know that.

1118
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:50,940
Yeah.

1119
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,420
I mean, I know better too.

1120
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,380
I said, but you see, Doctor.

1122
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:54,900
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1123
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,740
I have this son.

1124
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,680
He is.

1125
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,540
It's the truth.

1126
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,860
The boy is not lying.

1127
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,360
He is.

1128
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,180
He's very busy.

1129
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,880
You see, Doctor, he's too busy to pick up a phone and call his mother.

1130
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,820
Honey, listen, Mom.

1131
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,100
Dear, I want you to tell.

1132
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:10,160
Mom.

1133
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,500
Well, Arthur, when I said that to him, he said, I'm sorry.

1134
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:11,500


1135
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,480
Administrator Obama wanted to be a Medicare??

1136
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:12,480


1137
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,460
The guy he's working for泪

1138
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,960
Yeah.

1139
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:26,960


1140
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,920
You think I don't remember and use.

1141
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,160
I worked for a?

1142
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,160


1143
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,160


1144
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,160


1145
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,480
You, I didn't put a number for you.

1146
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:30,920
You said you're not having dinner?

1147
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:30,920


1148
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,320
I think you should call so I could say, Mom, I love you.

1149
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,640
Unfortunately, I was moisture, and I wasn't home.

1150
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,260
I wrote you my birthday vows?

1151
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:41,440
Oh.

1152
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:54,460
I feel that by taking everything personally and then freely talking about my grief and anguish that I can gradually work toward being a better person.

1153
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:01,200
Okay, the high point of my life was when I was about five years old.

1154
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:06,380
After that, it was a long downhill skid into adulthood.

1155
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:14,240
I had some pretty bad problems in high school, some difficulties with my father and my girlfriend.

1156
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,820
And I guess I can tell you about those later, but for now...

1157
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,600
Yes, that was Joe Person with the story of his life.

1158
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,700
Great, great story, Joe. Is he out of here? Good.

1159
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,560
Some say that history is the birth certificate of the present.

1160
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,360
Others, that the present is the present.

1161
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,100
The present is the epitaph of history.

1162
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,520
We say, the bucket of dialectics has a thousand leaks.

1163
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:48,340
And if you're tired of the itching, burning sensation caused by walking around in wet shoes,

1164
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,660
Relaxative Laboratories has got the product for you.

1165
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:58,480
Sure, the hoary past lives on, captured for all time in the annals of neurological regurgitation.

1166
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,660
But aren't you more than ready for an exciting career in guilt-free existence?

1167
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,360
Wouldn't you like a healthy dose of...

1168
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,740
free-for-all amnesia and still be able to find your house?

1169
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,860
This new product is not available in stores.

1170
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,300
And it comes with our no-risk, money-back guarantee.

1171
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,000
Simply try it for 30 days, and if you're not satisfied, return it for a full refund.

1172
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,580
And we can all forget the whole thing ever happened.

1173
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:47,900
OOO energetic begging and small and

1174
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:47,980
this has a thousand leaksPC

1175
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,000
This just falls asleep in it'silib groups.

1176
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,720
Can support a free mukbang in that either with a piece of food or something corporate.

1177
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,740
the mercies. And I heard them say,

1178
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,240
flat out!

1179
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,120
My transgressions.

1180
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,340
And then I want you to wash me.

1181
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,640
And what can wash away

1182
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,320
my sins?

1183
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,740
Time won't do it.

1184
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,100
Blue cheer won't do it.

1185
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,420
Cold power won't do it.

1186
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,580
Ox and dog won't do it.

1187
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,940
But nothing

1188
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,640
but the blood of Jesus.

1189
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,520
Say yes, Lord!

1190
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,660
Yeah!

1191
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,040
Megatron's

1192
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,220
monster transporter

1193
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,720
flows its way up

1194
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,420
to the sea.

1195
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,800
I don't know anything about running a regular show.

1196
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,600
But if you can hear me out there,

1197
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,780
this is the first time

1198
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,540
I'm actually going to take over this show.

1199
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,760
I think

1200
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,540
I can

1201
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,860
hang on to it for a minute here.

1202
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,240
I've got the show

1203
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,920
and I've got to go right now.

1204
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,620
Somewhere around here, I'm actually going to see

1205
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,320
if I can make the things come out.

1206
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:48,500
I've got the things.

1207
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,320
I've got the things.

1208
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,020
I've got the things.

1209
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,240
I've got the things.

1210
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,320
What are you waiting for then?

1211
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,620
Things come on here.

1212
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,020
Let's see.

1213
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,940
I'm going to try this.

1214
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,040
The problem is that the tiny little voices...

1215
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,560
Oh, there's one now.

1216
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,240
There's a...

1217
00:55:59,240 --> 00:55:59,740
Yeah, okay.

1218
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,120
They just come at you and they don't stop.

1219
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,560
It's really easy.

1220
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,040
The stuff that they do that sounds so strange...

1221
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,520
Get that one over there.

1222
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,640
It's really...

1223
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,500
Just push these buttons here.

1224
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,220
There's too much technology.

1225
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,120
This is great.

1226
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,460
Okay, now...

1227
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,200
All right.

1228
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,540
Taka-taka-buda-buda.

1229
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,020
This is the Dr. Drummond.

1230
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,960
Dr. Drummond Radio Hour.

1231
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,080
The Hum Drummond Radio Hour.

1232
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:23,740
Now I'm running this show.

1233
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,480
You can hum along with Dr. Drummond.

1234
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,480
I've commandeered the show.

1235
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,540
You've got a patch of...

1236
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,060
Came straight from St. Louis.

1237
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,460
Yes, I've got...

1238
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,140
Well, where is the show going next?

1239
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,140
Those are my underlings I brought with me.

1240
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,400
They're really not the guys that ordinarily run the show.

1241
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,100
Look, Dr. D.

1242
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,240
We've got a collar.

1243
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,960
Check out the board.

1244
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,680
It's lit up like a Christmas tree.

1245
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,880
Just some kind of...

1246
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,280
What you like...

1247
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,560
Ask Dr. Philodrum.

1248
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,200
This is the truth.

1249
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,920
Come on, collar.

1250
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,680
This is the truth.

1251
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,000
Come on, collar.

1252
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,320
This is the truth.

1253
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,000
The collars do call in.

1254
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,460
Can't call in anymore, though, now, because we're going off.

1255
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,480
Making room for Robert Wisdom's American Music Party.

1256
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,340
Please stay tuned for that.

1257
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,900
A lot of fun.

1258
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,620
And horror, both.

1259
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,400
Depending on whether he's playing blues or...

1260
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,880
I guess it's all blues.

1261
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,740
Ah, yes.

1262
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,920
Well, dear friends, you can...

1263
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,880
This is my last three-minute statement here.

1264
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:35,520
Please do send in a request for free information to the Subgenius Church.

1265
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,400
We can give you a post office box.

1266
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,440
Get that pencil ready.

1267
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,040
Just drop us a line, a postcard, saying,

1268
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,920
Hey, I may not spend any money, but I want to know what's going on.

1269
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,560
And you'll get at least a few hints.

1270
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,420
And that address is...

1271
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:10,960
Just write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1272
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,000
75214.

1273
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,000
Once again, that's Box 140306.

1274
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,180
In Dallas, Texas.

1275
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:23,500
75214.

1276
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,220
And I think I'll just let Chris Gross...

1277
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,580
This is Dr. Chris Gross in the background.

1278
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,180
I'm going to let his music just take us out here,

1279
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,000
because it's as good as anything else I can put on right now.

1280
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,920
And that's saying a lot.

1281
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,080
Ah, yes.

1282
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,480
Praise Bobby.

1283
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,500
Ah, yes.

1284
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:03,240
Praise Bobby.

1285
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,360
Praise Bobby.

1286
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,820
Really, he's just so hot right now.

1287
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:08,820


1288
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:08,820


1289
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:08,820


1290
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:08,820


1291
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:08,960
I'll put him out there as fast as I can,

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:08,960


1294
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:08,960


1295
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:08,960


1296
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:08,960


1297
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,700
That's basically the lebenheit.

1298
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:09,700


1299
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,680

01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:19,980
To body wear?

1302
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,100
some other things to play for you later.

1303
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:29,620
