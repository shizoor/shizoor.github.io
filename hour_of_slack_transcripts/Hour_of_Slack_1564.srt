1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,460
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,340
What's on the radio?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,820
Oh, this radio's no joke.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,180
Turn it on, see.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,760
Thanks.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,540
No, not that one, Ann.

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,600
That's my police radio.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,320
That's what you're in.

10
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,040
Right.

11
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,540
The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

12
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,180
You're becoming a regular boy scout, aren't you?

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,140
Aren't you?

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,480
I can take care of myself.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,780
Oh, I see.

16
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,220
What do you think, then?

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,680
Let me be perfectly clear here.

18
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,680
This is Over the Edge,

19
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,360
and also, simultaneously,

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,660
it is the Puzzling Evidence Show.

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,560
How can that be?

22
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,200
And we're going for five hours tonight,

23
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,200
right here on kpfa.org online,

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,380
where we can look on our monitors

25
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,580
and see where you're tuned in from.

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,300
There's no other stations.

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,300
If you're listening in Sweden,

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,260
we see that.

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
We see that someone is tuned in in Sweden.

30
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,800
We can see you.

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:00:59,920
Yeah.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,240
We can see you under your clothes.

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,280
Britt Eklund.

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,260
If you're in Sweden, give us a call.

35
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,180
You know,

36
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,640
what was her name?

37
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,940
Bridget Thorntonsen?

38
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,660
That's correct.

39
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,200
That starred with...

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,860
Yes.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Yeah.

42
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,340
The famous model.

43
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,880
Yeah.

44
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,340
Yeah.

45
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,800
Are you saying that she could be me right now?

46
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,140
You've got the one that made the...

47
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,640
We can beam you right now.

48
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,300
...Singmar's wife.

49
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,160
And Christine Jorgensen.

50
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,280
Beautiful girl ever.

51
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,300
Welcome to Babylon.

52
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,300


53
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,960
Well, that was...

54
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:30,820
I guess...

55
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,640
You know, can you fill in our listeners

56
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,220
about this whole trial?

57
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,820
I mean, because this whole...

58
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,600
Jesus, these are two subgeni who are being...

59
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
whose reproductive rights are being trashed

60
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,220
and whose right to reproduce

61
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,760
their own mutated versions of the human race

62
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,740
are actually being prevented by the law

63
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,800
in the form of a judge, I believe, in Texas?

64
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,640
No.

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,160
New York.

66
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,240
New York judge.

67
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,540
Yes.

68
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,020
In New York.

69
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,680
In Texas, they said,

70
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,940
whatever you do,

71
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,420
don't take that child back to New York.

72
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,300
But Jesus and Magdalene

73
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,620
took the Christ child.

74
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,300
Yeah.

75
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,860
Bob, who's called Conbo, by the way.

76
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,000
Conbo is a cute little boy of about...

77
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,240
Conbo.

78
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,380
...eleven now.

79
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,920
You know, like Marjo.

80
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,660
Yeah.

81
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,180
Oh.

82
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,660
Judge Punch John.

83
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,000
Marion.

84
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Marjo is named after Marion Joseph, right?

85
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:23,900
Yeah.

86
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,380
Conbo is Connie and Bob.

87
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,460
Anyway, Jesus and Magdalene...

88
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,640
The subgenius business managers at that time

89
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,020
had a custody problem going on with the child's father,

90
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,720
who was a pink human.

91
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,400
And at one point, the judge was shown photographs

92
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,440
of a typical X-Day drill celebration

93
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,860
in which Jesus and his wife were doing normal X-Day things.

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,400
And this shocked the judge so much

95
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
that he said that the mother was...

96
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,700
Unbelievable.

97
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,540
...not a fit mother

98
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,520
because she was a member of Church of the Subgenius

99
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,700
and gave custody of the child to the father,

100
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,460
who was basically a ne'er-do-well welfare cheat thief

101
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
in a trailer court.

102
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,520
And it wasn't even a double Y!

103
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,120
Unbelievable.

104
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah.

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,820
No.

106
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,740
It was an X-Y.

107
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,220
And the case made the news on the internet

108
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,380
and created quite a bit of buzz.

109
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,380


110
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,900
It made quite a bit of stir

111
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,760
and caused many people to buy memberships from the church.

112
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,080
Oh, good!

113
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,960
It made me quite rich.

114
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,660
So it was a helpful...

115
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,340
Oh, that's good.

116
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,260
However, they...

117
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,280
You're getting rich off me?

118
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,880
Yeah, that's good.

119
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,400
The good, kindly, well-educated, hardworking subgenius parents

120
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,800
still are not allowed to see their child

121
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
until the judge makes up his mind.

122
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
The first judge...

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,940
That's obscene.

124
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
The first judge was screwed up so bad...

125
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,400
Seriously, it's disgusting.

126
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,220
...he was refused...

127
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,540
He had to be...

128
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,800
He had to step down from the case.

129
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,160
Why?

130
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,300
Because he was such a jerk?

131
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,400
He was so stupid that he...

132
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
He recused himself.

133
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,620
So next time you're fired from a job, just say...

134
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,360
Just say, I've recused myself.

135
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,960
...I've recused myself because I was too emotionally tied to the job.

136
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,380
Well, the second guy should have done that.

137
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,260
Why?

138
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,680
Why?

139
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,140
Because...

140
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,320
Why?

141
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,560
Because he was a what?

142
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:23,080
He was such a Christian that he couldn't handle the idea of a cult sense of humor or a church

143
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,700
sense of humor?

144
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:32,940
Well, the images that threw him were the beautiful Magdalene with Jesus drawing a

145
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,400
heart on her privates in front of a crowd on the internet.

146
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,840
The other thing that bothered him was Jesus dressed in clown... in a Jesus suit with clown

147
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,160
face being beaten in a parody of that Mel Gibson movie, being beaten by naked women

148
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,260
with dildos.

149
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,200
Did you see a clown face?

150
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,400
It was a takeoff on the Passion of the Christ, which they thought was not bloody enough and

151
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
they decided to restage it.

152
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,380
Could there be a connection with the insane clown posse people?

153
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,040
No, just some of the photographs that were on subgenius.com.

154
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,540
Yeah.

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
This is...

156
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,960
Maybe it's just a juggalo.

157
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,200
Unbelievable.

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,920
Well...

159
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,780
What's unbelievable?

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,780
Well...

161
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,440
I think I can believe it.

162
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,080
No, it would hurt them.

163
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,240
Well, because, you know, I think that's what I'm saying.

164
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,240


165
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,240


166
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,240


167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,100
In other words, because the judge...

168
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,500
I don't believe anything.

169
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,200
Does anybody talk about those...

170
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,280
Everything you know is true.

171
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,780
You'll see in a moment.

172
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
You should believe everything that I say.

173
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,920
Yeah, because what...

174
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,820
I don't know about stank, I mean, but...

175
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,380
No wrinkles for me.

176
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,540
They're happy.

177
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,100
That's pretty scary, though.

178
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,380
Subgeni, they can take your baby away.

179
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,920
I won't even say...

180
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,780
Don't let me jinx it.

181
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,360
Look, they don't take babies away from strippers.

182
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,060
You know, they...

183
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,480
They don't take babies away from performance artists.

184
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,180
Yeah, I know.

185
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,580
They don't take babies away from big channels.

186
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,220
Because they don't have...

187
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


188
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


189
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


190
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


191
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,380
They don't have any.

192
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,900
I don't believe that they won't let them have any.

193
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,140
They don't let them have any.

194
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,460
They turn the baby away from...

195
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah.

196
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
A guy has a job.

197
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Jesus and Magdalene.

198
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,240
And he has a job, right?

199
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,120
Oh, yeah.

200
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,780
They both have three jobs.

201
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,240
They both...

202
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,140
They have three jobs.

203
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,520
They're college-educated subgeniuses who are responsible citizens and yet...

204
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,060
That's why they...

205
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,320
You know, normally, the courts just blindly give the kid to the mob.

206
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,200
But in this case, they blindly gave the kid to the Christian or the...

207
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,540
Yeah.

208
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,280
Absolutely abolished him.

209
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,440
Right.

210
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,560
The Christian deadbeat...

211
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,480
The deadbeat Christian dad...

212
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,400
Who was beating...

213
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,960
Garage band...

214
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,400
A dead horse instead of a live Jesus who was being beaten at X Day.

215
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,120
And the judge didn't think that was funny or...

216
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah.

217
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,760
Rather, we're not...

218
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,380
It's not that we're...

219
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,700
Yeah.

220
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,020
It's not that it's sick humor.

221
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,940
We're a reflection of the illness in society around us.

222
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:45,960
Exactly.

223
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,300
Of course.

224
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,620
I wonder if the judge was more...

225
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:47,800
I...

226
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm just a reflection of everybody else's...

227
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Failure.

228
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,100
Failure and neurosis at the moment.

229
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah.

230
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah.

231
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,080
Yeah.

232
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,720
We're not really totally screwed up.

233
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,860
We're a reflection of a screwed up society.

234
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,800
So, all people ever...

235
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,800
That's right.

236
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,620
Or, as we put it, officer, have you ever heard of Mad Magazine?

237
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,140
You're right, Tony.

238
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,820
Sure can.

239
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,140
That's how you really...

240
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,580
That's how the court case...

241
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:16,600
Is that what your lawyer said?

242
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:16,960
No.

243
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,820
That's how it should have started.

244
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,600
But they forgot that crucial line.

245
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh...

246
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,820
I believe you.

247
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,400
Scotty, you round up the crew.

248
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,100
I wonder if...

249
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,840
Well, you know, they will never take away Philo's baby, wonderful baby, because Philo

250
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,500
has a job.

251
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,140
And so...

252
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,900
Good night, Phil.

253
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,320
A few salesmen for a large downtown department store...

254
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
He has a really good job.

255
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
I mean, not like Philo.

256
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,440
... reports each weekend is only two days off.

257
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,120
Why is it...

258
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,080
... to the office of the police...

259
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,020
Everyone in Iran is a subpoena.

260
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,520
... between immigrants from Middle East countries...

261
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,860
Everything was one-off, huh?

262
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:52,960
... and the government.

263
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


264
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


265
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


266
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


267
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


268
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


269
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


270
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:52,960


271
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
The president is the head of the subpoena.

272
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,720
Well, good morning, Miss Helvinger.

273
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,620
Oh, good morning, Southern Fighter.

274
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,720
Well, once more, I'm here to strike terrific terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere.

275
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,800
Bob, you're the best at that of anybody.

276
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,420
Hmm?

277
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,380
Oh, all right.

278
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,400
Stand up again, please.

279
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,300
Yes, sir.

280
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,600
And sing in unison.

281
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,780
I'm stinking.

282
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,240
Oh.

283
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,920
Oh.

284
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,240


285
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh.

286
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,580
Oh.

287
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,100
Oh.

288
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,160


289
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,480


290
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh.

291
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,320
Oh.

292
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,240
Oh.

293
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh.

294
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:26,680


295
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:26,700
Oh.

296
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,720
Oh.

297
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:26,720


298
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,920
Oh.

299
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:27,920


300
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:27,920


301
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:27,960
Oh.

302
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


303
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


304
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


305
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


306
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


307
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


308
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


309
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


310
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


311
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


312
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:27,960


313
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:38,260
The president's a very driveled.

314
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,400
He is a very driveled man on the front.

315
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,160
It's not a very driveled man.

316
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,200
He's a man of irish background.

317
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,740
because it is partial, because it almost inevitably involves some kind of hatred.

318
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
You hate the people who don't share your fanaticism.

319
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,160
If you think you've got a mark on the book with a line of people because it says so somewhere,

320
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
I mean, that's not really fanaticism, it's just orthodox behavior.

321
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,140
That's what I told the judge that one time.

322
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,900
It still goes over time.

323
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,780
Northern States.

324
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't look up there.

325
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,320
Where the hell are you opening the book?

326
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,900
People have done that.

327
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,400
They have jumped, they have just marched dutifully.

328
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,760
Without giving it a second thought.

329
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,620
Just behaving like they're on parade.

330
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,920
March.

331
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,360
With their eyes open, oblivious to what their next step will bring.

332
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,460
Oh, none for any of us.

333
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,320
We'll be able to live in water, heat, cold, you name the worst, and never again a wrinkle.

334
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
Cryogenic suspension.

335
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,040
Why don't you shut up for a second?

336
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,420
I'm not worried.

337
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,680
No, you don't have to.

338
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,260
If you'd say a few words, it'd be better.

339
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,180
Harry, I can't believe it.

340
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
I just can't believe it.

341
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,560
Then if it gets taken over by a man, it's a good thing.

342
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,560


343
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,560


344
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,560


345
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,120
If it gets taken over by economic considerations, say, like the Crusades, then fanaticism disappears and perhaps does no harm.

346
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:43,760
I must go to extermination before I am exterminated by this gangster, computer god, concocted and controlled, worst mongrel, organized crime, murdering, cooperating gangster communist government.

347
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:51,480
I hand you the secret to save the entire human race and the entire universe.

348
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,280
One dollar.

349
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,020
One dollar is nice.

350
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,960
Or even a manual typewriter to me.

351
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,920
For your only hope for evil.

352
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,700
Maybe we could promote fanatical non-achievement.

353
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,280
Well, I don't know.

354
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't think of any good that the Crusades did.

355
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,300
The Crusades had, of course, two different streams in them.

356
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,060
A fanatical stream and an economic stream.

357
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,820
The economic thing was very strong indeed, but it wouldn't have worked without the fanaticism.

358
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm not saying it's bad, but the huge economic chain données were very important for the

359
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,020
anti-cognition and anti-corruption quandaries that were spread.

360
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,020


361
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,220
Where would they be?

362
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,620


363
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,400
West Virginia, in West Virginia.

364
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,440
Convinced?

365
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,700
Wow.

366
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,640
As far as we like to say, one of a kind.

367
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,160
The end of this part of the album.

368
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,640
I understand. It's just as well you didn't.

369
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,820
Hey, wait till she stops rolling, Doc.

370
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,800
You're very excited, ain't you?

371
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm afraid so. Even scientists get excited sometimes.

372
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,960
So, good day. Good day.

373
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,420
Hey.

374
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,140
Hey, where are you?

375
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,660
I'm over here.

376
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,140
No.

377
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,340
Okay.

378
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,380
Like, here we are.

379
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,200
Peter's Donuts.

380
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,900
Oh, take off.

381
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,560
We are.

382
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Okay.

383
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,980
Thanks for blowing it.

384
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,580
It's three in the morning.

385
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,140
Whose donuts?

386
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,480
Peter's Donuts.

387
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,280
Here?

388
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,180
She's at the till now. She'll see us in a minute.

389
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,640
I've got some crickets and worms.

390
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,940
We feed our little ones.

391
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:50,700


392
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,800
By the sound ofzwang, take me to mermaid city,

393
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
where the more we wanna fly we'll learn to срав Terra at dawn.

394
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,180
Ooh, Billy.

395
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,360
À tous les trois avant vos enfants,

396
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,260
nous sommes bourgeois.

397
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
Anticons Areum!

398
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,820
The new psychology was at that time sweeping through us all.

399
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
We were all influenced.

400
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,680
We were all concerned about fantasy or wishful thinking.

401
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,800
I formed the resolution of always judging and acting with the greatest good sense.

402
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,860
The fanaticism provided the troops and the economic motive the generals, roughly speaking.

403
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,760
What part would you say that witchcraft had played in fanaticism?

404
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,400
Oh, witchcraft played a terrible, terrible part.

405
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,700
Especially from about 1450 to about 1600.

406
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,280
A little longer than 1600.

407
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,380
A quite terrible part.

408
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,320
There was a work called The Hammer of Female Malefactors,

409
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,740
which was written by an eminent ecclesiastic and inspired,

410
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,500
just mad profusion of witch hunts,

411
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,900
which the people themselves believed.

412
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,340
I think it's very like...

413
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,560
It's very likely that Joan of Arc believed she was a witch.

414
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,820
Certainly a great many people condemned as witches did believe they were witches.

415
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,460
And there was an enormous spread of cruelty.

416
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,400
Now millions of men, women and children will be entering this world of the elder shape

417
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,480
and experiencing for themselves one of the great miracles of our time.

418
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
Your

419
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,840
reagent-like colour of the eye.

420
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,720
That, Meh.

421
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,240
Well, while you're here, Nicky, we'd like to have you do a little vocalizing with me, duet-wise.

422
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,220
You feel up to it?

423
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,800
I do.

424
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,980
Okay, let's be away.

425
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,900
Here we go.

426
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh, what a day.

427
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,640
Come marching in.

428
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,680
The outer shape we describe is the clothes we each wear.

429
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,680
Yes, you are.

430
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,840
Yes, I am.

431
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,820
Hey, don't you think you ought to wait for the rescue again?

432
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,000
I can't. I've got to see what's in there.

433
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,320
In backbaking, like, normally you eat a pound, right?

434
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,060
Okay.

435
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,700
So, in metric, the double is 2, and 30 is 32 kilos in backbaking.

436
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,020
Yeah.

437
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,500
Watch your head.

438
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,540
What if the speed limit is, like, 50 miles an hour?

439
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah.

440
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,980
Then what do you do, double it?

441
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,080
In a dollar is still closed.

442
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,300
Let's hope it'll open.

443
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,900
It will.

444
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,920
If we dare say most people believe...

445
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,380
It will.

446
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:00,800
It will.

447
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,900
It will.

448
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,500
It will.

449
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,040
It will.

450
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,180
It will.

451
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,240
It will.

452
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,500
It will.

453
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,700
It will.

454
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,140
It will.

455
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,140


456
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,600
It will.

457
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,280
We have to be ready.

458
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,220
We have to be ready.

459
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know.

460
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:18,240
I don't know.

461
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,400
I don't know.

462
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,240
I don't know.

463
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,400
I don't know.

464
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
I don't know.

465
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,320
I don't know.

466
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
I don't know.

467
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,780
I don't know.

468
00:21:50,840 --> 00:22:00,000
I don't know.

469
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,340
I don't know.

470
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,220
That was our ring, wasn't it?

471
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,700
I don't know. I never paid no attention.

472
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,380
But only with two bottles.

473
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,020
Okay, go.

474
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,140
This is the beginning of our theme.

475
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
You know, a lot of those pills,

476
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,940
they're a fake.

477
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,000
You know something?

478
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,580
They give me a pain in my aches.

479
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,600
An invention of Doug McKenzie.

480
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
He used,

481
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,320
gave her a little pinch of snooze

482
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,020
and she sneezed her fat away.

483
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,120
She died.

484
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,920
No, she only tried it

485
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,780
and she lost ten pounds every day.

486
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

487
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,940
For when she sneezed,

488
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,440
she shook like Yelly

489
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,820
that made the fat come off of her.

490
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,320
She used,

491
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,720
gave her a little pinch of snooze

492
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,140
and she,

493
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,600
and she sneezed her fat away.

494
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,020
Now, making some suggestions,

495
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,980
would her bed,

496
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,160
which is the best for me?

497
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
One night they were sitting on the sofa

498
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,900
with my Jenny.

499
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,300
That's the girl I go for.

500
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
Oh, she lay in my arms all ready to kiss

501
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,900
and they was all pocketed up for this.

502
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,020
But they didn't know when I was doing it.

503
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,420
She had snooze and she was chewing it.

504
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,820
I think that'd take you out.

505
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:16,960
Yeah.

506
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,620
No, that'd be taking you out.

507
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,220
Take him out.

508
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,840
Uh,

509
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,960
you could knock him off

510
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,740
or you could whack him.

511
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,900
Whack him.

512
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,000
This is the best song of all time.

513
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,520
This is,

514
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,240
this is,

515
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,480
this is

516
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,040
the girl of all time.

517
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,780
Hello, hello.

518
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,460
She wants to be bad.

519
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,240
If it's naughty to dance the men

520
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,200
Sleep each morning laughter dance

521
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
Then the end is the end

522
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,840
I wanna be bad

523
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,560
This is cute, and I must congratulate you,

524
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,300
uh, Artiste, on the cuteness of this.

525
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,240
Yep.

526
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,660
This august business meeting has been the cutest one

527
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,040
I've ever had the, uh, pleasure to...

528
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,680
It's the baby.

529
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,220
It really is.

530
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,820
It's the baby.

531
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,540
It's the baby.

532
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:05,900
Does it tarnish?

533
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,920
Does it, it doesn't tarnish our gravity though, does it?

534
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,700
It's the baby.

535
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,240
Yeah, it does.

536
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,120
When you bring a baby into a radio studio,

537
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,260
you just, you know, it can't help but cutify things.

538
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,140
It lightens things.

539
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,900
Uh, she was...

540
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,440
We were going to codify...

541
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,380
She's playing the keyboard in there.

542
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,160
...the doctrine, but instead we cutified the doctrine.

543
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,300
Did you see her playing the keyboard?

544
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,520
Well, we've cutified the church by a great margin.

545
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,500
I would say we've just about tripled the cutification of the church.

546
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,220
Well, that's saying something because we have never been able to cutify it very well.

547
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,560
Yeah.

548
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,880
It doesn't lend itself to cuti...

549
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,520
When somebody wants to insult us, they say that we've cutified it.

550
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, that's cute.

551
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,160
Oh.

552
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,400
Uh...

553
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:56,940
I have, uh, with me the entire of this book of the history of the Church of the Subgenius.

554
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,040
It's rather dry.

555
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah.

556
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,800
A lot of it's just counting which million was put into which bank and so forth.

557
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,100
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,400
But, but there's some...

559
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,040
The record of Vatican, you know, finances.

560
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,780
What about...

561
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,060
There's some interesting stuff about the Kennedy assassination and, uh...

562
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,920
Yeah, we've all heard that.

563
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,020
...the early involvement of...

564
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,780
Where did the money go out for...

565
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,020
What about the catalog?

566
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,540
Is that...

567
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,380
The tiger got him.

568
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,860
The tiger got him.

569
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm waiting for the catalog.

570
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,820
All the money for the investigation into the assassination of dogs.

571
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,960
What happened to the money?

572
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,020
It was his...

573
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
It was a tremendous amount.

574
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,000
It was, uh...

575
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,360
Thank you, thank you.

576
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,480
It was a tremendous amount of time was spent on, uh, prosecuting, uh, Doug Wellman.

577
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,200
Dr. Drummond, was that you making that horrible noise?

578
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:36,680
And, uh, they were able to...

579
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:36,720
Anything else?

580
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,100
That was me and Walter making that horrible noise.

581
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Well, uh, and they never were able to get Wellman for anything.

582
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:44,640
Walter and me.

583
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,380
Maybe I should say Walter and me.

584
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,000
Wellman was slippery.

585
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,840
I and Walter.

586
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


587
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


588
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


589
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


590
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


591
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


592
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,840


593
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,080
Even, uh, David Byrne was not able to get Wellman, and he tried.

594
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,400
I'm gonna try to ask for more.

595
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,240
This is, uh...

596
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,920
A little late.

597
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,440
Maybe even...

598
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,160
Beth, I wanna be back.

599
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,540
I'm just...

600
00:26:59,540 --> 00:26:59,760
Finally.

601
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,500
David Byrne had another song called Buck Naked.

602
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,640
It has become...

603
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,820
You know, he, uh, one of them died.

604
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:04,960
Another song called Buck Naked.

605
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,100
A reality.

606
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,180
I'm serious.

607
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm wondering...

608
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,260
Well, there was...

609
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,600
There have been so many musicians, singers named Buck Naked.

610
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,460
Including former subgenius Buck Naked.

611
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,060
Who made...

612
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,840
Who told me that if I ever mention him, I have to...

613
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:18,840


614
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:18,840


615
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:18,840


616
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:18,840


617
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:18,840


618
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:18,840


619
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,440
I had to say that he was former subgenius Buck Naked.

620
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,780
He did not want to be associated...

621
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:23,800
Yeah.

622
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,340
Please.

623
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,920
So I don't want to associate Reverend Buck...

624
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,680
Is he an apostate?

625
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,920
He's an apostate?

626
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh, yeah.

627
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,580
Major.

628
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,880
Really?

629
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, yeah.

630
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:29,960
Why?

631
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,100
Well...

632
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,660
I used to...

633
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,360
He was a good...

634
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,920
I met him.

635
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,560
He was okay.

636
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,820
He was regular Michael Pepe.

637
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,280
But...

638
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,480
He was...

639
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,700
Oh, wow.

640
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,880
But, uh, what, uh...

641
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,560
He joined...

642
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,260
He, uh, joined the last...

643
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:48,820
As I understand it, former subgenius Reverend Buck Naked joined a rival concert.

644
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:48,820


645
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:48,820


646
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,080
Oh, wow.

647
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,080


648
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,520
I think possibly even a Jesus-oriented one.

649
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,580
A genuine one?

650
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,680
Have you ever heard of the I Am people?

651
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,420
Oh, no.

652
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,180
Well, apparently he is.

653
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,220
Oh, my God.

654
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,920
I Am.

655
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,880
The I Am?

656
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,860
Holy...

657
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,840
I Am had some great graphics.

658
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,460
Would that be...

659
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,180
That's...

660
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,220
I've ripped off...

661
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,540
I've got...

662
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:07,900
Five syllables to the line.

663
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,640
I've got...

664
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,300
I've got...

665
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


666
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


667
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


668
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


669
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


670
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,300


671
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,320
I've got...

672
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,400
I've got...

673
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,400


674
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,960
I've got...

675
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,260
I've got...

676
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:18,900
I've got...

677
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:18,900


678
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:18,900


679
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,880
No, they still are.

680
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,760
To dovetain.

681
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,100
No.

682
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,300
You're thinking of the they were cult.

683
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,080
They did.

684
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,220
Yeah.

685
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,300
That was the, uh...

686
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,880
Yeah.

687
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,580
And then there was the Be Here cult, which I was in Be Here Now and Ram Das.

688
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,320
Were you in one of those Be Here Now cults?

689
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,460
Yeah.

690
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,660
I just liked his, uh, you know, show.

691
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,800
His, uh...

692
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,960
Penises.

693
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah.

694
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,040
Buck played a devil.

695
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,440
Oh, my God.

696
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,300
He was one of the foreground devils.

697
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,680
He made a great devil.

698
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,420
Speak of background devils.

699
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,160
That's former subgenius.

700
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
Former devil subgenius.

701
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,720
Now devil Celtists with the I Am.

702
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,940
There's a lot of former subgeniuses, actually.

703
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,580
It's quite a long list of people who decided they'd had it.

704
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,420
The top one, Appa State Schism, would be Bob Black, right?

705
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,680
I mean, he was...

706
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,120
Well, no, not really.

707
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,820
He was a scary guy.

708
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,200
I mean, I don't want to say Bob Black on the radio.

709
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,560
He wasn't.

710
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,180
His reputation precedes it.

711
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,700
He never scared me, let me put it that way.

712
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,460
Well, I know people that just...

713
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,100
Because he really did try as much as he could to arouse people's antagonism and opposition.

714
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,460
And, you know, wrote those nasty letters.

715
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:41,140
Well, I'm not trying to air a smeared underwear of the church on the air.

716
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,260
No, see, I've been trying.

717
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,680
In my revised...

718
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
85, essentially.

719
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,440
In the Stank Centric...

720
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,740
Revised history of the church, which I'm teaching to these innocents.

721
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,360
Hello, by the way.

722
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:52,720
Yeah.

723
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,240
Rosna and Chainsburger.

724
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:55,900
Hello.

725
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,100
Gary Gabo fan who's driving away.

726
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,780
Yeah.

727
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,640
Anyway, I've decided to just skip over the unpleasant aspect.

728
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah, I see.

729
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,740
I've un-personed quite a few.

730
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,700
Well, I...

731
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,280
That's...

732
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,980
We use the tried and true un-personing where you just don't mention them at all.

733
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,400
And they hate that.

734
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,540
Yeah.

735
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:16,540


736
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,240
You know, that's...

737
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,300
I know.

738
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
They hate that worse than anything.

739
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,460
It's the worst thing.

740
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,680
I know, in fact, that Bob Black hates...

741
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,120
Is more offended and enraged by being ignored than anything else.

742
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah.

743
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,160
And that kills him.

744
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,700
That's really the best way to treat people like, you know, the kooks.

745
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,280
I know.

746
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,220
He's a kook, even compared to us.

747
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,780
That's the funny thing.

748
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,720
I mean, even...

749
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,500
I mean, you know what I mean?

750
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
I mean, how can you be a kook compared to Stank?

751
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,540
To Church and Subgenius.

752
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,800
Yeah, but no.

753
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:44,900
They...

754
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,520
No, we feel for...

755
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,820
We feel for the differently-signed.

756
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,020
We're, you know...

757
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,580
Yeah, but they're not reality.

758
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,480
We're all kooks on some level.

759
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,800
No, you have to be a...

760
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,340
It's just that we're also subjectivists.

761
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,400
So anybody that we really dislike, we can say, well, he's a kook and write it off like that.

762
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
That's how words work.

763
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,320
Yeah.

764
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,080
They're just not.

765
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,800
That's what language is all about, is to label things.

766
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,160
Right.

767
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,900
Put them away.

768
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,140
And say prejudgments that are unfair.

769
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,360
They're prejudgments that keep order, which means you have to...

770
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,440
That's why there's this difference between...

771
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,380
Between subgeniuses and kooks.

772
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,820
Yeah.

773
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:26,460
It's just a way using linguistics to simplify things that are actually very complicated.

774
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,140
Yeah.

775
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,900
And it appeals to the stupid, the superstitious.

776
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,400
Yeah.

777
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:38,560
And to people who enjoy studying the effects of stupidity and superstition.

778
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,660
Yeah.

779
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,140
Stupidity, I'm afraid, you know, doesn't really exist.

780
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,460
I think stupidity actually is just fear where...

781
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,420
I mean, that is to say...

782
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,980
Stupidity is everywhere at all times, but...

783
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I can see why you would say that.

784
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,880
Yeah.

785
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,680
But is Bush really stupid?

786
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,840
Almost everything is stupid.

787
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,000
I mean, but...

788
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,980
Compared to what?

789
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,600
I mean, it's just like saying, you know, almost everything is insane.

790
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,560
Things are insane.

791
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,180
But they're so insane, the word insane doesn't apply.

792
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,280
Or it does, but...

793
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,400
Right.

794
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,880
So when we say subgenius kook, what we're basically talking about is a normal.

795
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,800
Is...

796
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,140
A normal person.

797
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,900
Okay.

798
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,780
Who...

799
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,280
A pink.

800
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,540
A pink who pretended to be a subgenius.

801
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,200
Yeah.

802
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,580
A pink who was aping its betters.

803
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah.

804
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,700
There you go.

805
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,320
That's the worst.

806
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,520
That's what we call a subgenius kook.

807
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:31,960
Yeah.

808
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,340
A gimme bob.

809
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,840
A gimme bob, yeah.

810
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,280
Or an imabob, actually.

811
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
The worst are the imabobs.

812
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,800
Imabob.

813
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,260
Oh, yeah.

814
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,880
Those are people who think they're bob.

815
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,320
You know, I knew bob dogs.

816
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,200
And...

817
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Sir, you are...

818
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,640
You are no bob dog.

819
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,460
You know, I haven't...

820
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:47,800
I haven't...

821
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,780
I'm a bob.

822
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,060
I actually had a case to say that in all sincerity.

823
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm a sane.

824
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,720


825
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm a sane.

826
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm a sane.

827
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:53,640


828
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,780
To one of the imabobs.

829
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,460
Yeah.

830
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,940
If you can see what I'm...

831
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,180
Can you hear where I'm coming from?

832
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,680
Then there's...

833
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,460
You know, then there's the he's-a-bobs.

834
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,780
Do you see what I'm saying?

835
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,700
Can you see the words I'm saying?

836
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,280
Well, they's-a-bobs.

837
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,260
The words...

838
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,100
I'm a bobby.

839
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,580
You see them?

840
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,840
He's-a-bob, it means the same thing as I'm a bobby.

841
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,680
Or the may-bobbs.

842
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:11,980
Yeah.

843
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,020
Nay-bobs.

844
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,780
Now, that was...

845
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,620
That's a little different.

846
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,960
Nylon shell, fully waterproof.

847
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,380
I kind of like the nay-bobs.

848
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,500
Sealed seats.

849
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,140
Yeah.

850
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,320
They're a refreshing change from all the yay-bobs.

851
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:22,820
Yeah.

852
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,780
The may-bobs?

853
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,440
Okay.

854
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,060
They're the opposite of yay-bobs and yay-hoos, which are sort of like yay-hoos.

855
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,260
On things.

856
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,020
You don't know who the yay-hoos are, but you do know who the yay-bobs are.

857
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,620
Straddle the line, you know?

858
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,840
Rather than...

859
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,120
Well, you have to compromise.

860
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,460
Life is a series of compromises and terrible pain.

861
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,840
Just try to compromise.

862
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,480
Life is a series of balancing between the interstitial vortices.

863
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,380
Exactly.

864
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,280
Dr. Drummond, you love that interstitial vortices thing.

865
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
It explains so much.

866
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,640
It's right.

867
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,460
It explains everything.

868
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,820
It's like the unified field theory plus string theory all rolled into one.

869
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,260
Plus the golden mean.

870
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,540
Plus the golden mean.

871
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,080
And not only that, it combines earth, fire, and water and air into a unified...

872
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,660
Wow.

873
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,040
Chemical.

874
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,520
Three times 666 equals 1998.

875
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,760
What's the vortices?

876
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,080
It's right in front of us all the time.

877
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,140
The interior is nylon lined for easy on and off.

878
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,040
The strings are aligned with nylon for...

879
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,840
So what, it takes your soul off?

880
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,940
Your skin...

881
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,300
Finally.

882
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:30,880
The vortices.

883
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,780
What do you mean the vortices?

884
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,920
First, you take the skin off of the feet.

885
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,580
String theory.

886
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,000
Okay.

887
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,520
What is string theory?

888
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,040
Now, the power here...

889
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,220
String theory is what superstitious scientists came up with.

890
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,240
Yeah.

891
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,380
They're trying to invent...

892
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,660
Because...

893
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,900
Because they couldn't understand the interstitial vortices.

894
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,400
Exactly.

895
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,520
That's right.

896
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:46,900
Exactly.

897
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,940
This is what Philo's talking about.

898
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,180
Exactly.

899
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,940
They knew that...

900
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,900
Stephen Hawking could not quite grasp the interstitial vortices.

901
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,940
Because he wasn't a subgenius.

902
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,220
So they had to come up with all these other silly...

903
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,680
I might add that if anyone...

904
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,720
Any of your subgeniuses out there are interested in an in-depth analysis of this concept,

905
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,680
scientists, and it's just another...

906
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,900
It's simply is look at the new edition.

907
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,560
It's...

908
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,340
The new printing of...

909
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,560
The interstitial vortices.

910
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, yes.

911
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,900
The new printing...

912
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,740
We forgot.

913
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,120


914
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,700
We forgot the swag, such as the newly reprinted...

915
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,040
Yes.

916
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,380
Long out of print.

917
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,060
Revelation X is back in stores.

918
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,540
The Bob Apocryphon.

919
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,040
Oh.

920
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,600
There you go.

921
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,560
The Bob Apocryphon is back in stores these days.

922
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,260
Wow.

923
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,240
Not that you should buy it.

924
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,260
No, you should buy it.

925
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,800
We can't...

926
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,060
You should buy it and give it to...

927
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,600
Give it to me.

928
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't even have one.

929
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,520
I don't even get one.

930
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,580
This is a buy as a whole.

931
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,100
This is a revival...

932
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,700
A revised edition, by the way.

933
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,540
The first...

934
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,640
We have to go through...

935
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:45,980
I don't...

936
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,340
I've never even gotten a...

937
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,160
Which edition is it?

938
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,220
The new...

939
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,820
The new...

940
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,300
Bob Apocryphon.

941
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,260
Revelation X has unpersoned a couple of people.

942
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,180
Unpersoned?

943
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,060
War in heaven became war is heaven.

944
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,380
Unpersoned in a way?

945
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,100
Yeah.

946
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,500
And you know, the good thing about it,

947
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,100
don't we go into detail on the interstitial vortices in that book?

948
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,620
Really?

949
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,200
The Dallas P.O. Box is now the Cleveland...

950
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,780
Well, what is it?

951
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,940
Okay, tell me about...

952
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,300
Because...

953
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,080
Well...

954
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,040
Vortices now, as far as...

955
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,620
So the ten strings that are...

956
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,380
There's a balance between pain and pleasure.

957
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,540
Are rotating...

958
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,060
That's right.

959
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,680
The dynamo of pain and pleasure.

960
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,200
Whirlpool.

961
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,140
Pain and pleasure.

962
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,680
You have to listen to Philo, Michael.

963
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,460
Okay, go ahead.

964
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,180
And they will...

965
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,500
It's the dynamo...

966
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,140
It's the eddies that are created between the dynamos of pain and pleasure,

967
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,040
balancing each other out.

968
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,020
They create this vortex.

969
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,740
And the vortices are...

970
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,340
Wow.

971
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,080
They are contiguous with each other.

972
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,260
They are contiguous with each other simultaneously.

973
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,640
And yet, each one is its own separate unit,

974
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,760
and separated by their own interstitial area,

975
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,060
which we call the interstitial vortices.

976
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,700
Dr. Drummond just explained the makeup of the universe and the meaning of life,

977
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,340
and you weren't even paying attention.

978
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,340
No, he wasn't.

979
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,900
Who are you folks?

980
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,580
I was.

981
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,520
He's so broke.

982
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,020
He can't even pay attention.

983
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,300
I can't believe this, that I found out about six meanings of life,

984
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:10,980
just tonight.

985
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,360
Just tonight only.

986
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,320
And the love...

987
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,160
Okay, so this is the interstitial...

988
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,880
And your assignment, you have to learn, you have to pick which one is valid.

989
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,120
Michael told me he was...

990
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,320
I would say so far, the interstitial vortices has it over everything I've heard so far.

991
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,880
If you read the back end of Revelation X,

992
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,920
there is a very detailed description of the theory of the interstitial vortices,

993
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,180
including illustrations.

994
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,560
Where can I get a copy of that?

995
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,000
You can get...

996
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,360
Revelation X from any better bookstore, as well as things like Walmart.com,

997
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,840
the evil, well, I should say, the evil Walmart.com,

998
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,000
the terrible Amazon.com.

999
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,620
We only...

1000
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:58,700
And also available is the new Hal Robbins dinosaur book.

1001
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,480
All right, Hal Robbins, who is...

1002
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,420
Who has just walked in.

1003
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,980
Rumored to have just walked in.

1004
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,620
Yes, it's true.

1005
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,360
It's true.

1006
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,820
Dr. Howe is here in the flesh for the first time.

1007
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,960
In the flesh.

1008
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,600
Someone who knows how to use his shift lead on their commander.

1009
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,120
Yeah.

1010
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,680
Carcass removed of all organs.

1011
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,580
A man with a vocabulary five times larger than the entire English language.

1012
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,020
Yeah.

1013
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
Those are my organs.

1014
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,300
Keep away from that.

1015
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,180
Those are my extras.

1016
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,340
In case I...

1017
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,840
Now, you know, in China, you can sell those.

1018
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,040
Dr. Howe is now being interviewed by Princess Marie.

1019
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,180
You can lose a tongue talking too much on the radio.

1020
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,960
That's the best part.

1021
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,080
It shuts the carcass.

1022
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,080


1023
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,440
You can't...

1024
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,660
$10,000 a kidney.

1025
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:42,960
I know.

1026
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,600
The way she's taking off his clothes, though, it looks a little bit perky.

1027
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,660
Look, here's somebody left this food thing here.

1028
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,020
It's still got something in it.

1029
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,080
It's called bourbon treat.

1030
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,400
Hey, stay away from that.

1031
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,040
Chocolate cream biscuits.

1032
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,380
Look.

1033
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,740
Wait, that's...

1034
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,220
That's laced with 325 milligrams of LSD-25.

1035
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,080
Okay.

1036
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,300
Bourbon treat.

1037
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,400
He's just going to just eat it.

1038
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,940
Bourbon treat.

1039
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,420
Bourbon treat.

1040
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:19,980
Now, back in the old days when the subgeniuses didn't have brains per se,

1041
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,740
they just had this sort of a nerve center at the end of their hind...

1042
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,800
at their hind end.

1043
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,480
This nerve center served as a thinking mechanism

1044
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,300
which caused them to be able to discern between pleasure and pain.

1045
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,540
Gravitating towards the one

1046
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,500
and moving...

1047
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,440
moving away from the other, they found their little cubby holes.

1048
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,960
Uh-oh.

1049
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,660
A special bulletin has just been handed to me.

1050
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,100
Oh, my God.

1051
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,640
Stand by as we switch you over to our main studio.

1052
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,600
A report from the DuPont Company of Wilmington, Delaware has just been received.

1053
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,060
Hurry.

1054
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,340
The news is that fabrics containing Dacron polyester made by DuPont

1055
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,980
are now being prepared for the special scientific heat treatment.

1056
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,080
This means all garments made from this material...

1057
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,860
this specifically treated fabric...

1058
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,120
can later be durably pressed for the perfect counter shape.

1059
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:22,360
And that fabric has been used to create this new Hal Robbins book,

1060
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,420
which, since I'm not a member of this station, I can promote, I guess.

1061
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,300
Dinosaur Alphabet by Harry S...

1062
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,320
Can you believe that?

1063
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,140
Harry S. Robbins.

1064
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,720
Yes.

1065
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,080
I knew that was his name.

1066
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,620
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1067
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,040
Dr. Hal...

1068
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,680
uh...

1069
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,020
his new book, uh...

1070
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,020
which is absolutely one of the most gorgeous dinosaur art books.

1071
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,180
Well, it is the most gorgeous dinosaur art book ever seen.

1072
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,540
Yeah, yeah.

1073
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:52,780
But is it...

1074
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,920
Dinosaur Alphabet.

1075
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,920
Is it real or is it fantasy?

1076
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,100
No, it's...

1077
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,400
it's...

1078
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,860
well, it is sort of fantasy.

1079
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,580
These dinosaurs are better than anatomically correct.

1080
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,140
That's one way of looking at it.

1081
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,900
They're colored in a way that has to be fancy.

1082
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,200
You know, no one's ever proven...

1083
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,600
Are their sexual organs enhanced?

1084
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,680
No one really knows what color they are.

1085
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,920
No one's ever proven...

1086
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,020
No one's ever proven...

1087
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,160
that dinosaurs existed in any form other than bones.

1088
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,200
That's all we have.

1089
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:15,600
That's right.

1090
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,880
What's less the large...

1091
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,840
What makes anyone think...

1092
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,200
Not only that, but there is...

1093
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,420
genitalia...

1094
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,520
There are poetic paragraphs that go with each of these full-page color...

1095
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,360
draw...

1096
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,520
uh...

1097
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,280
they're almost like paintings, really.

1098
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,400
Man's best friend.

1099
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,740
Yangchuanasaurus hid away from the prey on which he dined,

1100
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,000
panting in the heat of midday,

1101
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,860
crouching in his hunter's blind.

1102
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,280
An ambush predator.

1103
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,220
Yangchuanasaurus, though...

1104
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,360
just doesn't sound very interesting to me.

1105
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,600
...arosaurus-sized.

1106
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,500
And, uh, there's a...

1107
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,180
At the end of it, there's a kind of a bibliography...

1108
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,260
that describes the details about each of these fabulous creatures.

1109
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,600
Who wants to know details?

1110
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,240
But they're not fabulous.

1111
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,500
They're real animals that really existed.

1112
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,840
I want the gross, scanned overview.

1113
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,260
I don't want details.

1114
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,700
Like Gigantosnotosaurus.

1115
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,480
Ha!

1116
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:08,840
Gigantosnotosaurus.

1117
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:08,840


1118
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:08,840


1119
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,540
Which, uh, lived in, uh, Argentina.

1120
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,400
Had to flee to Argentina.

1121
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,340
Because it was bigger than three Tyrannosaurus rexes standing on top...

1122
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,600
on each other's piggy back.

1123
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
By the way, we have to do an ID here.

1124
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,000
Uh, this is...

1125
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,700
Over the Edge and the Puzzling Evidence Show combined and homogenized for your convenience.

1126
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,660
Now, now.

1127
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,080
Girl, what idea, baby, is that?

1128
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,220
Oh, I know.

1129
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,800
You should know.

1130
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,540
Face it.

1131
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:34,920
What's there?

1132
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,520
You'll hear me, baby.

1133
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,860
You'll hear me.

1134
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,300
This has been such a wonderful excesslessness mess.

1135
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,480
It's not over yet.

1136
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
We're going till 5 a.m. this morning.

1137
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,380
That means we'll get more presents.

1138
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,700
There are probably 20 to 30 people in the studio, each one of them with an instrument.

1139
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,280
It's the proof of karma, friends.

1140
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,840
I brought Phineas Narco a copy of the Bobliographon.

1141
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,200
He's got some pieces in it.

1142
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,820
And in the karma, I had instant karma happen when Dr. Howell brought me a copy of the Bobliographon.

1143
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:15,280
I'm sure he's got a copy of his new book, The Dinosaur Alphabet, by Harry S. Robbins.

1144
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,940
And by the way, Robbins is spelled with one B. I bet you radio-listening illiterates didn't

1145
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,440
know that.

1146
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,600
Some of them may have known it.

1147
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,340
And some may have known about it and repressed the memory.

1148
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,060
Well, I'm not a radio illiterate, and I didn't know that.

1149
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,320
But you do now.

1150
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,100
What does it matter when one knew something?

1151
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,760
So long as one knows it.

1152
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,820
What's important is that when you type in Bobliographon, you know it's a thing.

1153
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:38,820


1154
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:38,820


1155
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:38,820


1156
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:38,820


1157
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:38,820


1158
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,120
If you type in Bobliographon, you know it's a thing.

1159
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,120


1160
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,120


1161
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,120


1162
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,120


1163
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,120


1164
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,120


1165
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,040
But if you want to go into that search engine in the bookstore-

1166
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,460
See?

1167
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:42,900
I got you.

1168
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,060
I got you.

1169
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,900
You use the name Robbins with the one B.

1170
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,080
Like the bird.

1171
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,900
Like the bird.

1172
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,480
Look, you can either feed a man and he's full for one day or I can teach you-

1173
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,580
There is no-

1174
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,020
I can give you this fishing pole and teach you to fish and you can go feed yourself

1175
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,460
forever.

1176
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,900
No, put down that fishing pole.

1177
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,580
In the old-

1178
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,500
You're not supposed to hit Howell with a fishing pole.

1179
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,100
Stop it.

1180
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:17,640
Is it true, Reverend Stang, that the new edition of Revelation X is digest-sized?

1181
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,240
No, no, it is not.

1182
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,440
No, no, it's full-sized.

1183
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:28,960
In fact, aficionados of the Church of the Subgenius will want to lay out their old copy right next to their new copy

1184
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,200
because they'll want to have a new copy to keep their old copy in shape for its future value.

1185
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:42,260
As well as being able to have a new coffee table edition to show to their friends on their evenings of entertainment and frivolity.

1186
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,080
The third Subgenius holy book, which I always forget the title.

1187
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,180
If you buy a Revelation X, you get the coffee table?

1188
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,300
The Cyclopedia of Slack with Bob Leografon is small.

1189
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,240
It's not digest-sized, it's family Bible-sized.

1190
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,640
It's nice and small.

1191
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,820
It's like a family Bible.

1192
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,000
The earlier version.

1193
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,140
The older books are more like coffee tables.

1194
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,280
Well, it hasn't, but it hasn't got smaller, a la the Penguin.

1195
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,120
It's small and compact.

1196
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:10,920
It's tough.

1197
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,340
In any case, you'll want to lay your old one next to your new one and look at them page by page

1198
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,480
and try to study them to figure out what's different, what's changed, and where is Waldo?

1199
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:30,680
That's the big selling point of the new edition of Revelation X is that 23 of the pages are very subtly different.

1200
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,540
Oh, good Lord.

1201
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,740
And if you can find all those differences...

1202
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,300
Then you win, of course, the trip to Dobbspan.

1203
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,560
As seen on television.

1204
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,180
Tremendous honor, of course.

1205
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,360
Well, YouTube, anyway.

1206
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,400
It's not for the honor.

1207
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:55,300
An unspoken assumption of the expanding Earth theory is that dinosaurs were actually like the size of chickens back then.

1208
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,440
Well, yeah, but the Earth was only the size of Mercury back then.

1209
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,020
Right.

1210
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,400
So it's an expanding universe.

1211
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,520
Exactly.

1212
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:02,860
Exactly.

1213
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,020
So dinosaurs were really...

1214
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,080
Dinky little things.

1215
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,540
But since then, the elastic has weakened.

1216
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,560
Well, it would have been like the blue whales of their day.

1217
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,220
There were many whales, whines, and complaints.

1218
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,240
But nothing was done.

1219
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,580
And the Earth was without form.

1220
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,480
It makes sense because those dragonfly fossils and stuff, they're impossibly big.

1221
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,260
They had a meter-wide wingspan in the fossils.

1222
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,380


1223
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,380
Right.

1224
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:32,380


1225
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:32,400
Right.

1226
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,020
Right.

1227
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,540
Right.

1228
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1229
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,760
Right.

1230
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:33,840
Right.

1231
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,040


1232
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,080
Right.

1233
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,080


1234
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,080


1235
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,160
Right.

1236
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,160


1237
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,180
Right.

1238
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1239
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1240
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1241
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1242
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1243
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1244
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1245
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1246
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1247
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1248
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1249
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1250
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1251
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,180


1252
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,040
Adontal standard size as we see them now.

1253
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,480
They found fossilized frog sticks that were 15 feet long.

1254
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,740
They did.

1255
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,520
Well, I guess they were prospecting in the proper garden.

1256
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,660
There were giants in the Earth in those days.

1257
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:57,880
Everything was turned into giants over the millions of years as fossils.

1258
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,000
I have a theory.

1259
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,180
Dinosaurs were able to get so large because gravity was added.

1260
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,620
actually less in those days.

1261
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,500
But what about comedy?

1262
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,640
Now people ask me, well, how could that be possible? And I ask you, why not?

1263
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,400
We don't know anything about gravity. We don't even know what planet this is. We don't even know what it is,

1264
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,920
what makes it, how it gets here. I say that in the early days,

1265
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,660
it was probably because the Earth was spinning slower or faster,

1266
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,080
but the gravity was less. Well, if the Earth was smaller, of course the gravity would be less.

1267
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,200
No, it wasn't that much smaller. That wouldn't make that much difference, but gravity would.

1268
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,940
A fraction of its size would make a heck of a difference.

1269
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:47,420
Nothing can grow that big today because they'd have an immediate heart attack as they were crushed by their own organs.

1270
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,840
It's too big. It's too heavy.

1271
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,940
Well, it didn't happen at once.

1272
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,860
There were no dinosaurs when the Earth was the size of the moon.

1273
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,040
Well, that's a whole point. Of course there were, because they popped into the Earth.

1274
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,740
Fun, fun.

1275
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:03,980
Fun.

1276
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,640
Oh, suicide man, you're crazy.

1277
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,360
Well, let me accuse you once again.

1278
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,460
That's a crazy idea.

1279
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,000
Well, it is crazy.

1280
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,040
But it is true that things were different on this planet at different times in its history.

1281
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,720
What is crazy anyway?

1282
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,760
You wouldn't recognize it, I think.

1283
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,240
Back in the days of giant insects, the atmosphere used to be quite different.

1284
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,360
It's just being not reality oriented.

1285
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,080
You didn't have insanity, or did you? Was it all insanity?

1286
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,380
Gravity was less, mark my words.

1287
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,740
There was really a sanity that didn't exist since the human race didn't exist.

1288
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,180
Can an animal be insane?

1289
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,680
More energy to exploit.

1290
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,780
More food to eat.

1291
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,880
More fecundity of the Earth.

1292
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,560
That wouldn't account for the...

1293
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,680
Vital ability to grow.

1294
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,000
None of that would account for the gigantic size of these things.

1295
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,980
Given the ability to attain gigantic size, they attained it.

1296
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,040
Only because the gravity allowed them to.

1297
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,080
It would not connect.

1298
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,760
And they had to.

1299
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,400
Of course.

1300
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,020
Now the...

1301
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,120
Really the size of reptiles of today, back then...

1302
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,660
The whale.

1303
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,960
The greatest...

1304
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,500
Giant reptiles have persisted through into many ages, including the age of man.

1305
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,700
That's a crazy idea.

1306
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:29,700


1307
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,580
Yes.

1308
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,800
The megalania of the Australian continent is one example.

1309
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,600
An enormous...

1310
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,760
This is Walter Braun broadcasting from the factory of Tiny Togs Company.

1311
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,300
Really?

1312
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:43,520
What?

1313
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,720
It's alive today?

1314
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,000
No, it's not alive today, but it's...

1315
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,420
You can look at fossils of raindrops and there are a lot...

1316
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,900
Relative of the well-known Kamado dragon.

1317
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,260
That's right.

1318
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,040
What accounts for that?

1319
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,600
Much larger.

1320
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,040
Less gravity.

1321
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,760
What's the big shark's name?

1322
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,680
Kamado.

1323
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,820
That was the Carcharodon megalodon.

1324
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,920
If I was running for office today, I would advocate gravity reduction.

1325
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,580
Everything would be bigger.

1326
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,920
Everything would be lighter.

1327
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,920
You could lift more.

1328
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,920
You could jump higher.

1329
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,920
It would be great.

1330
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,080
It was like that on our original planet, what's now called Mars.

1331
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,300
It would take care of the obesity problem.

1332
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,480
Yes, Stan.

1333
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:19,900
Why?

1334
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:20,900
It would increase gravity.

1335
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,400
And there would have to be a compromise, which would end up just about where it is now.

1336
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,200
This whole argument is so moot because the planets were switched.

1337
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:28,200


1338
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,060
Suicide man.

1339
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,780
That's a crazy idea.

1340
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,360
And that's a crazy idea.

1341
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,840
The planets were switched in 1945.

1342
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,820
It's in the book.

1343
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,620
What is this?

1344
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,960
It's in the book.

1345
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,540
It's in the new subgenius book.

1346
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
Check it out.

1347
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,640
This is official subgenius doctrine.

1348
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,280
Dr. Howell, what do you think of expanding Earth?

1349
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,220
There's no point in struggling.

1350
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,340
The truth of the expansion of Earth is...

1351
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:55,840
Now, this does not, however, claim that subgeni expands in a certain sense.

1352
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,040
If a dinosaur wanted to get a donut...

1353
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,300
Yes.

1354
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,160
...the Earth is constantly being pelted by extraplanetary material.

1355
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,200
I'm not talking about meteorites.

1356
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,640
...and is increasing in size through that method of accretion.

1357
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,700
...that all matter is taking up more volume as time passes...

1358
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,500
...in a dramatically increased way.

1359
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:23,360
God pelts the Earth with excrement like a chimpanzee thrown at his enemy.

1360
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,240
We're not talking about cosmic spring here.

1361
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,920
We're not talking about cosmic spring here.

1362
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:28,280
We're not talking about cosmic spring here.

1363
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,480
We're talking about fecal peltings.

1364
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,760
In other words, if you were to take out one linear-sized piece of platinum...

1365
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,960
...and put it in a vault, in 100 million years, it should be like four or five meters huge.

1366
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,740
Here's another thing.

1367
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:51,620
Forbidden sciences teach us that gravity is not something that sucks you towards the nearest, the biggest mass...

1368
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:57,400
...but pressure from outer space pushing down on you against the Earth.

1369
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,860
That's why things fall.

1370
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,240
It's because outer space is pressing down on us.

1371
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,220
The pressure from space...

1372
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,060
Our science, Earth science, is so primitive.

1373
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,760
It's really in its infancy.

1374
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:15,320
It's based on language, which you feel good science would be based on things in themselves...

1375
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,760
...if they could be proved to exist.

1376
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,220
Right. We're babies compared to the people from the future.

1377
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,200
My former employers, I might add.

1378
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,260
My former employers, I might add.

1379
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,660
And the excess.

1380
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,320
What can we do about the people from the future?

1381
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,480
Primal energies of the animal, man.

1382
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,460
We can't do anything about the people from the future except not give birth to them.

1383
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,020
Yeah.

1384
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,660
It's too late for me.

1385
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,640
And even that's hard to do.

1386
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,620
I already gave birth to two of the people from the future.

1387
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,060
What did they look like?

1388
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,160
Were they older than they were at the time you saw them a moment ago?

1389
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,780
They were. Yeah.

1390
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,100
I'm talking about the UFOs or the...

1391
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,820
Oh, yeah.

1392
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,820
Well, they made it with the subgeniuses, right?

1393
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,800
Is that how the Yeti became more than man?

1394
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:15,160
No, it's really that the excess just flat out instant created the Yetis as a perfect creature.

1395
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,460
They were able to give life to...

1396
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,940
They were able to create new life forms.

1397
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,920
The Yeti was the smartest animal on the Earth.

1398
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,780
The Yetis then created the humans.

1399
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:30,890
The humans, much the same way by quick mutating a certain type of rat.

1400
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,870
Monkey seed.

1401
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,870
Monkey's mistake.

1402
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,030
So really, humans were the lab rats of the Yetis.

1403
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:36,850
Yeah.

1404
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:45,390
But a stunted, retarded Yeti made the mistake of freeing the humans and teaching them fire and language.

1405
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,110
And that's when the conspiracy was born.

1406
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,710
It's just that...

1407
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,090
Wow, nuts.

1408
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,290
There was a traitor Yeti.

1409
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,010
If you try to look for the...

1410
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,690
That's horrible.

1411
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,870
You know, they should have just let them fall back into the slime.

1412
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,750
...know when you're going to be looking for them.

1413
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,490
Why teach them?

1414
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,610
Why educate them?

1415
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,470
I mean, if they're only going to raise themselves up and out of the slime.

1416
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,370
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1417
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:18,170
Well, actually, the Yetis did go out and exterminate most of the humans, but some of them...

1418
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:18,530
They survived.

1419
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:23,270
...were projected by time control into about a million years ago.

1420
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,270


1421
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:33,090
Yeah, 100,000 years ago, where Cro-Magnon Man suddenly appeared and wiped out all the other wonderful, pleasant humanoids.

1422
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,670
Yeah, good-looking Neanderthals.

1423
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:39,550
Yeah, Neanderthals, the Homo erectus and the Homo connectus.

1424
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:45,890
You have the return of that in Jay Leno, you know, that's got the prognathus.

1425
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,490
I know, he's got the big jaw of the Neanderthals.

1426
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,650
And Anthony Robbins.

1427
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,430
He appeals, of course, to the...

1428
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:56,150
Yes, they're both that uber-human...

1429
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,890
What do they call that?

1430
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,150
Well, Jay Leno has that superhuman jaw like Bob does.

1431
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:01,570
The football.

1432
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,150
J.R. Bob Dobbs has a jawbone like that.

1433
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,410
It is the jawbone of the Yeti.

1434
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:14,690
Yes, a strong jaw, almost prognathous of a larger primate such as Gigantopithecus...

1435
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,110
Or J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1436
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,890
...or Gorilla or J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1437
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:22,390
But the Yeti now is such a much bigger...

1438
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,390


1439
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,390


1440
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,110
...and a larger animal than most subgeni I know.

1441
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,030
And it seems rather dwarf compared to the Yeti.

1442
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,350
Well, that's neither here nor there.

1443
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,470
Hitler wasn't very arrogant either.

1444
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,330
Yes, true.

1445
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:41,130
As far as ideological purity is concerned, do as we say, not as we do.

1446
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:41,590
Yeah.

1447
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,750
Yeah, I'll practice.

1448
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,570
We can do what we want.

1449
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,710
You can do what you want.

1450
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:50,450
As Bob said, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I preach to.

1451
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:50,910
Exactly.

1452
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:51,390
Here, here.

1453
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:51,750
Exactly.

1454
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,610
Neuronicus 1.14.

1455
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:55,890
Another door over there.

1456
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,470
You have to be crazy.

1457
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,130
You better stay calm.

1458
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,550
It's been a long journey.

1459
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:05,290
Many of us are tired, ready to lay our bodies down.

1460
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,990
I have the pain of a hundred million hells.

1461
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,630
Above all, a subgenius needs slack.

1462
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:14,450
That is it.

1463
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,630
The subgenius must have slack.

1464
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,630
It's not that the subgenius needs slack.

1465
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,830
The subgenius must have slack.

1466
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,470
The subgenius is born with slack.

1467
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:29,250
It doesn't mean that slack is not something you go out and acquire.

1468
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,610
Slack is what you have.

1469
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:36,110
The subgenius, to be a subgenius, must have slack.

1470
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:42,610
You were born with original slack, but the conspiracy took it away from you.

1471
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:43,390
That's right.

1472
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,430
Tell us.

1473
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,670
As heard on TV.

1474
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,170
Why?

1475
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:52,130
That conspiracy forced you to purchase false slack.

1476
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,950
And now you don't even know what real slack is.

1477
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:07,290
So if you're having a slack attack, you can find out how American hair must have it.

1478
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:14,470
So if you're having a slack attack, check out Revelation X at better bookstores everywhere.

1479
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,150
At Subgenius.com.

1480
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,670
Does the cover look just like the other cover?

1481
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,110
Yes, it is identical.

1482
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,130
Same colors?

1483
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,250
Yes.

1484
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,390
It all looks...

1485
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,870
In fact, I'd have a copy for you, Dr. Howell, but I gave them...

1486
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:37,190
All the ones that I had, I gave them away to my nieces and nephews in Stang County, Texas.

1487
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,730
Well, that's all right, I guess.

1488
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,470
Oh, I can mail you one.

1489
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:47,050
But those youths had never been exposed to the word of Bob in this form at all.

1490
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,910
You've read Revelation X because you co-authored it.

1491
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,150
Urban youths ought to be exposed to this kind of literature.

1492
00:57:55,270 --> 00:58:03,530
The youths of America deserve nothing less than full exposure to the Subgenius Doctrine.

1493
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:11,410
But are you saying that the authors of Subgenius Doctrine, Revelation X,

1494
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:18,910
are also working on the minds of tiny little helpless innocent children?

1495
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,270
Tiny little midgets?

1496
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:26,050
Well, as Bob ordered us to, yes, of course we are.

1497
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,870
You're only following orders?

1498
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,970
Little innocent precious fresh minds.

1499
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:40,510
I know what you mean, Michael Pepe, because every little innocent life is of inestimable value to us here in the Church of the Subgenius.

1500
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:47,330
Every tiny little runny pipsqueak that comes along toddling down the pike is to us a brother.

1501
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,090
And he toddles into a bookstore.

1502
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,490
He deserves to be coddled and burped and tickled.

1503
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,930
But there comes a time when you have to draw the line somewhere.

1504
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:05,210
And that line is www.subgenius.com.

1505
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,430
You have been listening to the Hour of Slack.

1506
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,410
Although this time it was a rerun.

1507
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,310
One of the KPFA over the edge and puzzling evidence show.

1508
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:17,510
Nonetheless, it is an hour of slack.

1509
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,490
Or just was.

1510
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:20,770
Subgenius.com.

1511
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,490
Praise Bob and thank you.
