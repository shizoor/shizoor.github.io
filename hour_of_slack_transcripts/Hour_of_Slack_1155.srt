1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:02,800
What?

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,400
When I think of Kobasi, I think of you.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,040
I think of Cleveland, Caneview.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,640
If you're cleaning up after the flood, you'll need to cause in...

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,640
Cleaning up after what now?

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,520
Your own sweat.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,480
Oh.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,000
That means you've been too busy, Janet.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,960
Something's wrong with your head.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,480
Let me look inside your ear canal.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,960
Have you been putting the wrong things in the right places again?

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,060
It's not safe to use electricity.

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,320
Electricity?

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,620
Yes, yes, yes.

16
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,240
If you're cleaning up after the flood, you'll need to cause injury or even death.

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,320
Oh, look.

18
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,160
There's an implant.

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,340
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,100
Yes, yes, yes.

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,620
There's an implant.

22
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,540
Oh, okay.

23
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes.

24
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,620
Look, it's a little crystal bob's head.

25
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,440
Oh.

26
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,160
Smoke's coming out of his nose.

27
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,080
I'll put it right back in your head just very quickly.

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,560
Ouch.

29
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,340
Ouch.

30
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,040
Doesn't hurt as much going back out as it does coming in, does it?

31
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,540
Oh, no.

32
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,380
I guess it doesn't.

33
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,560
That's just like the incoming...

34
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,060
If you're cleaning up after the flood, you'll need to cause injury or even death.

35
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,220
Hungry, hungry.

36
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,460
Step right this way.

37
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,720
Get your thrilling, exciting...

38
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,920
Self-genius.

39
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,720
Power of...

40
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,560
Splash.

41
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,760
Get your third dimension and genuine 3D glasses.

42
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,120
Listen, boys and girls.

43
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,020
Four thrilling, colorful pictures of real 3D glasses.

44
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,820
Welcome to the hour of...

45
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,600
This is American glory.

46
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,420
This is American...

47
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,880
Your old cheerleader, pyropractor.

48
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,100
Go home.

49
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,460
You know how it works.

50
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,100
Yeah.

51
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,960
La la, you know...

52
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,040
Little cheerleader on the court.

53
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,900
Six, six, six.

54
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,940
And how does it feel?

55
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,040
This is a little bit bigger monster.

56
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,700
Finish what you start.

57
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,260
This is the best experience I've ever had.

58
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,040
So weak.

59
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,880
I like that.

60
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,520
I like that.

61
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,160
It's a deep hole.

62
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,840
It's a deep hole.

63
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

64
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,440
Unbelievable, yeah.

65
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,160
Unbelievable, yeah.

66
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,840
Unbelievable, yeah.

67
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,960
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

68
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Back in history before time began, all the real cool cats had a solid plan.

69
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
When they dug a nervous chick, they...

70
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,820
All to a man went...

71
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,400
Aaaaah!

72
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,280
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah.

73
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,800
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah.

74
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,340
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah.

75
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,840
You wanna be cool, man?

76
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,820
Go ape.

77
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,380
Young mighty Joe swinging through the trees

78
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,900
Was the king of everything that roosted in the leaves

79
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,520
But when he saw a girl ape hanging in the breeze

80
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,020
He went...

81
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,900
Aaaaah!

82
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,860
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah.

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,380
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah.

84
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,040
Ape call, doodly-ah-bah.

85
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,280
You like to be hip, boy?

86
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,260
Go ape.

87
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,100
You're on the air.

88
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,000
Hi, Dr. Sinister.

89
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,980
What were you saying about old hipsters, some terrible slanderous thing?

90
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
Actually, that was...

91
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,260
I don't know what hipsters are exactly, but I know that nobody seems to like hipsters.

92
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,480
People tend to use hipster as a disparaging term.

93
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,020
And maybe I have a bit of a hipster streak in me, but I don't even know exactly what

94
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,560
that is.

95
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,420
You know, like...

96
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,740
You know, it...

97
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,720
I mean, I guess...

98
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,480
I don't know.

99
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,020
Well, it depends on...

100
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


101
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


102
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


103
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


104
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


105
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


106
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


107
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,020


108
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,280
It depends on who you're being compared to, I suppose.

109
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:12,060
I was standing in line for some kind of a rock and roll show, and I was with Reverend

110
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,320
Nikki Death Chick, who's about 20 years younger than me.

111
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,940
Mm-hmm.

112
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:24,080
We were kind of stuck in this long line with hipsters of every age group around us.

113
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Whoa.

114
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,080
And...

115
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,660
Where was this again?

116
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,040
It was somewhere...

117
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,540
Some show we went to see in Dallas a million years ago in the previous century.

118
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,300
Nikki was probably about 23 or 24, and I was younger.

119
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,540
I forget.

120
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,380
It may have been an Oingo Boingo show or Devo or something like that.

121
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,180
And we're standing in line with all these hipsters around us, and I just...

122
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,300
Suddenly I just...

123
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,020
I realized that I wasn't really a hippie.

124
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,020


125
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,460
Hippie or hipster or...

126
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,760
I was really...

127
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,820
Well, I was too young to be a hippie, and I was a little too old to be a punk.

128
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,620
Mm.

129
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,420
So I was stuck in that in-between thing where you smoked pot and said you were a hippie.

130
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,800
Yeah.

131
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
But I realized I really wasn't.

132
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,260
I was really just a geek, a weirdo.

133
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,820
And I said that to Nikki, and she said, I know I'm not really metal.

134
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,720
And we kind of looked down.

135
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,020
But it's not like I'm a geek.

136
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


137
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


138
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


139
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


140
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


141
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


142
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


143
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


144
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


145
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,020


146
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,360
But at the same time, you know, we had the pride in the fact that we were...

147
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,680
We really didn't fit in with...

148
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,500
Neither one of us fit in with our peers around us at all, even though it was a bunch of people

149
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,280
going to see a Frank Zappa concert or whatever the hell it was, some hipster thing.

150
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:58,020
And don't you get tired of the old hipsters who get drunk and start reciting Frank Zappa?

151
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,600
Or the Firesign Theater, or Monty Python, or Doctor Who, or some...

152
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
Whatever their animation, whatever their thing is.

153
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
Recitations, yeah.

154
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,160
Nowadays it would be games.

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,780
And you just want to kill them all!

156
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:21,400
Because just because you like something smart and brag about that, that doesn't necessarily

157
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,880
mean that you yourself are smart, because some of the dumbest people I've known of were

158
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,000
into what they thought was smart.

159
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000


160
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,840
And what they thought meant they must be smart.

161
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
Zappa or Ayn Rand.

162
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,100
That being really bad examples.

163
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,440
Ayn Rand, there you go.

164
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,980
And I was just as guilty when I was a young feller.

165
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,720
I looked down upon ACDC and Black Sabbath because I knew the really cool bands were

166
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,600
Captain Beefheart and so forth.

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
I never cared for ACDC.

168
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,260
I never knew...

169
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,680
I'm not a very good normal.

170
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,340
It would be hard for me to even place an ACDC song.

171
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
Princess Wee had to go, oh, you know that one song...

172
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,100
Yeah, yeah!

173
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,360
When the cats sing in my dance!

174
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,660
Right, right, right.

175
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,820
That horrible song they used to play all the time.

176
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,220
Right.

177
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,180
Yes, I hate that stuff.

178
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,900
Yeah, actually, and it's interesting though.

179
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,580
I think that was an interesting era in history when normals were into stuff that, you know,

180
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,080
was dark and nasty.

181
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,660
Well, you know, if I had been in high school at that time, I would have been a normal.

182
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


183
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,860
I would have been a normal then.

184
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,740
Well, I guess if you had been in high school at that time, then that would be...

185
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,140
It wouldn't seem so corny to me, if you know what I mean.

186
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,920
It's like what's playing on the radio on the first hot date, when you really score and

187
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,280
get to, like, second base or something, that's what you're gonna kind of identify with for

188
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,320
a long, long time.

189
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,640
Huh!

190
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
So, I haven't even heard that song yet.

191
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:48,740
Interesting.

192
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,260
And it takes a long time for that silliness to go away.

193
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,500
No.

194
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,640
And I think in a lot of people's cases, it never would have...

195
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,380
ever does.

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,240
I never got,

197
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,320
nobody got that joke

198
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,720
I made.

199
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,060
I got it.

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,840
So,

201
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,260
I don't know.

202
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,040
I've been,

203
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,060
I've been on the edge

204
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,380
of hip,

205
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,060
to the world of hipsters

206
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,320
myself my whole life.

207
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,020
Because they was,

208
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,880
seemed like they were

209
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,760
more interesting than

210
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,920
regular ordinary people.

211
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,960
But then you find out

212
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,800
they are just regular

213
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,480
ordinary people

214
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,180
who are posers

215
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,860
on the weekend.

216
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm sorry,

217
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,180
I had to play that.

218
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Anyway.

219
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,420
So,

220
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,760
like,

221
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,760
all I'm saying is

222
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
that I used to be

223
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
a real snob

224
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,680
about music

225
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
because it was like,

226
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:35,960
oh,

227
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,500
the dumb kids

228
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,460
like this kind of music

229
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,660
and us intellectual kids

230
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,480
like this other kind.

231
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,980
So that means

232
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,020
we're better and smarter.

233
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,560
And you know,

234
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,020
when you,

235
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,980
when I became

236
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,640
a little bit older

237
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,940
and heard that same

238
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,780
argument coming

239
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,500
from the mouth

240
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,900
of somebody

241
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,640
who wasn't me,

242
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,520
I realized

243
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,820
how dumb it was.

244
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,580
And that as

245
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,460
the Reverend

246
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,800
Friday Jones said

247
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,620
so personally,

248
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,220
perceptively,

249
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,220
long ago,

250
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,500
all music

251
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,900
is stupid.

252
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,660
I agree.

253
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,560
It's not,

254
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,260
you know,

255
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,520
necessary to our

256
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,680
survival.

257
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,340
No,

258
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,360
absolutely not.

259
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,640
No,

260
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,440
I hate all music.

261
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
I think all music

262
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,060
is absolute garbage,

263
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,480
actually.

264
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,080
You're right,

265
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,340
in one way or another.

266
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,360
Well,

267
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,640
it explains

268
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,360
you're doing

269
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,140
a radio gig.

270
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,280
Right,

271
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,020
which explains

272
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,660
why the music

273
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,420
I play is all,

274
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
all over the place,

275
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,260
you know.

276
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,220
Well,

277
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,460
I love music

278
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,540
in general,

279
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,660
like most humans

280
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,220
do.

281
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,760
Right.

282
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,800
And even subgeniuses.

283
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,560
But,

284
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,340
it's the snobbery

285
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,820
of music.

286
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,520
It's like being

287
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,300
the snob about

288
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,140
what kind of art

289
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,560
you like.

290
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,020
It's,

291
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,000
it's like,

292
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,500
doesn't that

293
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,000
sort of,

294
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,600
you know,

295
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,920
you're getting away

296
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,500
from the idea

297
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,060
of real art

298
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,720
and real music

299
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,240
if you're going

300
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,060
to suddenly dictate

301
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,380
what is valid

302
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,360
and what's not,

303
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,940
what's good

304
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,540
and what's bad.

305
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,220
And that's all

306
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,600
based on local,

307
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,600
temporal,

308
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,040
coolness

309
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,620
factors.

310
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,580
Yeah.

311
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,960
Well,

312
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,320
personally,

313
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,060
if you're born

314
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,020
short and ugly,

315
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,080
coolness might be

316
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,680
the only way

317
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,520
you can get laid.

318
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,340
Yeah.

319
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,480
Smartness ain't

320
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,080
gonna do it.

321
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,280
Big dinosaur

322
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,100
was a long,

323
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,720
tall lizard.

324
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,540
He drifted

325
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,040
through the jungle

326
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,280
like a slow blizzard.

327
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,120
But when he got

328
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,840
a double-ticket

329
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,740
lady lizard,

330
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,200
he did.

331
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,660
Ape call

332
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,100
doodly-ah-bah.

333
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,200
Ape call

334
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,640
doodly-ah-bah.

335
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,740
Ape call

336
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,100
doodly-ah-bah.

337
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,780
You wanna be

338
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,180
sharp,

339
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,520
sharp cat?

340
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,580
Go ape.

341
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
A pterodactyl

342
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,900
was a flying fool.

343
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,520
Just a...

344
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,740
I thought I'd break in

345
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,260
and tell you

346
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,640
what a pterodactyl was.

347
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,180
Well, it was sort of

348
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,480
a stork-looking bat

349
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,880
with sharp teeth

350
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
that cruised around

351
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
looking for...

352
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,760
Say,

353
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,200
we haven't changed

354
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,640
a bit,

355
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,320
have we, cats?

356
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,560
A pterodactyl

357
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
was a flying fool.

358
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,960
Just a breeze-flapping

359
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
daddy of the old school.

360
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,660
But a mama-dactyl

361
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,120
could sure

362
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,040
make him drool.

363
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,680
Ape call

364
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
doodly-ah-bah.

365
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,280
Ape call

366
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,580
doodly-ah-bah.

367
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,660
Ape call

368
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,020
doodly-ah-bah.

369
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,120
Don't be a square,

370
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,460
Joe.

371
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
Go ape.

372
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,140
I met...

373
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,480
Where's the monster jugs?

374
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,300
I met the editor

375
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,320
of monster jugs.

376
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,260
They're right over there.

377
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,600
Reverend Diane Hanson.

378
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,860
Hamster?

379
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,340
What?

380
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,960
She was a former

381
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,460
jugs-type model

382
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,700
who had become

383
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,500
an editor

384
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,720
of a men's magazine

385
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,020
and loved it.

386
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,640
Loved her job.

387
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,340
She said...

388
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,320
She edited

389
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,520
the magazine's

390
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,440
jugs

391
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,380
and some

392
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,360
foot fetish

393
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,820
thing.

394
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,240
Legs or feet

395
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,340
or something like that.

396
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,960
And she said that

397
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,540
manipulating men

398
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,940
was so much fun

399
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,000
because it was so...

400
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
It's such an easy job.

401
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Paid well.

402
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,140
She's recently

403
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,060
edited some

404
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,240
marvelous books

405
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,920
for attachment.

406
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,080
Well, she had

407
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,060
all the ingredients

408
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,740
of a good job.

409
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,280
She knew

410
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,940
quite a bit

411
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:49,940


412
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:49,940


413
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,620
what she liked.

414
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,660
She knew

415
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
that she enjoyed

416
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,060
her work.

417
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,080
And she was good

418
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,740
at her work.

419
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,100
And she got paid for it.

420
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,260
Diane Hanson has edited

421
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,820
some really great books

422
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:58,840
from fashion.

423
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
What more can a worker

424
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,500
ask for?

425
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,620
Oh, I didn't know that.

426
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,660
Yes, I think one of them

427
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,440
is the one on...

428
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,500
Workers that don't get to work

429
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,340
are like...

430
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,180
Men's sweat magazines.

431
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,720
Men's sweat magazines.

432
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,440
Have you ever seen that?

433
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
Men's sweat magazine.

434
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,540
My God, you've got

435
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,140
to see that.

436
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,780
Men's sweat...

437
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,900
I did find a website

438
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,660
for veiny women.

439
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,920
Photos of women

440
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:19,920


441
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:19,920


442
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
with huge...

443
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,540
My mom would have been

444
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,860
a star of that website.

445
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,720
...star of

446
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,560
vericoseveinywomen.com.

447
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,160
Yeah.

448
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Women with

449
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
nostril incrustation.

450
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,460
There's something

451
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,040
for everybody

452
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,200
except me.

453
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,180
Have you seen

454
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,720
Splosh magazine?

455
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,140
Ew.

456
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,920
No, but how about

457
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,240
heavilyincrestednostrils.com?

458
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,360
Pass.

459
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,120
Heavilyincrusted,

460
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,200
well, that's...

461
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,900
There she is.

462
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


463
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


464
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


465
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


466
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


467
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


468
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


469
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


470
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:49,900


471
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,060
She's all a damsel

472
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,600
of light dressed in a silken robe of white that shadowy in the moonlight show.

473
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,180
If you made a joke, what if the world was so screwed up that dot dot dot by the time you've

474
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,060
finished saying that, it's on the internet.

475
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,760
Yeah, somebody's got a website.

476
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,080
They've already developed all the software and put it out there in the length of time

477
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,160
it takes to say it.

478
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,020
Now they have software that generates the website as you're saying it.

479
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
And wildly glittery.

480
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
It's voice controlled software.

481
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,660
That was...

482
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,120
The gems in

483
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,180
That's why I quit working on my website.

484
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,700
I was...

485
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,000
It was embarrassing me.

486
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,300
I guess it was frightful there to see a woman with

487
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,580
And now you can go to myembarrassingwebsite.com.

488
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,300
Beautiful.

489
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,640
And make your own.

490
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,060
Yeah.

491
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,860
Automatically.

492
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,160
Right.

493
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,880
Just by thinking.

494
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Just by thinking it.

495
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
Software's so great.

496
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,120
We've totally disintermediated the software developer and writer from the...

497
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,220
Finally can't say that on KPN.

498
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,320
But with radio you can say something and...

499
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,380
You can say but with...

500
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,580
...instantly.

501
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


502
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


503
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


504
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


505
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


506
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,020
Yeah.

507
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,800
But not disintermediated.

508
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,220
That's right.

509
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,080
Oh, okay.

510
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,900
With the medium of radio, instant generation is possible.

511
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:55,920
Too many syllables.

512
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,460
But it might mean something else than what it sounds like.

513
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,160
So we have to watch out for what you...

514
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah.

515
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,240


516
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,540
But it does say media in it.

517
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:00,880
So maybe...

518
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,320
...the council will forgive us.

519
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,580
...as we've found out to our distress many times.

520
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,100
Hey, big boy.

521
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,900
Can I give you a lift?

522
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,820
I'm a bad girl.

523
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm so bad.

524
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,720
Oh, yeah!

525
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,640
Oh, yeah!

526
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,740
Oh, yeah!

527
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:13,900
Oh, yeah!

528
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,840
Oh, yeah!

529
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,720
Oh, yeah!

530
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,020
Oh, yeah!

531
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,340
Oh, yeah!

532
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Oh, yeah!

533
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,060
Oh, yeah!

534
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,620
Oh, yeah!

535
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,260
Oh, yeah!

536
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,120
Oh, yeah!

537
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,120


538
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Hey, big boy.

539
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,900
Can I give you a lift?

540
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,480
Hey!

541
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,380
Yes, baby.

542
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
And praise Bob.

543
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:41,280
This is Hour of Slack Number 1155, sex-hurt and love-fun themed, from the Church of

544
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,860
the Subgenius.

545
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,560
And that last collage, and many subsequent ones, are by the Reverend Norrell.

546
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:49,560


547
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,580
Norelpref of Norelpref.com.

548
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,120
The Hour of Slack titles and much else are by Fernanda Nende-Lemur.

549
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:06,060
And we're hearing clips from radio shows, Puzzling Evidence from KPFA Berkeley,

550
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,220
and Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland.

551
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,000
Nervous, Nervous does the ape call.

552
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,140
And friends, it's a love and pluses show as illustrated in this great rant from Winterstar 2008.

553
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,540
Friends, Reverend Bleepo Aberdathy has been a subgenius longer than damn near anybody.

554
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,880
1981, 82.

555
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,440
You can tell just by looking at him.

556
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,260
Praise Bob.

557
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,560
Bleepo.

558
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,560
Thanks.

559
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,800
You know, looking around the room,

560
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:42,980
there's a lot of people.

561
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,820
There's all kinds of people here.

562
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,040
And as a subgenius preacher for so many years,

563
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,820
I've had so many voices as a subgenius preacher.

564
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,080
But I decided to use this one today

565
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,980
and don't necessarily assume that this is the one that is, you know, set in stone.

566
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:05,340
You'll notice around you there are a lot of people who are various paganistic philosophies

567
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,440
and not agnostic, whatever you are.

568
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,160
And, of course, this one right here, Bob,

569
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,960
he becomes the personification.

570
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,900
He becomes the personification of what we call slack.

571
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,140
Praise Bob.

572
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,780
And I was talking with my dear friend Isaac Bonowitz about this,

573
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,980
and he reminded me that the only thing you have to lose through over-personification is Mr. Dignity.

574
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,820
So remember that, friends.

575
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,560
You know, there's a lot of confessing going on these days in religion, Oprah, Dr. Phil,

576
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:42,960
and stuff.

577
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,220
And I want to admit something to this audience for the first time publicly.

578
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,120
I feel it's time for me to come clean about this.

579
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,280
When I was a baby, I was part of a teething ring.

580
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,340
But enough of that.

581
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,860
You see, there's string theory and all that.

582
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,960
My friend Chris Rush has reminded me that string is real.

583
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,600
It's really merely baby rope.

584
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,340
So be aware of that as you're thinking about quantum physics.

585
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,040
Oh, my God.

586
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,220
The implications.

587
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,660
Good Lord, man.

588
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,260
Yes.

589
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,800
That's why I brought it up.

590
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,800
Now, Marshall McLuhan reminded us that new technologies amputate as much as they amplify.

591
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,960
You'll notice that as you're walking around, going around,

592
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,800
and seeing that as we're able to make even higher,

593
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,960
you're able to make even higher-resolution recordings on computers that are 96 kilocycles,

594
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,040
as opposed to the 44 that you're...

595
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,120
They go up to 200 kilobit cycles.

596
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,780
I don't remember all those words and stuff.

597
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,900
But anyway, you can make just the most highly accurate recordings now that you could ever, ever make.

598
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,800
Mirror image sound recordings are now possible.

599
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,740
It's impossible to tell.

600
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,960
Super high-resolution digital stuff is impossible.

601
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,840
And there are a lot of other technologies out there that allows us to record things more accurately.

602
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:23,280
And you can blow up these pictures that you take with your little cameras up to billboard size

603
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,740
and see molecules in the people's ring fingers and stuff.

604
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,980
It's amazing what you can do.

605
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,300
And yet, at the same time that this is happening,

606
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,240
shit sounds worse than ever on these little fucking MP3 players.

607
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,460
Because you're grinding.

608
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,880
As we can make it finer, we're also grinding it up finer.

609
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,800
And spewing it out at a lower bit rate.

610
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,380
So, I don't know where the comfort is in that,

611
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,860
but I have noticed an increase in something that I would call trans-porn-tainment.

612
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,780
This is something that if you had mentioned it in the 1950s,

613
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,400
people would say, nah, they would never allow that.

614
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,300
But no, friends, it's true.

615
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,980
On people's dashboards, you now have TVs.

616
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,040
So that you can watch TV as you drive.

617
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,640
Not only that, you can put whatever you want on this TV.

618
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,840
And I swear to God, swear to Bob,

619
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,660
as I was driving through New York City just a few months ago,

620
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,260
broad daylight, moms and dads and kids walking up and down the street,

621
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
cabs going by, buses, people, cops everywhere,

622
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,340
there was one man driving a Mercedes Benz,

623
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,560
giant thing, who, and he was just calm as toast,

624
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,180
watching really hardcore three-way fucking and sucking.

625
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,620
Right there, on his dashboard.

626
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,980
It's trans-porn-tainment.

627
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,440
And it struck me, now, maybe as we get used to it,

628
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,040
and our minds are more and more falling apart and over-saturated with media,

629
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,820
maybe we need a certain kind of like, you know, mental stimulation.

630
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,720
We're not allowed to drink, we're not allowed to smoke.

631
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,040
So you need something to keep you awake.

632
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,080
You can't drink coffee.

633
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,340
So it might as well be porn.

634
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,940
But how excited should you get while you're driving?

635
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
What are the limits?

636
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,040
These are things we have to ponder and figure out,

637
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,020
and you know, just figure out, you know, because if you're like,

638
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,900
if you're like falling asleep, yeah, you get a hard-on,

639
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,780
you're like, okay, yeah.

640
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,100
But then there's the point of distraction where, you know,

641
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,160
you're reaching a point of happy climax where, you know,

642
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,900
you'll lose consciousness, and it's extremely dangerous.

643
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,920
You don't want people driving around having orgasms

644
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,460
while they're, you know, supposed to be paying attention to the traffic light.

645
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,780
So, I don't know.

646
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,080
As far as I'm concerned, it's going to get worse before it,

647
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,420
as it gets better.

648
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,140
Because that's the thing.

649
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,500
Everything is getting worse and getting better at the same time.

650
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,860
So for every doomsday scenario, there's another scenario,

651
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,200
well, maybe we can just save this here planet.

652
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:30,020
Maybe there is a way to get, you know, internal combustion engines

653
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,220
replaced by perpetual motion machines.

654
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,440
And we will have that slack that we were, you know, dreaming of.

655
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,620
I'm just going to refer to my notes here.

656
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,180
All right.

657
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,140
There are two different coasts.

658
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,460
He's watching TV while he's preaching.

659
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,420
I am.

660
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,280
And I'll...

661
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
He's watching TV while he's preaching.

662
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,120
That's what's keeping me awake.

663
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,580
It's...

664
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,100
There are two coasts in this country, I've noticed.

665
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,160
And I've finally come up with a theory about the two coasts.

666
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,840
Because you'll notice that people on the West Coast are like,

667
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,680
yeah, man, we'll put up like...

668
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,520
We can put up vending machines to dispense medical marijuana.

669
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,880
What the hell is the West Coast, man?

670
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,220
You know.

671
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,200
And on the East Coast, you know, where we're still recovering from 9-11,

672
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,540
we're like, oh, you know, what are we going to do?

673
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,760
All this poison in the water.

674
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,900
The bagels are bad.

675
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,220
Ah!

676
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,980
And I figured out that there are two huge devices

677
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,600
buried on the various coasts by the conspiracy

678
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,660
that have kept the focus as simple as,

679
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,040
well, we're going to do this this way.

680
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,600
And on the West Coast, it's the...

681
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,840
Yes, it's the subwoofer is on the West Coast.

682
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
The subwoofer is on the West Coast.

683
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,500
And the high-frequency nebulizer,

684
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,580
or what I like to call the ultra-int,

685
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,960
is on the East Coast.

686
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
And the high-frequency projector,

687
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,740
it's like a tweeter on your old speakers there.

688
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
It's just pumping out anxiety

689
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,360
that's keeping us all uptight and making us worry about shit.

690
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,900
And that's balanced out by the subwoofer,

691
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,440
which is just...

692
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,320
It just sort of slows down everything

693
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,620
and sort of puts people in this perpetual sleep.

694
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,900
So that means it's up to the people

695
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,920
more towards the middle of the country,

696
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,380
more in places like Cleveland

697
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,420
and here in Pennsylvania, wherever we are,

698
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,860
to keep that balance there.

699
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,140
So if you're ever feeling irrelevant,

700
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,580
if you're people who live in the Midwest

701
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,820
and you're feeling irrelevant to the coasts,

702
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,860
I want you to be comforted

703
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,440
because you're actually standing in the sweet spot.

704
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,380
You really are.

705
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,640
And it's important to you to repop...

706
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,940
I think that the Midwestern party people understand,

707
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,100
even though all they have to eat

708
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,060
is like American cheese and iceberg lettuce,

709
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,620
it's still their job

710
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,120
to bring as much slack to the country as they possibly can.

711
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,200
They're the ones who actually should be reproducing.

712
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,320
Not the ones in the malls necessarily with 100 children,

713
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,080
but you people.

714
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,760
It's up to you to please go and spread the word

715
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,460
and keep the country happening.

716
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,080
Because, yeah, the coasts are kind of getting out of control.

717
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,200
But again, I think it's all getting worse

718
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,220
as it is getting better.

719
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,480
Finally, I just want to talk briefly

720
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,240
and leave you with the thought

721
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,200
that the thing that the Church of the Subgenius

722
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,680
is continually doing for me as a preacher

723
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,320
is not only do I try to imbue every piece of work I do

724
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,480
with a little bit of Dobbs

725
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,640
and a little bit of what I've learned through the years here,

726
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,800
but the subgenius church has helped me

727
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,060
to replace fear with humor.

728
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,580
And I think there's nothing more important than that.

729
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,820
And I'd like to leave with a little hymn

730
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,140
that I know.

731
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,720
It's not so funny.

732
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,520
It's just... I'll try.

733
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,920
I said I would try to do this,

734
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,000
and so I'm going to try this.

735
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,740
And you can feel free to sing along,

736
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,300
and then I'll leave.

737
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,160
So it's one that I once heard on a show

738
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,700
that was called The Great American Dream Machine,

739
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
and it just never left my mind

740
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,140
after I heard it like 30-some-odd years ago.

741
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,240
And it went like...

742
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,660
I want to be ready

743
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,800
I want to be ready

744
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,200
I want to be ready

745
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,720
Lord, ready to put on my long white robe

746
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Lord, I want to be ready

747
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,140
I want to be ready

748
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,380
I want to be ready

749
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,100
Lord, ready to put on my long white robe

750
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,880
Ready to put on my long white robe

751
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,220
Er, er, er, er, er, er

752
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,900
Reverend, please bow out loud.

753
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:03,900


754
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,820
Reverend, please bow out loud.

755
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,100
Reverend, please bow out loud.

756
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Oh, God, and be so glad

757
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,180
that I wasn't singing today.

758
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,160
that I wasn't singing today.

759
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,920
That was wonderful, Bleepo.

760
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,240
That was wonderful, Bleepo.

761
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,640
I know what he means

762
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,420
about all the cameras and recorders.

763
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:26,660


764
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,460
I used to film my life,

765
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,520
especially when my kids were growing up.

766
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,460
Everybody does that.

767
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,900
But I did it for the record.

768
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:33,900


769
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,260
A lot.

770
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Our last vacation, I didn't even bring

771
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,580
the video camera because I realized

772
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,080
as long as you're seeing through that little box,

773
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,760
you're just seeing what's in the little box.

774
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,720
You're not really there.

775
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,680
So I decided to start being here a little bit more.

776
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
So if you smell something funny, that's why.

777
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,860
The first thing I want to discuss in today's podcast

778
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,180
is the goal of the podcast.

779
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,540
I mean, why create a podcast?

780
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,960
Secondly, I want to talk about teensporn.com.

781
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
What is it and why bother?

782
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,520
And lastly, are you pro-porn?

783
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,660
Maybe a tongue?

784
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,100
This podcast exists for a reason,

785
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,440
giving me an excuse to purchase a podcasting microphone.

786
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,020
Does the internet need another podcast?

787
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,640
No.

788
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,360
Does it need sex, pornography, and...

789
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,700
sex, pornography, and masturbation?

790
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,220
Sex and porn every single day?

791
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,020
No.

792
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,140
No.

793
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,060
Um, surf porn, or surf porn because the Bible says so.

794
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,960
I've decided to surf porn.

795
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,360
Whatever the reason, I've decided to surf porn.

796
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,020
And to indulge in a porn habit.

797
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,400
Feed a porn habit.

798
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,600
And that's what we want, isn't it?

799
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,780
So I can be for you what you want to see.

800
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,080
I have the timing down, yeah, to surf pornography.

801
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,680
Some of our members like to see porn without a doubt.

802
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,740
I guarantee it.

803
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,320
Would I like to see porn?

804
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,420
Well, I watch porn two to three times each day.

805
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,220
And I wank while watching it.

806
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,180
Nothing wrong with that.

807
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,840
To surf porn, wanking on porn.

808
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,420
Masturbate.

809
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,240
I get that.

810
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,780
Come to teensporn.com.

811
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,440
Create an account and practice on us.

812
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,040
It really annoys me on our local PBS station here.

813
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,580
When they're fundraising, they get rid of the actual good shows that I wanted to see on PBS.

814
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,660
And they replace it with like these horrible boomer nostalgia movies.

815
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,860
Like the 50s and 60s.

816
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,140
Where they're just like, it's all your favorite songs from the 50s and 60s.

817
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,560
And they show this footage that's got to be like over 10 years old.

818
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,840
Maybe 20 years old in some cases.

819
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,240
You know, of like, you know, former like 50s and 60s pop stars performing on stage.

820
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:56,880
Or worse still, they'll have snake oil salesmen peddling, you know, a plan to...

821
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,260
Our boomers need our snake oil.

822
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,640
But, you know, now there's all this crazy stuff.

823
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,560
Crazy Generation Y nostalgia stuff going on.

824
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,420
Like, I don't think any generation has been so horribly inflicted with nostalgia so early as mine.

825
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,320
You're right.

826
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,840
It's disturbing.

827
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,520
You're right, actually.

828
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,960
And I'm really tired of it because...

829
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,600
Because stuff sucked back then.

830
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,880
They messed it up horribly.

831
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,320
The 80s sucked.

832
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,160
And I don't understand why people my age don't understand that.

833
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,740
Well, it causes inflammation of the bowel.

834
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,560
That's number one.

835
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,100
People have to be always aware of the, you know, the physical actual problems you're going to have with viewing this kind of stuff.

836
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,260
I had a lot of prins in the 80s because of that.

837
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,520
They usually think, you know, there's going to be a little treat for the eye and then maybe you'll get bored because it is 80s and boring and stuff.

838
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,120
But the next thing you know, there's physical symptoms.

839
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,320
And they're not good.

840
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,040
There's chills.

841
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,680
There's dryness of the mouth.

842
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:52,500
And there's, I think, a blurring of vision that causes some people to actually throw their TVs out the window.

843
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:52,980
So...

844
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,660
And in Cognite, it causes things like painful menstruation and moodiness.

845
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,660
In what?

846
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
Sounds like a commercial for Breezitol.

847
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,400
Oh, is that the place where they have the giant?

848
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,620
I'm sorry.

849
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,740
Excuse me.

850
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,780
I thought you were talking about the huge ones again.

851
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,280
Side effects may include painful castration.

852
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,260
Now that's the direction we want to go with this.

853
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,040
Viagra just turned 10 years old.

854
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,600
He's a problem child.

855
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:20,940
Really?

856
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,580
Yep.

857
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,280
You know, they grow up so fast.

858
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,440
But they don't grow up very much, do they?

859
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,640
What are we going to do when he's 19 and he's really old?

860
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:29,640


861
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,080
Really horny.

862
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,480
Talking about Viagra and saying they don't grow up very much is...

863
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,640
I get it.

864
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,340
You know what's really funny is they discovered it was causing blindness in some people.

865
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,400
It's like, gosh, kind of makes you wonder what they were using it for.

866
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,280
It's making them go blind.

867
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,960
Maybe it's not the Viagra, but...

868
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,200
Yeah.

869
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,100
I tried Viagra once and it made my entire body puff up like a toady frog.

870
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,940
And I'm not exaggerating.

871
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,920
I mean, that's the way it felt.

872
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,760
Well, that was all the blood, you know, just rushing to other parts of your body besides,

873
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,340
you know, the most important one.

874
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,500
Well, or it could just have been confused on which part was which.

875
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,400
It could have been the camel burritos.

876
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,760
Right.

877
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,060
It was the nano-onans in your body that were reacting to this Viagra.

878
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,160
And it realized, hey, the Viagra is here to, you know, expand blood vessels, so let's expand

879
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,620
all the blood vessels.

880
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,900
And it could have to do with the fact that it's the actual Viagra.

881
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:27,900


882
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,560
It's actually designed to help stimulate the parts of your body that are involved during

883
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,460
sex.

884
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,580
So in Sang's case, it must use more of your body.

885
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,000
Well, it does, it certainly does do that.

886
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,320
It's just that it does all this other stuff as well.

887
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,880
You're just using too many parts of your body.

888
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,040
It was, let me put it this way.

889
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,600
I wasn't going to do that again just for some girl.

890
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,920
His skin was cracking, Lassie.

891
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,040
His, you know, his...

892
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,640
They were like, his pores were oozing this weird, malodorous stuff, this stinky stuff.

893
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,620
He was on the verge of popping.

894
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,440
Leave your lover alone here at this hour of the morning.

895
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,700
Go grab your dick.

896
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,780
Out of shape and tired.

897
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,720
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dogger, dogger.

898
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,140
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

899
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,080
Yes, sir.

900
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,380
Clap trap, clap trap.

901
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,860
Yes, yes.

903
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,460
Crap, crap.

904
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,100
Mm-hmm.

905
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,060
Honky cracker.

906
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

907
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,180
How do you know?

908
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,860
No, no, no, no.

909
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,700
We don't know.

910
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,680
Biotech banking.

911
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,040
Taking a Broadway show.

912
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,860
Oh, oh.

913
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,940
I'm serious.

914
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,440
McBush, McBush.

915
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,180
Who, who, who.

916
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,720
Darn it, darn it.

917
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,380
Bull, bull, bull, bull.

918
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,760
Guns, guns and gay aspect is just, it's, it's, it's hideous.

919
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,520
Such, such.

921
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,460
Crap, crap.

922
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280

927
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:30,800
need to think about that but the whole charm of a bob condom of would be of course or a connie dum

928
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:40,280
but to see the distortion that happens when you put it on you know well these are the bob is only

929
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,000

island white fish without a dob's head on it and of course the reason is that who wants to get ink

00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,300
in their bloodstream you know what would you print you'd have to have ink printed on the outside

935
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,380

and which you might say well everybody doesn't everybody want that but not necessarily

938
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:47,040
made of toxic ink so we're working on the manufacturer of these things to switch over to printing them directly on the condom using squid ink or prairie squid ink something or something that tastes good too probably would be good i don't know i don't need to worry about

948
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:36,780


949
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:36,780


950
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:36,780


951
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:36,780


952
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:36,780


953
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:36,900
Still

954
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,820
So

955
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,080

00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:03,920
are dangerous. Prepare to turn away. 30 seconds. 15 seconds. 10 seconds. 9, 8, 1.

959
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:42,660
Stop. I painted your name, not in the light. About 8 feet tall, about 12 feet wide. I think that you believe me, but I came back down. And for a couple of weeks, we were the tall little town.

960
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:51,100
Hey, baby girl, say who and who. Hey, boy, say who and who.

961
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,200
Hey, everybody.

962
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:04,200
Say who and who. Hey, baby girl, say who and who.

963
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:15,940
Well, then I left town looking for a rolling grain. And it's a very nice week with a drink, six, eight, and four.

964
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,560
Care of me, whoever reaches, can't explain. I missed you so much, I fell in love.

965
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:23,560


966
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:23,560


967
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:42,080
And I cry. Oh, what do you see there.

968
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,000
But I understand, now. How we can understand each other, and believe me, what I don't understand.

969
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,880
And I think what I couldn't understand is me thinking, oh where did I miss thiszenia you

970
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,540
remember my love from youth.

971
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,440
Well, one day there was a factory in one of the parks

972
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,960
It was heated with wood and the house caught fire

973
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,700
I reached for the baby with the smoke and the sparks

974
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,300
But each one did I see the girl of the guitar

975
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,400
I got a lot of money, got a lot of good friends

976
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,860
But I can never back, I was like a man for says

977
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,620
Every name was changed, every story was true

978
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,440
Every priest was me, every strength was you

979
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,480
And they danced like angels, blessed out for being lovers

980
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,120
And I wrote their life story on a match

981
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,280
And I wrote their life story on a match

982
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,280


983
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,280
And the girls sang loo-de-loo

984
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,160
And the boys sang loo-de-loo

985
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,960
And everybody sang loo-de-loo

986
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,860
The semen sample was mixed.

987
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,080
Stop that. Holy crap.

988
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,460
Hell yeah, I lost it.

Holy crap.

00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,040
So you found the sex toys?

You can go buy a shawty.

1009
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,360
Hold up the local tab.

1010
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,940
Or steal a few VCRs.

1011
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,540
Or try a smash and grab.

1012
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,700
You won't be getting half the loot.

1013
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,700
Your lawyer QC will.

1014
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,840
You may as well obey the law.

1015
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,960

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,540
Just to watch him die.

1022
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,280
Go down to the casino.

1023
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,820
To see a dead and die.

1024
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,800
It sure won't be Lloyd Williams.

1025
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,940
Who hears the judge's will.

1026

00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:26,460
The animal will be locked away and never let him out.

For crime against property, you will have to pay the bill.

1038
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:50,260
For crime against the spirit, I sentence you to reveal.

Oh, Tissom.

1049
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,240
He did that.

1050
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,040
T-I-S-M, Tissom from Australia.

1051
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,340
And wouldn't you know it, as soon as we started playing them, as soon as we discovered them,

1052
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,340
their lead guitarist died.

1053
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
Many excuses.

1054
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:54,800
Blow.

1055
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,540
Acid.

1056
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,420
Under the Nazis.

1057
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,180
Cynical.

1058
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,500
Rap to make phone calls and knock on doors.

1059
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,380
The Bush administration.

1060
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,280

Among them, former mayor.

1066
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

1067
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,480
Many were surprised to see him receive communion.

1068
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,260
Giuliani's been married 3,000 times.

1069
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,160
Texas Judge Friday ordered that Giuliani submit DNA samples to help sort out family ties.

1070
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,100
It's wrong.

1071
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,900
It's wrong.

1072
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,480
It's wrong.

1073
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,060
It's wrong.

1074
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,520
It's wrong.

1075
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,400
Crackers.

Gross.

1079

00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,500
Attack it.

1101
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,000
All day.

1102
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:50,880
Or all night.

1103
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,260
Ugh.

1104
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:51,720
Riddles.

1105
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,000
Rose.

1106
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,180
Rose.

1107
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,340
Rose.

1108
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,880
Serious.

1109
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,480
Life starts.

1110
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,580
Now please, you've got to understand.

1111
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,080
Now let's continue with

1112
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,440
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

1113
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,600
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.

1114
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,220
Swing.

1115
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,100
Swing.

1116
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:02,980
Swing.

1117
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,480
Swing.

1118
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:03,820
Swing.

1119
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,800
She wants to swing.

1120
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,620
Don't you understand?

1121
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1122
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,740
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1123
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,580
Do you have any idea?

1124
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,220
What?

1125
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,040
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait a second.

1126
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,940
Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

1127
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,620
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

1128
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,160
You're the man.

1129
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:15,800
You.

1130
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,200
Bob.

1131
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,700
The man.

1132
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,220
Yo.

1133
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,420
Yo.

1134
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:17,620
Yo.

1135
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,340
Oh, man.

1136
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,640
I blew it big and Bob nailed me and man, I don't know if he likes me and I don't know

1137
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,480
if I can start all over again and I still.

1138
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,740
Really dumb, really angry.

1139
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,780
Really dumb, really angry.

1140
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,640
Yeah, in the house.

1141
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,480
Yeah, in the house.

1142
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,160
Got a little hard.

1143
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,980
Got a little hard.

1144
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,680
Rap, rap, rap.

1145
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1146
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay, I blew it, all right?

1147
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
I've got a, I've got a.

1148
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,280
Slack.

1149
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,480
Do you see what's happening?

1150
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:36,980
Of course.

1151
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,760
Slack.

1152
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,280
Baby.

1153
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,840
Baby.

1154
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,640
The pleasure.

1155
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,440
The pleasure.

1156
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:40,860
No.

1157
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,660
And don't think for a minute.

1158
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,680
And don't think for a minute.

1159
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,500
Let's just forget the whole thing happened and start all over again.

1160
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,000
Want to do that?

1161
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,080
Oh, oh, oh.

1162
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,900
Forget it.

1163
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,080
That's the concluding thought from Bob.

1164
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,060
It's always great.

1165
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,740
You'll want to use.

1166
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,480
You'll want to use.

1167
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,600
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1168
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,560
Just click in.

1169
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Slack.

1170
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,060
Slack.

1171
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,680
Slack.

1172
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,280
Slack.

1173
00:43:59,380 --> 00:43:59,760
Slack.

1174
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,140
Slack.

1175
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,380
Slack.

1176
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:00,380


1177
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,560
You ain't nothing but a rap.

1178
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,680
You ain't no friend of mine.

1179
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,240
You ain't nothing but a rap.

1180
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,620
We start a series of sermons today that are really a conversation with our cult.

1181
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,160
I grabbed this woman and not in a good way.

1182
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,480
And it's really hard.

1183
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,420
And you know, you know what I'm saying?

1184
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,740
There's a lot of tempting women.

1185
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,940
I want a woman.

1186
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,140
Oh, man.

1187
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,060
Yeah.

1188
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,840
Got to have another bite.

1189
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,540
But there are complications.

1190
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,880
And coming out incredibly.

1191
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,960
Lips respond.

1192
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,960
Crack.

1193
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,280
Clan.

1194
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,160
Transgendered woman.

1195
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,820
You have an incredible hard thing.

1196
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,900
She, man.

1197
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,020
We are homosexual.

1198
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,580
Sexually.

1199
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,080
We are so loose.

1200
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
We are so loose.

1201
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,520
And we are so loose.

1202
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,760
And we are so loose.

1203
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,960
My parents are weird.

1204
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,280
And I'm in this terrible situation.

1205
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,780
So hard.

1206
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,220
I do these things.

1207
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,700
Nobody knows what I do.

1208
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,840
It's my little secret.

1209
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,460
Nothing is yuck.

1210
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,260
This is a little one.

1211
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:02,520
This is a little one.

1212
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,520


1213
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,520


1214
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,520


1215
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,520


1216
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,520


1217
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,520


1218
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,560
Is it not a little one?

1219
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,260
You're on the air.

1220
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,620
Good evening, Dr. Sinister.

1221
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,440
Welcome, Rocknard.

1222
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,200
How is everybody tonight?

1223
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:08,960
Well.

1224
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,660
Full of beef.

1225
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,560
Full of beef.

1226
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,420
We're snowed in, baby.

1227
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,560
Yeah, I am, too.

1228
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,860
Actually, we're not.

1229
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,820
We've managed to tunnel our way out, most of us.

1230
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,600
Oh, have you been having all sorts of snow porn on the local news?

1231
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,500
Chelsea porn?

1232
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,660
No, snow porn.

1233
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,020
Snow porn?

1234
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,440
Well, disaster porn.

1235
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,500
Of course, the local news tries to make everything look as horrible and dangerous as they can.

1236
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,080
Because then the commercials look so much more exciting.

1237
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,360
Well, they were talking about it on NPR, actually, not like CPN.

1238
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,800
It was like in the hourly news updates from NPR News in Washington.

1239
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,300
I'm blah, blah, blah.

1240
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,080
And like they said, like Ohio severely snowed in.

1241
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,220
Cleveland Airport closed.

1242
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,540
And ODOT telling people stay home unless it's an emergency.

1243
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,740
Well, blinds and all kinds of blinds are not exactly sexy unless you have a fleet erection.

1244
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:01,740
Right.

1245
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,780
I mean, or it precludes.

1246
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,180
But how can you guarantee a flea-like erection?

1247
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,920
Actually, do fleas have ovipositors?

1248
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,180
I'm sorry, I get confused.

1249
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,160
Do fleas have ovipositors?

1250
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,220
I can't, I know grasshoppers do.

1251
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,940
I think they have a penile bone, don't they?

1252
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,800
Like a whale does.

1253
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,440
For grasshoppers?

1254
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,620
Grasshopper has an organ called an ovipositor, I think.

1255
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,140
Gee, that sounds so much like a positor.

1256
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,380
And a cloaca on the other end.

1257
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,760
A cloaca.

1258
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,560
But grasshoppers breathe through holes in their sides.

1259
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,420
In their sides.

1260
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,420
Spiracles.

1261
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,860
Spiracles, yes.

1262
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,960
And that's why you can't have gigantic insects because the, I guess it has something to do

1263
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,080
with the way the spiracles are made.

1264
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,660
Like they could not hold themselves together if they were larger than the largest insects

1265
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,200
out there.

1266
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,020
It's true that you cannot have giant insects due to nuclear radiation like we used to think

1267
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,720
in the 50s.

1268
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,380
But with quantum string bubbles, you can get giant insects.

1269
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:57,800
Brain numeral.

1270
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,060
And then they can play violin.

1271
00:46:59,140 --> 00:46:59,620
Yeah.

1272
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,400
That's because they have the string theory built right into their DNA.

1273
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,860
And when you see them in the old cartoons, they've actually gone back in time.

1274
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,640
And all grasshoppers, you know, it's like a syllogistic thing.

1275
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:18,120
If all grasshoppers play the violin, therefore, you know, equals, all grasshoppers play the violin.

1276
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,900
So there you go.

1277
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,000
That's a tautology.

1278
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:29,080
Well, as Bleepo Abernathy pointed out at Winterstar regarding string theory, strings are just baby ropes.

1279
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,600
Yeah.

1280
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,860
Well, yeah.

1281
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,520
So what does that portend for our whole universe?

1282
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,720
But then our food, like vermin, giant stuff like that would be inadequate ropes and would be inadequate strings.

1283
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:48,720
What happens when those, when the strings, the cosmic strings become cosmic ropes?

1284
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:49,620
Ugh.

1285
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,520
Or snap.

1286
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,640
Everything thickens up.

1287
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,740
Cosmic nooses.

1288
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,760
Well, what if they become frayed and still hold together?

1289
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,800
Cosmic strings may snap.

1290
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,140
You know what I mean?

1291
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,780
I keep breaking my cosmic G-string.

1292
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,960
Oh, geez.

1293
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,020
What an ill prescription.

1294
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,520
I'm sorry.

1295
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,000
The E-string.

1296
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,800
I meant the E-string.

1297
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,420
We're thinking I'm supposed to jump.

1298
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:05,920
Anyway.

1299
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,120
I just can't get, anyway.

1300
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,540
Two ones.

1301
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,420
There's no chanc, chancren, chancrenistic.

1302
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,260
I'm a lawyer.

1303
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,160
I'm a lawyer.

1304
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,380
Lawyer of the air.

1305
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,800
I got legal problems.

1306
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,900
No credit cards.

1307
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,340
But what's the problem?

1308
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,480
What's going on with you?

1309
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:28,020
Well, basically, I have some form of ecstasy.

1310
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,120
I'm a lawyer.

1311
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,340
I have ecstasy while in our home.

1312
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,240
What happened?

1313
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,620
Tell me what happened.

1314
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,000
Okay.

1315
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,300
From the beginning, basically what happens is I was upstairs getting dressed.

1316
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,360
Well, the nanny came.

1317
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:47,780
And this was probably like let's say, and then they said that he has the DNA.

1318
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,020
Call it ecstasy, right?

1319
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,380
Correct.

1320
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,420
So what happened then?

1321
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,700
So then of course what have you.

1322
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,540
So wait, wait, wait.

1323
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1324
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,300
Correct.

1325
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,180
Correct.

1326
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,480
That would be something, right?

1327
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,900
Right.

1328
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,060
And then.

1329
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,680
And now what's going on?

1330
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,360
Now what's going on?

1331
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,980
It's ecstasy.

1332
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,880
It's your ecstasy.

1333
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,580
It's your right?

1334
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,460
I completely understand.

1335
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:09,800
Okay.

1336
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,460
And.

1337
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,320
So what's the next step?

1338
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,240
The next step is.

1339
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,940
I don't think.

1340
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,260
You're, you're, you're.

1341
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,680
Oh, you're.

1342
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,340
Come on, come on.

1343
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,180
Come on, come on.

1344
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,980
Let's begin our time together with Bob.

1345
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,480
Bob reminds us of an important spiritual principle.

1346
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,160
Listen.

1347
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:25,720
Watch.

1348
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,040
Watch.

1349
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:26,480
Wait.

1350
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,500
Be careful.

1351
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,460
We'll rest assured you are being changed by slack.

1352
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:30,960
Yeah.

1353
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,680
We're coming again.

1354
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,860
Watching the rear.

1355
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,260
What do you do with all your men?

1356
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:35,780
Wait, wait, wait.

1357
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,000
You gotta.

1358
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1359
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:36,600
You gotta.

1360
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,240
And that's why I want you to see the.

1361
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,980
For as often as I take you.

1362
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,600
Come on.

1363
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,080
Come on.

1364
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,480
Don't touch.

1365
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:41,940
Don't touch.

1366
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,320
Mix.

1367
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:42,760
Mix.

1368
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,260
Mash them.

1369
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:43,700
Mash them.

1370
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,420
I, I, and I, I have a hard time.

1371
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,140
I, I, and I, I have a hard time.

1372
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:47,680
What are you doing?

1373
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,240
What are you doing?

1374
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:48,860
Yoke.

1375
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,260
Yoke.

1376
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,600
Yoke.

1377
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:49,940
Yoke.

1378
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,840
Get out of that.

1379
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,160
And I don't care.

1380
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:53,760
And I don't care.

1381
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,080
Come on.

1382
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,360
Come on.

1383
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,260
I'm not.

1384
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,800
I'm not.

1385
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:07,540
I'm not.

1386
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:07,780
Forward.

1387
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,320
Forward.

1388
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:08,680
Forward.

1389
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,340
Backward.

1390
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:09,820
Backward.

1391
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,460
What's happening?

1392
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,500
Lose.

1393
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,240
Direction.

1394
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,680
Direction.

1395
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,160
Direction.

1396
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,600
Direction.

1397
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,980
Bob will close our teaching today.

1398
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,200
The bad burn of.

1399
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,140
Bob.

1400
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,440
Bob.

1401
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:18,780
Bob.

1402
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,020
Bob.

1403
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,280
Word.

1404
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:19,680
Word.

1405
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,140
Cheese.

1406
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,960
In the next hour or so, we're going to talk about lust.

1407
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,580
And perhaps you as well.

1408
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,300
Like lost pornography.

1409
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,920
Like internet pornography.

1410
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,900
Internet pornography.

1411
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,220
I just use internet pornography as a fact of life.

1412
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,080
It's out there.

1413
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:33,980
You can Google it.

1414
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,860
It's really cool in terms of how fast things happen.

1415
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,360
One, two strokes from seeing things on the screen that are just absolutely unbelievable.

1416
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,760
So, you know, I'm a surfer.

1417
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,680
I'm a porn star.

1418
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,180
Porn star.

1419
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:44,980
Porn star.

1420
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:45,620
Naked.

1421
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,200
Hardening so as to indulge in every sensuality.

1422
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,800
Continual lust for more.

1423
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,160
Sex and those kind of things.

1424
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,320
Sensuality.

1425
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,140
Become sensual in your thinking.

1426
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,040
New pleasures and sexuality.

1427
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,380
Sensuality starts as a continual lust for more.

1428
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,480
Because you want it.

1429
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,820
You can't shut the lust engine down.

1430
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,160
Seeing a party going on.

1431
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,880
But that's sensuality in terms of just a continual lust for more.

1432
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,820
The dirty movies.

1433
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,340
Continual lust for more.

1434
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,860
There's got to be more and more and more and more.

1435
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,560
Reviewing pornography.

1436
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,300
Getting caught up in masturbation.

1437
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,180
So, we're going to try and look at it.

1438
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,860
Look at that tonight.

1439
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,660
Right on.

1440
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,300
Turn in your Bibles.

1441
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,380
Thank you.

1442
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,160
Word.

1443
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:25,980
Word.

1444
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,900
So, we're going to be talking about the importance of tongue.

1445
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,460
Describe a person that is coming.

1446
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,880
I gave the example.

1447
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:42,120
Phil, a couple of men to give them Tiger Woods in their life.

1448
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,620
Young men will see visions.

1449
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,060
Your old men will dream dreams.

1450
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,460
The tongue is the first thing that...

1451
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,200
What is the big deal about tongue?

1452
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,700
And what is the big deal about tongue?

1453
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,380
Tongue.

1454
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,020
Tongue.

1455
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,220
Religion is worthless.

1456
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,160
Okay?

1457
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,800
Word.

1458
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,900
Type.

1459
00:51:59,180 --> 00:51:59,720
Tongue.

1460
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,380
Wrong.

1461
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,540
Religion is worthless.

1462
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,920
PowerPoint is worthless.

1463
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,060
You know, inappropriate.

1464
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,640
None of that means a thing.

1465
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,900
And our religion is worthless.

1466
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,880
And here is why.

1467
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,540
Murder.

1468
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,580
Adultery.

1469
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,040
Sexual immorality.

False testimony.

1472
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,120
Slander.

1473
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,000
What goes in comes out.

1474
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,340

00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,560
The big mellow roony daddy with an iron hand.

1485
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,160
But when little Eva said,

1497
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:47,460


1498

00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:14,900


1507
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,280
I don't care if you lie like that or ask him a question.

1508
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:15,700
But I hear you.

1509
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,700


1510
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,700

00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1516
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,440
Soy, Rick enough to carry her from compassionate treatment to relationality.

1517
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:17,440


1518
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,980
And I know she's dreamin'

1519
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,380

1520
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,160

1521
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,660

1522
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,460

1528
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,860
He sings a different tune

1529
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,100
Yes, I know my brother well

1530
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,960
I've heard it said he's queer as hell

1531
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,520
Pray that he's in love as well

1532
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,540
