1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
Here now, here now, here now, dear friends.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,060
It's worth staying up for.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,340
But first...

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,660
I'd like to know if he starts the singing.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,740
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,860
Is it ready?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,020
All right.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,220
Three days ago.

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,800
Okay, here we go.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,440
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,840
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,760
Always resurface from the hypnosis slowly.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,900
Coming out of the tape has been likened to a total rebirth process, if managed successfully.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,400
He knows that a creative fail is one in which the idea that leads to a purchase

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,100
generates in the mind of the salesman before it does in the prospect's mind.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,200
He can create an appetite in the prospective customer.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,540
Where are we, Bob?

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
The code is broken.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,080
Trouble?

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:11,780
Big.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,900
Security?

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,260
I have the lid on tight.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,120
Well, take it off for me.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,860
The message is, Mars needs women.

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,380
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,420
Living in the future.

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,980
The Avatar of Slack and Saint of Sales.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,760
On Planet Lander.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,240
Bob?

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,800
Ah, yes, dear friends.

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,100
This is Robert Ivanstein.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour at Slack.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,700
But, friends, I still haven't made it.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm late to the radio station.

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,580
I still haven't made it to the station.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm broadcasting from this little remote mic.

37
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,400
And I'm trying to get everything packed up together here at my house.

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,340
This is...

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,940
...the Bald glaubt of time-controlled laboratory.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,480
He's got got this little...

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
...security system.

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:07,960
This.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,540
...that little security system.

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,260
Turn off the fake revolving can.

45
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh!

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,880
Wait...

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,700
I turned it on.

48
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,580
Okay.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,320
Get these things working right...

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,980
These are the, uh....

51
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,400
Kitchens of the Bald oughta time-controlled laboratory...

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,400


53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:38,700
You can see the little soles on the eyes over here that haven't yet been thawed out.

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,760
I heard friggin' bats.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,220
There's a hole in here.

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:55,720
And over here we've got the slackless children who've been cast out of the home for slackless children

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,680
because you didn't send in your donations to the station, Fran.

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,100
Look at these poor little children.

59
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,060
What do you have to say to the people, children?

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,300
My tooth is loose.

61
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,680
Like my sandpit's loose now.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,660
I got an ant bite.

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,260
Right.

64
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,600
A big old bug.

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,220
See, Fran, these are truly slackless children.

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,820
And these kids...

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,560
These...

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,980
These ant bites and these little bumps and bruises.

69
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,900
Now, Fran, you're not going to let these poor kids...

70
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,220
These are American kids.

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,820
You're not going to sit by and let these kids be in pain and slacklessness, are you?

72
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,880
You better call me Daddy.

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,220
Isn't that sweet?

74
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,720
These are only two of over 5,000 of them.

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,440
Because we have this amazing electronic babysitter here.

76
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,920
This...

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,600
This handsome robot.

78
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,640
You can hear it talking.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
And he's going to make a million dollars.

80
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

81
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
That's right, Fran.

82
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,520
He's going to make a million bucks.

83
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,920
Now he's inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
Ah, thank you.

85
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,520
Oh, you certainly are.

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh, friends, friends, friends.

87
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,420
Oh, really?

88
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,320
Help me, somebody.

89
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,280
She ain't got no legs.

90
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
Pungle every guy you go.

91
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,900
My legs are on fire.

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
They smell praise dogs.

93
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,020
Ah, yes.

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,440
It's so good to be back in power, dear friends, on the mighty, the mightiest, the very mightiest.

95
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,360
And you can call the mightiest of the mightiest.

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,980
I guess I ought to quit saying that word every five minutes on this show.

97
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,120
828-9500 is the number to call if you want to save your soul, friends.

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,260
Not just this station, but your soul.

99
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,260


100
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,740
Your eternal soul.

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
So open your heart.

102
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,100
Close your mind.

103
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,920
Unzip your lips and bend over to pull out that wallet, friends, because you're going to receive the word of Bob.

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,020
Because this is the last hour of the last pledge drive of the last hour of slack.

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,040
If you don't, call 828-9500 and make that pledge.

106
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,320
And dear friends, that some already have, even before we got on the air.

107
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,960
Tom Norris, praise Tom.

108
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,860
Praise Tom.

109
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Ha!

110
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,240
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah.

111
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,720
And you can call in and you can talk to the, there's some sexy ministers on the lines tonight.

112
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,880
Your prayer partners are here ready to receive your promise.

113
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,880
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

114
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,360
Why, the evil Dr. Zaphod here picked up.

115
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,380
He got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.

116
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,680
And I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,400
Now I know that, you know, not everybody can give that much.

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,220
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

119
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Is it the little old lady who can, who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name, but she donates a quarter, her last quarter?

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,340
Or does, or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars?

121
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,120
But only gives 10,000?

122
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:33,580
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that in Bob's eyes, that rich man is the only one that's going to get to heaven because he paid more money.

123
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,620
So I want you to call 828-9500.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
I mean, you have to, not just that number, but 823-2490.

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,440
And, you know, when you pledge, when you pledge, you're showing that there is a listenership out there for the Hour of Slack.

126
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,500
And believe you me.

127
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,020
We need proof every minute.

128
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,980
This show causes this nice station more headaches than probably just about any other show.

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,520
And, you know, we've probably got more enemies than most shows.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,580
So we need to prove that we have the friends, the dear, dear friends.

131
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,220
What is it you need here, sir?

132
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,100
Dr. Zaphon.

133
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,980
I just wanted to make a correction, Reverend Stank.

134
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,360
Oh, okay.

135
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,500
Go ahead, Dr. Zaphon.

136
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,300
Yeah.

137
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:38,780
Well, I just wanted to say that this, this brawl guy who didn't pledge $200, he pledged $199.99 because he heard on the last show, heard the last time around that Reverend Stank was going to meet anybody who pledged $200 at a motel on Harry Hines.

138
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,880
And it said he was down there and met you on Harry Hines last week for the parade.

139
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,560
Hey, wait a minute.

140
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,560
That was supposed to.

141
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,280
And he said he wasn't going to give $200, but he'd give $199.99.

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
Oh, so he thought.

143
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,980
Well, he gets the penny tip, huh?

144
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,560
Yeah, well, right.

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,700
Speaking of cheap hotels on Harry Hines, we just heard from a dear, dear friend when we didn't see at the parade.

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
I don't know why.

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,700
But the, oh, Reverend Ann, we feel your prayers.

148
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,380
And that ain't all we'd like to.

149
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Well, I don't want to go into that.

150
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,100
Let's go on.

151
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,260
Friends, like for that $40 that Reverend Ann sent in, what's the, what's the, what's the price?

152
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


153
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


154
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


155
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


156
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


157
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


158
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


159
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


160
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


161
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


162
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,260


163
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,820
I mean, you get everything.

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,340
You get the K&ON t-shirt.

165
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,060
You get the newsletter.

166
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:33,800
You get, oh, oh, oh, and I mustn't forget, folks, when you call 828-9500, you also get for free.

167
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:41,160
I mean, no matter what, how big your pledge is, you get an application to the church, the church itself of the subgenius.

168
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,960
A membership application to this church.

169
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,780
And just the application alone.

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,280
I mean, you think the Scientologists had a long questionnaire.

171
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:57,520
Wait until you see this one, friends, and you're going to see questions on there that you thought you had only asked yourself.

172
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,200
It'll be the first time anyone else ever asked you these questions.

173
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,720
But we got to sell you, friends.

174
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,960
We're not just going to sit here and talk.

175
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,280
Bob said we had to party.

176
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,720
Didn't he?

177
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,660
Didn't he?

178
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
He said we had to party.

179
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,420
He didn't say we could.

180
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,060
He said we had to.

181
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,220
And so we must also sell.

182
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,560
Praise Bob and thank you.

183
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,260
It's a significant amount.

184
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,260


185
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,900
We all heard.

186
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,820
Psst.

187
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,240
Are there destroyed?

188
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
The lid's off.

189
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,820
Yeah.

190
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,220
Squeaky clean.

191
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,700
The only way to do a show.

192
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,400
Oh.

193
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Hmm?

194
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,160


195
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,200
Hmm.

196
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,300
Hey, King.

197
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,700

Come on.

200
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,580
Get up off that chair.

201
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Follow me.

202
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,960
Ready?

203
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,620
Go.

204
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,500
The Soap Genius.

205
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,480
Our own sidewalk.

206
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,140
We're staying up late.

207
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,140

Up.

232
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,680
Up.

272
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,220
Oh, yes, dear friends.

273
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:34,820
Only if, you know, if you don't pledge, there's going to be more and more and more Reverend Stangs.

274
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,300
You're going to have to listen to it forever.

275
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,920
Can you imagine?

276
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,180
Dear friends, my gosh.

277
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,740
Let's get some spirit going here.

278
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,260
Look at those phones light up.

279
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,600
Oh, yes.

280
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,740
I like that old gold, friends.

281
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,480
Shake it off.

282
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,260
Shake it off.

283
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,620
Can you imagine a world without slack?

284
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,980
A world without the hour of slack?

285
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,040
And even almost as bad, a world without K&ON at all.

286
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:10,680
Because if you don't send some money by midnight tonight, you're going to be wishing to God you had or Bob.

287
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,740
Daddy, when are we going to get to listen to K&ON again?

288
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

289
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,100
Sweetheart, nobody sent in that pledge money.

290
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm afraid, afraid we may never get to hear K&ON anymore after, after this.

291
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,240
I mean, they didn't give the money, but they promised.

292
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,560
But that's just like stealing.

293
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,940
That's right, friends.

294
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,940
Yeah, I guess it is.

295
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,340
Yes.

296
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,340


297
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,540
That's very sad.

298
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,540
Yes, that's right.

299
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,540


300
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,080
Don't cry.

301
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,380
Don't cry.

302
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,680
Okay.

303
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,120
Thank you so much for watching this video.

304
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,540
And, hey, maybe I restroomed it a little too long.

305
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:11,840
If you liked it, press like.

306
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,840


307
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,840


308
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,840


309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,100
Bye bye.

310
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,700
Bye.

311
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,640
See you soon.

312
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:16,960


313
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,200
Bye.

314
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
Bye.

315
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,460
Bye.

316
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,460


317
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,460


318
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,460


319
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,260
You all sell.

320
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,180
Something to sell.

321
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Everyone selling together.

322
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,300
Milk tree!

323
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:44,960
With Connie's encouragement, the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary and almost frightening abilities.

324
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,540
Known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

325
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,880
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder and might have saved him.

326
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,100
But.

327
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,260
But, dear friends.

328
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,420
But.

329
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,700
Listen to that.

330
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,800
And listen to this.

331
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,320
Oh, folks, I want you to get back on those phones and call in another pledge.

332
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,560
I mean, and don't just pledge money.

333
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,280
Pledge everything.

334
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
You can pledge credit cards.

335
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,060
That's right.

336
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,320
We'll take Visa or Master Charge here.

337
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,520
Listen.

338
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,900
Feel the spirit of giving, friends.

339
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,900
This is that wonderful time of year.

340
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,100
And if you can just call 828-9500 or 823-2490.

341
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,460
823-7490.

343
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,700
That's 823-7490.

344
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Say that again.

345
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,200
Can you say that?

346
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,500
823-7490 or 828-9500.

347
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,420
Folks, and keep us on the air.

348
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Not just the hour of slack.

349
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,000
But.

350
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,340
But.

351
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,500
But.

352
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,500
K-N-O-N and all the other shows that you like and that I like.

353
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,120
But.

354
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,040
But don't.

355
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,760
You know, we got a lot of subgeniuses out there that call in with their church names.

356
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,960
Their.

357
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,420
Their.

358
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,820
Their church names.

359
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,820
And see, the problem with that is if you don't give your real name also, or rather your human

360
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,260
name.

361
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,300
If you don't give your human name, the mail won't get to you.

362
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,320
Your subgenius church application form won't get to you.

363
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,840
Your K-N-O-N t-shirt.

364
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,520
If you had that large of a pledge.

365
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,680
Your K-N-O-N newsletter.

366
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,720
That won't get to you.

367
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,680
The post office, we have found out the hard way, as have many subgeni out there, that

368
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,880
if you don't tell the conspiracy your real name, they use that as an excuse not to give

369
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,120
you your due slack.

370
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,620
Just one of many, many excuses.

371
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,660
So watch out with the fake names.

372
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,240
But do call in with that Visa and MasterCard number.

373
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,340
Call in with that promise of a check or cash.

374
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,080
And look at these.

375
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,520
These names.

376
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,440
Look at these souls lining up for the harvest, friends.

377
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,320
Reverend Simon Lewis.

378
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,760
These are all ordained ministers.

379
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,340
The minute they call in, folks.

380
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,160
Reverend.

381
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,080
Oh, this is so inspiring.

382
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,920
Reverend Simon Lewis has given and given and given.

383
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,200
Reverend Shaman again and again.

384
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,880
He keeps giving and keeps giving.

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
Why, the phones, friends.

386
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,840
The phones are just.

387
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,040
They're on fire.

388
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,040
They're on fire with the spirit.

389
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,080
Well, not exactly.

390
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,900
I can.

391
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,020
See where a few more lines could be.

392
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,480
But don't.

393
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,600
Don't pledge and then not send the money when you get.

394
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,460
You'll get a reminder.

395
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,220
Many have asked, well, do I get the reminder?

396
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,240
Do I get my goods immediately?

397
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,260
Well, not exactly.

398
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,580
We give you a little bit of time to send it in on your own.

399
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,280
But you will get.

400
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,720
You will get everything, friends.

401
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,400
If you give us your name and correct address, why, Batman himself has just called in with

402
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,140
a tremendous pledge.

403
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,940
I can't say.

404
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,300
I can't say how much it would embarrass him.

405
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:49,660
I'm sure.

406
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,940
Oh, also the Wayne Manor.

407
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,820
The Mr.

408
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,920
Roberts.

409
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,460
Hmm.

410
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,200
A Mr.

411
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,740
Roberts.

412
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,300
I wonder.

413
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,460
I wonder.

414
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,740
Mr.

415
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,860
Bob, they say the what?

416
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,080
Dr.

417
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,900
Zajac.

418
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,740
Reverend Shaman again and again.

419
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,140
He is a 600 pound wrestler, folks.

420
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,340
He's if I if I use his real name, you'd flip out because you see him all the time on World

421
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,380
Championship Wrestling.

422
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,420
And the lovely.

423
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,140
The lovely Mandy Macademia, if that is a female.

424
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,200
The mighty Reverend Head.

425
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,740
Now, that's a subgenius name.

426
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:32,140
If ever I heard one, Reverend Head at the Green Carpet Theater, Ratcliffe, the Cliff of Rats,

427
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,540
the Boat of the Man.

428
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,940
They're all out there, friends.

429
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,380
But I haven't heard from you.

430
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,100
That's right.

431
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,980
You, Bill, or you, Frank, or you, sister.

432
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,620
What's your name?

433
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,260
But you see, when this show ends and it will.

434
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,860
Pretty soon.

435
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,080
When this show ends.

436
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,060
So does what, you know, is your reality.

437
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,680
Oh, hey, we're getting hot.

438
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,460
Down here, we're getting some more of our famous extra friendly ministers, Reverend and once again giving more and more.

439
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,740
And now I want you all to make good on these.

440
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,860
I mean, you know, financially and every other way.

441
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,180
But I mean, when this show ends, if you haven't helped the station.

442
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,460
What?

443
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:15,860
You know?

444
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,340
As reality is going to.

445
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,640
to come to a crashing halt.

446
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,140
You see what I mean?

447
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,320
We were playing that cheery music

448
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,620
because we wanted to be positive.

449
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,540
But you know, frankly friends,

450
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,540
positive thinking can kill you.

451
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
Look where positive thinking has gotten

452
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,940
most of the world so far.

453
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,860
People say, Reverend Stang, he's a pessimistic booger,

454
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,740
but frankly, I'm worried that my most pessimistic predictions

455
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,560
might turn out to have been, in the long run,

456
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,540
idiotically optimistic.

457
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,400
And our fear tonight is that you out there taping this show

458
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,860
will think, will think, oh well,

459
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,640
well they'll stay on the air or not,

460
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,580
whether I give or not.

461
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,840
But folks, if you don't pledge,

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,560
the world will literally, will literally come to an end

463
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,020
at the end of this hour.

464
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,440
If you, and I don't mean just some of you,

465
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,280
I mean you, the one listening right now.

466
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh, you're laughing, you're laughing.

467
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,000
It's gonna collapse around your pathetic ears,

468
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,300
but you nihilistic teenagers out there,

469
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,300
oh no future, man, no future.

470
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,120
You know, that's why if the rival cult

471
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,280
that wants these airwaves had this hour,

472
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,360
they'd have raised 10,000 bucks by now.

473
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
And you know what they'd do with it?

474
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,100
They'd build concentration camps for the likes of you.

475
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,280
You abnormal, you, you punk, you.

476
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,380
You old hippie, you, you humanist,

477
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,900
you sub genius.

478
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,300
So friends, you know, the money isn't just

479
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,440
for the hour of slack, it's for the totality

480
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,900
that is K-N-O-N.

481
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,100
It isn't just for us mutants,

482
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,580
it's for your very mind, your very soul.

483
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,460
And you wouldn't believe how close your soul is

484
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,500
to being sold out.

485
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,680
Dear brother or sister, between your job

486
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,440
and the drugs and the lies, listen,

487
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,420
you need every bit of slack you can have,

488
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,940
and hang on to.

489
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,120
But we have a special form of slack

490
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,820
in store for you tonight.

491
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,040
Not stored in souls anywhere, folks.

492
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,340
And the type of slack you're gonna be getting is guilt.

493
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,480
Guilt, tonight we're gonna whip us up some guilt.

494
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,660
And some of you are saying, oh, well it's pledge time,

495
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Reverend Stang's gonna rant all night about money.

496
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,620
And you'd better be afraid that that's true,

497
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,120
little Bobby, little gimme Bob out there,

498
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,900
because if you don't send that pledge by midnight,

499
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,140
by midnight tonight,

500
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,340
you're gonna be wishing to Bob that you had,

501
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,160
or whatever god you worship,

502
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,600
the start, fist, and removal knows

503
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,220
whether you did or didn't, friends.

504
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,180
You think I'm crazy?

505
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,640
You think I'm crazy?

506
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,660
That's what they say about me.

507
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,800
Well, call 828-9500.

508
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,140
Call that number, 828-9500,

509
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,500
or 823-7490,

510
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,880
and receive the word of Bob,

511
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,720
and keep K-N-O-N here.

512
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,300
Oh, how'd that go, you guys?

513
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,600
Was that any good?

514
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,620
At first, you will want to turn away from him.

515
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
Then, you may find him a silent,

516
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,600
unresisting target for your ridicule.

517
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,640
Stand up.

518
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,340
Stand up!

519
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,600
Turn around!

520
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Mister, why's your head so big, mister?

521
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,560
But if you come to know him,

522
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,380
have you always been the way you are now?

523
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,240
You will begin to see beyond

524
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,220
the perversion of his form.

525
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,420
Are you in any pain?

526
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,300
Are your parents still alive?

527
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,020
And discover the beauty in the beast.

528
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,780
At no time have I met with such a perverted

529
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,140
or degraded version of a human being as this man.

530
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,700
I am not an animal.

531
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,380
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder,

532
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,820
and is well on his way there.

533
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,100
Oh!

534
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,580
Click it.

But what can you, a humble servant of Bob, do?

542
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,840
Bob, my friend, is the gun, but you are the bullet.

543
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,100
The showdown is fast approaching.

544
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,020
Though the church is still unknown to most,

545
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,640
Pink's, its infectious, ever-changing doctrines are spreading across the continents.

546
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,940
Church headquarters, the first Megafis Temple Lodge,

547
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,920
is housed in this Dallas skyscraper,

548
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,260
from which Dobbs' secret mandates are issued to his agents in the dreaded Brotherhood of Bob.

549
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,400
But this mighty edifice represents but the tip of a wandering rogue iceberg.

550
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,000
The words, hymns, and sound effects of Dobbs are disseminated on a weekly basis

551
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,280
to thousands of devout radio listeners in most major cities.

552
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,580
Even as far away as China.

553
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,080
Hello, this is subgenius talking from Beijing, China.

554
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,000
First, Bob, my name is Li Lijing.

555
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,160
I will tell you some funny story.

556
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,980
We know that humor is a technique of exaggeration, metaphor, and double-gloss.

557
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,960
It is a technique of exaggeration, metaphor, and double-gloss.

558
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,460
You have seen the real potential of humor in begin-ings between the

559
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,460


560
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,960
Right, what should we talk with the author instead?

561
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,000
The highly-demographic and version HU Three- healers from China.

562
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,600
Or a ratherieß en Unity Music.

563
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,340
Talkes about humor escaped from variety education and television scene.

564
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,340


565
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,580
Catherinericular history besides true kind and true fiction

566
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:31,680
Ah, buddy.

567
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:28,640
The church is most successful, dear friends.

568
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,720
Dear friends, when we get those bucks from you, and we're getting them, we're getting them, but we're not getting them fast enough.

569
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,380
I only see two lines lit up here.

570
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:45,000
Now, am I going to have to be like Dr. Gene Scott and just say, well, I'm going to play Chinese all night long if you aren't going to call in?

571
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:53,320
Is that what, you know, he gets on the air and plays his saxophone for three hours, and, you know, is that what it's going to come down to?

572
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,620
Well, I wanted to mention that that was the Pope of all China, Dr. Li Lijian.

573
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,520
And he was indeed telling a funny subgenius story in Chinese.

574
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:12,700
And I have to welcome to town, we've got a couple of the ambassadors, subgenius ambassadors to China, two of them.

575
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,620
Li Jing wasn't actually here last night, but over the weekend at the Buldada Time Control Laboratories,

576
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:26,900
we had the lovely high priestess of all Asia, including Japan, Miss Lian, and Hao Bing, who brought the cold weather.

577
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,240
You know, it snowed the other day.

578
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,620
Well, I hear you.

579
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,460
He's the reason why.

580
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,900
He's from way up there near Mongolia.

581
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,740
And here's an interesting thing.

582
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,900
And I'll tell you, after you call 828-9500 or 823-7490, why do I keep saying that?

583
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:49,320
823-7490 or 828-9500, you can, you know, we'll take that, we've got to have it, folks.

584
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,920
We have got to raise, to tell the truth, I've been told we have to raise a thousand bucks or that's it for the hour slack, you know.

585
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,620
Of course, that's what they say.

586
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,840
But here's the interesting thing.

587
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,160
This guy from China, yeah, more like 10,000.

588
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:13,880
This guy from China, Hao Bing, he got to talking to me about Kennedy's assassination.

589
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,060
It turns out that this guy from Beijing, China, was a Kennedy assassination buff.

590
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:28,340
And after, we talked about it for a long time, late last night, and he finally revealed to me that he personally suspects,

591
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:40,020
that Kennedy was not killed by Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone, but had actually been killed by a large, a conspiracy within the U.S. government.

592
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,860
And he was kind of letting me know that kind of under his breath.

593
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,100
He didn't want anyone else to know that he suspected this, you see.

594
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,600
So those of you listening out there who are subgeniuses and sent in your money to KNON,

595
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,620
but also paid to have it, you know, you're not going to get it.

596
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
You're not going to have Kennedy offed and to pay off the FBI.

597
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,260
Well, you know, maybe you should, I don't know, that wasn't a nice thing to do.

598
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,700
I took those Chinese driving around to see the Christmas lights of the rich people's neighborhoods of Dallas.

599
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,580
The people who never give to KNON.

600
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,160
And they'd never seen Christmas lights.

601
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,880
But I came across something real strange out there, folks.

602
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,980
Along with all the nativity scenes, there was something predicted in the book of the subgenius.

603
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
A Santa.

604
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,160
Nativity.

605
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,900
They finally are starting to get the record straight.

606
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,480
The birth of Santa Claus.

607
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,180
A tiny Santa Claus in a manger with an old Santa Claus with a halo bent over him.

608
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,460
And I thought, now that's a statement, folks.

609
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,620
That's a, that's, that's it.

610
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,680
When it is least obtrusive.

611
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,620
More important than all the media manipulation and celebrity ballyhoo.

612
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,660
The Reverend Ruggles Smedbeck over at the First Church of Mr. Science,

613
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:05,440
534 Revere Street, Revere, Massachusetts, 02151, I believe is the zip code there.

614
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,700
Anyway, if you want to write to them, they have their own magazine, Get Stupid Magazine, Fool Magazine.

615
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,400
Anyway, I was talking with the Reverend Ruggles Smedbeck last night.

616
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,700
He was a giant dog, and I was the dead Elvis Presley.

617
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,240
And it was very interesting seeing him in his dog incarnation.

618
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,900
Anyway, I'm not going to go too deeply into that now here,

619
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,220
because if you were to understand that,

620
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,100
then you'd probably understand everything.

621
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,760
So, instead, I just want to reiterate what we were talking about.

622
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,900
And that is the importance of time scratching.

623
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,960
Yes, friends, well, you know how your popular New York-style DJs will take a record

624
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,160
and they'll just scratch over it over and over again.

625
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,800
Well, we in the Church of the Subgenius are doing everything we can

626
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,580
to further the, the, the reaches of time scratching.

627
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,200
And, and the import of it is, is that we can take over.

628
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,200


629
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,800
We can take over the moment that we've enjoyed,

630
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,320
and we can scratch over the best parts of it over and over again.

631
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,040
Because, as you all know, Jehovah One, for instance,

632
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,460
tries to take from us at the peak moment, our peak experiences.

633
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,820
And what we can do is go back to these experiences in time

634
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,060
and scratch over them over and over again

635
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,900
until we gain as much as we can from the repeated,

636
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,640
the repeated ecstasy, you know, perc, squirt, piece moment.

637
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,780
Yeah, come on, come on, come on, come on.

638
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,200
So, you know, we can just scratch over it over and over again.

639
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,440
The point is, the point is you've got to call that 828-9500.

640
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,520
We can't time scratch anymore.

641
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,580
When, uh, the Reverend Ruggles smed back.

642
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,200
We need to, we need to get those pledges.

643
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,280
And right now it's, it's looking mighty bad.

644
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,560
It's looking poorly.

645
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,080
Now we have, we have been hearing from some people.

646
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,020
There's, uh, the Professor Richard Barham out there.

647
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,240
He didn't, he, he didn't have much to give, only $500.

648
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,960
But that's nothing to be ashamed of.

649
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,600
Uh, Caton Gates.

650
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,760
Huh!

651
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,300
Yeah, I, I, I, I.

652
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,600
That's, that's a huge one there.

653
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,480
Boy, friends.

654
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,120
But these, it's still, it's paltry.

655
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,800
It's paltry compared to what we really need, you know.

656
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,420
Free BAP rides every day.

657
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,200
Howdy, friends.

658
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,340
I'm Lord Jim Cravington for Medieval Motors,

659
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,460
your friendly truck stop and transportation in the Diet of Worms.

660
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,280
Friends, whether you're in the body or out to lunch,

661
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,440
we've got the Gryphon, the Minotaur,

662
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,580
or the sporty little camel leopard to suit your imaginary travel.

663
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,000
And gosh, what can I say about these little guys?

664
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,000
Yes, it's your all-new cardboard vampireettes,

665
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,500
the economy transport that's got them all guessing on the other side.

666
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,440
Well, we've got continents and peninsulas of new and used transfigurations

667
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,400
and a secret rose garden of perfect values.

668
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,040
So get your ass in gear and your oxen in here

669
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,640
so as we can trade indulgences and get you on your path.

670
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,500
Now, we're just a painful mile off the freeway of lost hope

671
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,780
at the intersection of down and out avenues in the Citadel of the Angel.

672
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,560
That's 828-98.

673
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,020
828-9500.

674
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,460
The good old boys are here tonight.

675
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,100
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

676
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,780
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home,

677
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,060
then try to keep yourselves awake and dial the phone.

678
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,400
Call in for pledges.

679
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,720
Call in for pledges, yes.

680
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,160
Call in those pledges.

681
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,900
828-9500, 823-7490.

682
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,800
We have a lot of our special beauties answering the phones this evening.

683
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,320
Beautiful Dr. Zaphon.

684
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,840
And the best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen

685
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,960
as quickly as you can with a contribution to the television mission.

686
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,540
That's right.

687
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,680
Don't forget to call in a pledge.

688
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,700
That's the hour of slack, 828-9500.

689
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:30,840
Talk about Jesus.

690
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,760
Well, you never know who's going to be here this evening.

691
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,120
That's right, friends.

692
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,340
Bob might be here.

693
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes, when it's one.

694
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,040
I know you are, son.

695
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,400
Might be Jesus.

696
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,240
You never know.

697
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,840
I know it's one of the real positive qualities of the television mission is we just never

698
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,780
know who's going to drop by.

699
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,300
I mean, it's a lot of folks have been.

700
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,920
The band is here.

701
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,880
The band is getting set up.

702
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,660
The band is ready.

703
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Okay, the band is ready, folks.

704
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:51,760
The band is ready.

705
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,200
And I'm here to tell you that it's time, ladies and gentlemen.

706
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,020
Buck naked and the Jaybirds.

707
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,540
I want you to hold on.

708
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,420
I want you to pause as long as you can because it's time you heard from Red Greenback and

709
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,800
the Blue Boys.

710
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,300
Oh, no, no.

711
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,820
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,100
Wait a minute.

713
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,620
That was the wrong.

714
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,320
Don't forget to call.

715
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,720
The number's on your screen.

716
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,840
828-9500.

717
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,480
Or, dear friends, 823-7490 to keep the hour of slack on the air.

718
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,380
And the one of Jesus standing underneath the bridge outside of San Antonio.

719
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,700
So, I gun my semi home to my baby's heart.

720
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:41,240
Well, I barely saw him thumbing in the rain, another hippie looking like he never did nobody

721
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,960
harm.

722
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:54,880
By the time I got my brakes on, I slowed her down and stopped and I looked around.

723
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,520
I got a ride with a woman.

724
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:08,960
I saw the tail lights of the Cadillac.

725
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:16,340
I picked him up, get smaller in the rainy dawn outside of San Antonio.

726
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,520
Come on.

727
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,460
Come on.

728
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:26,960
Jesus.

729
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,580
We want you to call 828-9500.

730
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,100


731
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,100


732
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,100


733
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,500
Come on, come on Jesus.

734
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,300
Come on, show yourself.

735
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,680
Show you care, Jesus.

736
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,400
Well, I chased them all that Saturday night.

737
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


738
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


739
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


740
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


741
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


742
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


743
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


744
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


745
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


746
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,500


747
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,780
Mexico just fell away, that woman never let nobody pass

748
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:17,760
They must have known I was behind them, eyes wide open, singing and shouting

749
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,840
Oh sweet Jesus, stop the gas

750
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,880
That woman kept on holding on, the big sky cracked and it drowned my song

751
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,060
And my rig and I broke down near Santa Fe

752
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:51,760
I thought I saw him waving as that Cadillac laid rubber smoking

753
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,200
Westward toward the desert and the city of L.A.

754
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,900
Come on Jesus, come on show yourself

755
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,620
Come on Jesus, come on show yourself

756
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,860
Well friends, Jesus hadn't showed up yet

757
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,480
But I'm sure he will show up soon

758
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:27,480


759
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,860
But the power of Bob is sure moving

760
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,360
We got Reverend Weatherly out there is going to get his subgenius membership pack

761
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,320
Because, or membership application I should say

762
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,440
Because he phoned in with that pledge for $828,9500

763
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,100
And that pledge for $823,7490,000,000,000

764
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,140
Can you believe it? Can you believe it?

765
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,900
And we've got here

766
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,060
Oh, they're still coming in folks

767
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,200
Somebody named, this can't be

768
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,520
A real doctor

769
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,200
A real doctor, a real doctor friend

770
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,260
Yeah, that was Dr. H. Stube Lewis

771
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,340
Don't call him

772
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,480
We got Lee O'Neill, we got Steve Atkins

773
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,240
We got Hal Hughes, we've got Howard Hughes

774
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,480
What, what?

775
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,300
We got Aaron Brucus, or Brucus

776
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,660
And friends you can talk to the real Will Frazier

777
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,720
You can talk, I mean this is, this is the Will Frazier

778
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,480
Answering phones for the hour of slack if you can imagine that

779
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,480


780
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,660
You can talk to the Reverend Zaphock, the Reverend Cecilia

781
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,860
You can hear these sexy voices talking to you

782
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,000
To you personally on the phone dear friend

783
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,920
But, but, but it's so sad because there's only three lines lit up now

784
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,840
What, what, what?

785
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,340
Hey

786
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,720
You mean they haven't sent any money to help the Stoichers?

787
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,140
That's funny

788
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,360
Isn't that just like stealing?

789
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,280
Oh, let me play that

790
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,360
You mean they listen to the hour of slack for free?

791
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,080
You mean they haven't sent any money to help the Stoichers?

792
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,760
Isn't that just like stealing?

793
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,800
Oh don't cry son, it's alright

794
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:21,920
I'm sure

795
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,540
We need more money!

796
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,320
Boy we sure do and we need it

797
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,460
It's so true, just listen to me

798
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,780
Listen to those slackless children

799
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,040
Those are kids from the home for slackless children

800
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,700
Begging you, begging you friends

801
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
Oh look at that, I only see a

802
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,820
Friend, you know, you know the, the way that you get a show at K-N-O-N

803
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:53,740
The problem is keeping it because if, you know, if they don't get the impression that there's a lot of people listening to this show

804
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,580
You know what's gonna happen, they're gonna put

805
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,720
They'll still let you have an hour of slack

806
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,920
Oh yeah, oh yeah

807
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,220
They'll still let you have an hour of slack friends

808
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,200
But they'll make you have it at 5 in the morning

809
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,960
You gonna, you gonna want to get up and get your slack at 5 in the morning friends?

810
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,380
Huh? Huh? Huh?

811
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,760
Well listen, that number to call is 823-7490

812
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,260
I wanna, I wanna see more calls, 823-7490

813
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,860
Or 828-9500

814
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,420
Do I have to act like Dr. Gene Scott and say look, uh, friend?

815
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,400
Boys and girls, I'm gonna have to just sit here and play my saxophone for full

816
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,700
Huh?

817
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,420
Wee, wee, wee, ah-ah, ah-ah, wee, wee, wee

818
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,760
The church is most successful when it is least obtrusive

819
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,660
More important than all the media manipulation and celebrity ballyhoo

820
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:50,140
Are the uncountable minor thought crimes and conversational subversions

821
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,800
Committed at random by lone, anonymous soldiers of slack

822
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,560
Slack

823
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,660
thousands of Bob's handy pamphlets with which to recruit the worthy and to perplex the normals,

824
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,860
to fill their minds with questions. Questions that only Bob can answer through his chosen apostles,

825
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,500
his fishers of wallets. And what is money? Nearly another tool of the conspiracy,

826
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:22,180
except when it gains power by passing from your pocket to Bob's.

827
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,760
I would like to testify to the power of Bob and what it has done for me.

828
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,820
Before I'd like to do that, I'd like to bring you a public service message from the Subgenius Foundation.

829
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,840
And friends, I'm talking about your cash flow. Have you thought about your cash flow recently?

830
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,840
Yeah! And where's it flowing? It's flowing out, isn't it?

831
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,860
Is there one person who says they got cash flow flowing in? Not one.

832
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:57,700
Let me tell you something, brothers and sisters. Let me tell you, cash is flowing into me.

833
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,720
How'd you do it?

834
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,300
Oh, I'm not telling you. But I'm going to tell you right now because you asked.

835
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:11,780
I believe in Bob. And if you have a problem with your cash flow, it's because your cash is not flowing towards Bob.

836
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:17,640
This is the first industrial church. We're not a tax write-off scam.

837
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,140
We're, we are an incorporator.

838
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:28,660
We're a profit-making foundation, if there is such a thing. We're profits and we want profits.

839
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,000
Children, you've got to come back to the old American way, yes?

840
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,720
You've got to come back to quality goods for your dime, a righteous purchase.

841
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:45,480
And let me ask you something, children. How many of you have been tithing unto Bob that which is truly Bob's?

842
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,160
Tell me that, children. How many of you have been giving 10% of your world's goods to Bob?

843
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,160
I don't care who you are.

844
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,060
I don't care who you are or where you come from. If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob, you're going to burn.

845
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,740
And K-N-O-M.

846
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:07,760
Mother Teresa, I don't care how many people she's helped, if she hadn't sent her $20 into J.R. Bob Dodds, it's going to burn in hell.

847
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,560
Friends, I want you to reach deep into that holiest orifice in your body.

848
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,440
Down to, you know, your back pocket.

849
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,080
Pull out that water.

850
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:22,320
Pull out that wallet.

851
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,200
And we don't just want the money out of the wallet.

852
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,540
We don't just want the credit card.

853
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,600
We want your library card.

854
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,800
Your social security card.

855
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,120
We want the wallet itself.

856
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,000
Because it ain't the money, friends.

857
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,700
It ain't the money.

858
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,760
It's the black.

859
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,220
It's the black.

860
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,400
Bob's got lots of money, friends.

861
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,040
Bob has lots of money, dear friends.

862
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,160
The money, you know, it don't buy you happiness, but it does buy you joy.

863
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,160


864
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,420
But it allows you the choice of what kind of misery you want to endure.

865
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,080
And if you can't have real slack, then I guess false slack is better than no slack.

866
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,720
But, remember, the conspiracy set it up to where you can never make enough money.

867
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,020
So, and this is something my young son just spouted the other day.

868
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,080
He spouted the word of Bob.

869
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,920
He said, don't take money, take Bob.

870
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,700
And you can't get Bob without sending money to K-N-O-M.

871
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,480
Via calling.

872
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,160
828-9500.

873
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,540
This logic is self-evidently inescapable.

874
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,340
And now, Dr. Zaphod.

875
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,120
Well, Reverend Stang, Carol Stazo called in with a pledge here.

876
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,480
She couldn't afford $200 for a date with Reverend Stang.

877
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,340
So, she settled for one with Reverend Zaphod.

878
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,940
And, well, I'll guarantee that.

879
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,800
Oh, praise that.

880
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,820
Praise that fine sister out there.

881
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,460
Once she has one date with Reverend Zaphod, she'll be banging on my door 24 hours a day.

882
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:51,460


883
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,760
Oh, it's a banging world, friends.

884
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,980
It's a banging universe.

885
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,860
Yes, it is.

886
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,140
Whew.

887
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:56,800
Whew.

888
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:57,920
Praise Bob.

889
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,280
You've got to give it some slack here at 828-9500.

890
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,820
You have to, friends.

891
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,060
You have to.

892
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,760
You must.

893
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,620
You must.

894
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,520
Because, because guilt, guilt is the, it's the feeling like, well, shoot, I can't, I

895
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,380
can't rant some, to that kind, I mean, this is a serious, serious, I need to, okay, I'll

896
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,860
put on this, here's some, what is this here we have?

897
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,860
Now, friends, you aren't calling those, oh, and, and Paul Riddle, oh, yeah, I remember

898
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,780
you from the parade.

899
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,700
It was a riddle indeed.

900
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,380
And, and, and $10,000.

901
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,100
Look at that.

902
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,140
Now, not everybody, like I say, not everybody can afford that.

903
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,400
It's, it's, you know, obviously true, but, you know, there's so many of you, you've been

904
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,620
out here taping this show.

905
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,160
And guilt is that feeling that you've been feeling.

906
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:58,600
It's like, it's as if the, the most hideous henchman of the tiny demon, Iheg-Iheen, was

907
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,080
gnawing and tickling incessantly at your very guts.

908
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,940
Like, the same feeling you get when it, when you call a pledge into 828-9500 and then don't

909
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,020
make good on it.

910
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,560
And it isn't from being afraid of the punishment.

911
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,900
It's from knowing that from, from that time on, you won't be allowed to forget what you

912
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,000
didn't do.

913
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,920
And guilt is the way you're gonna feel when I finish this sentence, which is actually

914
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,820
that you did pledge to KNO and last pledge drive, but you never sent your money.

915
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:35,400
You're getting free on this radio station what other sub-genii outside of Dallas have

916
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,320
to pay eight, up to eight bucks for, for one hour's worth.

917
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,080
And on top of that, you've been taping them, sending them around.

918
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,920
Maybe you haven't.

919
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,580
Maybe you've been sinless by omission.

920
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,880
But friends, Jesus, though Jesus is a man, he's a man.

921
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,600
Jesus Christ relieves you from, from guilt.

922
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,560
Bob, he, he, he, he don't forgive your trespasses.

923
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,800
He, he may show you some new ways to sin and he may give you a divine excuse by which to

924
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,240
rationalize your sins.

925
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,760
Oh yeah, but when it comes to sins against Bob, against slack, and against KNON, which

926
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,460
is a pillar of Bob's temple, oh no, he ain't gonna, he, he's gonna be whooping on your

927
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,840
butt for your trespasses.

928
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,560
And he's gonna do it in an hour that ye know not.

929
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:28,100
I lay upon ye jokers the curse that, here it is, may the curse of the head that has,

930
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:35,080
hath never bled be upon you that you may live listening to the other stations in quiet desperation.

931
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:43,420
And, and not, not one new mind-breaking experience would you have to give you that eternal satisfaction

932
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,820
because, because it would have taught you how to appreciate the suffering.

933
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,180
Desist not, Baric disappointed that your concentric circumstance was vegetable labor

934
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:53,760
and На all the others throw up but наe shall still disagree because they are, they'e

935
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,060
anton listening.

936
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,660
And, and his 734Talk.

937
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:16,340
Él haAppekiVí on MurぜAndl!

938
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,820
Let mうわIute!

939
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,320
Orán.

940
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,560
what you think you want to hear.

941
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,680
You pay to know what you really think,

942
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,000
and you want to hear surprises,

943
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,620
things that are new to your brain.

944
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,800
And they may be scary,

945
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,180
but it's like giving your brain a good rinse

946
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,400
through the car wash.

947
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,740
You know, you can't think about your own brain, friends,

948
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,640
but you can dial this number

949
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,040
and pledge that money to KNON

950
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,880
to help keep us all on the air.

951
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,180
And you too, for instance, at some point.

952
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,600
So, you know, friends,

953
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,400
it's your choice.

954
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,280
It's your choice.

955
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,380
You can go ahead and choose to blow it all off.

956
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,000
You can go ahead and go on with the conspiracy,

957
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,300
whatever the conspiracy wants you to do.

958
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,800
We have only our simple faith

959
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,280
that heaven will be ours if we only believe.

960
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,380
Ironically, his mission will not be to sell Earth,

961
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,500
but to prevent Earth being sold

962
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,160
and transformed into a country

963
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,000
kind of stuckies in space.

964
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,540
Don't forget that Bob has come to,

965
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,500
has prophesied the end of the world,

966
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,580
July 5th, 1998, okay?

967
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,520
When most Americans will have hangovers,

968
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,720
but it's not just for the Americans,

969
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,020
it's for everyone in the world.

970
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,040
I didn't hear that.

971
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,260
Yeah, right.

972
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,880
That is why...

973
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,140
I'm gonna start smoking again.

974
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,920
Yeah, start smoking, start drinking,

975
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,840
and live it up.

976
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,820
Start fornicating as if your very life depended on it.

977
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,060
Holy dog.

978
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:41,660
Okay.

979
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,060
Okay.

980
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,520
This is...

981
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,500
I'm speaking to you in the old calendar year, 1981,

982
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,740
which we refer to as 17BX,

983
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,460
before the exes,

984
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,800
before the exes land.

985
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,820
This is true.

986
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,140
All the signs are already in place,

987
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,020
and Bob has come to us

988
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,140
to make sure the end of the world happens properly.

989
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,180
But this plan will succeed

990
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,360
only if conditions are just right at the appointed time.

991
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,420
Otherwise,

992
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,280
dark forces of antiquity

993
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,020
will be awakened from their slumber of eons

994
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,120
and rise again from Atlantis

995
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,340
to rule our world in their sizeless grip.

996
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,300
These primordial elementals,

997
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,780
the Elder Gods,

998
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,820
have countless demonic and interplanetary minions

999
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,580
carrying out their unholy schemes.

1000
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,780
Now, many people here tonight, I'm sure,

1001
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,820
you guys down here,

1002
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,260
you see the conspiracy,

1003
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,280
you see the conspiracy on a very tiny,

1004
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,920
arcane,

1005
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,180
and mealy-mouthed level.

1006
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,840
You see the conspiracy only as the U.S. government,

1007
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,820
ZIA, FBI, Lutheran Church of Missouri Synod,

1008
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,480
Catholic Church, Jewish Defense League,

1009
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,680
Council on Foreign Relations,

1010
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,760
their trilateral commission.

1011
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,960
Other, more occultated individuals

1012
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,400
can see it at the next level.

1013
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,940
You see that the conspiracy exists

1014
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,660
as the men in black,

1015
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,700
the green energy demons,

1016
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,400
the aliens,

1017
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,660
the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

1018
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,580
from the hollow earth,

1019
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,940
the henchmen of Negi,

1020
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,400
and the Yakutismo.

1021
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,500
But I'm here to tell you tonight, children,

1022
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,180
that the conspiracy exists

1023
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,180
as none other than Jehovah One,

1024
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,480
alien space god of wrath

1025
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,780
from some corporate sin galaxy,

1026
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,560
and his star-fist of remove.

1027
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,980
With all his powers,

1028
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,820
could Dobbs really be defeated by these beings?

1029
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,400
Ah, but you must not underestimate him.

1030
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,500
The conspiracy is a conspiracy.

1031
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,760
Its weapons are so insidious,

1032
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,320
even the human conspiracy leaders

1033
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,780
are unaware of them.

1034
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,220
The fact that the conspiracy itself

1035
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,440
is ignorant that it is a conspiracy

1036
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,360
gives it such control over our minds

1037
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,880
that the very thought becomes unthinkable.

1038
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,860
You cannot think about your own mind.

1039
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,240
That's part of the problem.

1040
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,340
You cannot think about your own mind.

1041
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,420
You cannot wash soap.

1042
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,620
You cannot see your own eyes.

1043
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,920
You cannot run from your own legs.

1044
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,080
You cannot hide from other people.

1045
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,700
You cannot hide from God.

1046
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,340
He's bearing you.

1047
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,560
He's bearing all reality.

1048
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,140
Whoo!

1049
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,680
Help me somebody.

1050
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,000
She ain't got no legs, poor boy.

1051
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,100
My legs are on fire.

1052
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,020
The bovinity and temerity of the human mind itself

1053
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,120
does all the work.

1054
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,180
The evil ones may just lean back

1055
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,260
and watch the little humans march gladly,

1056
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,260
even proudly, to their doom.

1057
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,420
But we, too, must be vigilant.

1058
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,700
For, thanks to the false slack bombarding us daily,

1059
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,860
it is terrifyingly easy for even a subgenius

1060
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,940
to slip back into normality,

1061
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,240
to become one of them.

1062
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,780
We live in a dangerous world.

1063
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,240
The powers of pinkness

1064
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,260
are always fighting the powers of slack.

1065
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,360
Yes, children, they're locked in a death struggle.

1066
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,460
Sometimes all brother pink

1067
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,980
gets all brother slack down.

1068
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,960
And he's a gasping.

1069
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,600
And he's a choking.

1070
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,360
And he's a straining.

1071
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,340
But then,

1072
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,380
Go, brother slack!

1073
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:13,740
Go, brother slack!

1074
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,780
The boy and the mother,

1075
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,440
the boy and the good money.

1076
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,180
Fight it.

1077
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:17,460
Fight it.

1078
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,140
And the powers of slack fight back.

1079
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,100
Fight it.

1080
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,520
Fight it.

1081
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:21,980
Fight it.

1082
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,240
Fight it.

1083
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,240


1084
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,240


1085
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,100
Yes, yes, yes.

1086
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,960
Fight it with slack.

1087
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1088
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1089
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
The powers of pinkness down.

1090
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:26,980
Fight it with slack.

1091
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,260
But, children,

1092
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,420
the final outcome

1093
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,420
is up to you.

1094
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,220
Fight it with slack.

1095
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,640
Fight it with slack.

1096
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,620
You know what they do.

1097
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,840
That's the difference between us

1098
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,560
and the conspiracy.

1099
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,220
Our counter-spiracy

1100
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,320
doesn't tell you what to do.

1101
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,540
They'll tell you what to do

1102
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,480
and all they want is one simple thing.

1103
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,040
One simple thing.

1104
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,980
I just want you to give up.

1105
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,640
Professional football players,

1106
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,620
in case you don't know,

1107
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,400
have now gotten so big,

1108
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,920
so strong,

1109
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,780
and so fast

1110
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,080
that when they run into each other,

1111
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,200
the human body can no longer

1112
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,820
sustain the impact.

1113
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,540
And children,

1114
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,500
in the same way,

1115
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:05,820
have to fight back.

1116
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1117
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1118
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1119
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1120
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1121
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1122
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1123
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1124
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1125
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1126
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1127
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:05,820


1128
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,580
The images that win wigs,

1129
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,840
the great selling conspiracy monster,

1130
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,260
manipulate you

1131
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,320
have become so sophisticated

1132
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,160
that no matter how slick you think you are,

1133
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,700
you cannot resist.

1134
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,960
This is Stomachsons.

1135
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,900
And it's like a...

1136
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,620
We're gonna be taking calls

1137
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,840
on 828-9500 for pledging.

1138
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,950
If you want to call us for a talk line,

1139
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,130
it's 823-7490 to pledge.

1140
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:41,670
Yeah.

1141
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,030
823-7490 to talk on the air,

1142
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,850
828-9500 to pledge.

1143
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:51,890
So anybody on the other line,

1144
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:52,950
we'll just let them go

1145
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,410
and call back at 7490.

1146
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,070
We don't want to talk to you,

1147
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,490
you things out there,

1148
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,430
unless you're gonna...

1149
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,810
You know, give a little bit

1150
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,150
of what Bob's saying.

1151
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,950
What Bob knows is most important to you.

1152
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,290
You know, Bob doesn't...

1153
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,150
Our guru, our high E-pop,

1154
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:13,470
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1155
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,930
he does not care for your money,

1156
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,710
your lowly money,

1157
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,050
nor does he even care

1158
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,570
for your despicable,

1159
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,970
pathetic animal soul, friend.

1160
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,730
He doesn't care...

1161
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,790
He just wants whatever is most important to you.

1162
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:29,670
And here in America,

1163
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,390
that's usually your money.

1164
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,850
So let's please, dear friends,

1165
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,930
if you want to hear any more

1166
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,130
of the wisdom of Bob Dobbs,

1167
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,190
that could save you

1168
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,110
come that hideous holocaust,

1169
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,250
or the holocaust, we call it,

1170
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,670
because everybody will be watching on TV

1171
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,630
until their...

1172
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,350
until their flesh is fried off their bones

1173
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,850
and with the glorious radioactive kiss

1174
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:54,850
of Jehovah's...

1175
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,990
Listen to those calls.

1176
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,730
Listen to those calls

1177
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,830
going like mad, friend.

1178
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:01,150
Oh.

1179
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,250
Well, folks, that's it.

1180
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:03,790
That's it.

1181
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,010
I mean, it's gonna be over in five minutes.

1182
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,290
It is gonna be over.

1183
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,070
It's gonna be it.

1184
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,110
It's gonna be it for you, baby.

1185
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,530
I mean, you know, as it is,

1186
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,770
I have to censor the songs I play

1187
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:16,790
and the rants I play

1188
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:17,650
because of the FCC,

1189
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,190
because they're afraid of sex

1190
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,510
and all the sexy things

1191
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:23,890
and the words used to describe sexy things.

1192
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,450
And of course, I think some words should be illegal,

1193
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,030
like paperclip.

1194
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:29,870
That disgusts me.

1195
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,570
Kids use words like that,

1196
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:32,790
but paperclip,

1197
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,410
I hope none of them are up listening tonight,

1198
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:36,330
license plate,

1199
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,370
makes them want to be bad.

1200
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,310
They think it's okay to talk about paperclips

1201
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,270
and license plates any old time in church.

1202
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,510
I can get up and say,

1203
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:45,430
oh, preacher, I need...

1204
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,910
I need a paperclip for my Bible school paper.

1205
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,950
Oh, he said paperclip, stone him to death.

1206
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,370
Oh, no, no, don't stone...

1207
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,870
Throw the license plate at him.

1208
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,530
No, kill him.

1209
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,970
That's an old Monty Python routine, folks.

1210
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:59,050
But the false churches,

1211
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,230
they want to ban.

1212
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,790
They want to ban just about everything.

1213
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,470
And that shows just how much they have to fear

1214
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:09,090
from people possibly catching on to their little game.

1215
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:10,550
Their little game.

1216
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,490
Fear, fear, fear,

1217
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,130
and freedom of choice, friends.

1218
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,190
That's what it's all about.

1219
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,870
You know, fear is what a religion's all about anyway,

1220
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,350
to begin with, I guess.

1221
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,930
It's like, oh, don't kill me, God.

1222
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,250
Please, Lord, don't kill me.

1223
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:25,950
I'm a good boy.

1224
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,290
Oh, aside from dressing up like a girl, I'm okay.

1225
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,610
Oh, aside from all that masturbating,

1226
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,330
I used to steal a lot when I was a teenager,

1227
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,570
but that was a long time ago.

1228
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,450
I seriously thought about running around on my wife,

1229
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,490
but I didn't, God.

1230
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,330
It doesn't matter, son.

1231
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,610
Lust in the heart is the same thing.

1232
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,330
Fear and disgust.

1233
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,490
Friends, I want you...

1234
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:54,570
You've got the choice to call 828-9500,

1235
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,530
or you can call...

1236
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,990
You can call 823-7490.

1237
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:00,670
You can get...

1238
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,990
You've got three minutes left.

1239
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:02,850
Three minutes left.

1240
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,950
And friends, I know there's something going on.

1241
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:05,870
I'm in the spirit.

1242
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:06,330
I can...

1243
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,570
There's someone out there who needs an exorcism.

1244
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,310
Someone out there who needs...

1245
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:11,570
Wait a minute.

1246
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,130
We're gonna have to cut that down.

1247
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,510
We're gonna have to get into something more spiritual-minded here.

1248
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,450
Okay, now, listen.

1249
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:23,550
There is a person out there who has been tormenting their loved thing,

1250
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,190
and I want you...

1251
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,310
A friend of this is...

1252
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:27,830
I cast ye out.

1253
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,170
It was Bob.

1254
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,650
It banished you out.

1255
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,190
It brought you to the pit.

1256
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:35,490
It was he who flung you from the depths of heaven to the pits of hell.

1257
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,330
It was he who cast you out.

1258
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,470
Unclean spirit, he has dominion over you.

1259
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:44,390
I order you in the name of Bob to come out of this poor servant.

1260
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,250
And spare Reverend Cecilia.

1261
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,930
I command you to put your hands on the radio.

1262
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,810
I demand that you come out.

1263
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,010
Come out.

1264
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,010
Come out.

1265
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,870
The power of Bob compels you to call 828-9500.

1266
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,050
You have to.

1267
00:59:59,050 --> 00:59:59,650
You...

1268
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,110
I mean, Bob says you have to.

1269
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,810
Niggy says you have to.

1270
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,690
The power of Bob compels you.

1271
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,770
The power of Bob compels you.

1272
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,030
Friends, I'm in the spirit.

1273
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:08,930
I can feel it.

1274
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,010
It's building up.

1275
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,390
It's building up.

1276
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,770
I'm getting a sign.

1277
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,410
I can see someone in my mind's eye.

1278
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:16,290
They're thinking about calling 828-9500.

1279
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,210
It's a young man.

1280
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,090
His name...

1281
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:18,830
His name is...

1282
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:19,710
I'm getting it.

1283
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,550
I'm getting it now here.

1284
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:23,210
It's David, and he's deeply troubled.

1285
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,630
He's bound by demons.

1286
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,850
He's bound by the binding spirits of false conspiracy street drugs.

1287
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,770
And he has terrible financial problems.

1288
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:32,990
He can't afford the drugs.

1289
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,970
And he can't afford to send money to the hour of slack.

1290
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,270
He wants to be free, but the demons won't leave him be.

1291
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,210
He needs slack to set him free.

1292
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,110
Bob, you listening?

1293
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,810
I want you to come down.

1294
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,830
Cast him out all.

1295
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:49,130
Cast out the cancer, tuberculosis, tumors, arthritis, and bad checks from this man.

1296
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,070
From the crown of his head to the sole gland of his feet.

1297
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,170
Cast out the demons.

1298
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,290
Beat off the devil and set him free.

1299
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,770
I command this now in the name of Bob Dobbs, high hip hop to the church of the subject.

1300
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:58,990
I'm a genius.

1301
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,030
Help me somebody.

1302
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:00,610
Praise Bob.

1303
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,310
She ain't got no legs.

1304
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:01,990
My legs are on fire.

1305
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,530
Pull the lever.

1306
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,350
Down you go.

1307
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,210
Call 828-9500.

1308
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,970
This is the last chance.

1309
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,530
This is literally your last hope for planet Earth.

1310
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,610
This, I mean, after this, friends, it's going to be it.

1311
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:16,770
I'm sorry.

1312
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,070
There's not much else we can do, I suppose.

1313
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,810
It's just going to be...

1314
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:22,890
I guess they don't care.

1315
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:24,910
I guess it's time for us to sell out.

1316
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,010
Yeah, I guess that's what we ought to do is just start playing.

1317
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,430
Yeah, let's give up, folks.

1318
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,670
All we got is this few thousand...

1319
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,250
Look at this.

1320
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:38,370
Paul Newell, Tom, Jim Trotten, Brian Lunch.

1321
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,050
No, see, I'm going to have all these phone numbers.

1322
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:45,010
I'm going to be able to send some genius, crazy people after you in no time at all.

1323
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,650
And I'm going to get out of the way here in just one minute for...

1324
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:49,610
Oh, you're going to...

1325
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,550
Ron is going to let me go.

1326
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,510
But, friends, you can keep calling.

1327
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,910
The pledge drive ends at midnight.

1328
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,510
But you can keep calling in.

1329
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,890
We'll take your money.

1330
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,390
We will take your money tomorrow.

1331
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,390
We'll take your money the next day.

1332
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,330
We'll take the money from George Schaefer.

1333
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:10,470
We'll take the money from all these fine people who've called in and who I know.

1334
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,530
I know this time they're going to make...

1335
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,770
They're going to send that check in.

1336
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:17,790
And when they do, they're going to write our slack on there so that nobody gets mixed up.

1337
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,370
Friends, I was just kidding.

1338
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:26,330
We don't have to sell out the conspiracy this time and start playing the, you know, according to the...

1339
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,350
What do they call it?

1340
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,930
The program that comes down the computer from Seattle.

1341
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,770
That's how the other stations have to do it.

1342
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,090
No, no, no, no.

1343
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:39,930
Just plain folks like just ordinary, regular old Ivan Stank get on here and have a radio show.

1344
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,750
Ron Lindsey coming up right behind me.

1345
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:50,010
Those of you ready to tape Dr. Lindsey's wonderful show, the Soul Oldies show, I want you to...

1346
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:55,410
I want you, friends, you can write to Bob at P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas.

1347
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,490
But you can send your money.

1348
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:58,930
Send your money to K-N-O-N.

1349
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:07,070
And I don't see that box number in front of me, but you can call 828-9500 or 823-7490.

1350
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:11,430
And you shall have slack, dear friends.

1351
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,670
You shall have slack.

1352
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:13,970
Hi.

1353
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:14,870
How you doing?

1354
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,010
I'm real glad to see you.

1355
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,270
The news is coming up next.

1356
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:18,590
We're going to cut away.

1357
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,370
Straight away afterward.

1358
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:20,170
Hold it.

1359
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:20,590
He's gone.

1360
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:22,590
There's going to be no...

1361
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,770
Cut to the band.

1362
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,550
The bands are getting ready for another one.

1363
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,230
No, they'll do the news.

1364
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:27,230


1365
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:27,230


1366
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:27,230


1367
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:27,310
Hope you enjoyed the video.

1368
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:27,550
We'll be back after this.

1369
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1370
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1371
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1372
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1373
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1374
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1375
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1376
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1377
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1378
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1379
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1380
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1381
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1382
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1383
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1384
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1385
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1386
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1387
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1388
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1389
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1390
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1391
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1392
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550


1393
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,550
