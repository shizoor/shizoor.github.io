1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,900
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call the advent of the angelic host.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,840
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world, only his predictions are just a little different.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:38,280
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact, the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them, will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,480
And believe it or not, plenty of people, 4,000 of them so far and more every day, have already joined up.

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,040
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,400
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,980
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,340
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,420
Remember now, it's no surprise, if I should be found dead someday, I'll think that you were in the way.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,340
Oh, gimme Bob.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,040
Confusing that face.

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,200
With my own.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,640
Can't remember my place.

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,820
Bob's Rude.

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:31,280
My role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold on that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,880
When the men from Planet X arrive.

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,740
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous, it may sound ridiculous to many of the believers out there.

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,520
Are you saying they're all nuts, all those people?

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,260
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,240
Planes fly!

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,840
Are we controlled by secret forces?

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,800
Do you ever get the feeling that...

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,500
Free will is a joke?

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,100
Do people think you're strange?

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,380
Do you?

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Then you may be on the right track.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,880
Give me slack or give me food or kill me!

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,880
Give me slack or give me food or kill me!

29
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,260
Kill me!

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,080
Kill me!

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,820
Goodbye.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,820
Goodbye.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,340
Goodbye.

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,280
Goodbye.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,280
Goodbye, Earth.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,920
Night, little monkeys in your cage.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,580
Night, night.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:41,880
All your great skyscrapers, your achievements, your mighty books and discoveries, your symphonies, your armies, your concentration camps.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,140
All of it was...

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,440
Your indoor plumbing, your toiletries and your mini...

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,980
As a wink.

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,040
Delicacies that no one...

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,760
A tiny spark.

44
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,680
Starving.

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,140
Dying.

46
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,820
Dying.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:50,820


48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:59,540
Flying ember in the middle of thousands and billions of light years of empty, cold space.

49
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,340
Glowing stinky hole in your third eye.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,500
You are about as important as a cork in the ocean, my friend.

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,120
Think of a cockroach, if you would.

52
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,180
I don't know if you want to think of one for too long,

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,360
but just imagine the revulsion you feel when you swat one and brush it away from yourselves.

54
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,520
Think of yourself as a mere cockroach compared to these weird exes, archons, whatever the hell they are.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,120
They don't notice you. They don't care about you.

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,100
If you happen to hitch a ride and they don't swat you off, then count yourself lucky.

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,120
But don't think you're some kind of a big deal

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,540
just because God or some aliens happen to pick you up by the scruff of your neck

59
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,300
and show you a thing or two.

60
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,800
They're in there with you. They're in the room with you.

61
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,120
You can't see them. You can't smell them.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,140
You can't taste them.

63
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,060
But they're in the room with you.

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,880
And they blend with the walls, with the CDs, with the vinyl rack,

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,020
with the digital, with everything, with the microphone.

66
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,360
And with the airwaves.

67
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:15,520
It's the hiss buried in the tape that we use to carry the code, the coded signal.

68
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,440
But it's the only way we can stop them.

69
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,760
The human mind.

70
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,220
The human mind is capable of receiving and transmitting radio signals.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,380
It has no way of converting this knowledge or energy into a practical use.

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,400
However, the brain has in it, in some miraculous way,

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,800
the ability to transmit and convert and receive radio signals.

74
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:47,720
We use your brain as an envelope to send our letters to the others.

75
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,360
They are our course.

76
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
We are our correspondents with a world you could never fathom.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,000
It's square to your round.

78
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,040
It's cheesy to your musky.

79
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,520
It's black to your white.

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,620
It's green to your red.

81
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,460
It's out of focus to your sharp image.

82
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,020
Do the rat in the cheese.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
The cheese is the universe.

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,500
Do the rat, baby.

85
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,240
Do it one more time.

86
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,460
Everybody love to watch you do the rat.

87
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,800
Do the rat.

88
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,180
Do the rat.

89
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,840
The rat.

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,900
The rat.

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,040
The rat.

92
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

93
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,840
it's the Ask Dr. Hal Show, live on radio.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,980
Well, not really.

95
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,180
It's just I happen to be visiting.

96
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,260
I was passing through your state,

97
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,880
so I stopped in to pay a visit to your burgeoning community

98
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,760
to see how you are doing in this neck of the woods.

99
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,440
Yes.

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,700
See if the swirling demonic forces of the conspiracy

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,680
have managed to erode away the last vestiges of subgenius thought.

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,520
Because some outlying communities are just that,

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,300
outlying, benighted, bereft,

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,640
struggling in darkness thicker than tar.

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,880
And all we want to do is loosen it up a little,

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,780
provide a lack of obstruction so the flow can be eased,

107
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,500
so really,

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
relaxation can take place.

109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,820
The true communication of letting go.

110
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,300
Oh, you've got to let it all go.

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,320
Everything.

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,900
This entire earth and all that it inherits.

113
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,720
The mountains, the trees, the animal life and plant life,

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
the sights and smells of earth,

115
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,680
all to be gone, wiped out in a single fiery convulsion.

116
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,140
Not of nature.

117
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,640
But of advanced science.

118
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,400
Perhaps perpetuated by a perverted and senescent will.

119
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,500
So old it does not even fathom its own purposes.

120
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,700
Yes, this is coming.

121
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,060
Coming, my friends.

122
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,000
Coming for you and for me.

123
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,780
None of us shall escape this rain of fire

124
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,160
except those who have performed one simple act.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,360
As simple as the ablution of a baby's bombast.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,380
All you need to do is send in your $30.

127
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,840
And now it's so close, I don't know if the mail can accommodate this.

128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,000
I really don't know.

129
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,220
It may be too late.

130
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,700
I may be speaking to an audience of the damned.

131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,160
No, you're speaking to an audience on a community station

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,140
where we would never have a call to action or a specific amount.

133
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,400
Well, I can surely refer to symbolic words in the book of the...

134
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,560
Yes, when Hal refers to...

135
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,360
In the Christian Bible, I can talk of 30 pieces of silver,

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,500
the tares that are thrown in the field to be cultivated for later,

137
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,420
or the chaff to be swept into the furnace and burned at the final day.

138
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:11,160
That great day when the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne.

139
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,880
The seas give up their dead and monsters walk the earth.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,800
Worse than we got now, I mean.

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,900
Yes, it's all going to happen,

142
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,860
and there's not one gosh darn thing you can do about it,

143
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,400
even right here on community radio.

144
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,980
Nonetheless, it's good to be able to come in, hang up my hat,

145
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,300
put my feet up on the end iron, light up a good cheroot.

146
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, I guess we can't do that.

147
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,860
And commune as gentlemen in these, our last days on a planet

148
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,580
which was once this whole quadrant of the universe's most promising experiment.

149
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,700
Yes, there were...

150
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,920
Great hopes for a little earth when it began.

151
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,880
Just a twinkling spot of light in God's beard,

152
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,300
nestling within the heliopause,

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,620
one of those precious little precocious inner rocky worlds,

154
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,420
shunning the gas giants and their gravitational and magnetic barriers,

155
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,500
coasting in close to the sun and mooching its life-giving warmth.

156
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,080
Well, those soft days are coming to an end, buddy.

157
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,640
Sure enough.

158
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
There's not going to be...

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:19,880


160
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,260
There's not going to be no more whales and quails and any of that stuff.

161
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,640
The snails or potatoes.

162
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,320
Snails, they're going to be gone, too.

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,760
No braille, either.

164
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,480
No more need for braille.

165
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,800
No more staying in the dark using the fondness you have.

166
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
It's going to be too high in the sky.

167
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,980
The sun will be blue.

168
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,100
Too high.

169
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,400
The sun will be blue indeed as it ratchets toward the far end of the spectrum.

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,920
But you blew it, my friend.

171
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,660
What?

172
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,780
How is that?

173
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,120
You didn't join the church of the subgenius in time.

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,620
But, Pastor Stang, I thought we weren't supposed to mention that kind of thing here on the community.

175
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,040
We're not telling them to join the church.

176
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,640
They've already blown it.

177
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,300
It's too late.

178
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,480
There's no call to action here.

179
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,020
That's right.

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,580
The community radio people, if they want to get on your case,

181
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,220
they can do that.

182
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,160
As they're charred cinders blowing over a field of ashes 7,000 miles wide,

183
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,980
they can't do much about our...

184
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:19,760
Our...

185
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,280
Our violation of these petty rules of radio.

186
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,900
Right to our commercial considerations are of little value when you're atomized.

187
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,500
We've got a lot of ashes to haul, friends.

188
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,920
And a lot of atoms are our future consumers.

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,880
Unfortunately.

190
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,900
I hate to dismiss the idea out of hand, but since my hands are glowing right now,

191
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,460
I thought I might remind us all the fact that we're being pelted, or at least pionized,

192
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
with numerous sprays already.

193
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,720
And I don't know if they're ready to...

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,260
To...

195
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,320
To...

196
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,320
Spring a leak, or if things are going to happen, or...

197
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
My, them cosmic rays get you from any angle, wherever you are.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
You get interpenetrated.

199
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,360
You don't want to bend over in front of one, that's for sure.

200
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,720
Well, no need.

201
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
They'll get you from that direction, too.

202
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,620
And there's cameras everywhere that'll film it.

203
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Yes, that's true.

204
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,500
But there's not beings everywhere that are interested enough to watch it, you know.

205
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,600
Thank goodness.

206
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
That's the problem.

207
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,140
Other machines are watching our misdoings as we give it the finger.

208
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,660
Well, that's their job.

209
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,240
They've been programmed to take a peek at the unsanitary side of humanity.

210
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,860
And to them, it's just another epiphenomenon to record in their infinitely expanding memory banks.

211
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,740
It is a sad thought, boy, and there are plenty that you just erudited right there.

212
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,460
Well, I know that's true, but, you know...

213
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,720
They're all true.

214
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,180
The old rules are coming to an end, and the new ones will begin presently.

215
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,060
The end of the term will have come,

216
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,420
and school will be let out.

217
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,060
We will rush out into the glorious recess of the afterworld.

218
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,160
They're coming to take us away!

219
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,540
Ha-ha!

220
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,120
Hee-hee!

221
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,820
Yes, they are, and they will take us away.

222
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,540
I have my stateroom reserved, and I think we are all down with the new luggage rules.

223
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,400
The lack of a bag fee, I think, is quite progressive for these UFOs.

224
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,660
Well, for some of the people who need too much oxygen,

225
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,040
I don't know if it's a very considerate idea,

226
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,920
but it'll probably still have to go into the memo book in the files.

227
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, yes, some drone in the central offices will put it there.

228
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,120
I just handed Hal the very first filled-out subgenius membership card.

229
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,120
Number one.

230
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,260
You know, even Hitler's party membership was number eight.

231
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,360
But this is number one, man, and I just touched it with my sweating fingers.

232
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,640
It's filled out with a manual typewriter.

233
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,040
It has...

234
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,040


235
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,160
It has my human name.

236
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,980
I didn't even...

237
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,540
I hadn't even become...

238
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,840
I hadn't gotten my free name of Ivan Stang.

239
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,740
I had my simple old name of Mr. Smith.

240
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,060
Read the obverse.

241
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,220
Of Dallas, Texas.

242
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,460
Yes, Dallas, Texas.

243
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,900
Oh, well, here's what I have.

244
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,080
Not at all of a similar vintage.

245
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,220
Dr. Hal here has...

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,640
Be it known that Dr. Hal is a genuine pope.

247
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,940
Oh, this is an original...

248
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,780
This is an original Discordian pope card, isn't it?

249
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,220
Yes.

250
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,640
Wow.

251
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,280
Not a, you know, not a subgenius one or anything classy like that.

252
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,140
Do you have a miter and a hat and everything, or...?

253
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,480
Well, I brought them, but they're not here at the radio station.

254
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,560
I was...

255
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,580
Have you absconded with the wealth of all the parishes yet?

256
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,100
That's to happen at the moment, the special, specific moment.

257
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,900
7 o'clock a.m., July 5th, 1998.

258
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,820
Will this be 1998, my friend?

259
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,620
At last.

260
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,840
Is this month, is today June?

261
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,700
Or whenever you hear this...

262
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,460
The leafy month of June.

263
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,180
Is it the day you think it is?

264
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,060
Is this even the planet that you thought it was?

265
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,420
We can't be sure of anything.

266
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,640
Well, you must be familiar with Scientific American's new research on the substitution of Mars and Earth,

267
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,240
which is a hot thing in science.

268
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,960
I heard a little bit about that.

269
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,940
But why would you want to...

270
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,900
And we were ahead of them.

271
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Dr. Onan Kanabite wrote his first essay on that in 2005.

272
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,900
2005.

273
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,900
They're worried that it may destabilize the whole system, the solar system, this switching,

274
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,060
because they do have effects on the other planets in the disk.

275
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,160
It won't be the first time it's been done.

276
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,020
Just over periods of eons and so forth.

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,600
But why do we want to substitute anything for...

278
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
You know, it's like being in a Chinese restaurant.

279
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,600
And there are no substitutions.

280
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,260
I think we've failed on a way out of there.

281
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,800
Well, then they're just not going to get your business from then on.

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,760
Mars is...

283
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,160
If they won't accommodate you in your Chinese menu,

284
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,020
then the Martians will have to go home.

285
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,180
Oh.

286
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,440
It's just like...

287
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,340
We are the Martians.

288
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,100
...90 million miles to Earth.

289
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,120
What is the basic premise?

290
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,420
Was there a migration or the actual orbit shift?

291
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,020
The conspiracy used up the planet we were on last

292
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,800
and switched orbits and took over this one that we're on,

293
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,580
which used to be called Mars.

294
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,440
And now everyone complains that the resources are so meager

295
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,300
and everything seems to be used up.

296
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,900
Well, it's quite easy to see that now that we're on this old rusty Rust Belt planet,

297
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,160
we no longer have the lush opportunities we once did

298
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,220
when life was green and growing

299
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,620
and the devil could take the hot most,

300
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,560
the sweet, salty zest of life.

301
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,000
I think I heard that devil coming now.

302
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,360
Is that him?

303
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,340
Or is it Bob?

304
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,780
Oh, no!

305
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,540
Or is it the men from Planet X?

306
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,900
Or the men from Planet X?

307
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,560
I have a moment here.

308
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
I explain satanic bacon

309
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,520
and how it grills so easy

310
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,620
and goes down so fresh and moist

311
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,460
you'd wish it was Tuesday all over again.

312
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,860
Ah.

313
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,940
Ah, Scrapple.

314
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm looking forward to it.

315
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,800
Oh, long pick.

316
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,660
Are you Philly bound or are you just a big cheese?

317
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,860
Uh, Doc, uh, Mr. Sister.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,040
Reverend Dr. I.D.

319
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,020
Dr. Mr. Sister picked up some Scrapple for the X-Day event.

320
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,140
Boo-coo Scrapple, as I hear it.

321
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
At the store we call Giant Bagel.

322
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,100
Well, what the Eastern folks really love,

323
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,440
well, it's later on in the summer and stuff,

324
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,020
is to grill your Scrapple and make toasts.

325
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,780
And have big, slopping, huge, homegrown tomatoes

326
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,200
on top of it and mayo.

327
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,120
It's delightful.

328
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,820
To mix healthy food with Scrapple?

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
I've never heard of such a thing.

330
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
We'll have to try that sometime.

331
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
It might fool the body into accommodating more.

332
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,760
For those listeners who, in other realms,

333
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
who don't know what Scrapple is,

334
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
you know what they make hot dogs out of?

335
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,640
Hot dogs.

336
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,380
And you don't even want to think about it?

337
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
Well, Scrapple is made from what they won't even use

338
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
in hot dogs.

339
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,040
It's time to stretch and fetch

340
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,120
and visit our snack bar.

341
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,300
Hot dogs.

342
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,800
Visit our snacks.

343
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,980
Hot dog, it's a wiener.

344
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,820
Soft drinks, all colors.

345
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,020
You're saying that the average wiener

346
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,400
accommodates all sorts of colors

347
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,360
in its spectrum of light?

348
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,740
A coruscating rainbow of iridescent evil.

349
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,600
Oh, well, that's the least of our worries right now.

350
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,420
Ha ha ha!

351
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:17,820
Yes, I...

352
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,620
Impugning overwhelming good is going to sucker us all.

353
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,560
Well, we're just going to have to have a new...

354
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,500
a new scale of aesthetic values.

355
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,140
The poisonous lime greens

356
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,500
and head-ache-inducing vibrating oranges

357
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,060
will become the daily color of the fabric of our lives

358
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,020
in the new unthinkable existence

359
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,040
we all are now rocketing toward.

360
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,920
Oh, what a dire thought in your prescription.

361
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,300
Oh, you'll like it. It'll be fun.

362
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,760
Just like these so-called sex goddesses,

363
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,560
if you saw them in any other...

364
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,600
context, you might recoil, blanch, shriek,

365
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,900
or attempt to claw out your eyes

366
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,780
to cut out the hideous sight

367
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,760
of their undulating chitinous mandibles,

368
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,580
et cetera, et cetera.

369
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,280
But on the board, the saucers,

370
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,720
you will frenziedly copulate with these babes

371
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
because it's all chemical.

372
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,620
It's a chemical signal that you can't escape.

373
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,880
One calibrated to you

374
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,860
and your personal needs in this new world

375
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,480
all the way to planetary...

376
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:17,920
X.

377
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,700
And then in the waiting room

378
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,940
at the Port Authority building...

379
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,780
I beg your pardon?

380
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,860
I said, that's right, little shapers.

381
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,420
No genitalia necessary.

382
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,080
Act now while offer lasts.

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,740
It's like the Matrix inside the Matrix.

384
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah.

385
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,860
In the real world, you have to eat recycled roach crap.

386
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,720
In the Matrix, you can have the finest lobster

387
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,840
in a restaurant.

388
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,300
In the Matrix of the Matrix,

389
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,520
you can be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

390
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,580
with J.R.R. Martin.

391
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,280
Or Bob Dobbs himself.

392
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,980
Oh, yes, that makes it all worthwhile, doesn't it?

393
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,980
Sitting at the right hand of Bob,

394
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,980
each single one of us will be sitting right next to Bob.

395
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,220
Yes, that's right.

396
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,520
Farewell, Earth geometry.

397
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,600
...quality of the place where we are going.

398
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,560
If we think the wrong thoughts,

399
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,040
perhaps the wrong sex goddess will appear

400
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,280
and devour our needless genitalia.

401
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,300
You'll enjoy it just the same.

402
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,400
Enjoyment is the name of the game.

403
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,580
You'll enjoy it whether you want to or not.

404
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,380
You will.

405
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,040
It's chemical.

406
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,220
It's locked into you so that you are bound to enjoy it.

407
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,620
And it's so much better than what's happening to everybody else.

408
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,420
It's lump smoking good.

409
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,060
That's right.

410
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,280
You may be a smoking lump by the end of the voyage,

411
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,080
but you will be an enlightened lump

412
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,840
ready to participate up through the various sub-universes

413
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,640
in future heavens.

414
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,160
The polycosmos.

415
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,580
I didn't know a polycosmos was promised.

416
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,940
I'm sorry I'm so lax in my...

417
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,500
It just is.

418
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,320
Just take a gander at the...

419
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,040
It already is.

420
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,340
...afterlife diagram in Revelation X,

421
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,080
which shows clearly the pathway that one will follow

422
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,420
after reaching the port authority building on Planet X.

423
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,980
That diagram happened to have been drawn by Dr. Howell.

424
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,120
Yes, I drew it, and I was intending to produce a color version,

425
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,140
but then Philo came over to my house

426
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,780
and without even asking my permission,

427
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,960
rolled it up and said,

428
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,600
oh, I'll just take this away and make a copy of it.

429
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,880
Then he lost it.

430
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
You're kidding.

431
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,860
I can easily believe that.

432
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,040
I can easily believe that.

433
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,180
And I couldn't tell the tale one more sorry time

434
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,540
of what he did to my computer desktop.

435
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,780
He decided he could improve on my desktop arrangement one day.

436
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,360
I will never let him forget that.

437
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,740
What did he do to your desktop?

438
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,060
He cleaned it up.

439
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,260
Oh, well.

440
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,680
By his standards.

441
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,000
Cleaned all those annoying images out of it.

442
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,520
His idea of cleaning it up.

443
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,580
As if I didn't know that there was an autopilot,

444
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,500
clean-up thing.

445
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,320
This was back in the days before desktops reached out

446
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,400
and cleaned you up.

447
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,220
Oh, it says,

448
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,680
you have unused items on your desktop.

449
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,380
Okay, I don't care.

450
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,740
Click.

451
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,360
Pop.

452
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,880
You have unused light.

453
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey, I just...

454
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,920
It's actually telling you to take care of the detritus

455
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,300
through your coffee and your cigarette machine.

456
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,920
Oh, so blame it on the vending machines.

457
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,220
Well, you can blame them around here.

458
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,380
I went with $1.25.

459
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,980
I tried to get some diet soda.

460
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,500
All they had was diet Pepsi.

461
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,000
Then they didn't have it.

462
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,540
Oh, no.

463
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,580
Then they didn't have water.

464
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,280
They don't have anything,

465
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,720
and they won't give me my money back.

466
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,100
It sticks inside the machine.

467
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,120
So you can see...

468
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,500
I wondered why you came back empty-handed.

469
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,720
The conspiracy fights to the end,

470
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
to the very last end.

471
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,140
It will wriggle and thrash

472
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,740
like a snake whose head has been removed.

473
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,840
There's still life in its sinuous coiling fold.

474
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,720
But life is flowing out of it,

475
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,440
and it will soon be as stiff

476
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,340
as its prehistoric ancestors.

477
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,220
Yes.

478
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,200
Look at Hitler's feet.

479
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,480
Yes.

480
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


481
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


482
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


483
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


484
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


485
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


486
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


487
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


488
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,580


489
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:47,620
It's a rock.

490
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,620
Yes.

491
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,180
Now, Doctor, how did you do like in the movies

492
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,300
where you slam into the machine and kick it?

493
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,960
But this is not my radio station.

494
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,140
I could do a full-blown Homer Simpson on it,

495
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,580
but I just arrived at this place,

496
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,980
and I give a good account of myself

497
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,480
and not immediately start by trashing.

498
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,760
The lighting is nice there, too,

499
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,560
and it's pretty.

500
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,540
The walls are pink so that you don't argue

501
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,460
The money's still in there.

502
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,180
I can go hit it later

503
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,640
and try to get $1.25 back.

504
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,220
Try to get something back from the organization.

505
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,400
We should all try to do that.

506
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,340
Don't let them get away with murder.

507
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,720
But wouldn't you agree that the machines

508
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,580
are actually reading our minds,

509
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,960
taking our very thoughts

510
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,660
and using them as data to reconvert reality

511
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,020
and change our minds

512
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,040
and to make life miserable for us?

513
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,580
Pound away.

514
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,800
You guys, it's all yours.

515
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,340
Wow.

516
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,480
Ivan Stang's going to go and do battle

517
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,260
with that device right now

518
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,440
and strapped into the back of that mechanical mother.

519
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,740
There is a special solenoid

520
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,700
that'll keep him punching

521
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,260
until he's drunk with power,

522
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,880
as we classically say.

523
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,700
He's strapped in right now at this moment.

524
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,080
He left his post,

525
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,300
and he went there to start punching that machine.

526
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,580
But still, you know,

527
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,760
the only victory would be getting the money back

528
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,280
since they have no drinking water

529
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,120
or diet soda or anything else,

530
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,720
only heavily sugared death pop.

531
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,260
Well, remember,

532
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,480
remember in Dr. Strangelove

533
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,940
when Kenan Wynn went insane at the very end there

534
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,720
and shot the machine.

535
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,620
Colonel Batguano.

536
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,360
He was asked to...

537
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,920
He took all the money because the damned...

538
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,540
I'm not supposed to mention the name

539
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,620
on a non-commercial station.

540
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,220
Soda Pop Company was, you know,

541
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,840
did the wrong thing, and so he deserved...

542
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,380
Well, he said that Colonel Mandrake

543
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,940
would have to answer to that company

544
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,060
because he...

545
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,240
That's right, that's right.

546
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,280
Mandrake asked him to shoot the machine

547
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,360
to get the change out

548
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,240
so he could complete his mission.

549
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,080
He could complete his telephone call

550
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,900
to the White House in Washington, D.C.

551
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,820
That was correct after he had learned

552
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,160
about purity of essence.

553
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,420
So what, it just snickered and leered

554
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,640
and buzzed at you?

555
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
You're going to have to answer for this.

556
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,200
I was going to say,

557
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,920
you're going to have to answer

558
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,280
to the Coca-Cola Company.

559
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,940
That's right.

560
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,560
Yeah, I guess only in this case

561
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,740
the Pepsi-Cola Company.

562
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,280
It said...

563
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,260
It actually said,

564
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,940
do not rock or tilt.

565
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,360
Well, Mr. High-Voluntan, High-Minded.

566
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,140
Here goes a whole cultural movement

567
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,240
starting in the late 90s.

568
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,580
Yeah.

569
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,800
In the 1940s and going up to today.

570
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,960
You can't rock or tilt.

571
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,420
When I tried to...

572
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,920
I started pushing buttons on it.

573
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,440
That's what it said.

574
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,000
It said warning, eh?

575
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,280
My sensors indicate

576
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,660
an intruder is present.

577
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,800
This machine is too high-tech, you know.

578
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,540
I think we should take

579
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,240
a Phillips screwdriver

580
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,620
and take it down to the side.

581
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:34,880
Danger, danger.

582
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,080
Not too late.

583
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
You got it coming to you.

584
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
So a bend-over, a bend-over machine.

585
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,040
Well, on the other hand, once again...

586
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,660
Danger, danger, Will Robinson.

587
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,660
This is hurting my...

588
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,620
Now he's got my name wrong.

589
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,300
The thing is...

590
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,540
My power cells are extremely low.

591
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,060
Oh, that was the problem.

592
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,420
It did say it was out.

593
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes, it said that to me.

594
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,900
It's out of everything that it's selling.

595
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,540
Then why does it keep the money?

596
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Exactly.

597
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,680
Well, I know why.

598
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,800
Same reason we do.

599
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,000
Now, did you notice

600
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,420
there was a tunnel in the basement?

601
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,460
It just doesn't seem fair somehow.

602
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,640
But when you walked away from the machine,

603
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,740
did you or did you not notice

604
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,620
a strange sensation,

605
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,200
a feeling that it was already...

606
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,020
It was only June 15th.

607
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,900
Yesterday was the 27th.

608
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,820
And today was...

609
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,260
And that you had to get the papers done

610
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,280
before Dr. Mesmer came back.

611
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,220
And then you realized

612
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,680
that the machine had probably been...

613
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,240
How could a machine lie to you?

614
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,860
They don't lie.

615
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,100
They don't really...

616
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,160
They can't fabricate

617
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,520
because they don't create.

618
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,680
It's an instrument of the con.

619
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,840
They are designed by humans

620
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,720
and they interact with humans.

621
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,860
And this can include...

622
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,600
I think that...

623
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,220
I think that cut machine is coming down the hall.

624
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,780
It's a Pepsi machine.

625
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,840
The Pepsi...

626
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,460
It's...

627
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:47,960
It's...

628
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
It's rolling forward.

629
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,320
It's rocking back and forth,

630
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,540
rolling towards us.

631
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,560
Well, we're safe here.

632
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:52,800
I thought it was just a gun

633
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,900
that was there most of the time.

634
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,100
No.

635
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,320
It seems to have a built-in

636
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,120
flamethrower.

637
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,480
Shoot it with a laser.

638
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,840
Or a lighter.

639
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,300
I told you that thing

640
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,200
was too high-tech.

641
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,080
Why couldn't they just have

642
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,220
a cooler with a refrigerator coil

643
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,140
and you put 25 cents in it?

644
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,860
Oh, well.

645
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,140
Look at the vibrations in my water.

646
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,860
Look at that.

647
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
It's feeling the glass

648
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,260
with its little extended palps there.

649
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,100
It's trying to figure out

650
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,700
how to get in.

651
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,060
Somebody put a flower

652
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,700
in the gun barrel.

653
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,240
It was only...

654
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,240


655
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,920
It's only a dollar 25.

656
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,400
Look at this thing.

657
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,880
Well, and you see,

658
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,380
I thought I had better quit

659
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,720
while I was not too far behind.

660
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,540
This whole thing is similar

661
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,260
to what's happening.

662
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,900
I've broken my glasses.

663
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,340
I've had various disasters.

664
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,440
And it's just because

665
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,960
the conspiracy is gearing up

666
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
for the final struggle.

667
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,620
And now they've sent

668
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,980
this ridiculous rolling refrigerator.

669
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,680
I think we're fairly safe in here

670
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,460
and we can give it the old raspberry.

671
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,400
Although we're going to have to

672
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,840
get out of here

673
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,240
when the show starts.

674
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,820
The show is over.

675
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,740
Food is not allowed in the studio.

676
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,800
Yes, it should know that.

677
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,760
Have you ever heard of

678
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,500
Purity of Essence, Mandrake?

679
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,500
Why?

680
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,680
Have you ever heard of

681
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,360
Purity of Mandrake, Hemlock?

682
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,880
Have you ever heard of

683
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
Mandrake, Hemlock?

684
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,860
Heimlich?

685
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,400
Unheimlich Maneuver.

686
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
Heimlich Maneuver.

687
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,100
He was one of the first

688
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,640
in the movement.

689
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,900
That was the very first

690
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,580
card carrier.

691
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,740
And do you remember

692
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,420
the Fuhrer was number eight?

693
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,180
Unheimlich, yes.

694
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,240
He was in a Fuhrer

695
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,900
about that.

696
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,840
He liquidated

697
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,600
that later date

698
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,780
Heimlich Maneuver.

699
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
On the other hand,

700
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,400
that's part of the whole deal

701
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,520
with those natty Nazis

702
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,760
and their uniforms.

703
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,120
The idea was that

704
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,920
the main guy

705
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,720
would appear to be

706
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,080
not really main

707
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,320
but slightly standing

708
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,240
off to the side.

709
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,420
So everyone got

710
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,720
a super spiffy Nazi uniform

711
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,800
except for Hitler

712
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
who was rather plain,

713
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,760
you know,

714
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,180
as if he didn't need one.

715
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,100
And he wasn't

716
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,300
party member number one.

717
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,880
He was party member number two.

718
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:45,880


719
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,300
He was party member number eight.

720
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,600
Yeah, sure he was.

721
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
Well, I wonder

722
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
who else in this room

723
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,220
would have a little bit

724
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,960
in common with

725
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,500
good old Reverend Adolf.

726
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,680
I'm not sure

727
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,000
I understand your meaning.

728
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,380
They saved Hitler's mustache.

729
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,760
An Allied Artists production.

730
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm a mere reverend,

731
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,540
not a doctor nor a pope.

732
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,120
I just serve under Bob.

733
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,100
That's very good.

734
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,600
When you sit next to me

735
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
at the X-Day stage

736
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,620
during the live hours of Slack,

737
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,940
you're usually dressed

738
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,340
in a,

739
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,120
you know,

740
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,120


741
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,340
a,

742
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,580
a,

743
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:15,760
a,

744
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:15,800
a,

745
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:15,840
a,

746
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:15,840


747
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,960
a,

748
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,380
sort of a,

749
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,440
a gentleman's

750
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,320
suit,

751
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,440
a uniform,

752
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,940
whereas I'm sitting there

753
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,320
with some

754
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,640
threadbare Bob t-shirt.

755
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Well, this year,

756
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,920
unless it's too hot,

757
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,340
we may have

758
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,160
Papa Joe Mama

759
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,840
sitting there

760
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,440
in a full uniformed

761
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,640
splendid...

762
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,140
That's right.

763
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,100
That's right.

764
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,060
Papa Joe Mama,

765
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,380
we have just learned

766
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,040
this week,

767
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,620
will be

768
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,720
at X-Day 14.

769
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,920
to bring his

770
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,340
Schutzstaffel special

771
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,900
with the,

772
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,820
the shiny boots

773
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,540
and high-crowned hat,

774
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,860
you know,

775
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
that'll really shock

776
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,500
the Bobbies.

777
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,420
I love the music as well.

778
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:48,720
Yes.

779
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,680
It makes me weep.

780
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,080
They have complained.

781
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,080
We've gotten complaints

782
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,520
when Papa Joe showed up

783
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,580
in his full authentic

784
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,740
SS uniform.

785
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,680
Yes, but that was

786
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,520
at Brushwood.

787
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,080
Wisteria hasn't been

788
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,280
exposed to this side

789
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,620
of the Church of the Subgenius.

790
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
There's no hysteria

791
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,320
at Wisteria.

792
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,780
We're going to show them

793
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,340
the strange range

794
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,360
of subgeniuses.

795
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,080
You know,

796
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,840
they're not all

797
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,680
peaceful,

798
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,040
cud-chewing hippies

799
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,860
by a long shot.

800
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,420
The Reverend

801
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,980
Sturmund Drang.

802
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,060
Yes.

803
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,580
No, that was

804
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,480
Stang and Drummond.

805
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,260
Well, it still

806
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,040
sounds like

807
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,500
they're pure police.

808
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,240
They copied

809
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,920
that original

810
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,860
Two Cool Guys Club.

811
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,360
They were two salesmen

812
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,200
ranging the country,

813
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,900
drummers,

814
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,080
as they were called.

815
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,080
And there were

816
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,860
some brain clones

817
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,840
thrown into the mix

818
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,920
down in Peru

819
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,580
or somewhere

820
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,460
in South America

821
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,660
as far as anyone knows.

822
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,880
Look, I'll get back

823
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,500
to you in half an hour.

824
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,040
I've got to remove

825
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,460
my bus.

826
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,020
Ayahuasca

827
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,880
all over the place.

828
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,740
Well,

829
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,740
I guess

830
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,240
we all need

831
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,460
to get in shape,

832
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,800
you know,

833
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,800
do your exercises,

834
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,880
get prepped

835
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,660
because it'll be

836
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,820
strenuous to slide

837
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,760
over the spillway

838
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,200
into the new world

839
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,960
that's coming.

840
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,120
Sure will.

841
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,120
We'll be like

842
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,900
those tiny little

843
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,500
hyundais

844
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,340
in the great tsunami.

845
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,680
Yes,

846
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,960
tossed away

847
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,800
like some kids

848
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,380
wound up a car.

849
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,700
The raw power

850
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,300
of nature

851
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,900
against the

852
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,760
pitiable power

853
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,320
of man

854
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,560
or woman.

855
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,400
Yep.

856
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,580
It's,

857
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:14,680
uh,

858
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,480
nothing I would

859
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,060
like to be

860
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,800
in front of.

861
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,660
The powerful

862
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,020
hyundais.

863
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,460
I don't remember

864
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,120
you in front

865
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,580
of this place

866
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:20,920
before.

867
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,140
What are you doing

868
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,560
there standing

869
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,280
with that weird

870
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,020
fez with the

871
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,080
one eyeball in it?

872
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,620
Well,

873
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,180
you got something

874
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,080
you want to say

875
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,300
to me?

876
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,620
Hey,

877
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:27,860
look,

878
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,180
listen,

879
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,600
see,

880
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:28,980
now watch.

881
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,880
Get that hand

882
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,560
away from your

883
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,880
pocket.

884
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,220
You holding

885
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,500
a heater?

886
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,240
No,

887
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,860
I was just

888
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,780
easing myself

889
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,220
there.

890
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,740
Listen,

891
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,040
I wanted to say

892
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,840
this whole thing

893
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
is an opportunity

894
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,420
for us to

895
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,660
redeem the

896
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,580
entire mass

897
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,540
of mankind

898
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,220
in one,

899
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:44,800
final,

900
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,740
convulsive

901
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,380
moment.

902
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,060
Uh,

903
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,720
like the

904
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,580
inarticulomortis

905
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,100
doctrine,

906
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,780
where at the

907
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,340
end of a life

908
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,800
of sin,

909
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,620
you get to

910
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,060
go to heaven

911
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,440
anyway.

912
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,440
This is our

913
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,080
chance to

914
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,780
make it right

915
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,540
in the last

916
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,700
moments before

917
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,300
the entire

918
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,900
thing is

919
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,940
crushed and

920
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,860
blown away.

921
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,640
Unless,

922
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,160
of course,

923
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,980
someone does

924
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,840
go back in

925
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,940
time and

926
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,860
indeed kills

927
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,140
Bob and

928
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,980
conquers the

929
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,880
singular paradox

930
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,820
theory we've

931
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,640
encountered since

932
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
this last

933
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:12,980
week.

934
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,120
Oh,

935
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,720
we've tried

936
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,020
that,

937
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,380
Duff.

938
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:14,860
A thousand

939
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,460
times.

940
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,340
And it puts

941
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,100
wear and tear

942
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,500
on the

943
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,400
continuum,

944
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,120
and those

945
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,940
wormholes

946
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,360
look tatty

947
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,760
and not

948
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,200
fashionable.

949
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,240
Strings keep

950
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,840
popping up

951
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,660
everywhere and

952
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,240
popping down.

953
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,120
The gears

954
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,160
get loose

955
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,560
and the

956
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,580
mainsprings

957
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,560
sproings out.

958
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,300
Ever wonder

959
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,140
why things

960
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,840
look so

961
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,740
tacky these

962
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,220
days?

963
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,900
Half the

964
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,700

965
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,140

966
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,440

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,860

970

and subgenius

971
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:41,960
churches.

972
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,360

the son of

Zeus.

1005
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,920
Hercules.

1006
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,380
I told you

1007
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:21,680
before,

1008
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,720
this was the

1009
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,120
will of

1010
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,500
Thera,

1011
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,120
and also

1012
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,860
of Artemis,

1013
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,180
and the

1014
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,480
Welians.

1015
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,440
And remember,

1016
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:26,980
if we step

1017
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,860
back one foot

1018
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,240
from this

1019
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,440
shore,

1020
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,080
Greece will

1021
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,640
never retain

1022
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,100
its glory.

1023
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,000
What are you

1024
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,220
saying?

1025
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,820
Surely we

1026
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,300
cannot go

1027
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,060
against Hercules.

1028
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:33,540
Hmm,

1029
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:33,780
yes.

1030
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,120
I do not

1031
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,560
mock the

1032
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:35,940
Persians.

1033
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,640
I mock their

1034
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,160
breasts and

1035
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,580
their unusual

1036
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,220
haircuts.

1037
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,900
In the first

1038
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,240
place,

1039
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,700
what do they

1040
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,220
do thinking

1041
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,500
they are

1042
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,960
crossing the

1043
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,480
Aegean Sea

1044
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:41,840
the way they

1045
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,160
do think

1046
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,420
they are

1047
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:42,640
doing?

1048
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,940
Pardon me,

1049
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,440
my lord,

1050
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,120
a message

1051
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,560
from the

1052
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:45,820
octopus.

1053
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,840
This helmet

1054
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,480
makes me

1055
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,100
talk funny.

1056
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,220
Take off

1057
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,720
your helm

1058
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,020
in the

1059
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,520
presence of

1060
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:52,940
your lord.

1061
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,960
His head!

1062
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,260
I stand

1063
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,920
before you,

1064
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,260
sire,

1065
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,480
hoping that

1066
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,820
I can

1067
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,180
conquer

1068
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,880
Macedonia

1069
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,260
on my

1070
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,580
own.

1071
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,500
With this

1072
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,320
fragile foot

1073
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,680
and my

1074
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,260
lack of

1075
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,580
wings,

1076
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,540
I still

1077
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,100
I shall

1078
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,920
perform the

1079
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,460
task you

1080
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,000
ask of

1081
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,240
me.

1082
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,000
Give him

1083
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,680
wine and

1084
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,500
garum paste

1085
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,100
to eat,

1086
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,620
and let him

1087
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,680
recline upon

1088
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,440
this couch

1089
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,260
surrounded with

1090
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,120
soft Lydian

1091
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,840
airs.

1092
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,640
For he has

1093
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,340
done well.

1094
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,300
The luscious

1095
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,180
Lucian de

1096
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,820
Pazzarati

1097
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,180
is the

1098
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,820
queen of

1099
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,220
Herpiman.

1100
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,200
Hello,

1101
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,820
big boy.

1102
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,100
Stop!

1103
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,020
Do not

1104
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,540
touch that

1105
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:26,980
false

1106
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,580
enchantress.

1107
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,740
She is

1108
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,720
evil

1109
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,760
and corrupt.

1110
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,120
Look,

1111
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,360
sire,

1112
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,320
it is gold.

1113
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,440
Hermites is

1114
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,680
right.

1115
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,340
It's all

1116
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,820
gold.

1117
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,760
We're rich,

1118
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,040
sire.

1119
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,500
But I can't

1120
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:39,940
even eat a

1121
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,180
bean,

1122
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,720
you fool,

1123
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,280
before it

1124
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,760
turns into

1125
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,460
gold as it

1126
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,180
strikes me

1127
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,660
in the lips.

1128
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,540
This is the

1129
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,380
longest trailer

1130
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,100
I've ever

1131
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,540
heard.

1132
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,880
See,

1133
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,040
Hercules versus

1134
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,660
the moon man,

1135
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,320
or whatever it

1136
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,540
is,

1137
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,720
in this

1138
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,220
theater.

1139
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,100
In Censoround,

1140
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,060
Cinemascope,

1141
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,900
Regiscope,

1142
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,600
Fantomation,

1143
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,840
and Dynaflow.

1144
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,460
Also in

1145
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,280
Ridiculous Comet,

1146
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,300
issue 14 to

1147
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,620
45.

1148
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,520
It's in

1149
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
8D.

1150
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,640
No one

1151
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,100
will be

1152
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
admitted during

1153
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,560
the first

1154
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
72 minutes

1155
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:09,980
of this

1156
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,520
motion picture.

1157
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,740
The last

1158
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,380
century has

1159
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,120
been scoped

1160
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,700
and kept

1161
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,720
for your

1162
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,180
cultural

1163
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:15,980
disbelief.

1164
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,040
With exciting

1165
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,760
co-hit,

1166
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,160
Mommy and

1167
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,980
the Ogre.

1168
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,400
Mommy,

1169
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,420
who's

1170
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,520
that funny

1171
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,140
man?

1172
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,920
Why,

1173
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,120
it's

1174
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,580
someone who

1175
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,500
owes your

1176
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,700
father an

1177
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,260
awful lot

1178
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,680
of money,

1179
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,000
honey.

1180
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,880
Pay up.

1181
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
I'd like

1182
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,460
to talk

1183
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,880
to you about

1184
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,760
Miss Wellesley.

1185
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,180
Since her

1186
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,820
release from

1187
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,480
the institution

1188
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,440
last month,

1189
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:42,940
we've had

1190
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,320
numerous

1191
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,600
complaints.

1192
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,680
I was wondering

1193
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,360
if you would

1194
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,620
speak to her

1195
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,380
at least about

1196
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,700
these outbursts.

1197
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,580
The poor

1198
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,720
girl lives in

1199
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,400
a blinded

1200
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,080
world of her

1201
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,700
own making.

1202
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,060
No one can

1203
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,700
crack that

1204
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,040
shell and get

1205
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,820
to the runny

1206
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,480
meat inside.

1207
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,400
She's been

1208
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,180
ironing

1209
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
the wrinkled

1210
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,160
ascot and it

1211
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,900
just won't

1212
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,560
come straight.

1213
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,360
But how can

1214
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,900
we know she's

1215
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,840
not having us

1216
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,320
all on?

1217
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,280
Maybe she's

1218
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,660
having the

1219
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,280
last laugh.

1220
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,360
It's true.

1221
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,120
It could be.

1222
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,580
Damn you,

1223
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,500
Mrs. Finzer.

1224
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,160
This is not

1225
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,820
an ascot.

1226
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,860
I prescribe

1227
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,740
lobotomy.

1228
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm for

1229
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,400
thrallbots

1230
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,840
didn't it?

1231
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,640
Please,

1232
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:19,980
death.

1233
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,180
Wait a minute,

1234
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,680
did you say

1235
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,580
thrallbots?

1236
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,420
Yes,

1237
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,400
thrallbots,

1238
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,300
who do

1239
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,040
my bidding

1240
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,820
as I command

1241
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,820
in thrall.

1242
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,620
The new

1243
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,240
enemies of

1244
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,200
the Transformers

1245
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,700
and the

1246
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,280
gobots.

1247
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,120
And the

1248
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,960
Decepticons

1249
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,460
and the

1250
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,140
Johnsons

1251
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,780
and the

1252
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,600
Smiths.

1253
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah,

1254
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,340
right.

1255
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,060
The Martins

1256
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,320
and the

1257
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,720
Coys.

1258
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,840
We've

1259
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,380
expended

1260
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,800
them all

1261
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,960
and rightfully

1262
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,440
so because

1263
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,000
they did

1264
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,700
not deserve

1265
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,420
to die

1266
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:45,800
for it.

1267
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,660
The Grangerfords

1268
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:46,940
and the

1269
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,640
Shepherdsons.

1270
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,380
The Kulots

1271
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:49,720
and the

1272
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,500
Hamburgers.

1273
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,280
I mean,

1274
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,620
it was the

1275
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,000
Kulots

1276
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,320
and the

1277
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,740
Georgian

1278
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,280
seafaring

1279
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,500
people,

1280
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:53,900
the ones

1281
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,240
with no

1282
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,540
eyes.

1283
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,100
You remember

1284
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,660
them all,

1285
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,120
don't you?

1286
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,920
Yes,

1287
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,580
I remember

1288
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,180
those who

1289
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,220
used to be

1290
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,560
here.

1291
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,240
Who could

1292
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,720
forget?

1293
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,840
Now only

1294
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,720
these effigies

1295
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,000
remain.

1296
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
The Heelots.

1297
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,180
A lot

1298
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,760
of heels.

1299
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,020
Spear carriers.

1300
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,780
Sandal wearers.

1301
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,320
And people

1302
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,000
with no

1303
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,220
foreskins.

1304
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,560
Yes,

1305
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,820
or aftskins.

1306
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,060
Strangely

1307
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,600
exposed

1308
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,560
to fate

1309
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,680
and its

1310
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,180
vagaries.

1311
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,760
It's a

1312
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,500
change not

1313
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,220
only in

1314
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,020
this dimension

1315
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,660
but all

1316
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,300
the dimensions

1317
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,200
around it.

1318
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,400
Don't you

1319
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,240
understand what

1320
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,740
you're messing

1321
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,120
with?

1322
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,560
Can't you

1323
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,460
understand you

1324
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,920
might be

1325
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,860
destroying not

1326
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,340
only this

1327
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,860
world but

1328
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,060
every possible

1329
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,820
world to

1330
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,160
come?

1331
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,280
We have to

1332
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,720
take that

1333
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,120
chance.

1334
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,360
Especially

1335
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,960
while the

1336
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,740
mighty

1337
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,780
army

1338
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,340
of Lars

1339
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,260
Porsena of

1340
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:44,960
Clusium is

1341
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,200
in the

1342
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,800
field and

1343
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,540
advancing upon

1344
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:46,860
us.

1345
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,260
So we have

1346
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,680
to break a

1347
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,160
few rules.

1348
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,460
Let loose

1349
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,860
a few

1350
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,740
outmoded

1351
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,300
laws and

1352
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,400
ordinances.

1353
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,560
This is

1354
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,260
full-scale

1355
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,100
war against

1356
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,600
a ruthless

1357
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,240
enemy.

1358
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,960
Listen guys,

1359
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,040
I know a lot

1360
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,560
of you don't

1361
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,240
like the idea

1362
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,420
of not only

1363
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:03,960
training so

1364
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,580
hard and so

1365
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,100
long but

1366
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,360
wearing the

1367
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,120
new orifices

1368
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,760
we're forcing

1369
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,300
you to wear.

1370
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,220
I know

1371
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,460
they're

1372
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,100
cumbersome

1373
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,500
and they

1374
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,760
don't feel

1375
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,040
right.

1376
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,480
Sometimes

1377
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,060
they hit

1378
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,340
you in the

1379
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,940
wrong places

1380
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,380
but I'm

1381
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,760
telling you

1382
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,620
they're just

1383
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,040
like your

1384
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,620
buddy system

1385
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,200
and knowing

1386
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,720
your weapon.

1387
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,960
They're there

1388
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,620
to save your

1389
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:19,920
life.

1390
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,900
Because where

1391
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,320
we're going

1392
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,260
no one

1393
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,660
wants to

1394
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:22,860
go.

1395
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,640
And that's

1396
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,160
why we

1397
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,500
got to

1398
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:24,640
go.

1399
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,160
Because we

1400
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,700
don't want

1401
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:25,980
to go.

1402
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,620
If you

1403
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:26,920
want to

1404
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,400
go somewhere

1405
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,840
then you

1406
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,300
can't go

1407
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,460
there.

1408
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,680
But somehow

1409
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,120
I don't

1410
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,380
know how

1411
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:30,800
this works

1412
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:30,960
out.

1413
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,520
If you

1414
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,880
don't want

1415
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,080
to go

1416
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,440
there then

1417
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:32,820
you got to

1418
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,160
go there.

1419
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,880
But then

1420
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,620
of course

1421
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:34,880
if you

1422
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,420
could somehow

1423
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,100
fix it in

1424
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,520
your mind

1425
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:36,920
where you

1426
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,560
both didn't

1427
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:37,780
want to

1428
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,000
go there

1429
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,260
and go

1430
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,540
there and

1431
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:38,780
go there

1432
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,180
and didn't

1433
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,460
go there

1434
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:39,740
at the

1435
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,400
same time

1436
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,320
then the

1437
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,660
problem

1438
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,120
might be

1439
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,940
never mind

1440
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,240
dismissed.

1441
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,400
Just don't

1442
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,760
fling me

1443
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,240
into that

1444
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,180
briar patch

1445
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,920
officer.

1446
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,900
Just don't

1447
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,280
throw me

1448
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,160
into subgenius

1449
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,860
hell lord.

1450
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,740
That's right

1451
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,400
I sure don't

1452
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:51,700
want to go

1453
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,860
there.

1454
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,200
I'd rather

1455
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,460
be in

1456
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:52,960
Christian

1457
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,520
heaven

1458
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,020
wouldn't

1459
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,240
you?

1460
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,040
Did you

1461
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,480
not

1462
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,920
praise Bob

1463
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,720
during your

1464
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,520
life and

1465
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,480
serve his

1466
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,100
church

1467
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,320
when you

1468
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,080
could just

1469
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,620
as well

1470
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,200
have served

1471
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,100
the lord

1472
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,900
here in

1473
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,220
heaven?

1474
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,780
Well yes

1475
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,480
lord it's

1476
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:07,660
true.

1477
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,140
I'd like to

1478
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,680
play back

1479
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,420
the tapes

1480
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,680

1481
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,200
show right

1482
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,600
now.

1483
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,680
It's true

1484
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,120
lord just

1485
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,620
don't throw

1486
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:13,900
me into

1487
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,660
subgenius

1488
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:14,980
hell.

1489
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,460
Don't

1490
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:15,840
throw me

1491
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,160
into where

1492
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,520
all those

1493
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,000
people are

1494
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,520
partying

1495
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:17,960
all those

1496
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,080
young

1497
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,820
attractive

1498
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,640
folks

1499
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,320
all grappling

1500
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,960
with each

1501
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,340
other.

1502
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:24,940
His name

1503
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,500
does not

1504
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,300
appear lord.

1505
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Then I

1506
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,920
say unto

1507
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,220
you

1508
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,160
depart from

1509
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,960
me ye

1510
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,840
unclean

1511
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,820
spirit into

1512
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,440
the eternal

1513
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,520
hideous fire

1514
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,280
prepared for

1515
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,620
Satan

1516
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:37,960
and his

1517
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,840
fallen angel

1518
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,720
buddies right

1519
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,460
through that

1520
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,160
suspicious

1521
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,020
looking tunnel

1522
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,700
with the smoke

1523
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,400
coming out of

1524
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,840
it forever

1525
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
and forever

1526
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,700
for I

1527
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,300
thy god

1528
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,580
am a jealous

1529
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,100
god.

1530
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,740
Although I

1531
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,140
am so

1532
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,200
senile I've

1533
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,800
forgotten what

1534
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm even

1535
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,120
jealous of.

1536
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,200
It doesn't

1537
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,480
matter.

1538
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,780
You have to

1539
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,360
walk that

1540
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,340
lonesome road

1541
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,940
into the

1542
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,100
flaming pit

1543
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,320
which my

1544
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,780
boy

1545
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,460
Yeshua

1546
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,480
cooked up

1547
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:07,740
for you.

1548
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,420
This thing

1549
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,380
God's got

1550
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,200
himself into

1551
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,560
a whole

1552
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,140
peck of

1553
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,520
peckerel

1554
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:12,780
trouble

1555
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,840
as Miss

1556
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,480
Annie and

1557
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,020
Jumberline

1558
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,560
trying to

1559
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,020
figure out

1560
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,540
the order

1561
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:16,780
of the

1562
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,180
saints.

1563
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,460
They search

1564
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,160
out an old

1565
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,060
obscure volume

1566
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,520
called

1567
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,620
Lives of the

1568
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:21,940
Saints

1569
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,580
but they

1570
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,080
can't seem

1571
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,500
to figure

1572
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:23,980
out the

1573
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,820
bibliography.

1574
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,880
Well we

1575
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,280
join them

1576
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,800
now as

1577
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,300
the fun

1578
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,580
begins.

1579
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,120
Honey

1580
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,940
how am I

1581
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,300
going to

1582
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,000
tithe by

1583
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,340
Saint

1584
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,900
Swithin's

1585
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,120
Day?

1586
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm all

1587
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,840
out.

1588
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,040
He's

1589
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,660
schizophrenic?

1590
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,120
Me?

1591
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,620
No.

1592
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,320
Who?

1593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,860
Why don't

1594
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,220
you calm

1595
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,880
down and

1596
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,340
say your

1597
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,020
beads and

1598
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,960
I'll look

1599
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,480
up in the

1600
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,000
eschatological

1601
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,260
calendar if

1602
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,920
it's alright

1603
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
to use

1604
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,660
the back

1605
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,260
shed today.

1606
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,020
What's

1607
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,400
the beads?

1608
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,280
Am I

1609
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,520
a bead?

1610
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,560
Who's

1611
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:50,640
the

1612
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,000
scotch

1613
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,080
a

1614
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,240
lot

1615
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,380
in

1616
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,560
New

1617
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:51,660
England?

1618
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,380
It's the

1619
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,880
eschatology

1620
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,500
that's

1621
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,340
what we're

1622
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,860
talking about

1623
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,620
the end

1624
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,000
times and

1625
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,820
scatology

1626
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,780
refers to

1627
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,240
what goes

1628
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,840
on in the

1629
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,300
back shed.

1630
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,560
Damn you

1631
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,180
I told you

1632
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,520
I'm getting

1633
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,060
a little bit

1634
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,480
up there

1635
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,080
in aeons

1636
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,440
and so

1637
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:06,940
forth and

1638
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,340
so forth.

1639
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,820
What else

1640
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,940
was I

1641
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,320
telling you?

1642
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,320
I'm

1643
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,420
jealous.

1644
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,160
That

1645
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,240
twice battered

1646
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,780
god of

1647
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,240
Palestine

1648
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,280
Lord

1649
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,260
deal as

1650
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,600
you did

1651
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,000
with him.

1652
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,720
Remember

1653
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,580
when Dagon

1654
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,600
was sassy

1655
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,000
to you

1656
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,320
and you

1657
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,800
knocked over

1658
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,300
the statue

1659
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,740
of Dagon

1660
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,180
and then

1661
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,580
they set

1662
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:25,940
it up again

1663
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,300
and then

1664
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,700
you knocked

1665
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,020
it over

1666
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,360
and broke

1667
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,720
it into

1668
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,240
two parts?

1669
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,280
That showed

1670
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,140
the Midianites

1671
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,600
a thing or

1672
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:30,760
two.

1673
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,460
Yeah Midianites

1674
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:32,740
whatever

1675
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,720
did we

1676
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,500
batter dip

1677
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:34,860
and deep

1678
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,280
fry them?

1679
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,040
Yeah they're

1680
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,540
gone.

1681
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,260
They're

1682
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,080
all gone.

1683
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,120
With

1684
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,840
Nineveh

1685
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,440
and Tyre.

1686
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:40,540
trying to get

1687
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:40,780
there and

1688
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,180
made a

1689
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,680
flood and

1690
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,460
so forth?

1691
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,640
Now you

1692
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,380
are getting

1693
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:45,780
on in

1694
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,200
years but

1695
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,540
you did

1696
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,940
say you

1697
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,200
wouldn't

1698
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,680
send another

1699
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,480
flood since

1700
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,860
you did

1701
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,220
that the

1702
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,600
last time.

1703
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:49,980
You said

1704
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,300
that next

1705
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,700
time it

1706
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,000
would be

1707
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,720
the fire.

1708
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,280
Oh that's

1709
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,440
right.

1710
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,020
Fire.

1711
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,500
Fire.

1712
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:53,740
I like

1713
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:53,780
fire.

1714
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,360
It's

1715
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,780
really hot.

1716
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,300
It's

1717
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:55,820
hotter every

1718
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,080
day.

1719
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,680
I think

1720
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,460
all but

1721
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:57,860
the most

1722
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,640
blinkered

1723
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,460
blinders

1724
00:40:59,460 --> 00:40:59,900
wearers

1725
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,520
can see

1726
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:00,880
the

1727
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,720
grizzly

1728
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,240
frizzling

1729
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,560
shape

1730
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,060
of the

1731
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,740
inflamed

1732
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,100
future.

1733
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,140
Oh boy.

1734
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,040
I can

1735
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,420
we're

1736
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,660
talking

1737
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,860
about

1738
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,180
again.

1739
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,960
Exists

1740
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,320
they're

1741
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,540
going to

1742
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:09,960
pour on

1743
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,400
the heat.

1744
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:10,820
The

1745
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,580
subgeniuses

1746
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:11,800
are going

1747
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:11,980
to be

1748
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,380
down there

1749
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:12,980
barbecuing

1750
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,520
and then

1751
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:13,720
the

1752
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,100
exists

1753
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,480
are going

1754
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,800
to begin

1755
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,300
the grand

1756
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,100
barbecue

1757
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,040
in which

1758
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,660
all will

1759
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,360
fly up

1760
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,760
to heaven

1761
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
in flame

1762
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,400
and smoke.

1763
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,240
I get

1764
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,580
the credit

1765
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:21,760
though.

1766
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,060
Remember

1767
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,280
I'm

1768
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,460
jealous

1769
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,960
right?

1770
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,760
Yeah

1771
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,380
sure

1772
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,420
Jehovah

1773
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,940
we can

1774
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,440
just fly

1775
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,000
away and

1776
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,780
watch you

1777
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,340
manage

1778
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,700
your

1779
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,300
burned up

1780
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,840
compost

1781
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,360
pile

1782
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,440
and say

1783
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,360
thanks

1784
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,980
for the

1785
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,360
memories.

1786
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:34,700
You know

1787
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:34,980
I never

1788
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,380
thought we'd

1789
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,000
have Jehovah

1790
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,520
One on

1791
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,020
the show

1792
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,520
and I

1793
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,720
thought he'd

1794
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,180
be taller.

1795
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,140
Well you

1796
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,540
know he

1797
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,260
was once.

1798
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,340
Let's give

1799
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,680
him credit

1800
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,340
where credit

1801
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:44,560
due.

1802
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,060
Maybe he

1803
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,620
didn't even

1804
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,020
shrink.

1805
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,880
Maybe man

1806
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,640
just got a

1807
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:47,980
little more

1808
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,760
bloated and

1809
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,060
large.

1810
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,900
Well if we

1811
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,520
believe the

1812
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,320
teachings of

1813
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,840
the Vedas

1814
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,380
that means

1815
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:52,960
he is the

1816
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,280
substance of

1817
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,940
memory itself.

1818
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,600
He is beyond

1819
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,100
all memory.

1820
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,620
How could he

1821
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,020
lose his

1822
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,460
memory and

1823
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:57,940
act like a

1824
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,420
feeble-minded

1825
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,180
duttering fool

1826
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,600
like that?

1827
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,380
That's under

1828
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,340
Hindus and

1829
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,000
don'ts.

1830
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,400
I cannot

1831
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,040
find it here.

1832
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Well be

1833
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,200
under the

1834
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,720
altar.

1835
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,240
of the

1836
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,100
many-armed

1837
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,380
statue of

1838
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,220
the deathless

1839
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,720
eater of

1840
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:10,960
Saul.

1841
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,840
I wish

1842
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,240
you well

1843
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,020
but I

1844
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,380
can't see

1845
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,880
what you're

1846
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,520
talking about.

1847
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,640
Better bring

1848
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,000
me around

1849
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,340
somewhere.

1850
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,500
Oh my.

1851
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,460
Well I

1852
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,560
guess I'm

1853
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,080
a little bit

1854
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,740
behind in

1855
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,580
my churchly

1856
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,320
duties but

1857
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,400
there'll be

1858
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:26,980
a nice long

1859
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,760
interval where

1860
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,240
I can do

1861
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,860
all my

1862
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,860
devotions and

1863
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,700
get right

1864
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,160
with the

1865
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,620
pantheon.

1866
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,260
Nothing like

1867
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,460
it.

1868
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,580
Getting right

1869
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:35,940
with the

1870
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,520
pantheon.

1871
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,040
I remember

1872
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,320
it was,

1873
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,140
I think it

1874
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,500
was the

1875
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:38,980
day of the

1876
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,680
great snake.

1877
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,500
We're all

1878
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,040
hunkered down

1879
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,740
for a barbecue

1880
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,540
afternoon and

1881
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,560
one of the

1882
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,220
bigger children

1883
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,340
began slaughtering

1884
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:45,920
all of the

1885
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,620
smaller children.

1886
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,880
Now Mammy and

1887
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,460
Pappy didn't

1888
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,020
exactly go for

1889
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,300
that.

1890
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,960
They'd had

1891
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,460
plenty of

1892
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,080
children before.

1893
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,700
They called

1894
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,020
them the

1895
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,980
beast with

1896
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,380
a thousand

1897
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,640
breasts,

1898
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,620
so to speak.

1899
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,700
That means

1900
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,180
a thousand

1901
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,140
generation upon

1902
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,680
generation

1903
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,620
intermixing and

1904
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,740
kind of making

1905
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,480
themselves a little

1906
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,060
bit genetically

1907
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,960
impaired but

1908
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,640
that's another

1909
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,100
story.

1910
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,300
I guess that's

1911
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,720
the fighting

1912
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,300
spirit in

1913
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,420
them.

1914
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,520
But I'll

1915
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,040
return my

1916
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,760
vigor someday

1917
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,680
and when I

1918
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,840
find it I'm

1919
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,080
going to

1920
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,660
shoot it down

1921
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,380
the drain and

1922
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,600
cry.

1923
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,280
Well it's

1924
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:14,760
good to have

1925
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,000
aspirations and

1926
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,720
hopes of

1927
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,160
however

1928
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,560
inadequate their

1929
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,280
chance of

1930
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,100
being realized

1931
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,400
for without

1932
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,660
that we are

1933
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,200
truly stopped,

1934
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,540
defeated and

1935
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,240
blinded.

1936
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,920
We have to

1937
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,760
compartmentalize

1938
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,240
is what we

1939
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,620
have to do

1940
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,500
especially if we

1941
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,340
realize some

1942
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,040
things that we've

1943
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,240
always wanted are

1944
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,040
never going to

1945
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,360
happen.

1946
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,400
We have to

1947
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,920
find out new

1948
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,560
reasons to go

1949
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:39,880
on.

1950
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,600
New shapes we

1951
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,540
still may weave.

1952
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,620
New laws,

1953
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,700
new gods

1954
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,400
receive.

1955
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,640
Smooth ascots.

1956
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,560
Janet.

1957
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,560
New popes.

1958
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,300
Janet,

1959
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,360
you've got my

1960
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,100
ascot and my

1961
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,740
aspirations for a

1962
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,220
new world.

1963
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,280
What's wrong

1964
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,660
with you?

1965
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,360
Has father been

1966
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,060
lying to you

1967
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,300
again?

1968
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,580
What's wrong

1969
00:43:59,580 --> 00:43:59,920
with your

1970
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,180
pants?

1971
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,220
You're supposed

1972
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,780
to be dressed

1973
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,340
like a man

1974
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:02,620
again.

1975
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,460
I forgot to

1976
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,180
bring those

1977
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,140
special pants.

1978
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,640
I just

1979
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,020
remembered.

1980
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Oh, now I

1981
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,540
am.

1982
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,140
What has

1983
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:09,620
happened to

1984
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,040
your nose?

1985
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,700
I've just

1986
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,420
returned from

1987
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,700
Rome.

1988
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
There was a

1989
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,480
nose there

1990
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,760
once.

1991
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,640
Yes, this

1992
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,500
was once a

1993
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,100
nose that all

1994
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,740
the world

1995
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,280
could behold.

1996
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,040
But now his

1997
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,160
nose is thin

1998
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,940
and it rests

1999
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,820
upon his chin

2000
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,740
like a staff

2001
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,940
and a crick

2002
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,540
is in his

2003
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,240
back and a

2004
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,000
melancholy

2005
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,360
crack in his

2006
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:32,760
laugh.

2007
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,760
The mossy

2008
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,020
marbles rest

2009
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,820
on the lips

2010
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,340
that he had

2011
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,120
pressed in

2012
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,540
their bloom

2013
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,660
and the

2014
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,500
names he

2015
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,140
loved to

2016
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,900
hear have

2017
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,600
been carved

2018
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,340
for many

2019
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:43,860
a year

2020
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,440
on the

2021
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,740
tomb.

2022
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,380
So now

2023
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,500
he walks

2024
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,180
the streets

2025
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,640
and he

2026
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,200
looks at

2027
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,560
all he

2028
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,860
meets

2029
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,280
all for

2030
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,800
long and

2031
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,460
he shakes

2032
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,340
his weary

2033
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,300
head so

2034
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:54,860
it seems

2035
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,620
as if he

2036
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,800
said they

2037
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,640
are gone.

2038
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,280
Blasted

2039
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,480
with antiquity

2040
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,320
super

2041
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,160
annuated

2042
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,900
with extreme

2043
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,040
age and

2044
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,360
eld

2045
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,500
palsied

2046
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,160
shaking

2047
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,400
feeble

2048
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,300
piping

2049
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,020
with his

2050
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,600
lisping

2051
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,180
voice

2052
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,760
and faltering

2053
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,860
shaking

2054
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,920
roomy

2055
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,400
eyesight.

2056
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,120
Now

2057
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:16,760
Puck Black

2058
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,380
isn't that

2059
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:17,720
bad.

2060
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,100
No I

2061
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,460
guess not.

2062
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,220
He's in

2063
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:19,860
bad shape.

2064
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,400
He's actually

2065
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,040
only 22

2066
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,580
years old

2067
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,700
but he's

2068
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,080
done a lot

2069
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,380
of hard

2070
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:23,660
living.

2071
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,660
Yeah

2072
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,020
Governor

2073
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,020
can you

2074
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,540
spare me

2075
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,440
23 more?

2076
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,440
Get away

2077
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:28,800
from me

2078
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,740
you uncouth

2079
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,540
being.

2080
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:30,980
Please

2081
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,260
please

2082
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,680
some

2083
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:32,620
cutter

2084
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,020
for me

2085
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,300
brother.

2086
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,740
Where

2087
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,340
are you?

2088
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:35,440
Are the

2089
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,700
police

2090
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,180
at times

2091
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,580
like this?

2092
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,340
Really

2093
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:37,780
I can't

2094
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,140
be bothered

2095
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,560
by these

2096
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:38,840
street

2097
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,260
urchins.

2098
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,320
Constable?

2099
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,640
What seems

2100
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,080
to be

2101
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,700
going on

2102
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:43,920
here?

2103
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,300
What's

2104
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:44,620
all this

2105
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:44,920
about

2106
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,540
Vinay?

2107
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,020
Well

2108
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,680
the street

2109
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
Arab

2110
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,200
was sassing

2111
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,520

2112
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,100
officer

2113
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,840
I think.

2114
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,260
I wasn't

2115
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:51,500
doing

2116
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:51,920
nothing.

2117
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,760
Oh another

2118
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
sassy Arab

2119
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:53,940
eh?

2120
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,820
That's right.

2121
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,300
Blank

2122
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,100

2124
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:56,640
back

2125
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:56,980
where you

2126
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,380
came from?

2127
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:57,860
Innocent

2128
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,380

you I'm

2130
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:58,980
innocent.

2131
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,100
And who

2132
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,520

2133
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,080
Vinay?

2134
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:02,900

2138
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,240
I'm

2139
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:05,940
totally

2140
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,480
innocent

2141
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,320
nothing.

2142
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,660
I don't

2143
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,140
see that

2144
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,660
on your

2145
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,260
driver's

2146
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:10,620
license.

2147
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:11,680
Wow.

2148
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:11,940


2149
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,060
it looks

2150
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:13,500
like a

2151
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:13,900
mandrill

2152
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,140
head.

2153
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,120
Who

2154
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,620
took this

2155
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,940
picture?

2156
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,440
It's

2157
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,880
the sign

2158
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,280
of the

2159
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,720
rabid

2160
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,360
baboon.

2161
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,360
Ah

2162
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,840
a sign

2163
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,400
we've been

2164
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:22,900
waiting for

2165
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,560
for so long.

2166
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,660
The sign

2167
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,100
of the

2168
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,480
rabid

2169
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,000
baboon.

2170
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,420
Yes

2171
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:26,720
it's time.

2172
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:26,980
Ranging

2173
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,620
in the

2174
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,040
east

2175
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,560
pounding

2176
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,100
the earth

2177
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,660
creating

2178
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,080
a cacophony

2179
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,340
of

2180
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,860
mistrials

2181
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,020
and

2182
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,740
misguided

2183
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,140
efforts.

2184
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:35,940
Nobody

2185
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,600
knows the

2186
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,100
trouble I

2187
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:37,340
seen.

2188
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,500
Nobody

2189
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,920
knows.

2190
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,220
Did you

2191
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,560
hit him

2192
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,520
hard son?

2193
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,480
Did you

2194
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,200
get mean

2195
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,560
mad?

2196
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,340
Well I

2197
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:44,700
came out

2198
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,360
swinging and

2199
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,920
I landed

2200
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,320
a few

2201
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,000
good punches

2202
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,720
but on

2203
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,080
the whole

2204
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,500
I was

2205
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,380
steamrollered.

2206
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,640
I haven't

2207
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,280
been holding

2208
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:51,720
my own

2209
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,000
lately.

2210
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,440
I have

2211
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,120
been swept

2212
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,060
backward by

2213
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,280
the overwhelming

2214
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,320
current but

2215
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,540
as I was

2216
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,440
saying earlier

2217
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,040
or trying to

2218
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,480
say we

2219
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,880
should all

2220
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,500
expect a

2221
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,760
little of

2222
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,000
this.

2223
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,200
The

2224
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,620
resistance.

2225
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:01,980
The

2226
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,340
demonic

2227
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:02,880
resistance

2228
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,900
trying to

2229
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,340
keep us

2230
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,520
from

2231
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:04,900
getting to

2232
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:04,980
the

2233
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,340
assembly

2234
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,360
point to

2235
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:06,480
the

2236
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,960
nexus

2237
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,260
of

2238
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:07,860
X-Day.

2239
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,140
You

2240
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:09,360
have to

2241
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:09,620
walk

2242
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,400
forward

2243
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:10,720
against

2244
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,040
that

2245
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,700
wind.

2246
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,840
What's

2247
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,000
that

2248
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,400
bruise

2249
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:13,660
above

2250
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,020
your

2251
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,300
third

2252
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:14,580
eye

2253
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:14,900
son?

2254
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,560
You

2255
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:15,900
look like

2256
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,080
you've

2257
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,400
been in

2258
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:16,680
a hell

2259
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:16,940
of a

2260
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,220
fight.

2261
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,300
Well I'm

2262
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:18,920
sorry you

2263
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,460
noticed that.

2264
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,860
That was

2265
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,860
I ran

2266
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,380
into the

2267
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:21,820
end of a

2268
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,380
door actually.

2269
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,740
I thought it

2270
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,040
was Ash

2271
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,340
Wednesday.

2272
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,920
Well maybe

2273
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,420
it was.

2274
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,300
I can't

2275
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,520
even

2276
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,100
I have

2277
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,560
to consult

2278
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,080
my notes

2279
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,520
to figure

2280
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:29,800
out

2281
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,820
exactly.

2282
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm

2283
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:31,940
somewhat

2284
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,460
confused

2285
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,060
as to

2286
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,320
the

2287
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,840
calendar.

2288
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,440
Well there

2289
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,180
was something

2290
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,560
in the

2291
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:36,880
ashes

2292
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,220
son.

2293
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,700
That's

2294
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,260
the only

2295
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:38,760
problem.

2296
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,780
Oh yeah?

2297
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:39,960
You came

2298
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,260
in and

2299
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:40,680
got your

2300
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,160
dust in

2301
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,520
all right

2302
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,280
but it

2303
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,200
might dust

2304
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:43,620
you off

2305
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:43,900
if you

2306
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,140
know what

2307
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,400
I mean.

2308
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,260
I thought

2309
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:45,600
it was a

2310
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:45,820
little

2311
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,580
leaden

2312
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:46,900
heart

2313
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,240
that

2314
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:47,620
wouldn't

2315
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:47,920
melt

2316
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,200
even

2317
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:48,540
in the

2318
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:48,700
middle

2319
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:48,920
of the

2320
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,220
fire.

2321
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:49,820
Everything

2322
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,120
else

2323
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,560
ashes

2324
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:50,980
but

2325
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,880
this

2326
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,440
little

2327
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,100
coal

2328
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,380
black

2329
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,000
heart

2330
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,500
was all

2331
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:55,640
that

2332
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:55,900
remained.

2333
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,960
You know

2334
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,380
the burning

2335
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,000
of the

2336
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,160
subgenius

2337
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,480
icon

2338
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,680
at X-Day

2339
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,240
this year

2340
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,600
we're

2341
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,240
not

2342
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,440
going to

2343
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,140
you know

2344
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:08,380
we're

2345
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,900
rebooting

2346
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,080
the

2347
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,480
franchise.

2348
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,020
This is

2349
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,640
like X-Day

2350
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:10,860
2.

2351
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,620
It's

2352
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,000
like the

2353
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,200
new

2354
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,760
Star Trek.

2355
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:13,740
It's

2356
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,120
not just

2357
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,900
Ginebrum's

2358
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,400
directed.

2359
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,300
It's

2360
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:16,560
not going

2361
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:16,800
to be

2362
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,080
one of

2363
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,320
those

2364
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,940
Bob

2365
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,340
icons

2366
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,180
made of

2367
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,560
plywood

2368
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,280
that burns

2369
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,640
up just

2370
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,080
like that.

2371
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,160
We're

2372
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,660
actually

2373
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,700
I believe

2374
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:23,980
that

2375
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,060
Reverend

2376
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,780
Wilhelm

2377
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,780
Stahlhelm

2378
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,080
Stahlhelm

2379
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,000
Wilhelm

2380
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,020
Stahlhelm

2381
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,600
Stahlhelm

2382
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,080
yes I

2383
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,320
don't know

2384
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,420
why

2385
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,640
it makes

2386
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,140
me

2387
00:48:34,140 --> 00:49:04,140


2388
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:04,760
three

2389
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,660
dimensional

2390
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,760
flammable

2391
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,340
Bob

2392
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,780
designed in

2393
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,460
such a way

2394
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,040
that first

2395
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,600
his clothes

2396
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,100
burn then

2397
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,580
his flesh

2398
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,040
burns off

2399
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,700
his eyes

2400
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,760
will literally

2401
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,820
roll out

2402
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,420
of his

2403
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,840
head.

2404
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,720
He's

2405
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,680
been designed

2406
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,980
to have

2407
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,680
eyes that

2408
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,260
will roll

2409
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:21,780
out of his

2410
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,340
head and

2411
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,800
a skeleton

2412
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,200
that will

2413
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,560
be left

2414
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:25,800
behind.

2415
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,240
And if

2416
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,580
you say

2417
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,520
the tiny

2418
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,920
little

2419
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,180
lead or

2420
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,840
in this

2421
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,800
case plutonium

2422
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,160
heart.

2423
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,040
I ain't

2424
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,540
scared of

2425
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:33,660
no

2426
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,300
skillet.

2427
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,420
And

2428
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,760
Stan will

2429
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,180
be doing

2430
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,980
the familiar

2431
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,960
pyrotechnic

2432
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,720
displays from

2433
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:40,860
his

2434
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,140
dairy

2435
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,360
or

2436
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:41,600
ice

2437
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:41,860
bone.

2438
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,280
No

2439
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:42,640
that's

2440
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:42,920
chicken

2441
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,200
John

2442
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,560
stuff.

2443
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,820
Banjo

2444
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,020
Bob.

2445
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,860
No we're

2446
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,360
not going

2447
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,980
to do

2448
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,520
anything

2449
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,120
familiar.

2450
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,560
Nothing

2451
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,000
will be

2452
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,420
familiar

2453
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,060
this time.

2454
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:51,620
All that

2455
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,180
old stuff

2456
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:52,760
goes by

2457
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,260
the boards.

2458
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:53,540
It's

2459
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:53,940
going out

2460
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,380
the window.

2461
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
Yeah with

2462
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,140
the baby

2463
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,660
and the

2464
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,220
bath water

2465
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:57,640
all of

2466
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:57,800
it.

2467
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,540
Yes don't

2468
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,040
stand below

2469
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,640
and we're

2470
00:49:59,640 --> 00:49:59,960
going to

2471
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,460
be washed

2472
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,320
clean and

2473
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,000
able to

2474
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,560
start our

2475
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,100
new complete

2476
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,520
reboot of

2477
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,240
the church

2478
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:05,520
of the

2479
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,100
subgenius.

2480
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,860
Once upon

2481
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,220
the time

2482
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,500
at a

2483
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:08,860
next day

2484
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,160
past

2485
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,900
Magdalene

2486
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,340
led the

2487
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,020
ritual of

2488
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,340
actually

2489
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,880
burning the

2490
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,100
church

2491
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:12,500
itself.

2492
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:13,800
Really?

2493
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,140
And

2494
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,800
resurrecting

2495
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:14,940
it as a

2496
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,380
zombie.

2497
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:15,880
That must

2498
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,260
have been

2499
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,700
like five

2500
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:16,940
or six

2501
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,400
years ago.

2502
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,560
Well it was

2503
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:18,900
like one of

2504
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,160
those little

2505
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,620
birdhouse

2506
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,140
churches.

2507
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,180
That explains

2508
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,860
a lot.

2509
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,640
It does.

2510
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,380
That's what

2511
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,760
happened.

2512
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,960
And he

2513
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,180
crudely took

2514
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,600
a poor

2515
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,480
young robin

2516
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,200
and dressed

2517
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:28,640
it up like

2518
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,000
a vicar

2519
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,420
and burned

2520
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:29,740
it alive.

2521
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,000
There's a

2522
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,340
couple of

2523
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,960
robins in

2524
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,160
here.

2525
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:32,880
Who

2526
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,080
does

2527
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,240
that?

2528
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,780
Who did

2529
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,200
such a

2530
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,380
thing?

2531
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,020
I think

2532
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,580
therefore I

2533
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:38,840
think.

2534
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,460
There's two

2535
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,200
robs in here.

2536
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:40,920
Hello goodbye

2537
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,780
therefore I

2538
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:41,940
think.

2539
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,580
Well yes.

2540
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,600
I already

2541
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,520
explained that

2542
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,840
if your name

2543
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,340
is Rob

2544
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:46,920
then you

2545
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,340
are very

2546
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:47,820
close to

2547
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,460
being a

2548
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,900
Bob.

2549
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,000
And I

2550
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,620
explained the

2551
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,320
derivation of

2552
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:51,820
how I

2553
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,720
actually also

2554
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,440
can be

2555
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:54,800
Bob.

2556
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,740
A

2557
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,620
gnomon

2558
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,520
designation.

2559
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,640
Very quickly

2560
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,480
I'll say it

2561
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:00,700
again.

2562
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:01,880
Nixon.

2563
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,620
The White

2564
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:02,840
House.

2565
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,400
Watergate.

2566
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,140
The 70s.

2567
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,960
H.R.

2568
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,320
Haldeman.

2569
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,020
Nixon's

2570
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,560
chief hatchet

2571
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:06,720
man.

2572
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,180
His name

2573
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,620
was Harry

2574
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,140
Robbins

2575
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,640
Haldeman.

2576
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,460
My name

2577
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:09,840
is Harry

2578
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,380
Robbins.

2579
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,120
They called

2580
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,920
him Bob

2581
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,680
Haldeman.

2582
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,680
Bob short

2583
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,100
for the

2584
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:14,320
Rob.

2585
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,040
Rob in

2586
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,480
Robbins.

2587
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,320
Therefore if

2588
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,960
he is

2589
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,780
Bob I

2590
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,460
also with

2591
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:18,880
the identical

2592
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,940
name am

2593
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,700
Bob.

2594
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,860
So put

2595
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,260
that in

2596
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:22,740
your pipe

2597
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,240
and smoke

2598
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:23,460
it.

2599
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,120
What about

2600
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,360
that?

2601
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,680
Ain't enough

2602
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,320
room in

2603
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,800
this town

2604
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,020
for both

2605
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,440
of us

2606
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,920
Bobs.

2607
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,400
I think

2608
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:31,880
two of

2609
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,020
them

2610
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:32,600
Bobs are

2611
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:32,820
going to

2612
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,300
have to

2613
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:33,540
go.

2614
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,660
Say.

2615
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,860
Hey who's

2616
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,460
been snorting

2617
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:37,700
on my

2618
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:37,980
whiskey

2619
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,300
bottle?

2620
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,200
Is it

2621
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,460
a you

2622
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,220
short fat

2623
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,760
acne

2624
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,440
bespeckled

2625
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:42,920
Bob or

2626
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,840
the tall

2627
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,340
handsome

2628
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:44,960
Bob with

2629
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,980
straight teeth?

2630
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:46,540
Does it

2631
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,100
matter if

2632
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,580
one is

2633
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,200
handsome or

2634
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,580
the other

2635
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,780
is unappealing

2636
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,440
as long as

2637
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,480
they're taking

2638
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,380
your whiskey

2639
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:52,780
away?

2640
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,060
I don't know

2641
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,460
where to trade

2642
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:54,860
a bottle of

2643
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,140
whiskey.

2644
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,980
That's what

2645
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,580
I'm trying to

2646
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,060
say Snooki.

2647
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,840
Both of

2648
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,360
them Bobs

2649
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,600
have got

2650
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:58,920
to go.

2651
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,220
And who

2652
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:00,960
will replace

2653
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,300
them?

2654
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,220
Reverend

2655
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:02,800
Hyde.

2656
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,600
Dr.

2657
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,440
Dobbs and

2658
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,440
Reverend Hyde.

2659
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:05,720
Reverend

2660
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,640
Jacqueline Hyde?

2661
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,420
Yeah.

2662
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,080
Reverend

2663
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,100
Jacqueline Hyde

2664
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,620
will be at

2665
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,100
the judgment.

2666
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,640
Well alright

2667
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,020
then.

2668
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,800
That's good.

2669
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,680
We'll be in

2670
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,380
good hands.

2671
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,580
I think it's

2672
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,020
going to be a

2673
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,280
little bit

2674
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,260
difficult for

2675
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,000
judgment day

2676
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,440
for a lot

2677
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:20,800
of people

2678
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:20,980
who have

2679
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,280
shown

2680
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,900
remarkably

2681
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,740
poor skills

2682
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,400
in judgment.

2683
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,060
Or maybe

2684
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,560
that's their

2685
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:25,760
common

2686
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,340
that's what

2687
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:26,660
it's all

2688
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,220
about you

2689
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:27,460
know.

2690
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,440
Forgiveness.

2691
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,420
Atonement.

2692
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,360
Atonement with

2693
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,220
nothing

2694
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:32,740
absolutely.

2695
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:32,960
Absolutely

2696
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,240
nothing.

2697
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,760
Perhaps a

2698
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,540
peculiar feeling

2699
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,060
in the groin

2700
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,360
area.

2701
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,300
Hopefully for

2702
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:37,500
some.

2703
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,400
But that's

2704
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,920
our universe.

2705
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,060
It's mostly

2706
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,780
composed of

2707
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,100
absolutely

2708
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,540
nothing.

2709
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,360
And then in

2710
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,340
one small

2711
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,260
area there's

2712
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,660
a little bit

2713
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,080
of feeling.

2714
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,200
An area

2715
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,820
soon to be

2716
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,280
made much

2717
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:48,680
smaller.

2718
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,180
But with

2719
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,960
an increase

2720
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,560
of feeling.

2721
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:54,120
That

2722
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,060
I can

2723
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:57,480
see it

2724
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:57,640
now.

2725
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,020
A big

2726
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,800
beautiful

2727
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,680
world of

2728
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,260
the afterlife

2729
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,180
spread out

2730
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:01,820
before me.

2731
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,800
Infinite

2732
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,500
possibilities.

2733
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,940
Eternally

2734
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,460
young

2735
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,000
and vigorous.

2736
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,380
All possibilities

2737
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,920
open.

2738
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,080
My knuckles

2739
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,560
are clean.

2740
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,620
Enough time

2741
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,420
to learn

2742
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,260
Portuguese

2743
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,980
and do

2744
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,660
everything else.

2745
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,600
The baby

2746
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,580
of my aunt

2747
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,440
is on the

2750
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,000
I did it.

2751
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,520
I'm a success.

2752
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes.

2753
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,540
No.

2754
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,140
No.

2755
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,200
No.

2756
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,400
How much

2757
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,580
does it cost

2758
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,600
to use the

2759
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,120

2782
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,700
That's right.

here.

2787
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,400
I've been

2788
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,100
telling all of

2789
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,380
you.

2790
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,400
Fool followers

2791
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,300
about the

2792
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,280
the end of

2793
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:04,780
the world

2794
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:04,960
the

2795
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,920
conflagration

2796
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,660
that's coming

2797
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:06,880
up.

2798
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,040
Well we're

2799
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,400
going to have

2800
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,140
one and

2801
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:10,700
this time

2802
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,780
it's not

2803
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,300
going to be

2804
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,580
a dud.

2805
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,220
Yes the

2806
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:13,620
world really

2807
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,120
is going to

2808
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:14,480
end and

2809
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,380
I'm going

2810
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,900
to tell you

2811
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,900
I've been

2812
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,100
camping on

2813
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,620
that for

2814
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,780
some years

2815
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,840
and it

2816
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,440
irritates me

2817
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:22,760
when these

2818
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,500
false prophets

2819
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,520
from their

2820
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,240
citadels

2821
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,260
are

2822
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:27,740
proclaiming

2823
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,400
their fake

2824
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,960
apocalypse

2825
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,460
when the

2826
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:29,960
world really

2827
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,680
is ending

2828
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,160
and

2829
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,580
why is

2830
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:32,900
everyone

2831
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,540
fooling around

2832
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,200
to such

2833
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,500
unacceptable

2834
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,400
unagreeable

2835
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,000
levels of

2836
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,540
falderal

2837
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:38,920
with some

2838
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,480
hillbilly

2839
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,260
radio preacher

2840
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,880
instead of

2841
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,960
using their

2842
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,640
eyes to

2843
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,100
look around

2844
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,700
and see

2845
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,000
the

2846
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,200
despoiling

2847
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:45,820
of our

2848
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,380
world

2849
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,840
which is

2850
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,540
after all

2851
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,380
all that

2852
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:48,920
we stand

2853
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,380
on

2854
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,180
to keep

2855
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:50,600
us from

2856
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:50,860
being

2857
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,740
tumbling

2858
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,140
through

2859
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:52,500
space

2860
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,320
forever.

2861
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,260
The shifting

2862
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,020
despoils.

2863
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,660
Well it's

2864
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,240
something

2865
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,880
people should

2866
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,420
think about

2867
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:58,580
it.

2868
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,200
Instead they

2869
00:54:59,200 --> 00:54:59,980
have to

2870
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,400
couch it

2871
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,420
in quaint

2872
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:01,960
and curious

2873
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,760
rites of

2874
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,220
primitive

2875
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,040
savagery.

2876
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:05,800
Oh a whole

2877
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,160
bunch of

2878
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,480
them think

2879
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,800
they have

2880
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,740
until 2012.

2881
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,260
Well many

2882
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,820
more believe

2883
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,180
October 21st

2884
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,680
but that's

2885
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,220
several months

2886
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,760
more than

2887
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,220
they actually

2888
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,900
get as you

2889
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,000
know.

2890
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,140
That's right.

2891
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,400
Well that was

2892
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,020
that one

2893
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,680
interpretation.

2894
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,980
Well they

2895
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,460
said they

2896
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:21,860
were pulling

2897
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,400
their legs.

2898
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:22,760
We just

2899
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,200
said F

2900
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,560
myth they

2901
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,040
can't take

2902
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,440
a joke

2903
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,460
but they

2904
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,100
said they

2905
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,740
were pulling

2906
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,480
their legs

2907
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,200
and that's

2908
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,700
what happened

2909
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,100
as they

2910
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:29,560
approached

2911
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,200
the speed

2912
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,580
of light.

2913
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,160
Their legs

2914
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,680
got a lot

2915
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,120
longer.

2916
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,680
But they

2917
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,120
didn't get

2918
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,720
any taller.

2919
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,440
That's right.

2920
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,300
I'd like to

2921
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,000
remind everyone

2922
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,780
aboard this

2923
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,940
vessel that

2924
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,400
the following

2925
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,280
rules are to

2926
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:41,840
be either

2927
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,560
obeyed

2928
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,580
vigorously

2929
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,660
or not

2930
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,360
obeyed at

2931
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:47,840
all.

2932
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,420
Furthermore I

2933
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:49,960
would like to

2934
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,440
remind the

2935
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,280
passengers that

2936
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,820
you may or

2937
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,260
may not be

2938
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,180
passengers upon

2939
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,680
my own

2940
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,360
personal women

2941
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,860
within the

2942
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,300
next five

2943
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,380
seconds I

2944
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,860
may all

2945
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,220
have you

2946
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:57,600
killed.

2947
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,740
Where's the

2948
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,600
holodeck buddy?

2949
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,360
John Mayle?

2950
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:00,880
That is a

2951
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,000
mean

2952
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,460
diamond

2953
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,780
deed.

2954
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,200
You're confusing

2955
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,780
your Star Trek

2956
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,060
generations.

2957
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:03,500
Those are

2958
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:03,940
first generation

2959
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,460
background

2960
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:04,900
noises.

2961
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:05,780
There was

2962
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,320
no holodeck.

2963
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,160
I thought it

2964
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:07,520
was a

2965
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,140
holo show.

2966
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,880
Oh well.

2967
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:09,940
These are

2968
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,360
not holograms.

2969
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,380
Warning.

2970
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,260
All employees

2971
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:15,780
of the

2972
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,300
subgenius

2973
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:16,580
government

2974
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,460
must present

2975
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,120
identification

2976
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,320
to registrar

2977
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,060
before entering

2978
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,300
these holodeck

2979
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:21,620
grounds.

2980
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,380
What is

2981
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:22,920
acceptable

2982
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,660
identification?

2983
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:24,940
must be

2984
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,400
presented

2985
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,000
for

2986
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,540
extinction.

2987
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,740
How about

2988
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,120
a good old

2989
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,600
California

2990
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,340
driver's

2991
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,620
license?

2992
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,820
Does that

2993
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,200
cut the

2994
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:31,440
mustard?

2995
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,920
It's

2996
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,380
holo X

2997
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:33,680
day.

2998
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,360
Only

2999
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,440
those who

3000
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:36,900
bear the

3001
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,480
mark upon

3002
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,100
the hand

3003
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:38,500
and the

3004
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:38,820
forehead

3005
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,380
and that

3006
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:39,800
one other

3007
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,140
place.

3008
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,200
You've

3009
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,440
got to

3010
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:43,860
tamp down

3011
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,320
the reaction.

3012
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,920
I can't

3013
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,360
change the

3014
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:46,660
laws of

3015
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:46,980
physics.

3016
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,260
Well,

3017
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,320
the Catholics

3018
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:53,960
got rid of

3019
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,040
purgatory in

3020
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,740
a snap of

3021
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,360
the papal

3022
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:56,660
fingers.

3023
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,400
So that

3024
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:57,840
same thing

3025
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,340
happened to

3026
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:58,720
physics

3027
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,240
apparently.

3028
00:56:59,460 --> 00:56:59,720
With a

3029
00:56:59,720 --> 00:56:59,980
more

3030
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,480
frothy

3031
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:00,680
reaction.

3032
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:00,900
We can't

3033
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,280
make it,

3034
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:01,580
Captain.

3035
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,360
There is

3036
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,460
that.

3037
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,900
It's made

3038
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,160
us.

3039
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,380
Can't you

3040
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:06,640
see?

3041
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:06,940
Look at

3042
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,280
your feet

3043
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,480
now.

3044
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,080
Oh,

3045
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,660
they're rooted

3046
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:08,940
to the

3047
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,280
spot.

3048
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,800
I always

3049
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,080
thought that

3050
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,400
was just

3051
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:10,860
an expression.

3052
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,020
You don't

3053
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,440
need to

3054
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,020
walk anymore.

3055
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,020
No,

3056
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,400
I've walked

3057
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:14,920
too far

3058
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,460
in somebody

3059
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:15,800
else's

3060
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,160
shoes.

3061
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,460
Put out

3062
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:17,880
branches

3063
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,820
and acorns.

3064
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,460
Wise

3065
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:19,840
acre.

3066
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,720
That's what

3067
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,100
they called

3068
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,340
you in

3069
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:21,580
school.

3070
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,500
You never

3071
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:22,900
listened.

3072
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,800
Now you

3073
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,400
listen and

3074
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,300
put back

3075
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,720
all this

3076
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,080
nonsense.

3077
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:26,960
I had

3078
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,480
to travel

3079
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:27,960
my own

3080
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,640
way in

3081
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,480
my dad's

3082
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,180
cast-off

3083
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,000
Galagaskins.

3084
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,420
Now I'm

3085
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:32,840
going to

3086
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,500
walk about

3087
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,020
no more.

3088
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:34,820
I love

3089
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,340
the bees

3090
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,180
around here

3091
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,720
and the

3092
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,360
trees and

3093
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:37,680
flowers.

3094
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,220
Bees,

3095
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,340
trees,

3096
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,880
flowers.

3097
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,940
I look

3098
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,540
often in

3099
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,100
the distance.

3100
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,880
There's all

3101
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,660
my departed

3102
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,360
relatives.

3103
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:46,880
Well,

3104
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,220
I'm not

3105
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,440
going to

3106
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,140
give them

3107
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,320
anything.

3108
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,780
Clean up

3109
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,060
Armenia.

3110
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:53,620
Get a

3111
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:53,940
hair lip.

3112
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:55,980
You can

3113
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,620
help the

3114
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:56,980
Armenian

3115
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,540
Republic

3116
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,640
continue to

3117
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,020
exist.

3118
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,720
I must

3119
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,300
do is send

3120
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:01,700
all your

3121
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,260
money from

3122
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:02,540
the United

3123
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,280
States back

3124
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,960
home to

3125
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,140
me.

3126
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,420
Shorban

3127
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,200
Arzanian.

3128
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,000
That's

3129
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,460
Shorban

3130
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,040
Arzanian.

3131
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,900
The

3132
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,300
hewn

3133
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,660
Armenian.

3134
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,840
He's

3135
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,560
rough hewn

3136
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:12,940
from

3137
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,720
solid

3138
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,240
matter.

3139
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,060
He's a

3140
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,620
good fella.

3141
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,400
Kind of

3142
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:17,720
chunky.

3143
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,400
Regular

3144
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,740
looking.

3145
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,180
Regular

3146
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,560
features.

3147
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,180
What's

3148
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,460
regular?

3149
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,300
Well,

3150
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:22,840
he's a

3151
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,440
regular

3152
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:23,960
dealer.

3153
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,200
Has bowel

3154
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:25,680
movements at

3155
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:25,920
the same

3156
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,340
time every

3157
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:26,520
day.

3158
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,060
Exactly.

3159
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:27,500
There is

3160
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:27,660
that.

3161
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,460
That can

3162
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,940
be understood.

3163
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,000
And what

3164
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,560
other ways

3165
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,200
are he is

3166
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:32,520
regular?

3167
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,660
Well,

3168
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:33,980
he's,

3169
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,420
he follows

3170
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,160
the regs.

3171
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:36,700
That's for

3172
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:36,960
sure.

3173
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,220
And he

3174
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,260
has even

3175
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,440
features of

3176
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,280
his face.

3177
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,020
Yes,

3178
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,680
that is

3179
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:42,960
true.

3180
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,540
Such a

3181
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,000
pleasant

3182
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,680
evenness.

3183
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,880
Almost as

3184
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,740
if sculpted

3185
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,300
by some

3186
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,120
divine

3187
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:48,960
phidias.

3188
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,000
So perfectly

3189
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,360
symmetrical,

3190
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,040
his heart

3191
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,560
is directly

3192
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,940
at the

3193
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,600
center of

3194
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,100
his chest

3195
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,740
between his

3196
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,100
lungs.

3197
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:54,600
And

3198
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,220
unfortunately,

3199
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,560
this makes

3200
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:56,960
him prone

3201
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,460
to heart

3202
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:57,740
disease.

3203
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:58,820
Well,

3204
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,480
that is

3205
00:58:59,480 --> 00:58:59,860
unfortunate.

3206
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:00,260
But,

3207
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:00,620
you know,

3208
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,020
you give

3209
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,300
a little,

3210
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:01,680
you get

3211
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:01,960
a little.

3212
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:02,360
He would

3213
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,240
have no

3214
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,160
more

3215
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,500
problem.

3216
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,460
Simply

3217
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,280
remove the

3218
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,560
heart,

3219
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,300
place within

3220
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:08,780
the use

3221
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,020
of the

3222
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,440
parts of

3223
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:09,860
the brain

3224
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,200
to

3225
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,500
reconclude

3226
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:11,760
or

3227
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,320
capitulate

3228
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,360
a new

3229
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,280
form of

3230
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,880
heart and

3231
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,380
perhaps just

3232
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,000
pour gasoline

3233
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,620
on him and

3234
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,000
set him

3235
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,360
on fire.

3236
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,200
It's

3237
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,800
neither left-handed

3238
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,420
nor right-handed,

3239
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:20,860
but begins

3240
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,800
each line

3241
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,640
of text

3242
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,320
on the

3243
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,020
opposite ends

3244
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,500
of the page,

3245
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:24,920
writing with

3246
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,420
both hands.

3247
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,140
And that

3248
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,720
brings us

3249
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:27,760
to the

3250
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,200
end of

3251
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,400
this

3252
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:28,960
particular

3253
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,500
first

3254
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,380
hour of

3255
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:30,640
Slack.

3256
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,180
What?

3257
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,180
Yes,

3258
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,260
we've been

3259
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,020
recording for

3260
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,100
exactly one

3261
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,680
hour.

3262
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:35,920

have more

at some

point.
