Hey Jill here, Aerosmith, Fleetwood Mac, Bon Jovi, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
Yes, Brian Adams, Bob Yip, Sub Geniuses, their pets, Bluebirds, and all of their worldly goods.
Because friends, you can take it with you when you're a Sub Genius, sure.
A throne of gold can be yours.
You can take off and get it on.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Don't bother me for a while, I'm busy.
Stupid idiot.
You know, it's just occurred to me we really haven't had a completely successful test of this equipment.
I blame myself.
So do I.
I have no sense worrying about it now.
Why worry?
We are...
We are...
We're home.
We're home.
That sounds like caterwauling dying people.
We are home.
We're home.
Bob.
Bob.

This is brand new because nobody remembers it from them.
If you didn't buy it.
I'll continue.
I know it's hardly delete.
It's gonna take, I'm gonnaコmpletely
all impacting something, is what I use.
Give me a thousand bucks and let's get secretly hot and grab a

Like
it's
permanent happiness.

Oh, this episode is nothing at all like any recent episodes, or old ones for that matter.
It's almost entirely created by the Cleveland weirdo named Sheridan, who I've never met, incidentally.
He wanted to give me a break and maybe show off a little bit.
So he did two whole shows, of which this is the first.
There'll be a break in the middle for rare Just Unearthed songs by Nenslow and The Swingin' Love Corpses.
But now, back to the media barrage of Sheridan.
We have to take some baby steps to ensure that we have backup plans in place, right?
Hello?

Good job.
here and i'm the one who has to work
um hold on wait it's is it any better no it's not besides preaching slack he also
provided warnings he's been warning us that all this was going to happen since 1953 and in fact
his most succinct and true prophecy was it's going to be a bummer man
life is
Let me, let me, what about now?
We're about to save.
Uh, okay, hold, hold on.
Let me, let me, what about now?
We're about to save.

Okay, hold on.
Bob said in 1953, it's going to be a bummer, man.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
We'll be right back.
As Bob said, for the first time last week,
it sucks to be born every minute.
Coming to get you, Barbara.
Coming to get you, Barbara.
That was completely new, and in fact, training was needed.
We have one more first we'd like you to try.
The levels of energy storage we have achieved are some of the same order of magnitude as those in supercapacitors.
Oh my gosh.
We will not be held back in our efforts by any kind of law or moral principle.
Oh, yes, indeedy.
Lately, there's been violence in the streets.
The moon is full, but hearts are dark, Dolores.
Danger in every stranger.
You may...
This is not a rerun.
RUN!
RUN!
We just did a can of did-a-dell, cops down there, all this game.
RUN!
RUN!
RUN!
This is more serious than any man's enemy in this damn naughty town.
RUN!


RUN!


Wh-Haa-
Hup!
This does not have any redeeming social value.
It's outrageous still.
Maybe I could make a good rock star.
Why don't you do something else for a change?
Get out of this house and make yourself a friend.
No!
Yes!
No!
Yes!
No!
No!
Yes!
A dear friend's a...
I mean, if the flat Earth is real, then...
There's, like, some place getting, like, 20 feet of snow.
I don't know.
All right.
The Church of the Subgenius is a club.
For non-joiners.
That's okay.
It's your mind.
It's your brain.
That's the pure definition of privacy to me.
As Bob also said in the pre-scriptures,
there will be a long and hard time of false slack for the masses.
Until the very last breath you have, please don't ever come out.
OK, let's talk.

OK, I'll talk.
So what would you be, during your holiday?


Um, if you're gonna go for a harvest, these medcum comes into play.
Oh, has it?



Keep your business, please leave mine alone
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry how I hurt my friend
Cause my success is driving you out of your head
Go around, door to door, talking about, about me, door to door
Send to your business and leave my affairs alone
Greetings and welcome to the premiere of the brand new show that we're calling, You Know
The premise is simple, we invite famous celebrities, musicians and authors on for a one-on-one interview
The very first time they say, you know, the interview ends and the next guest comes in for their turn
This process repeats until we're out of famous people and we begin interviewing the staff here in the studio
An added feature is that one half of our You Know point is awarded for each time the guest uses like instead of um
Beginning a sentence with so will be frowned upon but not penalized
So, we're ready for our first guest
Please welcome Miss, Miss You Know

On the sibble
So, Matthew, can I call you Matthew?
Yes.
Very good.
So, Mr. Matthew, how did it feel to be named Sexiest Man Alive by Two Wheel Bicycle Magazine?
Well, you know, I didn't...
Oh, boy, that was fast.
I'm sure there's somewhere else you need to be right now.
So long.
Our next guest is the famed African-American writer, Tom Nisey Coates.
Come on over.
Over, Mr. Coates.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, let's get right into the deep.
Do all black people think they can sing?
Yes, because they can.
Yes, it's like, you know, the first time you, like, talk to, you know,
your children in that, you know, sing-song voice for, like, the first time.
It's an immense, you know, great release.
I am overjoyed that you could be on our pilot episode.
I delayed the bell because you are so prolific with those words
that I just let you go.
I'd be willing to bet when you're thinking and writing
that you don't weave those words into every sentence of the page.
Yes, but the first time I said, like, it meant similar to.
Nice try.
Bye-bye, Mr. MacArthur Genius.
The next guest is John.



Gene Simmons from the rock band Kiss.
Hello, Gene.
I'm warning.
How are you?
So, Gene, just how long is that tongue?
Wouldn't you like to know, babe?
Okay.
I'm not going to wait for you to say,
you know, I just can't sit here and look at someone's balls
wrapped in shiny, tight, black leather.
Sayonara, Simmons.
Wimb.
Oh, next we have, uh, well, we have our cameraman.
Cameraman Curtis.
Welcome to the other side, Kurt.
Uh, uh, well, yeah, yeah, whatever.
So, my man, how are you?
Well, you know, been better.
What the?
Curtis.
Curtis.
Curtis.
You are part of the crew.
You know the rules.
What is wrong with you?
The only thing I like about the show is the paycheck.
Am I done?
Can I go?
I have to polish my lens.
Well, it's a little bit of a mess.


Couldn't get any thicker.
I mean, what's there on top of that
lane?
Uh...
With this.

If you could fly to Dobbs Town in a twinkling of an eye.
Do you think that you could ever get in to see that guy?
For the line extends forever in time and into space.
You could never get in to see that guy.
You could wait for all eternity and never see his face.
His pipe is always burning.
His teeth will always grin.
For he knows you are unworthy and wiltering in sin.
You think you're a subgenius.
But he knows you're just a dumb.
You'll never get out of hope.
Although you'll wait forever you'll never get hope.
There is no end to sorrow there is no end to pain.
There is no end to conspiracies that drive your mind insane.
There is no end to cruelty.
There is no end to greed.
There is no end to Bob Dobbs.
There is no end indeed.
If you could fly to Dobbs Town in a twinkling of an eye.
Do you think that you could ever get in to see that guy?
For the line extends forever in time and into space.
You could wait for all eternity and never see his face.
That was Nenslow, just unearthed, never heard before.
Next up, a swingin' love chord.
Bob Dobbs' piece that no one heard for 25 years.
The reggae version of Jumpin' Jack Flash.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I was born in a crossfire hurricane.
I was born in a crossfire hurricane.


And I howled at my boy in the driving rain.
But it's all right now.
In fact, it's a gas.
It's all right.
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.
It puts you in deep sleep.
We can do anything if we just jumpin' Jack Flash on affected space.
Everything夏 살.
We'd like to say thanks for sharing your blues.
And on happy Mom, everybody.
I hope opportunity full of laughter and stories inform our fun years,
Well I was born in a crossfire hurricane
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
For the soul, right
Yeah man, it's alright
Yeah man, it's alright
I was propped up
I was worshipped and left for dead
I fell down on my feet
And I saw they bled

I was crowned
With a spark right through my head
But it's alright

Oh well, looks like I have to place myself again.
Friends, these are shit.
Strange times, uh, that I sort of expected for much of my life, but not this way.
It's actually even more stupid than we expected.
Way more stupid.
But I guess that's the way of Jehovah One.
Uh, Bob can only continue to guide us through, and we can only follow Bob's lead.
Yeah, I mean, even when he's blindfolded.
So praise Dobbs.
And let there be slack.

To my near right on CD players 1, 2, and 3,
I've got something ready to fire off of turntable number 2,
and I'm not sure what turntable 3 has to hold.
What is holding out for us? I don't know.
I never know what's going on on turntable 3.
It's a very mysterious turntable. In fact, it's so mysterious,
it's not even located in our main air studio.
It's down the hall in a very dimly lit corner.
A lot of cobwebs going on in that corner,
and there's a mysterious odor like cat urine
or leftover beef-vegetable-stew mix.
It's right next to the ladies' restroom, in fact.
I don't know if that has anything to do.
It's got that peculiar odor.
And turntable number 3, I believe,
is located beneath the haunted tampon machine.
He didn't realize that he had accidentally started
during the eight-and-a-half-minute silence.
But that was okay with me,
because I really wasn't looking forward to that anyway.
I get stiff.
I miss you.
I used to believe that Bob could screw up that bad.
But if he does, I want a new false god.
I have a coupon.
Buy one, get one free.
But they're always out of stock,
and I don't want to wait
three hours for the rain check.
Then let your mind conceive
the falling
of the rains
and blossoming of
rainbow flowers.
Ah!
just won't hear them

Don't touch the pipe, son.
You will burn in the fires of whatever someone put in the pipe to smoke it.
Devil is amongst us.
Stay back, boy.
This calls for divine intervention.
No.


No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
That's right.
Each one of the Bobs in the book sees.
Did you know that every picture of Bob has the power to view you?
Has the power to look at you and look into your very soul?
Every picture of Bob is not just an image, not just a meaningless, mindless graffito.
Those dots are alive.
Look at you.
Each of those dots pulses with unfathomable radiant energy.
Each of those Bobs next to those toilets all over the U.S.
You are really...
You are really lucky because you are now finally by accident being delivered from the false religion.
The biggest trick the devil ever pulled on you to the church of the subgenius.
The difference between you and us is that we have brains.
We have brains!
We have brains!
We have brains!
We have brains!
We have brains!

I can see brains, a brain!
I nobody ever thinks you have self-esteem orワ
I try to think that we are not spices.
We think that we are€»
I say I don't know you don't know me and I busy talking with you this whole time.

that was igual to my brain,
not stupid people.
You will pay to know what you really think.
Once upon a time, there was a poor child.
There was no father or mother.
Everything was dead.
You will pay to know what you really think.
As long as the music's loud enough,
we won't hear the world falling apart.
The world is dead.
The world is dead.
Imagine, inside a computer's memory,
there's this string of 13 light bulbs.
Light bulbs that IT people call bits.
Each one representing a different power of two.
So that first light bulb represents
two to the power of zero,
which is one,
because anything to the zero power equals one.
Don't ask.
Second light bulb?
Two to the first power.
Which is two.
Third bulb?
Two to the second power.
Four.
Two times two, four.
Four.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Okay.
Now, in order to represent numbers that aren't powers of two,
uh, all the computer does is turn on multiple bulbs at once.
A sequence of power of twos.
For example, when Maria got her third,
it turned on the first and second light bulbs from the first.
Because one pl-
When she got her fourth,
it turned off the first and second light bulbs,
and turned on the third.
Two to the second.
When she got her fourth,
it turned off the first and second light bulbs,
and turned on the third.
Two to the second.
Bulb.
Two to the fourth power.
Sixteen plus the first bulb.
Two to the power of zero.
One. Equaling seventeen.
And so on.
So, we knew that the result could be traced back to the-
Thirteenth bit flipping.
What we didn't know was what caused the bit to flip.
Okay.
What- What could cause this bit to flip?
No idea.
I'm sorry.
That's the way things go.
You know, we just simply had no proof of what caused the bit to flip.
We just don't know.
That's the way it, uh, it turned out.
.
We're most concerned is that the people can trust the electronic-
. We're most concerned is that the people can trust the electronic-
system and with this sort of problem.

We are not sure the people can trust the system.
No, no, they must be moral.
Nobody can understand this sort of vocabulary,
and I was confused with the explanation.
.
This phenomenon is extensively described in the specialized literature.
.
Yes, we did write that.
.
.
What- What- What- What were you referring-
through there nothing in particular
what's this why they not explain what's really happening what can we check who
can check who will check but I say hey wait I did computer science studies and
bits are not flipping what are they talking about so I need it to find out
blah blah they said yes if the cosmic ray touch your computer the right way at
the right spot it could change a bit from zero to one and my first reaction
was to see hey hey hey cosmic ray hey what a joke
yes when they
invest in the data they just don't know exactly what's going on but then they
I figured that they found out that it could have been cosmic rays causing problems.
I see.

Sorry!

I will not share any of this.




I will not share anything with you.
We will not establish a relationship.
We will not have any meaningful dialogue.
And we definitely will not spend any quality time.
