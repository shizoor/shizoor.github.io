In the tombs where you fled to escape your fellow man, to escape from your inferiors,
from the halt and lame of mind, do you speak to men, you pious vomit?
Your abode is in a nest of peacocks, Meron.
Well, that's certainly enough of that. Our guest was the demon from The Exorcist.
And now let's go to our next guest. What you're talking about here is
Doctors for Extreme Prejudice, our guest here tonight in the studio down here by the beach.
Yes, for the first time, Doctors for Extreme Prejudice hits the West Coast.
Look at that go. Yes, yes.
Bob Rotman.
Bob Rotman.

And when the doctors get together, they like to relax with a few shots and a few shots.
Yes, a few shots and a few shots.
It's all right, it's all right, Doctor. You'll be okay.
No. Holy, holy Bob.
That's just another fine Doctor for Bob, all puffed up and swollen with the sound of rant.
Hey, Doctor.
Doug, did you gas the show up?
No, I don't think I did. I better check.
Okay, I've got my credit card, so I'm gonna go gas it up while you guys clean the windshield.
Get some Raisin Bran, okay, and some big newbies and stuff.
All right.
Now we're ready to go to...
Camera 3 and the closest shot of this scary operation which we've been able to see this morning.
And here are the little tree frogs that used to inhabit the island and came...
Oh, come on, get them off me.
Hey, you wanna get those frogs off me?
They're jumping all over the bathroom.
Get those frogs off me.
Where's my torch?
How do I get out of here?
This is sticky.
I'm going to the other end of the house.
Wait, you've got the wrong show, dog.
Oh, this isn't the Bolivian show?
No, no, no.
This is the Oakland show, right?
Yeah, right.
The Berkeley show.
The Berkeley show, right.
Take the frogs off.
No frogs here.
No, no, you need muggers and police cars.
These are not good operating conditions here on the football field with all these dogs strutting around the temple.
But they get whatever's left over and that's what we call the eco-balance of nature.
Nevertheless, I'll try to wake up and talk.
Hey, dog, you wanna give me the keys so I can get the tank unlocked?
Do we use keys in this show?
Well, if you want me to fuel up the show...
I guess so.
I guess we better use them.
Well, I have a key.
Tonight the show's going to various scary parts of the world.
We're going to the wrong, wrong right side of the Yakutizma Perception Center
where people are going to...
stretch out their little maple eyestitch fields
and we're going to look for babayons in a Gargamel Chow's cavern.
Not for no one, neither.
We'll take the show back to the far other side of the extent of where we haven't been yet.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.
What you gonna play?
Now, Bobby, I don't know.
B-b-b-b-b-baaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, strap in.
The show's about to take off.
...about two and a half miles in width.
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.
Hey, did you bring your law firm?
I did, it's right here in my briefcase.
Break it out.
Well, break out what you can and let's get them to signing these papers.
Right.
How are you gonna find out before we get them all signed?
This, uh, stand has to be terminated with extreme prejudice.
Shh.
Okay, okay, okay.
The state doesn't know about that yet. We're still signing the papers.
Sign over there.
Now, could you sign this piece of paper?
Okay, now, over there.
Ah, okay.
Will you have your wife sign this piece, please?
The children need to make their marks here and here.
Tevis, sign here.
And the house, the house...
Oh, here are the papers for the house.
The cars have to sign here, please.
Oh, yes.
Someone else has to sign.
And all three of these parts to find itself are in deep trouble.
We are in trouble.
Are we possessing rights?
Okay.
Here at the singing lawyer.
This is the...
Oh, again, sign the final agreement.
Still signing.
...staying in return for the two-thirds of my sole back from the other bankers,
hereby give the church to the bank.
And, uh, I'm signing right here.
He's just singing.
And right here.
And, uh, he's signing chapter three.
Okay, I've got to pick up what I've got here, guys.
He's getting his chance.
We can't wake him up in the middle of the night and take his church away with his kids sleeping and his wife.
I'm sorry, he's just lost it.
The church no longer belongs to him.
Stang, I've got two-thirds of my book in the mail myself.
Look, here's Stang calling in to tell us he wants his church back.
Hello, this is Stang.
Where's Bob?
Well, you don't have to worry about Bob because there's a new church.
Oh, is this time control?
So here is your future, Wiz's past.
On your video screen, you can see the bad things that happened in 1984
and the good things that'll be happening in 1985 when your new religion is being sold.
Sorry.
What is wrong?
What is going on?
Sorry.
One thing I had to say is that somebody wants our church back and agricults want to see it live.


or that one ¡uh!
Just disgusting.

There is nothing to Weakening U say,��자.

Uh, yes, and that's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about, friends.
Uh, we, uh, once again, one of those thrown-together shows,
well, actually, I edited it about a half an hour's worth of stuff,
but I've got some great music.
It's about time we played it.
There's a new album, or tape, one might say,
from Lost Souls Incorporated here in Dallas, Texas,
or actually in Arlington, the city, the mid-city city,
and, uh, you know, I could just play, it is so good,
I could just play the whole Lost Souls Incorporated album.
I'm not going to, but I'm gonna try to put in two songs from it tonight.
You'll love this stuff.

I was having the nightmare of the apocalypse again
When you woke me with your phony bedside screams

Since Pavlov and his dogs have had their day
We're drooling green and we recycle everything

Trying to steer the upside down
I'm a down world trying to ignore the entropy
Trying to steer me upside
I'm a down world talking about the 20th century

Now I'm back

It's time to say death
Right now
Oh yeah
It's time we set an air
Beautiful, beautiful, and more of Lost Souls Incorporated coming up, dear friends.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
What am I going to do with my daughter here?
Sivit, do you have anything to say,
or is there any reason that you've come to this show to hang around,
aside from the fact that it's Father's Day?
Oh, she's unplugged the microphone.
There.
I fixed it.
Why did you come down here today?
Because it's Father's Day, and I love my daddy.
Oh, man.
The best daughter in the whole world.
That's what I've got, dear friends.
Well, we hate to get personal on the Hour of Slack
or show any feelings, human emotions,
any crack in the facade,
any tiny breach in the armor,
is, of course, uh...
Well, it's a blessing in the eyes of Bob, dear friends.
Oh, yes.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Now, if you will excuse me, I must be on my way.
Jekyll.
Are you sure?
Oh, it's... safe.
Ha ha ha.
Primitive people have been using it for centuries.
Cool, man.
Okay, here are the two shows.
I'm gonna put some show on here for you, and I'm just...
trying to get my show together here so I can give you some show.
And I'll still be able to send you some show.
Oh, and now I would like to present...
Beautiful day.
His...
His Excellency, Count Hohenstaufen von Liechtenstein.
Our guest tonight.
The Count has a war wound.
He's not able to speak very well, but he's sickled by...
Rem.
He waves his stumps and, uh, thus communicates.
Yes, and here we are, flying high over the hill.
Oh, my God.
The hills of Berkeley now.
Whoa, look out!
Cleveland Donuts.
Don't...
Call her!
Call her right outside the building.
Come on.
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.
It was almost a half second.
Good.
Oh.
Come on!
That'll last forever in my memory.
First time ever.
Okay.
No.
Okay.
Oh, more.
Oh, oh.
We got some more.
Why do I feel that they're...
Bergman knew how to use the...








... silence?
The silence of the soul.
Sure is nice out here.
I hope the boat comes, though.
Fellini knew how to use silence.
Gary said he was going to.
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands...
Yeah, I know.
Don't touch him.
... that giant flaming oar...
Oh, yes.
Mr. Boatman.
Please, Mr. Boatman.
Uh...
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue, and it's all black and icky.
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.
No, no.
And be prepared for the next time.









I'm prepared to go past my dog, my three-headed dog's cerebrus.
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates, the gateway.
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
What's he reading from?
Yes, I am away...
It's a B-movie script.
... into eternal sorrow.
I am the wage of forsaken people.
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.
I don't know.






It is getting hot in here.
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.
... beyond me and beyond time, I think.
Yeah.
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.
It's nice out here in the ocean.
It makes you feel a little bit of a problem, doesn't it?
Oh, look out.
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his kite from one hand to the other, pulled out from his voluminous
ditty bag a sop of cakes with wine and honey, fermented, which he threw dexterously into
the slavering three mouths of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous entrance.
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.
And a mighty belt shook the canine's bulging stomach.
His three-headed thing wafted in the air.
You're not going to get me to mention that.
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts on the world of mythology.
It's horrible three foreskins quivering.
His gigantic, populous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably as with two-headed men.

In canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor, howling and dribbling from
all three heads simultaneously.
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell and saddled up to Ivan's leg.
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.
Pino, why did you make me do that horrible thing?
Yes.
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling.
For you and not for me.
Take my glands away, King P-Dog.
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.
Yeah, they don't ever stop.
Yes, from Cerebus the P-Dog, they all go for Ivan's leg.
Ow! Get that, you! Get those horrible little poodles off of me!
I hate poodles!
That was Madame Ruzanga and her dancing chihuahuas performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and darkness.
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Dr. Howell.
What a nice service.
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were capable.
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?
Good morning, Michael.
Oh, I'm sorry, Michael Jackson's not going to be on tonight.
Instead, we have Lost Souls Incorporated, which are, believe me, every bit as good, and I'm sure you'll enjoy them just as much.
This is a little ditty called Elvis Don't Live Here.
And, ah, yes.
By the way, now that I've got this music from Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in the background, I have to say, I hope when I grow up to be 70 years old that I'm more like Dr. Leary than Mr. Harryhausen.
Because I went to the Fantasy Fair this weekend, you know, a big sci-fi convention here in Dallas.
And, praise Bob, Ray Harryhausen was one of the guests.
The great special effects expert.
The man who really, if anything, is responsible for the church of the subgenius, one might say.
And many, many other subversive and evil things without ever meaning to be.
He just presented us with what we could not see in the conspiracy world.
And so we chose that other world.
But, you know, he's an old man.
And I was at that convention.
And I was hoping I wouldn't hear this, but I did hear him bad mouth Jurassic Park.
Yes, Ray Harryhausen sat up there and said,
Well, anyone can push buttons on a computer.
But this, the things we used to do were handcrafted.
I don't think that, ah, that for $50 million,
or whatever it is.
Friends, you know it's sad when one gets so old,
he can't appreciate the fact that something is done better and more beautifully and easier with a different technique.
And I can't believe I'm saying that about Ray Harryhausen.
One of the truly great, great men who has ever lived.
Yes.
But, ah, but to hear anybody,
I'm sorry, but to hear anybody bad mouth Jurassic Park,
that just makes me sick.
What do you say, T?
Can you believe it?
That's what I say.
I tell you, man, it's a mess.
You know, people get to be old fogies of some kind or another.
Now, which, which tape was I going to stick in here?
Oh, yeah, Lost Souls Incorporated.
Elvis don't live here no more.
Uh-huh.
Elvis doesn't live here anymore.
And if he did, he'd have long since changed the decor.
Now, they won't let you walk on the grass where the king played touch football with his friends.
But you can write your postcard home saying you were there with him.
We drove for a thousand miles listening to his cassettes.
Crashed in some sleazy motels with broken TV sets.
Just to drop out a C-note off some sacred relics,
the postcards, the keychains, the cups.
To listening to him on the way home made me want to throw up.
Cause they're popping him in from the top.

From the Lisa Marie to the Heartbreak Hotel restaurant.
And they'll never ask what you expected, just what do you want?
What do you want?
Because Elvis doesn't live here anymore.
Oh, no, no.
Even his spirit avoids the place I could have sworn.
And it's a shame to admit, but like all of the sheep, I was herded quite docilely by
the programmed security robots disguised as tour guides.
Who's that laughing at me?
Oh, so derisively.
It couldn't be just in my head, no.
That's the spirit of Colonel Tom Parker that's always learned.
He's got the looks there.
And he's lurking there.
Saying what he wants.
Better out there.
Saying what he wants.
Better out there.
He said the time has shaken our little house down to aience.


Elvis doesn't live here anymore.
He's always gatherings, seusses, Seven of the forgiven,
but only dishes and a retriever.

And I'm gonna take him home and do the rest.
And if he's so cheap and you can't cry his grave side, that's all right.
There's no time for tears.
And if you're like me standing right there, you'll feel like you're light years from here.
Cause they're piping him in from the Lisa Marie to the Heartbreak Hotel restaurant.
And they'll never ask what you expected, just what do you want?
So what do you want?
And I heard a lot of food and stuff.
Okay, there hasn't really been that much, but go ahead, what's on your mind?
Well, I'd like to talk about salvation instead.
Okay, I'd like to too.
It's more, to use the other discussion, it's more nutritious.
You know what I mean?
I do, yeah, food for the spirit.
Yes.
Wait, you got a card?
I don't know nutrition in salvation, not in fire.
Mm-hmm.
Salvation comes first, that's for sure.
It's not the difference between good food and bad food.
I wouldn't eat a McDonald's packet of Burger King, you know?
And I just don't, you've got to be able to choose.
You do, and that's the first step to knowing God.
Appreciate your call, Marge.
Thanks, Kamal.
All right, now turn the record over, and we'll hear more about this great plan of ours.
Here is some more racism in the Bible.
And God told Isaac and Rebekah, the sons of the world will become two rival nations.
One will be stronger than the other, and the older shall be the servant of the younger.
This means that the African nation shall be the servant of the younger.
And the older shall be the son of the new nation, of the whites.
This is clear and clear.
Racism in the Bible once again.
Now, who tainted the Bible?
Satan!
Satan again has tainted the Bible.
All faggots must die and die and die in the fire of hell.
Faggots, send as much money as you can before you die to this day!
Eat your wretched lust for a while.
I hate to break up your game, but we're leaving for Earth as soon as possible.
Yeah, that's what we're doing right now, dear friends.
And the swinging love corpses will help us.
I wish we were leaving Earth, actually, is what it comes down to.
Uh-oh. I'm not politically correct.
Father!
How about the, uh...
Iraq has a hydrogen bomb.
Father!
How about the, uh, in Bangladesh?
3,000 people are killed in a typhoon in Bangladesh.
3,000 people are killed in a typhoon in Bangladesh.
Bummer!
Bummer!
There's a trillion dollar deficit.
Bummer!
Kind of a bummer.
I can't myself buddhi.
I cut myself shaving.
Oh...
Bummer!
Bummer!
Bummer!
Hitler killed six million Jews in World War II.
It was a bummer!
Bummer!
The greenhouse effect for...
Well, he killed the dinosaurs.
Oh yeah, right. When an asteroid hit the earth,
all the dinosaurs were killed as a cloud covered the earth.
Real bummer!
Bummer!
Help! I'm falling and I can't get up!
Bummer!
Bummer!
That song is a bummer.
Come on!
You can scream louder than that!
Ah, come on man.
I'm sure you can...
scream.
Can't you? Can you not scream louder than that?
Tevis, what do you say?
Is it hot? What?
I can scream very loud.
And Willow Dog knows it.
Yes.
Wait a minute. Now, what is that?
I can scream. I can scream very loud.
You can...
Any 12 year old girl can scream loud enough to wreck the eardrums of a hundred grown ups.
Or dogs.
Yeah.
Yes, dogs.
Oh, yes.
Yes, we're back.
I guess we're back.
And we're not very beautiful, really.
...thing for earth as soon as possible.
Say, Mac, could you like spare some change for like a bite to eat?
What?
Ah!
Here! Now go on!
Scram!
Like, bless you, sir.
Deadbeat!
...and get good milk from a brown skinned cow.
The color of the skin doesn't matter no how.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ha, ha, ha. You can learn common sense at the grocery store.
We shall begin.
Sit down in your favorite chair.
The chair in which you do your reading, your thinking, and your relaxation.
Or lie down on your favorite Chesterfield.
Drop your arms to your sides.
Relax completely.
And now, listen to my voice.
We're like a slowly growing organism in its infancy now, but gradually maturing.
A super race.
Well, yes.
But not an evil super race.
Still in the future, there won't be any room for imperfection.
But who chooses?
In medicine, as you know it, your organ transplants are forcing a choice.
I mean, who should have another heart?
The mental deficient or the great philosopher?
Hmm?
Or an artist?
Or some great statesman?
Now don't tell me that you would choose the deficient.
They're breeding with our daughters and spreading their AIDS.
Spreading their AIDS.
They're just, they're intermingling in the blacks and the Jews.
Imagine that, a new chocolate race.
Okay, okay.
Disgust!
Racism!
This is what racism and the Bible leads to!
This is what we've been telling you about!
These heathen masturbators, the heathenism, or the Satan-worshipping racists that we've been talking about!
You're not paranoid!
It's just that Satan is everywhere!
He's all around us!
He's right behind me!
He's in front of me!
He's to the left of me!
He's to the right of me!
Satan is everywhere!
He's in our schools!
He's in our classrooms!
He's in our youths!
He's the drugs on the streets!
And Satan is taking over!
He's taking over the hearts and the souls of mankind!
And there's this teeny few of us who must combat this evil!
You seem to have forgotten something.
You must not forget, Doctor.
You have to murder them.
Well, my dear young man,
we are for the future.
Now I ask you,
what future do they have?
God!
Give us some preachers!
God!
Give us some preachers!
God!
Give us some preachers!


The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius also takes a little bit of explaining.
And I've been searching for an example, children, and I think I've found it.
The Church of the Subgenius knows, as you do not yet,
that the conspiracy is out to get you, children.
It's out to sap your lifeblood.
And you have to deal with the conspiracy every day.
And things that happen to you
that give you the existential blues,
you may not recognize them as a conspiracy,
but they are.
And because of that,
the Church of the Subgenius knows that you should elevate
every confrontation with the conspiracy
to the ultimate.
So that you don't lose sight
of the stakes involved.
And that's why we call this rule
Or Kill Them.
Let me explain this, children.
I was in a store.
I was in a store one day.
I was purchasing a few objects.
Or as you say in New Orleans,
objays.
And I was looking at the store.
And I stacked my objays by the cash register.
And something caught my eye on the counter.
And I went over to look at it.
Wasn't that interesting?
I turned back.
And some pink-wimp conspiracy mind-deaf
had taken my line,
my spotting line,
at the cash register.
Children, this was not a minor event.
This was the conspiracy incarnate.
And I said to him,
excuse me,
but I was in a store.
I was here first.
Then, and he said to me,
no you weren't, I was here first.
You may mistake this for a meaningless confrontation, children,
but it was the conspiracy incarnate.
And that's why I turned to that man
and I said,
I was here first.
Or kill me!
The next rule of the Church of the Self-Genius
is an intro into the next part of this section
and I'm going to tell you
what the subgenius is
and what makes a subgenius.
One thing you can always say
about subgeniuses is that
they pick fields
where it takes your entire lifetime
to fail.
Children, subgeniuses are artists.
They're writers.
They're musicians.
They labor in obscurity, children.
They work hard.
They work alone, children.
They work alone.
Because the conspiracy wants you to believe
that if you are a creative person
you have to be out there alone.
Shut off from the world.
In touch with your views.
Because the conspiracy wants you to believe
that you cannot unite children.
But even the people
who have to be alone to work
need a community, children.
A collaborative network.
And that's why in the Church of the Self-Genius
we say,
individuals get lonely too.
And,
that's where I decided to
just cut in on my edit.
I had some good cuts that go with that.
But I'm going to instead play this
yet one more song
by Lost Souls Incorporated.
Sort of an anti-romantic song.
And I think some may appreciate it.
And I think some may appreciate it.
And I think some may appreciate it.
Lost Souls Incorporated, dear friend.
Lost Souls Incorporated, dear friend.
She doesn't channel spirits of the dead.
She isn't all that great at making beds.
She isn't all that great at making beds.
Her figure isn't stunning
but it won't embarrass you
at the beach either.
At the beach either.
She might suggest to me
that I'm her kind
It's true if love is
lame as well as blind
I'm willing to endure the average lifespan
So I must be glad to meet her
Medium girl, I guess I'll marry her
And father mediocre children
Some middle class neighborhood
Medium girl, it's hard to sing her praises
But she's maybe best for it for me
Girl's okay
She'd be so easy to back close for
If I ever went to the mall
I'd pick her birthday card at random
She'd thank me for remembering at all
Medium girl, I guess I'll marry her
And father mediocre children
Some middle class neighborhood
Medium girl, it's hard to sing her praises
But she's maybe best for it for me
Girl's okay
In a world full of people
Always yearning for something
Till we settle for anyone
I'll take her
And it's dumb as a program
On your cathode ray t-shirt
Yet you follow the
Line of least resistance
I'll never write a symphony for girls
And I'll never write a symphony for girls

Instead I'll buy a string of phony pearls
She's not exactly clever
Maybe I could convince her
There's something real
Medium girl, I guess I'll marry her
And father mediocre children
Some middle class neighborhood
Medium girl, it's hard to sing her praises
But she's maybe best for it for me
Girl's okay
Just okay
Yes, I'll marry her
Our used pee on her
I did choose her poison
And spoke the girls of today
Incorporated. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Was I thinking about playing some more music tonight?
Well, why not? We'll do it.
It's Greg Keeler, dear friends, in Bozeman, Montana. Another independent production, as
everything we play just about is.
It's Greg Keeler, dear friends, in Bozeman, Montana. Another independent production, as
everything we play just about is.
I hope hell gets here soon. This Sony cassette recorder might pick up these last words. So
I'll press record and tell my tale and hope someday I'm heard.
I was the new age cowboy and I walked the mountain trails.
With my llama name, Persephone, I sought the hidden vales.
With chest over made of cream.
I was the new age cowboy and I walked the mountain trails.
I freed myself from sin.
And harnessed my computer to ride the solar wind.
I've channeled all the Aztec gods.
I've listened to the sea.
All I ever wanted was to set my body free.
All I ever wanted was to set my body free.
Free, angry, sugar free, AIDS free, drug free, fat free, smoke free, booze free,
beet free, caffeine free, milk free, odor free, smog free, interest free, care free,
all I ever wanted was to set my body free.
I was the new age cowboy and I rode a cosmic range.
I chased the fads, both good and bad.
I changed with every change.
With pistols made of crystal.
I freed myself from sin.
And harnessed my computer to ride the solar wind.
Now the flames are closing in on me.
Burning plastic fills my nose.
So I'll zip this Sony in a baggie.
And toss it in the snow.

Music.
Music.

Yes, Greg Keeler there.
From his album.
What is this album?
I honestly don't even know.
But it's Greg Keeler,
Bad Science Fiction I think is the
name of the album.
And it's probably about time that I gave
you some helpful hints
as to what you've been listening to.
to dear friends and background music here you know a feller tries to get in
and do this radio show dirt back no there's just a hum listen to that name
any kind of background music you can't use that it says it's playing anyway a
lovely lovely long stretch of material here we've had a lot of KPFA radio show
pieces from puzzling evidence dr. Howell and in this case
special guest G Gordon Gordon we also find ourselves listening to a cut my it
I pity myself having to read my own handwriting I really do you know KPFA
some Christian calls to radio talk show programs I believe in Oregon from and I
those were sent in by
Reverend Jim Blanchard the fine Reverend Jim Blanchard with his huge
prank call collection which is sort of interspersed with ours what are you two
doing over there hmm Tevis well I'm playing with a pin have you got nothing
better than my eyes work oh great you've taken a sharpie and and marked up a
perfectly good
good
touch with the ball knocked out oh she knocked the ball off of ballpoint pen
here at the station that was my ballpoint pen at one time I think and has
marked up an old newspaper and done some sort of extravagant avant-garde artwork
I yeah okay also we heard from the the Church of New Faith wonderful preaching
there from Church of New Faith early in the show media barrage material from
Reverend Jim Busser who has helped us out many times in the past and more of
that coming up Vincent price our Reverend Vincent price of course member
of the church talking about the super race and Pope David and Meyer on the the
rant about the church doctrine of order
kill me.
In Turks and the subgenius we say, individuals get lonely too.
Tell me about it.
Tell me what you like.
Oh, it is so good.
But I don't think you like the way you taste it.
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?
I know this will sound funny to a scientist.
I can't taste it.
Okay.
And now, this.
This.
That thing is still running.
What have we got here?
Oh.
Why don't I run the show from the left side of your brain if you want.
Okay, here it will unplug the right side.
The show stumbled on its own one and a half feet.
Come on, doctor.
This man is bleeding to death.
Okay.
It is all better now.
No.
I'm not even listening to your show.
Good, good.
But we can't stay to be on your show because we have another listener.
We're picking up those vibrations.
You are not.
You are not.
You are not.
You are not.
We are picking up those vibrations.


Another dead radio station.
Jerry, please.
I am desperately lonely.
Jerry, hello?
Yeah, you're lonely.
Well, he lost him there.
Now, I have, fortunately, and not too often,
I have been deceived here.
We've had a couple crank calls.
One fairly recently, a week, week and a half ago,
which, you know, I was brought right into the middle of it,
and then the person kind of started laughing at the end.
And that's fine,
because I'm not always going to discern who's right on.
And I know that there are some callers
who call and switch names.
And they'll call a second time,
or maybe another night,
but under the frontage of a different name.
So I have to, again, I'm saying,
I have to depend upon the Lord.
At least that's my desire.
It's hard to do.
Hi, Andrea.
Hi.
Hi.
I have something that's totally unrelated.
Oh, well, then forget it.
Hi, Malcolm.
Hi.
Hi, my name's Malcolm,
and I'd like to talk a little bit about
what that last caller was talking about,
because it fits into what I'm talking about.





I originally called to talk about,
I mean, I have to say I'm a compulsive eater.
Okay.
And I'm attracted to worldly things,
like food.
I can't stop eating.
And it's really hard for me,
because I know that God wouldn't want,
or doesn't want me to be compulsive.
It's not a Christian thing.
Just like smoking cigarettes,
compulsively,
is a bad thing.
And just like taking drugs compulsively
is a bad thing,
if taking it at all.
And I think that,
I think I'm going to eat myself to death.
I think that I'm going to get so fat
that I'm not going to be able to fit into heaven,
if you know what I mean metaphorically.
And I really don't know what to do,
because I'm compromising
my not being a part of this world.
I'm cutting myself off from my lifeline to Jesus.
I've got a message for you,
Bob.
The office says it's important.
Good.
Keep going.
Is this some kind of a joke?
Believe in the power of the dogs.
I believe.
Believe in Bob.
Reach out for him.
I'm reaching.
Sorry, sorry.
We didn't mean to bring up the program.
Drop the sacred name of the program.
Not on the ground.
This is kind of incestuous,
you know,
a radio talk show.
Calling a radio talk show,
I mean.
Hello, caller.
I just walked in.
Well, so did we.
Everybody's real quiet.
What program is this?
How did we get here?
We found this show in progress,
and nobody's running it.
Where's my car, caller?
Did you have the keys?
Where's my car?
Give me my car back, caller.
I want to go home.
People are weird.
And we either deprogram them
or teach them to stay or kill people.
Here's the deprogramming going on right now.
The battle between the two.
Between churches continues.
Well, that's what churches are for.
Okay.
And I lost my car.
This is a message for world peace.
Look.
And sometimes it is a hard task,
but it must be done.
Satanism is becoming an organized religion,
just as Christianity is.
It is going to amass its intelligence into one force
and overthrow Christianity
if we don't do anything about it.
And he's going to overtake Jesus on earth.
And it's up to us, brothers and sisters,
to make sure that this does not happen.
The Pope's out to get us.
The U.S. government is out to get us.
The governments where we have our ministries are out to get us.
Communists are out to get us.
Nazis are out to get us.
Racists are out to get us.
Derelicts, atheists are all out to get us.


And we must combat these evils.
Since that day, it is worth a toss,
one-third my purchase price.
Thereafter, groups of assassins ready to barge out after me in the foyer
lurked in all stock brokerage offices.
I did not dare to even watch the ticker tape from the sidewalk.
I went into hibernation,
waiting for the computer god efforts to murder me
in the brokerage offices to relax.
Early in 1969, secretly,
the computer god controlled and manipulated gangster government
issued a warrant for my immediate arrest and incarceration
in a maximum security environment.
I was sent to the insanity prison to be cured forever
before I could go before any parroting puppet,
hangman rope gangster judge to give testimony.
Since 1969, I hide alone in this house.
All deliveries, food, etc., I mail order,
adding five bucks for delivery.

God understands!
That thing of wandering around,
I don't know what I've done wrong.
I don't know what I've done wrong.
That's hogwash every man.
Wandering around, I don't know what I've done wrong.
Wandering around, I don't know what I've done wrong.
That's hogwash every man.
That's hogwash every man.
Knows what his head in his hands and pulled his hair in his hands and pulled his hair and clawed the ground.
I know what that is and that doesn't include me, Brother Rodney.
Move on, move on, move on, move on, move on.
Just move on, move on, move on.
This is it.
Here it is.
This is it.
But there's one thing.
There's one thing that keeps us from giving up.
One sure weapon we possess.
The sole effective tool that we can, nay, must use to thwart the conspiracy.
Our indomitable, implacable, unswerving hate.
Yes.
Yes.
The church offers the same features as most religions.
Mindless aberration for an invisible dead guy and lots of hate.
But ours is a new kind of hate.
It has a superior way of festering than does theirs.
For ours may ferment, smolder, and explode into cash dollars for the hater.
Our hate is like a self-fueling fusion reactor.
Because the conspiracy gives us, the conspiracy itself gives us the energy to oppose it.
Its very hostility towards us is the uranium which fuels us.
Our hate dynamos.
Many foolishly see hate as negative.
But hate, that is, unsullied hate, Adamic or original hate, is merely the active nature of Wotan.
A cosmic principle so primal that humans can't conceive of it because it makes up their conception.
Subgeniuses, on the other hand, have since prehistory.
Deliberately exploited their inborn hate.
Have diverted it through the transformer of their inherently good natures.
To recreate it as the divine stupidity which drives man to build his great monuments, compose his sublime sonatas, and open his exalted pop bottling plants.
We're not talking about the pinks, run-of-the-mill, panty-waisted, limp-wristed little hate.
Oh, and you've heard this before.
Oh, I hate taxes.
Oh, I hate the president.
I hate my job.
Or, worst of all, I hate myself.
That's the diddly-fiddly-namby-pamby kind of hate.
A sick and weakly spitefulness.
Normal hate, bottled up, makes the mediocritan want to destroy what he doesn't have, whether he wants it or not.
Especially if it's something he might need but can't understand.
Subgenius hate gushes and erupts.
It spews and contaminates.
Eric, we were both taught that a psychiatrist's function is to find mental illness and to cure it.
As simple as that.
Obviously.
But at the cheaper hotel across the street, a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend were holding a little convention of their own.
These wackos call themselves the First Church of the Subgenius and they include, in their, to say the least, eccentric membership...
Bob.
Bob Bob.
Bob Bob.
Bob Bob.
Bob Bob.
Bob Bob.
Bob Bob.
What do they believe in?
Everything.
Who do they believe in?
A mysterious character named Bob.

Oh my God, that's so cool.
Bobbs is 8'8' and likes writing lyrics.
Roomoz combined, alright, with Tom Schrightl, the bomb.

That one's in Los Angeles, right?








I couldn't find him.
7-5-2-1-4.
7-5-2-1-4.
And you...
Why you...
Well, those of you who already know won't be amazed.
But the rest will love it.
And, uh...
And, uh, that's it, I guess.
It's after midnight.
Time to go.
Bye!
