here at aganya guam on this remote island we disseminate the subgenius word
you
through a long and painful process of osmosis administered to the islanders and to
round eyes alike bringing about a sort of neo-zen or apocryphal meaning
when civilians are subject unto this feeling
they too
are subject to this feeling
enjoy listening to knon alice texas
and the frequencies ivan is oh that's 89.3 fm in doubt well ivan it's probably time for you to take

gosh
gosh

When will you turn your date with me if you could call
a turnkey
listen to this
rather like a


radio
here
right here

over there
Today, more than 80 stations across the country broadcast programs recorded more than 40 years ago.
Their gentle, homespun humor seems demeaning to time.
Almost like a flower frozen in amber, it lives on.
A tribute to the lives and the hearts of two men who have lived their way through the first broadcast
with the folksy humor and advice that would become their stock and trade.
Some of you may go crazy, but not me.
No radio commentator is going to sweet-talk me into bankruptcy.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
I'm going to beat you up.
Just enough eccentricity.
Huh?
For they are all there, but one.
And that's Bob.
And you just...
See, it's part of the zen.
This is all part of the zen of corporate butt-kissing.
Yes?
That's the idea.
Show just enough abnormality that they think you're being real up front and honest with them.
You know, just enough eccentricity that they think you're not...
hiding anything or being a sycophant.
And that's the idea anyway.
If it's a rogue, unsaved subgenius you're dealing with,
they'll see right through it.
Oh, yes, friends, because we only turn the cheek one time.
They cut out the part where Jesus said,
and then if he slaps you again,
flay him alive in front of his wife and family.
Oh, yes, but let's get back to the show,
the lovely old, old show.
We'll see what...
Oh, here's one new little bit of a tune from So-So Dada
up in New Jersey, wonderful So-So Dada.
Friends, I want you to remember
you're listening to the Church of the Subgenius,
and remember your pledges to this station.
It's so, so important.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah, friends, I almost forgot to tell you about the, it's time to start talking about this.
Now that it's 1994, you need to know about the Portland Pilgrimage.
Yes, on X Day, 1994.
1994, not 1998, but this year, there will be the greatest subgenius event since the last Dockstock.
Yes, Reverend Orton Nenslow, Master Control, assassinated Nen Master, will be, well, we'll just see what he does now that we're announcing it.
X Day, July 5th, 1994, go to Portland, friends.
That's all I'm going to tell you right now.
Because if you are, well, it's true that we may dangle many bobs before you, and it is up to you to choose the correct bob.
Now, I will be giving you specific hints on how to do this, and so you can't say that you had any excuse.
And this is the way that we find out whether you are chosen.
If you are of a discerning nature, then that indicates you were chosen to go to Portland and make the pilgrimage, the X Day Pilgrimage.
In the name of Bob.
There will be no free rides for Janer, by the way.
That's one of the main selling points of this convention.
That's what Nenslow told me to say.
And here's his post office box number.
That's box 86582.
That's right.
Portland Pilgrimage, X Day, at, this is the place to be on X Day, 1994.
P.O. Box 86582.
Portland.
Portland.
Portland.

Oregon.
Zip code 97286.
And you can call the station if you didn't get that.
Will will tell you or something.
But I'm here to talk about the meanest, the baddest, the dumbest redneck that ever lived.
I'm, of course, talking about Bobby.
Bobby Cream.
When he was 12 years old, he was beaten by six other students.
His back was broken.
He was operated on by government, not doctors, but government scientists.
They rebuilt him into a man.
Nay, not a man.
A redneck.
No, not a redneck.
A scarlet neck.
Nay, not a scarlet neck.
A black neck.
He became Bobby.
Bobby Cream.
Now, I think you'll find that.
Bobby Cream.
Bobby Cream.
Is the tri-syllabic divine incarnation of redneckery.
If you just say the words, Bobby Cream.
Bobby Cream.
Can everybody just give me Bobby Cream?
Bobby Cream.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby Cream.
Now, do you feel like if you just sat in a lotus position and just repeated, Bobby Cream.
Over and over, you could just go out and just rob a convenience store or steal a car or...
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.

Bob.
Bob.
Bob.













And now, as we do the long expensive Crane Shot Interview, giant offices at KPFA Olympics,
Reverend Hela's stretched out, reading the morning news, preparing the show.
Do you see this, Farnsworth?
They claim that the ratings of the show are down 20%.
That's ridiculous.
I've never had so many people telling us how much they enjoy the clean, virile, masculine
taste of the show in the morning.
There's something about it that
sets you on the right way.
It's like drinking a big jolt of
jolt cola or hot
coffee.
I really do.
Boom!
I ain't got nobody
now.
I'm holding around, I mean.
When the sun go down,
I'm in my brown
boucher jello.
My roll.
Three moths, you let it fall.
Just touch you, grab you,
put it in a way that I
couldn't get it till I
had my right mind.
Still in the low time boucher jello.
You know, only the lucky can die,
and all of you who think you're in danger of death
are actually in danger of something far worse,
continued immortality.
Eternal boredom.
Closer and closer.
Into infinity.
You think that is nothing bad?
You haven't lived as long as I have.
Oh, the collar fell away.
But, yeah, I'm not supposed to talk about that either.
Too many secrets.
As the man said to Ivan Stang,
if you turn the tape recorder off,
I'll tell you the real story.
And he went for it.
Of course, again, it's no big conspiracy.
It's bureaucratic ineptitude,
which explains most of everything.
Yeah.
It's raining.
As the rain falls on the castle of Kahnstein,
only one yellow light shows
that the inhabitants is up.
And as we dolly a little closer,
we see...
Dracula.
It's Dracula,
but he's not doing what I expected him to.
It looks like he's squeezing a pimple
on the end of his nose.
This is ridiculous.
Well, you see,
he can't look in a mirror,
and so he's very clumsy at performing.
The problem with Dracula is it's so, um...
It's so binary.
Either you're with Dracula or against him.
Dracula's got a little short, stupid cape.
Because it represents...
That's too many teeth.
That's too many teeth.
There's just the powers of Dracula.
Look at that haircut.
That's ridiculous.
The power of evil.
Oh, man, great.
And then he goes to the policy security guard
in the bathroom and kills him.
The immortal Count Dracula.
No, that was Renfield.
The Dracula never went into that bathroom.
Oh, I see.
Oh, now he kills negative land.
Oh, that's cool.
Star value, I guess.
He ate the eyes, and he ate the flies, and...
Oh, yes.
A very popular character.
Well, our test audience for Dracula in New York
seems to lap it up,
as it were.
On their laptop computers,
they attend the virtual theater with enjoyment,
but now realize it's time to get back
to the fabric of their lives,
to resume the small connections
and the great,
which cause the seamless web work
of the fabric of life
to sparkle with unvarying intensity.
A president who could do
what no other president has done
since the beginning,
and the president of our republic.
Unite the people.
The universal empire.
Pennsylvania.
What a guy.
It's like an old Chinese legend.
The story of the blue will plate.
That was the name of President Dracula's yacht,
the Blue Willow.
Yes, it went down off Hatteras,
with no known survivors.

It was only less than,
well, it was actually less than half a mile from Oman.
And George Bush's gas-dizzling gunboat.
There were no callers.
There was no one except the mystery sound effect man.
Yeah, a tiny tape player at the end of the wire.
If only he would speak,
the Count's mephitic powers would be loosened.
And here, it's almost time to go see him.
In addition to the well-publicized ability
to transmogrify,
the vampire can also cloud the mind of his victims,
and can exert an evil hypnotic spell.
One does not need to look into the blazing eyes
of the fiend to be affected.
One may even be affected,
one's reflexes slowed,
and one's mind reduced into a torpid state,
from a distance,
as the foul creature,
the revenant,
works his malefic will.
What?
The only extermination of vampires that can be valid
must begin with a belief in their super old natural existence and activities.
I have devoted 20 years of my life
to hunting down these pestiferous fiends
and eliminating them.
Hey, guys,
if you're sending me on a guilt trip,
the least you might have done
was pack me an overnight bag.
One for my friends Liz Bean and Homosexual, too.
There's nothing wrong with these pinks,
and an expensive operation wouldn't prolong.
You know, friends,
the only bad thing about reincarnation is
that someone will get these osteocephaloids
for a past life someday.
Oh, they ought to be charged with assault
with a deadly weapon.
They need Preparation H with sunscreen in it.
This is right,
rigid Reverend Bill Burroughs said,
paranoia is simply having all the facts.
Just because you're not paranoid
doesn't mean they're not out to get you.
But as Jethro Bodine said,
once you've tasted the joys of outer bohemianism,
daddy-o,
you can never go back to the past.
You can never go back to squares, Bill.
Here we say,
honesty is the best policy,
but insanity is a better defense.
Pull yourself up by your own bra straps.
You don't need sex.
Sex needs you.
Oh, don't let this slice of lifelessness get you down.
Reality is highly overrated.
If we wanted a simple life,
we would have been born paramecia.
Ah, it seems like it's fallen to us
to change the world,
even though we weren't the ones that dumped in it,
diapers.
So friends,
grab the reins of this runaway stagecoach
and get back on the path to Slacktown.
The lifestyle you save may be your own.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Oh, no, no, no!
Hey!
Bayern,
japa,

Tell them to sign my Tattoo.
I can't find any room over on the bottom left
A group from down in the midst from the bus
It's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
It's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
You look all everywhere you turn
To roll your head up on the pleasure of death
The world's getting stuck on the tip of your tongue
She's the real thing but you knew it all along
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
Look into your mind, the water is
Looking into your mind
Spinning around the world
Rock on with just a minute's our own love
She's just a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

Spinning from somewhere you can't see
She's life on top of every next change
She's fun down on her own, I'll run if I love
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
Look into your mouth and walk away
Look into your mind, spirit
Why don't you just admit it's all a rush
She's just a girl you want
She's just a girl, girl, a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want
Everyone says I love you
But just what they said it for I never knew
It's just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who says I love you
Take a pair of rabbit's hooves
And start cutting chatter and begin to woo
And pretty soon you'll find a million more rabbits who'll say I love you
When the lion starts getting frisky and begins to roar
There's a lot of lions who know just what he's roaring for
Everything that ever grew
The goose and the gander and the gosling too
The duck upon the water when he feels that way too says
He's got a little bit of a heart attack





This is Rudy Schwartz Project, our friend Reverend Joe Newman in Austin.
In this case, not from his regular CD, but from a CD called Past Normal.
It's like a sampler of bands from this place called FOT Records, or FOT Records in Bloomington.
And there's some great stuff on there.
I may play the next song.
But first I should give you some credits.
Just before this one, you heard Girl You Want, the Devo song, performed by Soundgarten.
Prior to that, Reverend Susie the Floozy ending her little repression rant.
I think I'm going to have a different background here.
There we go.
There, I like that.
And Dr. Howell, of course, in Puzzling Evidence, talking about President Dracula.
And show ratings.
Sort of a sexy song called Hang It on the Wall.
It was a sexy song, believe it or not.
By that old guy that R. Crumb did the comic strip about.
The old blues musician.
I can't remember his name.
You'd have to ask Joe Riley.
And, of course, Jane or Hyperclete's there talking about Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby.
And I'm not sure what next.
We're going to flip the tape in just a minute.
And we'll just see.
What comes up next.

Well, now where's my CD number two?
What happens if I hit this thing?
I ain't getting nothing, friends.
They're trying to mess me up.
Well, I guess in that case, perhaps I'll...
maybe there's a lesson to be learned here. Maybe what I should do is forget the CDs,
forget the slick stuff, and go back to the good old days, yes? Now, at this point in the show,
we're going to let negative land and puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Palmer Vreedys, Gary
Brogfran, the band that dare not speak its name, take over. It seems about a month ago,
old Puz, as we call him, Puz Ev, was asked, but negative land was about to go on tour.
They do a radio show, or at least Don Joyce of negative land and the rest of them at some point,
I don't know, do this show over the edge on KPFA in Berkeley. And they sometimes invite
puzzling evidence to come in and take that show when they're, in this case, they were
about to go on tour.
Well, puzzling evidence thought, now the band that dare not speak its name hasn't played together
in three or four years. What a perfect time to play together on the radio in front of everybody
and with negative land. So that's what's coming up here. For those of you old time hour slack
listeners, you will delight in these renditions of your old favorite band that dare not speak its
name hits.
Peapod, Dobbs, poster of Dobbs, and of course, the irrepressible Dr. Howell never shutting
up while the songs are being played. So it's oldies but goldies. For those of you new to
the band that dare not speak its name, you'll probably throw up.
I wonder if we could have a word with you, Dr. Weird.
Digitally, we can edit that, but what we'll need to be doing on track 24, we're going to be doing a
little more is, is using Jay's pick, the sound of Jay's pick being crushed by a steamroller.
And then we can, uh, then we can do the show.
You take the ability to talk for granted, don't you?
They don't respect the equipment.
They dance around wildly.
Then why shouldn't you? You talk every day of your life and you don't think much about it.
I'm in the band. I'll come, okay, I'm going to be on the band.
Okay, I'm giving backstage passes to all of you that are listening to the show.
What a band. This is the battle of the bands.
I heard Negative Land's gonna do a new album soon.
So we got hot and ran down here to KPFA to start on ours.
Yeah!
And you can join us.
We can play power chords like this.
He's giving enormous influence on the music of the 1990s.
The 1990s?
Mike Dario.
We hired some more guys.
That's all we can tell you about them.
Mike Dario is a former free dose.
And Reverend Hal.
But we're not gonna let them. You can't hear them.
They're just...
His gift to me, to Macquarie,
started a whole new wave of underwater music for fish.
I can't hear myself think.
What's the matter with your generation anyway?
Reach out with your generation.
Let's combine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull groove.
This guy can't hear himself think.
Let's do it this way.
More and more and more.
Did you see that thing, Hal?
Well, I went by so fast it was above my thresholds of perception.
I like to think of it as superliminal projection of a junior sample.
Oh no, look, the lawyer's line is lighting up.
Well, that's alright.
You know, every time someone calls, we make $2.95 an hour for them.
Yeah, but every time that lawyer line calls, we have to pay $3.95 an hour to some lawyer.
Well, somebody has to pay.
You don't expect these things to rub themselves, do you?
Now, you know, you boys...
Well, I've been looking at your performance evaluation and your contract is coming up for...
It really stinks.
Well, thank you for being so blunt.
Not at all.
I appreciate the bold, masculine directness of your voice.
4-4-2-5-1
Yes, 8-4-8-4-4-2-5-1, this is your night to serve.
Rather to get so hard to futilely attempt to contact the Transplant Radiant Show.
All the organs and organelles in the system have indeed been lifted and patched in.
To a new creation.
Stitched together out of the parts of other shows and youthful bone hormones.
And joie de vivre.
I wouldn't hit you.
I wouldn't cry to you.
I have your best interest at heart.
You know, if you have an enlarged and irritated prostate and have to get up several times a night for bladder-related complications...
Then why shouldn't you?
We will improve your problem.
And why shouldn't we?
It's the very least we can do.
Talk every day about an operation for severe varicose veins.
Don't have one.
Just listen to this program.
You'll forget that you have veins of any kind.
Now, some people are very concerned that they're developing a stomach paunch.
But when you listen, you won't worry about that either.
You won't need to use your eyeglasses at all.
Just your ears.
And you'll recover naturally.
Far beyond even your doctor's expectations.
Your hernia will heal in a matter of weeks.
It won't have anything to do with us, but that's part of the miracle of nature.
Your migraine headaches will disappear.
And your constant asthma attacks will sink below the level of your perception.
These are all improvements not usually covered in exercise manuals.
It's what we call...
Musicotherapy.
This anti-music of an industrial noise band, whatever that is,
is guaranteed to lift your spirits and even to get grandma and grandpa tapping their feet.
Mary Ruby, is Podunk wanting to know?
Yes, I'm sure she does.
Whose highly sophisticated vocal style makes the down-to-earth beat of bluegrass music
to the intoxicating laughter rhythm of the hall?
Well, I didn't get up yesterday and even know that grass is usually green and the sky is blue.
They're trying to convince me of things that are just not so.
While I know for sure that there is just one moon in the sky.
I'm bored.
Or...
Excuse me.
How does this have any value?
We need to enter into second food.
Yes, a second food.
Hold on to your pants.
Hold on to your hats.
We're going to have a lot of fun.
Because if you are interested in popular music,
and you possess a small telescope,
just plug your Walkman radio into your ears and keep listening to this anti-music.
Go out and focus your attention.
There's no reality.
You might make a momentous discovery.
One that would eclipse the discoveries of the world's greatest observatories.
You have a chance to zip it up.
Possibly.
Find an extra moon.
And why should...
Talk every day of your life and you don't think much about it.
Well, think about it now.
Because that little body might be hurtling across the sky
and only you with your backyard snooperscope
could be on to this amazing astronomical discovery.
And if you continue to listen to our program,
I, Dr. Howell, will tell you how you can spot this hurtling meteor of the sky.
But in order to be relaxed, including the optic muscles necessary
to focus on such an interesting discovery,
you must listen to a heck of a lot more anti-music
played by an industrial noise band, whatever that is.
You have a good chance to find this suspected second moon to the Earth,
a comparatively tiny meteoric customer,
an iron stone ball some four or five hundred feet across
without atmosphere and frozen to the core,
if you follow my instructions
and refer to page 43 in my book,
Seeing Your Own Brain.
Yes, it's a mysterious, strange little body
pulled from its course by gravity
and effected by comedy here on the Earth.
Believed to revolve around our Earth once every three hours,
traveling at an incredible speed of about three and a half miles per second,
it's worth a mile, about 2,500 miles per second.
Your modest three-inch meteor scope should reveal it.
But it's a small, scudding black speck that never passes across so unmoved it.
If the suspected second moon really exists,
it is reasonable to assume that occasionally it must pass between
the sun and moon, moving rapidly across in six or eight seconds.
Reports have been received that such a body has been observed,
but these must be substantiated.
The only way to leave the optic vein to see this tiny satellite
is to release it.
All the body's muscles,
all the body's connection between brain nerve and muscles,
only anti-music such as you hear on this program
is a sufficient counter to follow this awe-inspiring physical journey.
And once you've undergone this set of journeys,
not only will you spot Earth's tiny parasite satellite,
but you will be unable to keep from seeing it again and again.

Whoa!
Sit on the floor.
There we go.
Do I get to mix in here?
I think so.
You can do it on the piano.
B-pa-da-da.
I'm having a mix in here.
Whoa, maybe if I could get a little, uh...
Volumatic mix.
Yeah.
So, now that sounds really good.
I think I'm going to do it on the piano.

Let's do it.

Go ahead.
I'll do it again.
Put it on...
And I'll take care of it when you hit the start.
Okay.
Also, you varietals out of the ao.
If people that aren't used to it, can have a little more practice of perseverance.
Try That.
Sounds good, shoot.
I'm just ahead of you
Are you scared, scared?
Are you close enough?
This is the good part
We're all carrying the posters down and ripping them up
We were playing the media cards
And the little listeners
All the little listeners out of KPFA
Are calling the station now
They can hear us playing from blocks away
But it's still a piece of paper
Oh!
You close the door
Are you scared, scared?
Are you close enough?
Are you close enough?
Closer enough
Why did you do this to me?
Now I see everything I never wanted to see
Now I'm everything I never wanted to be
Oh, closer enough
Why don't you let me be?
Oh, you closer enough
Are you scared, scared?
Are you close enough?

A little closer?
Or are you closer enough now?
Or are you closer enough?




That's Dobbsalicious, friends!

Of that great old hymn
One of my favorite old hymns
This time performed with
A band that dare not speak its name
With Negative Land
Or actually it's
Let's see
I think our personnel on that was
Of course, Gary Brogue-Fran
On Vogue Radio

vocals and guitar, Palmer Vreedys on bass, Puzzling Evidence on drums, and somebody on keyboard,
possibly Dr. Howell. And while we're playing good old songs, but God, it's just such a sweet old
hymn, you know. While we're in the midst of doing old songs by our old friends, here's a song by
one of our new friends, Indian Rope Burn in Kent, Ohio. A fine band, Indian Rope Burn. This is a song
I got to see them play this live while at our last Subgenius Devival, our last tent show Devival
there in Akron. It was great. And this is a song they did, we'll see now, called Technoboard.
I will hit the little button.
It starts the song.
I will destroy you.
I will destroy you.
There you go. It says that now is the time to find my way to the top. Not stop. It's all in a game that I cannot win. Come again.

Yes, dear friends, Indian Rope Burn off of a CD. They have their own CD now.
Indian Rope Burn CD, lovely, lovely thing.
I told you we were going to play some amazing cover tunes tonight.
This is the Swingin' Love Corpses off of their... which album is this?
