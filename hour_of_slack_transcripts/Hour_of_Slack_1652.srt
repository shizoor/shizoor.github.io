1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Bud Light presents the subgenius power of swag.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,580
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,360
Don't stay in too long, or everyone will shout.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,840
Finish quickly and come back.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,780
One, two, three.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,960
I met her in a bar, naturally.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,960
And naturally she wanted to dance.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,920
I politely declined, naturally.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,620
I said I really hate this band.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,100
We went for a coffee at a little cafe.

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,440
I had more picks in my pocket than I had spare change.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,660
She said hold it right there.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,860
Just stop.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Where you are.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,560
Not another guy.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,440
Not another guitar.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,940
Couldn't get her off of my mind, naturally.

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,080
And so naturally I gave her a call.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,040
So when I answered the phone, naturally.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,720
Then I recalled that she lived with her mom.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,820
I said do you have a daughter?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,740
That's the fairest by far.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,900
She said who shall I cease calling?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,720
Who shall I say that you are?

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,800
Tell her lover boy is here.

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,680
And could I borrow her car?

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
Oh, not another guy.

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,560
Not another guitar.

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,360
No!

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,740
Not another guy.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,440
Not another guitar.

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,820
She said you boys are so, you're all the same.

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,940
You're chasing a dream that you cannot name.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,720
A shoulder to cry.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,800
A sofa to crash.

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,600
A mean little mama with no strings attached.

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,580
She said you should have a song.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,620
No better I should.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,660
But you go out and make it all sound so good.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,800
You're chasing a dream.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,800


42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,800


43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,800


44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,800


45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:28,800


46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,840
Well, to make a long story short, naturally, we fell in love and she done me wrong.

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,260
She say the same about me, naturally, but to my face and not in a song.

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,540
We're both gonna make that same old mistake again someday.

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,860
It's gonna happen to her, it'll sure not happen to me.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,140
There's just something in that music that makes us do that dance.

51
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,820
In that special room of tears and fear and fear and romance.

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,820
As soon as 19 sounds ring your big ID.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,960
You know you're never too young to be too old for me.

54
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,140
And I'm never too bad to be more trouble than I'm worth.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,220
Just another sad angel singing to the sad earth.

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,080
It's another long night, it's another long month.

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,040
It's another long line to hear another long tune.

58
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,040
It's another long line.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,160
It's across another long bar.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,960
Another girl, another guy, another guitar.

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,980
Another girl, another guy, another guitar.

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Well, I'm just another guy with another guitar.

63
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Just like Chris, another guy with another guitar.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Another girl sitting on the roof.

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,200


66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,940
Yes, dear friends.

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,020
This is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stagg.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:15,080
And I'm sitting in Tarzan's radio studio with buddy, the guard dog.

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,280
Princess Wee is in the kitchen cooking.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,420
And I'm going to read to you.

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,140
Oh, that was the Rainmakers.

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,860
I decided to read to you because we're going to publish another novel after Neighbor World.

73
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:46,700
Our next subgenius space opera, this one is, is called Eyelash by Nikolai Kingsley, who lives in Australia.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,220
And I'm not going to read this in an Australian accent because I can't.

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,500
I simply can't.

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,180
But here, let's, it starts with a quote from, I don't know how to pronounce this,

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:16,320
Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade of the Duke of Bangly, the 120 Days of Sodom.

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,380
Justifying his turpitude with equal amounts of cleverness and effrontery,

79
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,120
he loudly proclaimed that his poltroonery, being nothing more than the desire,

80
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:33,860
to preserve himself, it were perfectly impossible for anyone in his right senses to condemn it for a fault.

81
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,920
So that might sum up subgeniuses, and that's what this novel is about.

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,180
They were waiting for the end of the world.

83
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,260
The precise time and date had been set long ago, X day, 7 a.m., July 5th.

84
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
After that day had come and gone, it was just a...

85
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,360
matter of getting the year right.

86
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,380
Until that happened, it was an occasion for end of the world parties.

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:14,240
Elif Na Roach, formerly John Matthew Lee, hadn't taken any of it seriously until his abduction.

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,320
He'd been shown the reality of the situation through the always effective medium of personal experience.

89
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,640
He had once believed the whole subgenius thing was a joke,

90
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,120
a parody of millennia of the past, and that it was a joke.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,460
But it was a lie.

92
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,240
masala

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,240


94
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,240


95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,240


96
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,240


97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,380
stationary

98
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,800
abduction

99
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,840
zombie

100
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,360
I have out there this whole day to pretend to be stupid,

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,500
who will prove,

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,100
who will tell me about all the creatures and all that they do,

103
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,380
shock, he'd abandoned his mundane identity, burned his credit cards, changed his name,

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,580
and hidden in a safe cocoon of hermetically self-contained paranoia for two years before

105
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,300
he came across other subgeni who'd been abducted. It was one thing to look up at the stars and

106
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:23,600
think humanity would be exploring them one day, and quite another to realize it was already

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:33,360
very crowded out there. Crowded with things that made humanity look like a cluster of dazed

108
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:42,260
cheese mites by comparison. He dealt with it, mostly, but it was a sort of bump in the road

109
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:51,700
of life that left a permanent bend in your front axle. While most of the subgeni around the world

110
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,580
got drunk, danced, and made a lot of money, he was still a little bit of a man.

111
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:03,060
Made a lot of noise, Elif Naroche and Ty, no surname, huddled under blankets in Ty's backyard

112
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,720
and drank peppermint tea, anxiously watching the skies as 7am drew near. Elif was a short

113
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,140
34-year-old apprentice engineer with the rounded features of someone who's about to start a diet.

114
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,580
She was a helplessly mediagenic 26-year-old woman who was a little bit of a pain in the

115
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,700
neck, and had a few things to say about her. She was a young 18-year-old geek lesbian, or lesbian

116
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,800
geek, depending on who was to hand, studying neurology and artificial intelligence through

117
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:40,620
round wireframe glasses. Her black hair contrasting with skin pale from a life spent indoors. Her

118
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:49,820
every movement restricted by myasthenia gravis, complicated by a series of typically 21st century

119
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,580
autoimmune syndromes.

120
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,480
Elif nervously clutched his mug of tea. Ty's cup rested on the padded arm of her wheelchair.

121
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:12,160
This is pointless, really, he said. It won't be this year, but it'll be soon. I know they say that

122
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,100
every year. But her voice was soft, just audible over the sound of nearby traffic and sirens.

123
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,340
Before that day, Elif hadn't spoken of this to

124
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,840
anyone, not even the other abductees. But that's what he told me.

125
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:47,020
He? Him? You actually met him? He examined his mug. Actually him, the man. I met J.R. Bob Dobbs,

126
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,220
in the flesh. The dealmaker. The one and only high-e popped of the church's

127
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:01,920
subgenius. Elif sipped his tea and swallowed grimacing. He told me either this year or next

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,440
year, and I could tell at the time he was really worried about her. Ty hadn't been abducted, but

129
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,740
she had met some of the tentacled things that had taken Elif. She knew enough to take it seriously,

130
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,340
knew that Elif took it very seriously, and knew him well enough to want to lighten the mood.

131
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,240
What was he like?

132
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,800
Elif laughed quietly a series of short hisses from his nostrils and smiled.

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,440
He's a really nice guy. You'd trust him with your life savings, and if the deal went bad,

134
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,780
and everybody lost their money, you'd forgive him and trust him again. It's what makes him

135
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,840
such a great salesman. He's a little vague at times, like he's got a lot on his mind,

136
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,800
but you can tell he's very sharp underneath it all, and, uh, uh…

137
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
Glancing away with a smile, Elif looked back at him, and he looked at him with a very sad face.

138
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:02,120
He was probably the first guy I've ever felt even vaguely attracted to. I don't know what it was.

139
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,900
It was aftershave, I think. Maybe the pipe smoke.

140
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,620
Ty laughed.

141
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,900
You're the most relentlessly hetero guy I know, and you're gay for Bob.

142
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,460
Elif shook his head in a slow, dazed moment, lost in thought.

143
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,280
It's just one of the things about him.

144
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,080
He stared up into the sky.

145
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,420
Something halfway between meme and the aroma of the pipe smoke. It faded a little after

146
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,040
he went back to Malaysia, but it's always there. Like hepatitis. Like the Numa Numa song.

147
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,600
He poured tea and blew gently to cool it. It was a night like this. Clear skies, about

148
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,540
half past six in the morning when my phone rang. And, as he said the words, of course,

149
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,480
his phone started ringing.

150
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,060
He said,

151
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,580
And in a moment, he stared at her, eyes wide.

152
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,720
She gave him an encouraging hug.

153
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,780
Go on. Answer it. It has to be he!

154
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,100
He drew a deep breath.

155
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,800
I'm not ready for this. I'm not ready for the end of the world!

156
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,020
She rested her fingers on the back of his hand and tapped a five-button bat-keyboard

157
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,580
pattern.

158
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,940
With the cautious error of someone unlatching a gun's safety catch, Elif thumbed the pulsing

159
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,240
answer icon and held the phone to his ear. He didn't need to ask who it was.

160
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:38,820
Mr. Dobbs, hello. A pause of 15 seconds. Yes. Of course, yes.

161
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:51,380
Yes, she is. One moment, please. He addressed Ty. Are you up for a short trip into the city?

162
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,140
Her eyes widened. She was plainly exhausted from the evening's vigil, but the chance of meeting Bob

163
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:04,700
immediately said, hell yes. Elif nodded. We'll be there, sir. No, thank you. It's quite an honor.

164
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,920
The phone beeped. The call ended and a disabled access taxi pulled up in

165
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,560
the laneway behind Ty's apartment, ready for her wheelchair.

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
Well, friends, yes, they meet Bob.

167
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,320
And many, many terrors ensue.

168
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,500
Whoa, there's one of them right now. We better call Lonesome Cowboy Dave or cut to this.

169
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,640
So

170
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,620
you

171
00:13:51,940 --> 00:14:02,740
in about two seconds, some dumb mother will fire up the chainsaw.

172
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,060
Jesus only knows where I am, but I can't get him on the phone.

173
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,440
Right now, Jesus, me ain't much help. I need to get gone away home.

174
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,340
Now, Mr. Dunn, can I see?

175
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,600
Nicolai!

176
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,300
You gotta be kidding me

177
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,700
What are you laughing at?

178
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,860
This ain't funny, I don't get to joke

179
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,860
And what are you looking at?

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,060
Don't stare at a man when he's dead broke

181
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,240
Well I've seen things I never wanna see

182
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,200
Hoping it's a bad dream

183
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,440
Standing on a cliff, grab my wrist

184
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm gonna take your death with me

185
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,580
Nicolai!

186
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,620
Again I see

187
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,820
Nicolai!

188
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,740
You gotta be kidding me

189
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,040
Take the phone off the hook

190
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,360
I don't wanna look until everything's right again

191
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,640
This ain't the first time

192
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,740
Won't be the last, but I'll see you to the bitter end

193
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,000
I walked the plank, I robbed the bank

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Ignoring the consequence

195
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,080
Just when I think I made my escape

196
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
All hell breaks loose again

197
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,300
Nicolai!

198
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
For the eleventh time

199
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,600
Nicolai!

200
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,600
This life can't be mine

201
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,060
Nicolai!

202
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,120
You gotta be putting me on

203
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,880
Oh no!

204
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,980
Nicolai!

205
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
This is my song

206
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,060
Oh!

207
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Oh!

208
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,580
Oh!

209
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,100
Oh!

210
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,880
Oh!

211
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,260
Oh!

212
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,520
Oh!

213
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh!

214
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,020
Oh!

215
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,120


216
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,180
Oh!

217
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,780
Oh!

218
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:14,780


219
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,300
Oh!

220
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,940
Oh!

221
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,620
Oh!

222
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,060
Oh!

223
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,260
Oh!

224
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,800
Oh!

225
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh!

226
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,160
Oh!

227
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,120
Oh!

228
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,300
Oh!

229
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:25,920
Oh!

230
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,760
Oh!

231
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:28,600


232
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,020


233
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:29,620
Oh!

234
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,900
Oh!

235
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,320
Oh!

236
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:31,540
Oh!

237
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,100
Oh!

238
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,200
Oh!

239
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,420
Oh!

240
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,660
Oh!

241
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,060
Oh!

242
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,620
Oh!

243
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,020
Oh!

244
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,280
contacts.

245
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,220
C for cowboy, right?

246
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,860
He says the buzz is gone.

247
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,820
The buzz is gone.

248
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,780
The buzz is gone away.

249
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah.

250
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,600
Yeah.

251
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
The buzz is gone.

252
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,040
Hello?

253
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,500
Daveman.

254
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,760
Daveman?

255
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,480
Daveman.

256
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,800
No, it's Reverend Ivan Stang.

257
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,280
Oh, it's Reverend Ivan Stang right now?

258
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah, in Princess We Are Doe.

259
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,320
Yeah.

260
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,820
You just called, don't you remember?

261
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,280
You just called WCSB.

262
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,440
Yeah, that's right.

263
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,980
I just called.

264
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,200
Oh, how could I?

265
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,880
You're on the air, man.

266
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,280
Turn your radio down.

267
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,400
Hi, man.

268
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
The red light is on.

269
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
He scanned 25 minutes and a half ago.

270
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,720
I already forgot.

271
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,520
Can you imagine such a silly thing?

272
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,760
Well, you said that you could call early.

273
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah, but I also said I could fly.

274
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,180
And if boondoggles had wings, I'd be the Prince of Norway.

275
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,820
Dave, some people say you are the Prince of Norway.

276
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,460
Yes.

277
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,380
I am the Prince of Norway.

278
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,420
They've been saying that, too, Dave.

279
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,280
Long time for now.

280
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,040
Well, we're not really at WCSB, either.

281
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,800
No, I know, because you're an astute liar.

282
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
What'd you call me?

283
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,140
What kind of liar?

284
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,400
Astute?

285
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,300
Astute.

286
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
What kind of?

287
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,940
What's astute?

288
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,080
It's a person's...

289
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm a good liar.

290
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,840
I'm not a stoop liar.

291
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,440
That means, like, stupid, I bet, don't it?

292
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,480
Hey, I found my father's list of big words that he used to confuse and insult people

293
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,440
without their knowing it.

294
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
And they would know if they got confused, but they wouldn't know they'd been insulted,

295
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,300
because he was using chariantism.

296
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,760
He was practicing chariantism.

297
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,460
Chariantism?

298
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,420
Yeah, that was one of his vocabulary words on this little secret list that he carried

299
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,800
around that he used to impress people with his entomology knowledge.

300
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,480
Yes.

301
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,860
Which he actually did have.

302
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,220
I mean, he compiled the list himself, fair and square.

303
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,980
Yeah, he had a little entomology.

304
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,820
I should have whipped it out for this show.

305
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,060
I whipped it out?

306
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,420
Yeah.

307
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh, please don't.

308
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,160
The list, and then I used it on you.

309
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,540
Well, we'll do that next time.

310
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,160
It's for a future show.

311
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,780
Because I'd have to...

312
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm not sure where I'd put that.

313
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,940
You'll get to that.

314
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,760
It's in the can.

315
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,540
It's in the can.

316
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:39,300
Everything is still in flux and Charlie mucks here, because we unpacked everything, but

317
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,820
then we don't know where we put it away.

318
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm still looking for everything.

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,480
That's so true.

320
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,160
I have to look.

321
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:53,860
We've got ten different places to find every CD or tape or tool or soul or address.

322
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,040
So yeah, we kind of lost the canisters of a lot of souls.

323
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,300
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

324
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,420
The subgeniuses, I mean, they should feel safe.

325
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,340
They shouldn't feel like we've really lost their soul or anything.

326
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,340
Yeah, especially if you weren't going to huff it directly or immediately.

327
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,220
Not us.

328
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,520
Not us.

329
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,040
No, we wouldn't.

330
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,120
Are you kidding?

331
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,160
Bob would kill us.

332
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,960
This is what's going to be used to sell to the X-ists.

333
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,080
Right.

334
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,380
It's got to be passed down the line, so to speak, before it gets to...

335
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,960
Moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon,

336
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,020
central, part one.

337
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,560
Planet X, we call it, although that's not what they call it.

338
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,000
What do they call it again?

339
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,920
We wouldn't be able to pronounce it because it's not...

340
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
It's not done in sounds.

341
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,000
It's done in...

342
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,680
Which we obviously can't even pronounce.

343
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:55,660
So...

344
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,840
Yeah, it's all alien stuff.

345
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,160
It's so alien that you might as well just go, oh, it's magic.

346
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,040
Yeah, because there's no reference point in our scientific world because their science

347
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,920
has expanded beyond it.

348
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,060
Right.

349
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,780
They're so advanced, they don't even need science anymore.

350
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,420
Right.

351
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:15,420


352
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:15,420


353
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:15,420


354
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,160
It's just magic.

355
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,580
That's the way we could look at it.

356
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,500
Yeah.

357
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,320
That's the safest way for us to look at those particular aliens, and those are the only

358
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:32,800
ones we need to look at because they can beat all the other ones, except possibly the Yucatisma.

359
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,740
They got dodecahedron heads and stuff, you know, ten-sided heads and everything.

360
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,780
It's a weird customary asthmatic to be riding one.

361
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,960
They only have four.

362
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,000
They actually only have four faces on their heads.

363
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,760
But one fits on each side, right?

364
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,380
Yeah.

365
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
It's like north, south, east, west.

366
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,020
Yeah.

367
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeah.

368
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,620
That's right.

369
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:55,900
They do.

370
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, when they had bodies, they did.

371
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,240
Or their bodies may still exist somewhere, but they don't need them.

372
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,480
And what in the world did they do with their bodies once they throw them away?

373
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,200
We don't know.

374
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
We don't know.

375
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,440
But we know that they are bodiless aliens at this point.

376
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,980
And you don't have the right nor the Qualarones to call them disembodied?

377
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,040
They don't have bodies, but they have machines that do the work for them, of course.

378
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,640
Machines that might well be called the human race.

379
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,720
Yeah.

380
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,780
So, yeah, they're pretty good manufacturers.

381
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,200
That's the sad part at the very end.

382
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,660
Well, not the actual end, but right before the end.

383
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,580
Well, actually, the sad part is that...

384
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,180
What?

385
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,560
The...

386
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:44,760
The...

387
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:51,580
The X-ists invented on Earth near the end of the age of dinosaurs were the Yeti.

388
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,820
Our shared ancestors.

389
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:04,600
But unfortunately, the Yeti then went on to use X-ist downloaded technology to create the humans,

390
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,220
who were originally going to be like lab rats, but they got out and the bad Yetis started, well,

391
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,720
using them for pleasure.

392
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,520
And the next thing you know, they were little half-breed Yeti and humans, and that's where

393
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,360
the subgeniuses came from.

394
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,180
But then there were a lot more humans that were just...

395
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,260
That had no Yeti blood at all.

396
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,540
And they overran the Earth and they destroyed it.

397
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,360
And then they switched Earth with Mars, and now we're destroying it.

398
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,740
They're destroying it again.

399
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,700
And we're trying to get away from it before...

400
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Before they finish the job, so that we can finish the job.

401
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
From a distance.

402
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,920
From a distance, yeah.

403
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,600
From a parsec of about five trillion light years.

404
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,760
We don't want to get too close or we'll send your eyelids.

405
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,120
Well, we want to be able to see the details, the juicy details of the end of the world

406
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,820
that we're not part of up close in VR.

407
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
It'll be as if we were there.

408
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,200
It will really be, I don't know, brains in jars or something.

409
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,920
I don't care.

410
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,660
It doesn't matter.

411
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,060
Once we're ruptured, once we're on our way to Planet X, I don't care whether what we're

412
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,680
experiencing is real or not.

413
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,460
So I'm like the guy in the Matrix.

414
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,480
I just want another good, real good steak dinner.

415
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,160
Or how about they live where the guy...

416
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,260
It just has to be realistic.

417
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,420
That's all I ask.

418
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,240
So what?

419
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:41,080
I just remember the guy in the live Rodney Rodney Piper, whatever his name was, he ordered

420
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,140
a steak at the nun's.

421
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,500
They live?

422
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,060
Yeah, and he became a dystopian science fiction fool watcher.

423
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
Rodney Rodney Piper?

424
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,040
Yeah, he could eat more food, more, well, that's the way he phrased it.

425
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,600
I could eat more chicken than any man ever seen.

426
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,140
I don't know, that sounds kind of silly.

427
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,200
Another thing he said was, I came here to chew gum and kick ass and I'm all out of

428
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,400
gum.

429
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,380
Yeah.

430
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,140
Well, that's after he discovered that all the Republicans...

431
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,120
Yeah.

432
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:18,180
...were actually hideous skull-faced aliens from another planet and that the humans had

433
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:28,680
been hypnotized and brainwashed by these rays used by the aliens that make the world look

434
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,780
like it looks to us.

435
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,940
But if we put on the special glasses...

436
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,320
We could see the subliminal ads like disobey authority and smoke your mommy and stuff like

437
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,520
that.

438
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,620
Well, no, that was the opposite.

439
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,720
It was obey and marry and have kids.

440
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,600
You look at a dollar bill and it said, this is your God.

441
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,720
Yeah.

442
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,380
Yeah.

443
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,080
Yeah.

444
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,020
It was about as subtle as a sledgehammer and there was a lot of sledgehammer fighting in

445
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,000
that since it involved pro wrestlers as actors.

446
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,820
But that was a great John Carpenter movie.

447
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,980
It was iconic and of a truly subgenius nature.

448
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,300
Anyway...

449
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,360
Because it basically said your whole world was completely, completely fake.

450
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,120
You're seeing only the faintest echoes of what's really going on.

451
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,380
Yeah.

452
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,920
And that's what it's all about.

453
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,020
I mean, I remember when that fight was like Sparkets versus the Onion People or something

454
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,560
like that.

455
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:33,000
It lasted for three and a half hours here selling programs and people were walking around

456
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,920
with wieners and so forth and offering cigarettes to their various girls.

457
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,280
Yeah.

458
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,280


459
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,280


460
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,280


461
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,280


462
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,860
And they were dancing around the ballroom.

463
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,980
Now, Dave, is that one of your real memories or do you think maybe that's just part of

464
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,440
the dream?

465
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,440
I think it might be an implant.

466
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,120
I'm part of an implanted part.

467
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
That's my fear.

468
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,000
Well, yeah.

469
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,980
How would we know?

470
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,880
We don't know what year this is.

471
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,560
How would I know?

472
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,620
We know that for sure that we don't know what year this is.

473
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,400
And we know for sure we're not sure what planet this is.

474
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,680
Right.

475
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,280
So why would we know?

476
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


477
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


478
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


479
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


480
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


481
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


482
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


483
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,280


484
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,840
Well, how do we really know anything?

485
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,900
That's the epistemologist's dream.

486
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,940
How do we understand?

487
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,980
How do we know anything?

488
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,340
That's the flat earther's dream.

489
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
World looks flat, must be flat.

490
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,820
They fake all those pictures.

491
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,740
And of course, the round world believer just says, well, then drive to the edge and take

492
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,560
a picture, please.

493
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,180
Well, they hide the edge.

494
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,960
It's like, why?

495
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,620
Yeah, that's what I want to know.

496
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Why hide the edge?

497
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah, why hide the edge of the flat earth?

498
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,340
Just because we could, because we elites could, just to laugh at the rubes running around

499
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,920
thinking that-

500
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,680
To gaslight them.

501
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,660
Yeah, that's it.

502
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,680
That's it.

503
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,700
That's what Church's subgenius is all about, gaslight the whole planet.

504
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,500
I never thought of it that way.

505
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,740
Bob was pretty smart.

506
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,640
Tricky guy.

507
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,900
Yeah.

508
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,160
But what does that really mean?

509
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,840
I'm confused.

510
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,920
I've got a little empathic organ thing going on here right in my fetus.

511
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:23,660
It seems to me like if I change my shoes off enough, I'm never going to get where I want

512
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,500
to be going, so to speak, anyway.

513
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,320
You're speaking metaphorically, right?

514
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,440
Or do you really mean your shoes?

515
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,500
Those particular, because, you know-

516
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,260
Well, metaphorically, I'm not going to be going to the toilet.

517
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,260


518
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,260


519
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,480
Metaphorically, shoes mean your ability to get around, to dance.

520
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,220
Oh, I see.

521
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,740
Or to pilar, as they say in total Hungarian.

522
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:57,880
I get mine at Walmart, those Dr. Scholl therapeutic shoes that have Velcro straps, you don't have

523
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,140
to mess with tying them.

524
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,100
So, Dave, have you been-

525
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,840
It's slack full.

526
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,480
Changing your means of movement lately?

527
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,240
Yeah, because sometimes if your gluteus maximus is too tight, you're going to get a little

528
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,420
bit of a cramp.

529
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,540
Yeah, the gluteus maximus is too large for the whale board.

530
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,380
They have to put you on one of those-

531
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,680
There's a lot of good scrimshaw on that whale board.

532
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,840
Yeah.

533
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,440
But what's on the gluteus maximus is just gross.

534
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,860
That's not scrimshaw, that's for sure.

535
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,700
I don't know what it is.

536
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,480
But the gluteus, they've got to throw it out.

537
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,420
The gluteus maximus parts, of course, they have to be thrown out.

538
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,760
But sometimes, if you've got enough, you know, like make dog food out of it, or you can make

539
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,720
those hard cake cracker biscuits.

540
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,660
So they're not all-

541
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,120
There's the buzz came.

542
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,660
Hi, Buzz.

543
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,060
Everyone, listeners, all say hi to the Buzz.

544
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,560
Now we all got a Buzz together.

545
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,540
That's right.

546
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,060
It's my pet.

547
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,140
Man, that Buzz just kicked in, man.

548
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,340
It's my pet fly, Buzz.

549
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,380
Don't harsh my Buzz.

550
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,020
It's not too bad.

551
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,920
No, it's not.

552
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,380
Let's just turn the music up a little bit.

553
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,860
It's a nice warm voice.

554
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,540
Dave can't hear the music.

555
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:07,740
I'm sorry.

556
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:07,740


557
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,340
It's only the Buzz.

558
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,520
Why would it do that to me right now?

559
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,320
Why couldn't it wait until tomorrow or some other?

560
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,640
Oh, you breathed.

561
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,800
There, look, it went away.

562
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,320
I saw it go away.

563
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,300
It's basic unfairness.

564
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,120
It's just general-

565
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,960
It's, talk about your subliminal messages.

566
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,080
It's a fickle Buzz.

567
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,700
Well, which one was the ficklest of them all?

568
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,620
The mud?

569
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,720
Every time that Buzz happens, Princess, we usually-

570
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,460
Your face suddenly changes into a hideous skull alien face, and the dog looks like

571
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,620
I don't even know what.

572
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,620
Then when the Buzz stops, you look like you again, and the dog looks like Buddy.

573
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,400
I don't know what that Buzz is doing.

574
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,600
It's putting some veil over my vision, I guess.

575
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,460
That must be it.

576
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,220
It's got a direct-

577
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,600
It can't be lifting the veil.

578
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,800
It's got a direct finger on your pancreas.

579
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,600
Not your pancreas.

580
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,360
What do they call that?

581
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:06,720
Your hippocampus?

582
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,170
Your amygdala or whatever?

583
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,390
It's got a finger on your-

584
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:10,710
That's it.

585
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,710
That's it.

586
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,190
You should sell-

587
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,150
It's got a finger on your amygdala.

588
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,630
You should sell that Buzz to Devo.

589
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:22,550
They were always looking for the tone or the note that would make everyone in the audience

590
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,030
spontaneously lose control of their bowels or whatever.

591
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,990
Yeah, I remember that.

592
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:32,150
Anything that would affect some sort of secret sound that they could work into their music

593
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,710
where you say you'd leave the concert way different than you would leave the concert.

594
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,710


595
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,710


596
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,710


597
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,630
You know where they got that information the first time?

598
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,490
The CIA.

599
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,050
The Blues Magoos.

600
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,670
The band the Blues Magoos.

601
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,250
The Blues Magoos did that?

602
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,290
The Blues Magoos experimented with the same thing.

603
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:57,250
It was called Sonic something or another, and it was a minute and a half of a frequency

604
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,810
that was designed to make you have to go to the bathroom.

605
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,630
Sonic BM.

606
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,810
So Devo ripped that idea off from the Blues Magoos?

607
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:05,070
No.

608
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:10,290
It's an idea that once you're in a band and you're thinking about musical type of stuff

609
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:15,250
and vibrations of sound and everything like that, once you know there is a vibration that's

610
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:19,070
going to make somebody go poo whether they want to or not, you like that.

611
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,730
Yeah, you're going to be in search of that lost chord forever.

612
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,250
Right.

613
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,630
Exactly.

614
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,870
I hate to say it, but that was extremely remarkably well put.

615
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,350
In search of the lost chord.

616
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,050
That's what you're looking for.

617
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,210
Yeah.

618
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,150
Well, it was that Moody Blues album.

619
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,290
The Moody Blues almost achieved it.

620
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,070
They generally made me vomit rather than excrementitate.

621
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,970
Not the Moody Blues, the Blues Magoos.

622
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:46,530
Right.

623
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,290
No, that's why anything with the word blues in it, they were always trying to do that.

624
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:57,390
The Moody Blues were in search of ... Weren't they in search of a lost chord?

625
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,710
Or am I thinking of somebody else?

626
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,070
Yeah, no, that's right.

627
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,430
Unfortunately.

628
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,270
Yeah.

629
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,170
So, you just can't trust the Blues.

630
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,990
They're like other instruments.

631
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,370
Any other ...

632
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,430
They make you lose your bowel control.

633
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,090
That would explain a lot.

634
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,430
That would explain my infarctance.

635
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,010
I've been listening to the Rainmakers too much.

636
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,110
Ah.

637
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,710
They must have some frequency they use that make you flatulent.

638
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,570
Now, that's another one.

639
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,930
That's the OSS developed that in World War II to attract Japanese sailors to get them

640
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,770
to join the Navy and stuff like that.

641
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,970
And many of them just couldn't do anything with this farting.

642
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,790
They just fart their blues away.

643
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,510
Wow.

644
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,770
Listen to what the buzz is doing.

645
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,110
It's speaking to me.

646
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,270
X-Boy, hey, hey, hey.

647
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,810
If you could replicate that tone, that would mean you'd have a hard time memorizing what

648
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,430
it looked like.

649
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,910
Hark, hark.

650
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,450
As a fan.

651
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,630
Logo, pink boy of Earth.

652
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,130
That's why they send their message.

653
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,970
Well, they did.

654
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:04,930
That last X-Day, there was a noise buried in that electrocating, electrocating, electrocating

655
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:04,930


656
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:04,950
I don't know if it was the radio.

657
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,950


658
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,950


659
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,950


660
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,950


661
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,950


662
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:10,770
It was a noise when Legume fired up his machine and I was trying to commune with Bob and everything

663
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,910
and I got electrocated.

664
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,210
Yeah.

665
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:20,290
And then Synthaltimus decoded the noise and it sounded like robot voices telling the humans

666
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,750
they had to try again.

667
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,850
X-Day, the aliens were going to come but we screwed up.

668
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,590
It was very confusing like it always is.

669
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,310
You can't tell whether you're...

670
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,370
Yeah, it was confusing.

671
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,830
What's right and what's wrong and what's up.

672
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,310
What's up and what's down and that's where they want us.

673
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,250
We just don't know and that's right where they want us.

674
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,890
There were clearly confusing directions.

675
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,130
Yes, clearly confusing.

676
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,470
All kinds.

677
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:53,490
Especially by the laundry chute, the turkey chute and the poop chute.

678
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,430
These were all three elements of nature.

679
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,790
Well, and that dick and the...

680
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,050
Yeah.

681
00:34:59,350 --> 00:34:59,910
The stiff.

682
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:01,630
Yeah.

683
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,730
That was the really, really gross part.

684
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,230
The...

685
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:13,550
I mean, it wasn't a person exactly but it wasn't just an object either.

686
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,070
It was sort of a person.

687
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,030
Yes, it was much more than an object.

688
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,810
It was gross.

689
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,610
I left that in Cleveland deliberately.

690
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,930
We got to bring it to X-Day and then I'm going to give it to Philo.

691
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,830
I don't want it around here.

692
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,310
I don't want any of those things from Bob's storage room.

693
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,570
That's crap legumes digging up.

694
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,590
He's going to pull it off.

695
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:35,590


696
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:35,590


697
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:35,590


698
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:43,330
Do you know what the high cost of dark sorcery I think was the way his fundraiser put it?

699
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,430
Yeah, I remember that.

700
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,250
Man.

701
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:47,570
He was...

702
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,910
He got fired by the king of excrement.

703
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,870
What was his name?

704
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,790
Pablo Casals.

705
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,650
He was the world famous violin player only with the cello.

706
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,190
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,870
He was a cousin of Jerry Casale.

708
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:58,850
Yeah.

709
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,050
And Jerry Lewis and Jerry Lee Lewis.

710
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,570
Right.

711
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:04,810
So, he was a guy.

712
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,810


713
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,810


714
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,810


715
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,810


716
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,810


717
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,810


718
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,810
Yeah, they're all related.

719
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,770
And Jimmy Swaggart and Jimmy Carter, all related.

720
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,290
By name.

721
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,010
And Ron Warren and Ron Moore.

722
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,490
And Rusty Warren and the Warren Commission.

723
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,230
And Warren Bork.

724
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,450
Yeah, and Judge Bork and Bork the singer.

725
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,070
I think my favorite.

726
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,710
Well, I can't.

727
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,850
I better not say it.

728
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,910
There's a secret Bork, isn't there?

729
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,270
Yeah.

730
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,690
Yeah.

731
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:34,810


732
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:35,750
Insiders.

733
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,810
It's like, if you say the name, you die, right?

734
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,670
In Frankenstein's head.

735
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:40,970
Is that the way they do it?

736
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,010
Huh?

737
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,870
I heard it was one of those things like, what's the name?

738
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,010
You know, you ask somebody, well, what's the name of this group or organization?

739
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,010
I can't tell you.

740
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,430
If I say the name, I'll die.

741
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,890
And it seems like everybody's going to die whether they say the name or not.

742
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,650
I mean, they made that pretty clear.

743
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,750
I'm not going to take the name.

744
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,350
I'm not going to take the name.

745
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:05,430
I'm not going to take the name.

746
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,430


747
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,430


748
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,430


749
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,430


750
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,430


751
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,270
And by the same token, I'm going to repent on my deathbed.

752
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,570
I'll do it right now.

753
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,390
Oh, Lord, I actually believe in you.

754
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,130
I believe in you this whole time.

755
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,090
Deep inside my heart.

756
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,170
I repent of all the terrible things I said.

757
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,550
All the jokes I said about war on God.

758
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,650
Of course, you know it's a joke.

759
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,790
I knew you were laughing at it.

760
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,090
Because you guys said, oh, stop, God, please.

761
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,430
Okay, sorry.

762
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,190
I won't do it again.

763
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,150
See, I'm forgiven.

764
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,590
I was praying to the right one.

765
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,390
I've repented.

766
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,870
So that's okay.

767
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,090
Do I have to do it again on my deathbed?

768
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,770
Or am I cleared for good?

769
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,330
If I don't sin between now and when I die.

770
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:46,990
There you go.

771
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,250
Good luck.

772
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,670
Everything's a sin these days.

773
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,250
Everything we do is a sin.

774
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,670
Having fun, thinking your own thoughts, not telling other people what to do.

775
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,770
Drilling oil wells?

776
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,030
No, drilling oil wells, that's real good.

777
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:12,030
Especially if it's done in what had been a national monument or a national park.

778
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,170
Deep-flushing armpits?

779
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:14,570
No.

780
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,230
A general complex?

781
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:20,570
Grand Staircase Escalante in Utah is only like a third the size it used to be.

782
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,810
And now you can just drill all over the place out there now.

783
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,390
It's the most beautiful land I've ever seen.

784
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:31,690
It was the last explored part of the contiguous.

785
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,830
United States.

786
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,630
You've been to that area?

787
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,690
Yes, we did.

788
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:43,950
We tried to get to Spooky Canyon, but we were too fat to climb to the entrance.

789
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:51,430
And we took a mile-long canyon or straight canyon or narrow canyon or something.

790
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,770
We went to our canyon lands and arches and all of that.

791
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,970
But Grand Staircase Escalante is...

792
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,690
It's not exactly a national park.

793
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,570
But it's run by the Bureau of Land Management.

794
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,990
They just wanted to preserve it because it's unearthly.

795
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,310
Well, it's going to be full of condos.

796
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,650
Condos for the oil workers or whatever.

797
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,450
You know, uranium miners.

798
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,110
Miners.

799
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:29,350
They'll find something they have to mine to destroy that pristine beauty and about 900 species in so doing.

800
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,270
I know how it works.

801
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:31,750
I know how it works.

802
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,750


803
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,750


804
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,390
I know how they destroyed Earth the first time.

805
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,530
I mean, every time they did it.

806
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,430
They did it the same way.

807
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:44,350
You know, they just use up every resource and screw everybody and then move on to the next planet.

808
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,170
And it's just rich people doing it.

809
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,050
The top .0001%.

810
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,370
It's like about five people, you know that?

811
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,810
And all of them are pathological sadists.

812
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,970
They would have to be because I just looked at some of the income.

813
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,730
Some of these people.

814
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,050
Some of these people are pathological sadists.

815
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,430
And they're so wealthy.

816
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,070
Why wouldn't you take one hundredth of your wealth?

817
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,150
One tiny, teeny tiny part.

818
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:16,910
Just like go down to Puerto Rico, for instance, and say, oh, well, the electricity is still not on.

819
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,070
Just snap your fingers and put everything back together again.

820
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,610
And it could be done.

821
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,010
But with that amount of money they have, I just can't.

822
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,870
What does one person get out of having that amount of money?

823
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,410
Zuckerberg.

824
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,610
Are you listening to our Slack right now?

825
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,110
Zuckerberg, do the right thing.

826
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,070
That's Dr. Howell's neighbor, the rich kid.

827
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,450
Do the right thing?

828
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:41,830
No.

829
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,650
Or do the wrong thing?

830
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,070
No.

831
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:51,390
The inventor of Facebook lives around the corner from Paul Mavridis and Dr. Howell,

832
00:40:51,450 --> 00:41:00,930
who live in a rent-controlled apartment that I'm surprised that they're allowed to live, frankly.

833
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:14,690
Because if Paul and Howell weren't there, that landlord could be getting like three or four thousand dollars a month at least for that place because of the location.

834
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:23,550
In the Mission District of San Francisco, which used to be the most poverty-stricken, it's the kind of place where people shopped in the supermarket in their nightgowns.

835
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,550
Yeah.

836
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,390
And that was Paul and Howell.

837
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,810
So you can imagine what the old housewives were wearing, nothing at all.

838
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,030
That's San Francisco, after all.

839
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,950
So anyway, that's the way it used to be.

840
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:42,130
Now it's all Silicon Valley kids.

841
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:50,290
And some of them guys moved down to the China Basin area down there, and they actually shaved their skulls and put little tiny like lapel pins in them.

842
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,310
Just to prove that they were, you know, just to prove that they were, you know.

843
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:56,630
Yeah.

844
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,130
Just status among other elites.

845
00:41:59,630 --> 00:41:59,630


846
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:06,990
And that's why the guy had all them funny, remember that one movie that the guy had all the funny, had them pins in them and stuff like that?

847
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,930
Hellbender? Hellraiser?

848
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,230
Hellraiser or something like that.

849
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,810
Yeah, it had an incentivite in it.

850
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:13,850
Yeah.

851
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,190
Yeah, pinhead, pinboy, pinface, whatever.

852
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,810
That's what we tried to use anyway.

853
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,930
Oh, now kids do that to themselves just to be cool.

854
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:33,890
I saw a kid going into Glen Rose High School, just like that movie character with pins sticking out of him, all bald-headed and little lines drawn on his face.

855
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,610
That's just being cool.

856
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,990
He had a broomstick in his butt.

857
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,450
He was the coolest kid in school.

858
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,030
And the funny thing is they've been doing that in New York for ten years now.

859
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,410
I mean, they quit doing it ten years ago in New York and Paris and London.

860
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:47,770
Yeah.

861
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,390
It's just now hitting Glen Rose.

862
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,910
Glen Rose is like Ashtabula, their small little bird thing.

863
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,250
They get everything about ten years after.

864
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,890
Pretty soon they're going to have a Thai restaurant in Glen Rose.

865
00:42:59,170 --> 00:42:59,490
Right.

866
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,110
Right.

867
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:00,450
Yeah.

868
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:00,830
Yeah.

869
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,850
Well, everybody has long hair like me.

870
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,710
The old guys.

871
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,450
They finally got cool.

872
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,470
And now they have long hair.

873
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:08,850
Well, there are actually a bunch of—

874
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,050
But only the really old ones.

875
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,910
You know, the 50s to 70s, 70-year-olds.

876
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:23,650
I guess they were all a bunch of cowardly Vietnam deserters who decided to gather in one town and not be noticed by anybody.

877
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,390
No.

878
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,570
No, I'm just kidding.

879
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,010
No.

880
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,070
Oh, man.

881
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,490
This town is full of veterans.

882
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:38,990
My dad and I used to go out and do the flag stuff at all the cemeteries on Veterans Day.

883
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,330
Did you get to burn one when it got too old?

884
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,090
Of course.

885
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,790
We deliberately—if they touch the ground, you have to burn them.

886
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,150
So, oops, we dropped it.

887
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,890
Better burn that one.

888
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:49,690
You have to buy a new one.

889
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,230
That was part of the fun.

890
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,630
It was burning all the flags.

891
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:53,630


892
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:53,630


893
00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:00,170
I protest like it was your Second Amendment right to have a party or something.

894
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,510
Well, you touched the ground, sir.

895
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,390
It was tainted.

896
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:13,690
You know, do you remember the flag folding routine that you did in like Boy Scouts and stuff?

897
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:14,190
Yeah.

898
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,250
Yeah, it was like having to learn all them knots and stuff.

899
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,390
It was all too hard for me to do.

900
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,450
You had to learn how to fold the U.S. flag.

901
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,930
You had to learn how to fold the flag just an exact certain way, perfectly.

902
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:32,970
And if you let that thing touch the ground, you have to burn it and then pay for a new one.

903
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,670
And it cost a million dollars each.

904
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:36,550
Yeah.

905
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:46,410
Now, in my high school, some radical history teachers decided they would show us how powerful symbols were to human beings.

906
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,750
And they had us all draw an American flag.

907
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,970
I'm like, why the hell are they asking us to do this?

908
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:53,630
Okay, whatever.

909
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,010
We hand them in.

910
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,190
They picked the prettiest one.

911
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,010
It wasn't mine.

912
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,010
And they burned it.

913
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:05,650
And then they knocked the flag in the classroom over on the ground and walked out and left us to discuss what had happened.

914
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,890
And, of course, we just kind of looked at each other and went, that's weird.

915
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:16,290
Except for one kid who went home and told his dad all about it and said, they burned an American flag, Daddy.

916
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,790
Well, he was, that kid was the son of the publisher of the Dallas Morning News.

917
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:29,550
And in a short time, those two teachers were fired.

918
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,250
The headmaster was fired.

919
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:46,410
And the school switched from being kind of a liberal arts thing to strictly H. Ross Perot machine for cranking out the proper kind of rich kids.

920
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:51,770
Not the kind who worry about whether people are too wrapped up in the American flag.

921
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:57,410
And symbols, nationalistic symbols, as if those things were the real thing.

922
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,830
Well, sometimes symbolic things are real.

923
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:02,710
Well, yeah.

924
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,350
I mean, like.

925
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:03,850
To people.

926
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,950
People, yeah, people, sure.

927
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,310
Yeah, people sure what?

928
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,470
Yeah, but people sure are dumb.

929
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,250
That's my, that's the problem.

930
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:13,890
Yeah, I guess you got it there.

931
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,890
And, again, you hear a subgenius saying people are dumb.

932
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:19,490
Man.

933
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,150
They really are.

934
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,950
Oh, the world's gone to a bad place now.

935
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,790
The subgenius says they're dumb like it's a bad thing.

936
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:35,030
They've got to be really, really, like even when even a subgenius thinks somebody else is dumber than them.

937
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,450
Oh, my God.

938
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,450
Of course, the subgenius is dumb, so he could be wrong.

939
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,830
But the subgenius admits that.

940
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,370
The dumb human doesn't admit that.

941
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,930
Therein lies the critical.

942
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:49,730
It's not normal, not the dumb human.

943
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,670
There's absolutely critical difference.

944
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,910
The subgenius knows that it could well be wrong.

945
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,890
The normal, that thought never enters their head.

946
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,350
And that's why they're wrong.

947
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:02,850
Nor does any other.

948
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,190
Right.

949
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,010
So, it's not that we're smarter.

950
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,330
It's that we're dumber.

951
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,870
It's we're better only because we're different from them.

952
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,390
That's good enough.

953
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,210
Being different from the normals, that's good enough.

954
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:21,670
Yeah.

955
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,930
Better, worse, doesn't matter.

956
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,810
It's better if you're different from them.

957
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:28,430
Period.

958
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,630
I'd wear a zebra's shoes and follow anybody around.

959
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:40,910
Of course, it's better in the way of really tall, handsome, good-looking, rich, intelligent, and original, and kind, and brave.

960
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:47,370
But if you can only be different, that's better than dumber.

961
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:47,990
Normal?

962
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,370
Yes.

963
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,710
Because look at what the normals have done.

964
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,010
With some rogue sub...

965
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:02,410
They've been enabled entirely by rogue subgeniuses.

966
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:13,230
Unsaved subgeniuses who could have been slack, flim, bob, but instead became resentful, authoritarian monsters, really.

967
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,930
They're emergentiles gone evil.

968
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,870
Who never got saved by slack.

969
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:21,530
Horrible.

970
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:22,370
Horrible.

971
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,710


972
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,810
It is.

973
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,130
Horrible.

974
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:24,630
Way to go.

975
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:26,490
Horrible.

976
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,430
Could be so much worse than we ever think of that.

977
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,710
Did you ever, you know, think of that?

978
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,370
It could be ten times worse.

979
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,150
It is.

980
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,610
Every second it becomes ten times worse.

981
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,550
It's like the budget deficit.

982
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:44,550
With every single second, everything becomes a hundred million times worse.

983
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,090
We thought the critical mass would be hit years ago.

984
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,370
So when it goes, it's going to go big time.

985
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,230
Bigly.

986
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:54,450
Bigly.

987
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:54,950
Yeah.

988
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:56,470
Bigly.

989
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,650
But I won't be here to see it.

990
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,510
Where will you be?

991
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,990
I'll be on Planet X with Bob.

992
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,630
And Connie, and Princess Wee, and Buddy.

993
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:09,510
And you, Dave.

994
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,870
Yes, even you.

995
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,530
Yeah, but I'll be on Planet Y just to be contrary to you.

996
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,590
There you go.

997
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,370
See your difference.

998
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:16,810
You better.

999
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,370
Except the problem is Planet Y is where the Yakatizma come from.

1000
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:21,990
And they're...

1001
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,350
Well, you know how scary the X's are?

1002
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:28,470
Yeah.

1003
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,790
They're scared of the Yakatizma.

1004
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,690
But I wouldn't spell it like Y for Yakatizma.

1005
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,930
Yakatizma, I'd spell it W-H-Y for like why not or what me worry.

1006
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,370
Oh, that.

1007
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:39,970
Oh.

1008
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,270
The white me worry.

1009
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,470
What me.

1010
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,510
White me worry.

1011
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:44,550
Yeah.

1012
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:51,870
I must say, as an aside, I think the most recent, the last couple of months of Mad Magazine

1013
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,530
are truly superb.

1014
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,830
I haven't seen Mad Magazine in the last couple of months.

1015
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,470
I haven't either.

1016
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:03,530
We had a subscription for about 10 years, but they started running ads and they changed

1017
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,970
the artist on that one strip and...

1018
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,950
We just got disgusted.

1019
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,670
Well, we didn't so much get disgusted, it's just we didn't want to pay for it anymore.

1020
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:22,450
But for the most part, Mad Magazine is still the real news.

1021
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,490
Not the fake news.

1022
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,570
Mad Magazine has the real news.

1023
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:34,610
I mean, if Elf Prisoner, Ivanov, Nirvana, Trump, and Berger has its direct connection

1024
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:41,170
to the antenna and the inquirer and stuff, why can't we have our own inquirer, which

1025
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,830
is, you know, used to ask questions?

1026
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,830
Well, it's called the Stark Fist of Removal.

1027
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,330
It's just online now is the problem.

1028
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:53,630
But, you know, there's The Onion, The Mighty Onion, not that I really follow it anymore.

1029
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:58,110
They don't mail out the printed page anymore.

1030
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,350
Consarn it.

1031
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,110
Oh, the death of books.

1032
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,250
And we're going to print another book.

1033
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:11,150
I was reading earlier in this show, Dave, I was reading from Nikolai Kinney.

1034
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:11,150


1035
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,550
Kingsley's book, Eyelash, which we're going to publish now that we've got Neighbor World

1036
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,050
out there.

1037
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,750
I still have to do the books on that.

1038
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,470
I heard Wee Ma Ma sneeze in the kitchen.

1039
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,170
I bet the listeners could hear it, too.

1040
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,150
I could hear it, too, even though we're here in France.

1041
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,150
Wow.

1042
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,790
She could sneeze pretty loud.

1043
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:37,050
She's 88 years old, so she knows how to sneeze better than anybody.

1044
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,410
But yet it's so dainty.

1045
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,370
Yes.

1046
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,250
Demure, delicate.

1047
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,270
It's you.

1048
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,090
It's you.

1049
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:54,210
It's great living with an 88-year-old person because she has wisdom, the wisdom of patience and slack.

1050
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:54,970
Yes.

1051
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,530
She's unearthly patient.

1052
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:07,950
And, you know, patience, here's a little-known Bob quote, Dave, and you'll see why we don't advertise this one very much.

1053
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:16,770
Patience is the only form of time control that we actually have available to us.

1054
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,590
Now, is that depressing or what?

1055
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,010
I mean, subgeniuses all talk about time control, time control.

1056
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,650
I can control time.

1057
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,830
I'm going to make bad times go short and good times go real long.

1058
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,050
I'm time control, time control.

1059
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,330
No.

1060
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:31,350
No.

1061
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:33,650
Patience.

1062
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,990
If you really can develop patience.

1063
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,550
What would I read today?

1064
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,630
Rationality is freedom.

1065
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,310
Patience and rationality.

1066
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,790
Rationality is freedom.

1067
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:46,830
That's so boring.

1068
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,110
And patience is time control.

1069
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:50,990
Yes, friends.

1070
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:56,930
The Church of the Senior Subgenius preaches the truth.

1071
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,390
We may not practice what we preach because we're not the same kind of person we're preaching to.

1072
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,970
But you can learn more from subgenius.com or write to us.

1073
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:20,870
And we'll send you to our new address at the compound here at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1074
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:30,690
Yes, you've been listening to the Hour of Slack number 1652.

1075
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,430
Sixteen hundred and some odd.

1076
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,230
And even hours of slack.

1077
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:50,670
Delivered straight into your ear holes by that man Bob and his called ministers such as your surely Reverend Ivan Stang.

1078
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:54,790
And my co-host Princess We Are Doe seen here on camera three.

1079
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,490
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave seen here with our streaming net cam.

1080
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,570
And the magic of radio.

1081
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,930
The magic of radio.

1082
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,630
And uh...

1083
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,990
Neighbor World.

1084
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,250
Yes.

1085
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,890
Welcome to Neighbor World, neighbor.

1086
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,510
The Neighbor World.

1087
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:17,570
The world where everyone is joined together at the knees and the hip sockets.

1088
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:18,930
And everyone...

1089
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,710
And the eye sockets and the brain sockets.

1090
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,010
The tree walking brain socket doctors.

1091
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,310
Tree walking brain socket doctors.

1092
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,090
I finally figured out where that came from.

1093
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,510
The tree walking...

1094
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,530
Jane-er must have known somebody who had a treeing walker.

1095
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,050
Like that little dog right there.

1096
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,890
A treeing walker coon house.

1097
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,230
So tree walking brain socket doctors.

1098
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,650
Now it all adds up.

1099
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,030
Of course brain socket.

1100
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,490
That's, you know, needless to say.

1101
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,730
It doesn't need to be delineated.

1102
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,830
And doctors, well that's what we all are.

1103
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,050
Of types of doctors.

1104
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,690
Form of doctors.

1105
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,110
Skull...

1106
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,330
Well we're farmers too.

1107
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,130
We're...

1108
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:06,970
Skull farmers.

1109
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,070
We're skull farmers.

1110
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,350
And we're doctors for Bob.

1111
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,350
Not to be confused with the band Doctors for Bob.

1112
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,510
No one would want to become confused.

1113
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:20,650
No.

1114
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:21,730
Never.

1115
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,550
Well friends...

1116
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,550
Good night.

1117
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:27,530
Good night.

1118
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,190
And have a pleasant...

1119
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,850
Good night.

1120
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,650
Good night.

1121
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,570
Good night.

1122
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,690
We're all throwed up, we're all gone while they all

1123
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,930
Then be like a stepchild

1124
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,710
And if you saved the world, then visit that day one

1125
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,510
Put on a case and you'll see me

1126
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:01,190
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1127
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:06,530
In spite of you, in spite of me

1128
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,850
Oh yeah, in spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1129
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,630
I've seen dreams die soon, folks hate it seen

1130
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:19,250
The devil's slow gone, spray paint it seen

1131
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,490
Figures of authority, saying bad is good

1132
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,910
I've seen the six o'clock news in my own neighborhood

1133
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:27,170
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1134
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,390
In spite of you, in spite of me

1135
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:37,770
Oh yeah, in spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1136
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:05,530
I've seen the six o'clock news in my own neighborhood

1137
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:05,530


1138
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:05,590
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1139
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,510
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1140
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:14,070
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1141
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,930
A band heart broke a band

1142
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,190
Ball busted band

1143
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,510
Short chains of band

1144
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,690
Mistrust again

1145
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,790
Slander in the streets

1146
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:23,890
Labeled in the press

1147
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,690
I've been embarrassing the backroom

1148
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,730
Booked by the press

1149
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:29,870
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1150
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,950
In spite of you, in spite of me

1151
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:40,130
Oh yeah, in spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1152
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:41,330
Rock again

1153
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,870
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1154
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:08,410
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1155
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:12,030
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1156
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,950
Well, there's a camouflage tank sitting resting in a dump

1157
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,750
There's a camel in a tent where the horn is humped

1158
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,170
The temperatures are rising, people hiding in the shade

1159
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,570
The ice caps melting, we're making lemonade

1160
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,730
In spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1161
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:32,030
In spite of you, in spite of me

1162
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:37,210
Oh yeah, in spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1163
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:42,230
In spite of you, in spite of me

1164
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:47,330
Oh yeah, in spite of everything, it's pretty good to be alive

1165
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,390
Ha ha ha.

1166
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:02,450
Okay.

1167
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,130
Okay, they're not listening anymore.

1168
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,430
This is part two of the show.

1169
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,630
The part they don't like because it goes on for more than an hour.

1170
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,910
We actually got a little bit of...

1171
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:21,010
Last week I left a half an hour of our gibber-gabber on the end of the internet version.

1172
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,650
Uh-huh.

1173
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,690
And somebody said,

1174
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,650
I didn't come here for poodle masturbation.

1175
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,390
I came here for slack.

1176
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,110
Oh, wait.

1177
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,430
No, I was mixed up.

1178
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,290
It was the other way around.

1179
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:33,810
Poodle masturbation.

1180
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,390
Yeah, and somebody else said,

1181
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:39,590
Remember the good old days of our slack number 753?

1182
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,530
Or maybe it was 573.

1183
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,230
I can't remember.

1184
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,710
I need to look that up and rerun that one next week.

1185
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,510
Whatever it was.

1186
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:49,190
Nobody ever gives us any feedback.

1187
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,450
Nobody ever says,

1188
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,350
I hated that.

1189
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,650
Or, I loved that.

1190
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,390
So we actually got some love-hate that time.

1191
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:01,210
And listeners, we're listening to your comments.

1192
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,410
We love your love-hate.

1193
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,250
Yeah.

1194
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,990
Oh, there is some news we have to give on the internet version that we can't do on the radio version,

1195
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,970
which is Slack Friday sale.

1196
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,110
Yeah.

1197
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:21,410
We have so much slack here at the church.

1198
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,250
And subgenius.

1199
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:30,770
That we forgot the annual Slack Friday sale on Slack Friday after Thanksgiving as the humans count time.

1200
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:41,290
But I have changed the website so that now you can get your subgenius ordainment kit or two of them for you and a friend.

1201
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,330
Or just two for two friends.

1202
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,170
Or one for a dead ancestor.

1203
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,330
Or two for a dead ancestor.

1204
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,890
And one for an enemy.

1205
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,210
Anyway, it's two.

1206
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:51,930
It's a number one sale.

1207
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:56,010
So you get two subgenius memberships for $35 plus postage.

1208
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,990
Postage on two memberships is almost $10.

1209
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,890
Depending on how far you are from Glen Rose, Texas.

1210
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:08,070
So, yeah, that's the Slack Friday sale.

1211
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:08,470
It's the once a year.

1212
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:09,070
All the way through.

1213
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,570
It lasts until Christmas.

1214
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,830
Or just before Christmas.

1215
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,290
Say the 23rd.

1216
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,290
December 23rd is when the Slack.

1217
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,010
Well, that's because I'm going to quit filling orders for two or three days.

1218
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,990
Because grandkids come.

1219
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,990
And that's all princess we and I live for is the grandchildren.

1220
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:30,370
The future of the subgenius race.

1221
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:34,530
Whose little minds are still malleable and controllable.

1222
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:41,510
And we're going to really twist and pervert them as best we can in the grand tradition.

1223
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:47,410
Although, really, I did such a good job of parenting that I don't have to worry about that.

1224
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,850
My daughter and her chosen husband.

1225
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,730
We'll twist those kids' brains just fine.

1226
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,410
They're already doing a fine, fine job.

1227
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:07,930
They're doing an excellent job as heard here in this special excerpt from age 7 and age 9.

1228
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:12,490
Join Reverend Stang on the Hour of Slack.

1229
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:13,870
Slang.

1230
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:17,630
Slang.

1231
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:17,630


1232
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,770
Slang.

1233
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:21,390
Slang.

1234
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:21,390


1235

Yeah.

1293
01:02:53,530 --> 01:03:04,110
It's a weird monster, basically, who has hair, spikes for hair, and razor for claws, and

1294
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:05,790
his eyes are razors, too.

What?

1300
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,130
He's right behind us.

1301
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:10,790
Ah!

1302
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,730
Ah!

1303
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:12,730


1304
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,050
I'm out of breath.

1305
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,370
We did it.

1306
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,830
We're safe.

1307
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:23,310
Where's that monster?

1308
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,470
He's following us.

1309
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,210
He's still there.

1310
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:25,810
Run!

1311
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:26,830
Ah!

1312
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:29,950
You scared it.

1313
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:30,490
Okay.

1314
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,070
You scared us.

1315
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,270
Our feet sound like horses.

1316
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:33,510
Okay.

1317
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,130
On a table.

1318
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,130
We lost him.

1319
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,030
Good.

1320
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,090
I'm thirsty.

1321
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,290
Anyone else?

1322
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,510
Go, go, go.

1323
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:40,990
We're lost.

1324
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,330
Where are we?

1325
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:42,710
This place is so scary.

1326
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,710


1327
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:43,710
This place is scary and spooky.

1328
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,090
Guys, look.

1329
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,530
Look at that thing.

1330
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,950
And look at that other thing.

1331
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,390
And the giant thing.

1332
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:49,870
Wait.

1333
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,670
Why is there so much spider webs?

1334
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:56,790
Spiders.

1335
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,450
That means there's a lot of spiders.

1336
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,950
What's that crawling on your face?

1337
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,550
Dude, you got a spider on your face.

1338
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,850
There's spiders everywhere.

1339
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:07,010
We better run out of here.

1340
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:07,850
Oh, wait.

1341
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,150
Oh, no.

1342
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,570
The monster is outside the cave.

1343
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,710
We have to run back.

1344
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,570
We have to run back in the cave again.

1345
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,490
Dude, don't you know how strong this thing is?

1346
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:17,610
Ah, a spider.

1347
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,650
Which do we...

1348
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,170
Which do you want?

1349
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,190
Spiders or monsters?

1350
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,250
Dude, guys, do you know how strong this thing is?

1351
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:22,430
Run.

1352
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,170
He's going to break in the cave.

1353
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:26,950
Okay.

1354
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:31,610
Guys, since we killed a spider, I think the mama spider coming.

1355
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,850
He's right behind us.

1356
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,790
Look, a secret chamber.

1357
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,350
Let's hide in there.

1358
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:39,690
Hurry.

1359
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,230
Oh, my gosh.

1360
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,270
It's full of treasure.

1361
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:41,770
Yeah.

1362
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:41,970
Yeah.

1363
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:42,910
Diamonds.

1364
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:43,690
Guys.

1365
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:44,410
Guys.

1366
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:44,730
Yeah.

1367
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:45,610
Guys.

1368
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,190
Here's a map.

1369
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:46,630
What?

1370
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:46,970
Guys.

1371
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,090
A map to a bigger treasure.

1372
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:48,730
Guys.

1373
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,030
Wait.

1374
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:53,670
There's a sign that says, this treasure belongs to Bob.

1375
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:57,130
Do not touch or you'll be cursed forever.

1376
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,710
Wow.

1377
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,050
Maybe we better not...

1378
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:00,430
Who's Bob?

1379
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:01,630
Guys.

1380
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:02,150
You know, Bob.

1381
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:02,950
Guys.

1382
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,110
Maybe we better leave.

1383
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,590
If it's his treasure...

1384
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:05,970
Guys.

1385
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,890
We better leave it alone.

1386
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:08,370
Guys.

1387
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:08,590
Guys.

1388
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:11,370
There's a nuclear bomb set to two seconds.

1389
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,050
That must have been the curse.

1390
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:16,430
Okay.

1391
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:17,190
It didn't go off.

1392
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,910
We got out of there just in time.

1393
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:19,910
It must have been a trap.

1394
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,750
If it was a nuclear bomb, everybody would be dead, even the monster.

1395
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:26,710
Yeah.

1396
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,710
How about just a hand grenade?

1397
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,090
Okay, guys.

1398
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:31,150
A dynamite.

1399
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,530
An acne dynamite barrel.

1400
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,370
I don't think I believe in Bob.

1401
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,310
Who's Bob anyway?

1402
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:37,870
This guy.

1403
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,070
All right.

1404
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:39,530
Here.

1405
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,970
I touched your treasure.

1406
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,750
Who is Bob?

1407
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:42,050
Who is Bob?

1408
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:42,810
Cursed.

1409
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:44,250
I will curse you.

1410
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:47,030
He touched my treasure.

1411
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,030
Oh, no.

1412
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:55,390
Now, every time you walk, there will be a hand grenade falling down from the sky.

1413
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,510
That's a pretty bad curse.

1414
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:02,010
Every time you walk, a hand grenade falls from the sky?

1415
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:02,170
Every time.

1416
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:02,590
Okay.

1417
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,570
I'll just tell you this.

1418
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,730
Who pulls the...

1419
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,850
Is the pin pulled?

1420
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:05,690
Oh, wait.

1421
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:06,710
It didn't work.

1422
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:08,190
Run.

1423
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:09,350
Run.

1424
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:09,570
Run.

1425
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,710


1426
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:11,410
Run.

1427
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:11,710
Run.

1428
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:11,730
Run.

1429
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1430
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1431
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1432
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1433
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1434
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1435
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1436
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1437
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1438
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1439
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1440
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1441
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1442
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1443
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1444
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1445
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1446
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:11,730


1447
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:12,090
Okay.

1448
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:12,890
Bob's gone.

1449
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:13,650
Good.

1450
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:13,930
Guys?

1451
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:15,290
Now I know who Bob is.

1452
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:19,830
I found this map and it says there's a nuclear bomb under the ground.

1453
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,350
Oh, come on.

1454
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,590
Why is it always nuclear?

1455
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,310
There is.

1456
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,510
It's not nuclear.

1457
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,870
You crazy widow.

1458
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:34,090
And that's where we can slip in some of the other kid talk.

1459
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,390
Yes.

1460
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:36,730
Yeah.

1461
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:37,630
Okay.

1462
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:38,030
I'm cutting you.

1463
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:38,710
I mean, I think, yeah.

1464
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,350
I had great background music there, Dave.

1465
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:41,450
Oh, man.

1466
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:41,730
You know what I mean?

1467
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:41,730


1468
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,150
You would not believe the background music has been so good.

1469
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:49,510
If you heard me getting real dramatic a few times, that's why.

1470
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,350
Because the music was surging.

1471
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:51,750
Yes.

1472
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,010
It was matching it.

1473
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:53,410
Yeah.

1474
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,550
I love it.

1475
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:55,470
I love doing that.

1476
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,190
That's really fun.

1477
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:56,610
It was great.

1478
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,630
Well, it's really good movie music.

1479
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:05,170
It's movie scores, mostly from sci-fi and fantasy movies.

1480
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:07,790
Oh, yes.

1481
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:08,990
I'm tired.

1482
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,370
I am too.

1483
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:11,730
You are.

1484
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:11,890
I am too.

1485
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,330
I almost fell asleep at the mic just like Hal.

1486
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:14,750
I know.

1487
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:15,590
I'm embarrassed.

1488
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,210
That's pretty good.

1489
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:17,950
I'd like to have her.

1490
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,690
I'm really embarrassed.

1491
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,510
Your eyes would be started on tap.

1492
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,510
Well, you do that in the best movies, though.

1493
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,830
Just when movies are getting good, that's when you just start to pass out.

1494
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,790
God, I hate that trait in some animals.

1495
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:34,770
You get to the good part of the movie and you hear this loud snoring sound.

1496
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,870
Yeah, your dog's not even noticing.

1497
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,450
This is the big chase scene.

1498
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,350
They did that.

1499
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,030
That cool thing.

1500
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:42,810
He missed it.

1501
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:46,630
You look at the nobody for reassurance as you're about to enjoy a certain part of the movie

1502
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,610
that you both love so very well.

1503
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:54,550
And you look over there and the person's got a knife and a machine gun and a twist for

1504
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,190
a tourist pickle.

1505
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:00,190
And there's a whole bunch of other machinery that you just easily eat your eyebrows.

1506
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:01,650
Oh, yeah.

1507
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:06,110
Well, Princess Wee's missing a little piece of one eyebrow because of that.

1508
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,710
She slept through the climax.

1509
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:12,970
The beginning of the end.

1510
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,050
That's a Burt Gordon giant grasshopper movie.

1511
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:21,290
She missed the grasshoppers crawling around on photographs of skyscrapers.

1512
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:25,750
The editor left a frame in a little bit too long.

1513
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:31,670
You see the grasshopper's foot land on the sky instead of the skyscraper.

1514
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:32,910
And you go, he's just walking.

1515
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,070
It's just a grasshopper walking up a photograph.

1516
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,810
It's not a giant grasshopper on a building.

1517
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,850
He let me down.

1518
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:46,130
We could go see the director of that movie, Princess Wee.

1519
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:46,350
Really?

1520
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:46,970
Burt I. Gordon.

1521
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:50,810
He's at Monster Bash every year in June in Pittsburgh.

1522
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:52,590
He must live there.

1523
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:53,910
He must live next to the hotel.

1524
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:59,710
And the actress from Creature from the Black Lagoon is always there.

1525
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,750
I think we should go to that somewhere.

1526
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,970
We've got to go to Monster Bash sometime.

1527
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,170
It's got to be the nerdiest thing ever.

1528
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:05,570
Yeah.

1529
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:10,250
It's like an old monster fan nostalgia con.

1530
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,450
In Pittsburgh.

1531
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,550
Hmm.

1532
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,270
Sounds antithetical.

1533
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,990
I want to go there with Fat Mandy and Tommy Amoeba.

1534
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:26,850
And the Apocalypse Boys.

1535
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,330
Them circus dwellers.

1536
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:31,650
Yeah.

1537
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:35,970
Andy and, you know, Small Wiener Guy.

1538
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:38,150
Small Wiener Guy, yeah.

1539
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:38,810
Baby Wieners.

1540
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,110
Yeah, Baby Wieners.

1541
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,490
Yeah.

1542
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:42,490


1543
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:46,790
Well, I'm glad it wasn't me because there were people going around taking pictures and

1544
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:52,550
then they put them on telephone poles and stuff like that and say wanted or reward or

1545
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:52,770
something.

1546
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:53,910
We miss him.

1547
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:59,010
I saw a picture of you that said wanted, but I don't think it was because they loved you.

1548
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:04,050
I was just going to, yeah, I was prepared for that one because that's what I was thinking

1549
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,770
of too because wasn't he arrested like a common criminal?

1550
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,950
And so that set off a whole bunch of transfusions.

1551
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,730
I needed to get through.

1552
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:18,030
The next thing you know, they had said I had to go all the way to the vetch hospital of

1553
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:19,210
alien wars.

1554
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:23,110
Because if I was out there fighting, you know, monsters from outer space.

1555
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,090
That's not what it was about.

1556
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:33,730
Franklin, Hyman, Sprout, Roosevelt or whatever, whoever was pretending to be the president

1557
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:41,010
for that week came on the radio and newsreels and then on television and the internet.

1558
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,210
And they're just everywhere.

1559
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,590
What you going to do?

1560
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:48,370
What are you going to do?

1561
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,030
What you going to do?

1562
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,230
I don't know what you going to do.

1563
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:57,410
Toss your hands up in the air and, you know, cast your fate to the wind.

1564
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:58,610
There it goes.

1565
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:03,010
Just tumbling off into the sky.

1566
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,270
There goes my fate.

1567
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:06,570
I'll just cast it into the winds.

1568
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,470
Good riddance.

1569
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,070
Good riddance.

1570
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,350
Good riddance.

1571
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:10,850
I'm going to get him.

1572
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:11,670
I'm going to get a new one now.

1573
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,510
I'm going to go get me a new fate.

1574
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,870
One that works better.

1575
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:20,330
I think I stole that from Bob W.

1576
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,010
Bob W.

1577
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:33,550
Well, Dave, I guess we could end our conflict, conversation.

1578
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:36,870
Okay.
