Oh yeah.
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.
All quarantined, all strapped in my suit, pressure suits all pressured up.
Yeah, it's here.
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.
Waiting for the moment, the final countdown.
And that's where we're at.
Just hours away from the final hour.
The final minute.
The final second.
The final...
X-Day.
Thought it'd never get here.
It's kind of late now.
We're there.
There's nothing else to do.
Just sit, look out the window,
and wait for the lights.
Don't be scared.
No, just sit.

Imagine a new point.

Or you can find an actual ==


So.
The time is yet to come.
somewhere
in Eurasia
blue.
My name's
We'll see you.
One, two.
Hey, Bleepo.
Yeah.
Chaz and I have been planning
which reruns we're going to run
since there's only another
week of broadcasting left on the planet.
Oh, God.
I've done 638 hours.
Down to a few hours now.
And we're going to start rerunning, number one.
Not that this is actually a rerun, friends,
although I am going to rerun some stuff
for a few more minutes here.
The fact that some other civilizations
are more advanced than we are may be humbling.
You don't understand how we live here.
You're an alien.
That's the way I am.
You know what would happen if they found out
your visa had expired?
Uh, I...
Yeah.
It exists and is being kept secret
by the same vested interests who control our destiny.
The aim of the game is a world government
comprising members of the cabal
who are elected by no one
and accountable to no one.
And what are they up to?
I don't know.
Come on, Moneo.
I want you to start working on a completely new project.
What is the nature of this project?
Uh, I...
Yeah.
I'm going to be a scientist.





Who are these vested interests?
Who?
Are you?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Whatever, man.
The Santee Misses?
The Mob Guys?
Well, the cabal comprises...
Oh, no.
...the Council on Foreign Relations.
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved,
you folks listening by radio, you folks listening by record,
once the church is gone, there is going to be a cataclysmic judgment,
and millions will die in those next few years.
They'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets,
blowing up schools and factories, putting an end to the birth of the world.


Oh, George, what?
Well, thank ficar senor, I'll tell you what, the행 Viol matin?



It is?
We're off service.


Turn out the credits.


Well, I'm training in upper-우�èka when we are falling back and worried that you're
going to hold back the tower cliff and the current
chaos that's in the way.
Let's go.
See them in the back.
What they want.
I don't know.
They're all ready to go.
Turn around.
Go back down.
Back the way you came.
Can't you see that flash of fire?
Ten times brighter than the day.
And behold.
A mighty city.
Broken in the dust again.
Oh God.
Private man.
Broken in the dust again.
It's gonna be me.
And it's gonna be you.
We're gonna do everything we want to.
It's gotta be now.
And I can't wait.
Think about the fear and all that pain at hand.
Oh.
Like a flaming baton.
That's burning the world.
Like George Bush on acid.
Singing in the duke of.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

To anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and get yourself to fight
And think about the times we've been and what they've been
It's nothing, it's nothing
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
That's why we might as well take our time
So stop the traffic, stop that song
Stop the traffic, stop that song

I wanna get off
I wanna get off with you
I wanna get off
I wanna get off with you
One more job in the supermarket
One more kick to get me started
Everyone get on board, this ship is sinking
I'm looking for a way in
Searching for the way out
Angels ride free in your mind
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild
Hey man, get hip
Climb aboard our pleasure ship
Speed boy, we know
You're king of the real, yeah, come and go
No, no, no
Go Apollo 69
Rock it baby, walk the line
We see the fire, now's the time
Fly Apollo 69, yeah, yeah
The beginning was the end
Of everything now
The ape regards his tail
He's stuck on it
Repeats until he fails
Half a goon and half a god
A man's not made of steel
See the fire sweeping
Our very streets today
Burn like a rock cold carpet
Mad bull
Has lost its way
Born a shielded
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Born a shielded
It's just a shot away
Shot away, shot away
When we were born
In the early light
We were destined
To make it right
In pretty turnin'
And this is our fate
We're singin' this song
So you can read late
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
This time
We are going to save the universe! This time!
We are going to save the universe! This time!
We are going to save the universe! This time!
We'll take the queen
We mean it man
There is no future
In England's dreaming
No future
No future
No future for you
I'll show you why
No future for you
I'll carry you in my arms
SIng100

I'll text you a book

I'll get you installed

Jinya
The Linny Bruce is not afraid.
What of the limitless sex and violence in the wake of Ragnarok?
Welcome to the slaughter.
What are you going to do?
What will be your epitaph when we get done with you?
Are you going to cry for your mama?
Are you going to have a good time?
Are you going to be a bohub?
When it's your turn to die,
don't get crazy.
Let them all around.
Anarchy here.
Rural streets in the Ragnarok party town.
Ici et esos gohos lol.
Next episode is going to Eurovision funds the tough.
Alan McCallum talked about how many dollars he needs to keep worth the inclusion of
possible
Let's put some reached out in the sun.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.
It really is.
And then we shall be caught up in the rupture,
the eternal, ineradicable, invincible promise of Bob.
And in the celestial chariots, vimanas,
saucers of the space goddesses,
we shall travel in transition to our newer and higher state of being.
I tried.
I tried what he said.
Oh, you can depend on it.
It's as inevitable as death, taxes, and Bob.
You know those things that you see out of the corner of your eye in the woods?
That they are from my deteriorating vision.
It looks like insects are creeping up on me, but it's actually damage.
It's all real.
X-Day's really going to happen?
Damage to my right eye, and of course in the left eye there's a cataract.
But on the right eye it's worse because...
Phantom objects.
That'll all be fixed.
Those things that move around in the dark spaces under the furniture,
it's not just your imagination.
It's sent by the conspiracy.
Sent.
Those are the agents of the conspiracy.
Why are you being silent and not backing me up on this assertion?
Oh, I'm sorry. I was reading. I wasn't paying attention.
Oh, well, that's understandable.
The Bobliagraphon will distract anyone, I suppose.
I was distracted because our background music...
The background music isn't loud enough. It's from that movie Alien.
Alien?
Yeah, the first one. The original Alien.
Yes. Well, you know...
It's very quiet.
It was originally composed for the movie Freud,
and then that composer decided it would work best for the situation in Alien.
Incidentally, did you know that James Horner just died in a plane crash?
No!
He was the only pilot, the only passenger of the plane.
And...
James Horner?
The paleontologist.
James Horner, the composer of music for movies.
Jack Horner is the paleontologist.
You're thinking of Jack Horner, yes.
James Horner is a music composer for many recent movies,
including all kinds of monster movies that we view and like.
And who is to say that the conspiracy is not also at work there?
The conspiracy that we truly hate.
The real conspiracy.
Which, of course, doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.
A faceless confederacy of dunces,
so vast and so broad that it underlies all the lesser conspiracies
and permeates all human reality.
Quite the opposite of devious.
It dominates by merely exploiting the overall mealy-mouthed,
chicken-butt-kissing code of normality, or con,
of all the pinks, normworms, and mere humes at large.
More than anything else, the conspiracy is an attitude,
a fear of pinkness, a cancer of the imagination,
the hatred of the real, the yearning for cuteness,
the eagerness to obey, and the lack of true faith in Bob Dobbs.
This fear of the unfamiliar permeates society.
It's what lets the con get away with real murder on a massive scale.
The obvious injustices and insanity,
written into law books by Illuminati bigwigs,
are insignificant compared to the little things.
The unspoken agreement with the status quo,
the unthinking daily cowardices,
the petty, subtle put-downs,
the judgmental gossip,
and all the mundane venalities that make up human nature.
Bummer, man.
So the conspiracy.
The conspiracy goes deep.
That's what Bob said.
Bob actually predicted this.
He said, it's going to be a bummer, man.
And the cops, of course, are working for Obama minions,
and Obama minions work for Obama,
and Obama works for the Illuminati,
and the Illuminati works for the conspiracy.
I'm real original.
I call him Obama.
I call him Obammy.
Obammy, get it?
And, of course, the conspiracy itself ultimately works for Jehovah One,
the alien space god from corporate sin galaxy, as everyone knows.
Well, so do we, though.
Stop snoring, sleepo.
Wake up and face the music.
Now, Hal, I did read that same section about ten shows ago.
That's okay, though.
Hal is reading the word of Bob as reprinted from our books in that dissertation.
Yeah, it's this guy's academic paper here.
Uh...
By Reverend Lee Chrysler.
It's full of many diagrams and illustrations.
Right, yeah.
It's up to the minute.
And in a thick leatherette cover, a black book like Liber Innominatus,
a work of foul and malefic sorcery.
I don't think anybody else owns a copy like that.
This is the only copy.
Maybe the author and maybe the Library of Congress
and the school that gave him the PhD for that.
God, did he pull one over on their eyes.
He's gonna be at X Day.
Well, here's a...
Reverend Lee Cipher will be at X...
He'll be at the Judgment.
Uh...
I have a whole list of at least 31 preregistrants.
That many souls will be saved.
We know that many.
There will be 31 called.
That's right.
If they're paid up, even though they may be some sort of Internet troll
who just happened to...
on the whole thing, they...
They get seized up in the saucers while others,
who some might think more deserving,
will be forced, owing to the capricious legality,
to be left behind.
Speaking of legality, Dr. Howell, you know,
we can't name prices on this type of station.
Did I mention a price?
No. I'm just warning you ahead of time,
so I don't have to hit the dump button.
Of course, there is the pearl of a great price.
Right.
It's like a kidney stone.
Once it's removed, it's a valuable, valuable thing.
Here's a letter to you from R. Crum
about how good the book of the subgenius is.
I better believe I was surprised.
That guy hates everything.
He says, thanks for the copy of the book.
It is Bible II.
I read it every day for inspiration.
It's much groovier than the old Bible for today's world.
Well, then illustrate it, Crum!
Every motel room should have a copy in the bedside drawer.
That Gideon society should get with the times,
the pervasive influence of Bob shows itself in subtle ways.
Check out a jar of Paul Newman's spaghetti sauce.
A subliminal Bob, if I ever saw one.
God, that's lame.
Enclosed is a must-read item a friend of mine sent me.
This guy, Francis E. Deck,
is the high holy saint of paranoia.
His history of the computer gods.
You know what?
That thing you're reading right there,
the reprint of Francis E. Deck,
the Francis Deck that accompanied it,
was the Francis Deck document that got out into the world.
Crum was one of the first people to send it.
Yes, he printed it in Weirdo Magazine on the back.
Right.
But I had never seen it before.
He sent it to me,
and I started sending it around, of course,
to everyone I knew.
And sooner or later,
you started hearing that professional recording of the Francis E. Deck.
Yes.
The Frankenstein computer god.
Right.
The deadly Tabin needle.
Right.
The deadly Tabin needle.
A thing to send shivers through one's nervous system,
says Mr. Crump.
Yeah.
Well, a lot of people think that that announcer guy is Francis E. Deck.
Unfortunately, the late Mr. Deck would never have been able to speak that way.
A professional radio announcer.
And where did Mr. Deck ever find one willing to mouth those poisonous platitudes?
He didn't.
He was already in a rest home by then.
I know a subgenius who went and harassed Francis Deck on his deathbed,
got a short little VHS home video,
and he was in a long movie of the dying kook,
just before they kicked him out of the rest home.
Terrible.
Yeah, it kind of was.
It'll happen to us now,
through the ineluctable laws of karma.
For all we know, it already has happened to us.
You mean our corpses are being examined somewhere and given an indecent...
No, that somebody busted into our rest home and interviewed us.
Oh, yeah.
How would we know if we're in that condition?
Unfortunately, we have the same discussion every week
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, but he...
and Princess We seem to be gone somewhere.
I wonder what that's all about.
Well, there you have it.
An interview with the subgenius...
They've been ruptured already. The Xs are already here.
X-State started.
The holiest ones were taken already.
Princess We's gone.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, that innocent, crazy man.
The emotional responses of the subjects during this interview were technically augmented.
Oh, yes.
Well, yeah, we were sitting there in the rest home,
and they came and they attached their little leads to us,
and they got about 15 minutes out of it.
Princess We, have you heard from Dave?
Dave is going to call!
He's going to call, or he's going to pay a call?
Is he going to come, or is he going to call?
Oh, if he would only be able to pay a call.
Who's there? Is it Dave?
Oh, it's Dave.

It's that scary guy! It's that scary pipe guy!
I'm starting to have my X-State nightmares again, Dr. Howell.
They're no fun.
It's always got Bob sneaking through the woods, creeping up on me.
Bob sneaking through the woods.
Come on, be a man. Pull yourself together.
We tried to catch him last time.
Yes, you saw how well that turned out.
No kidding. Well, you know when you go chasing Bob,
that's only happening because he wants to be chased.
And you're only going to catch him if he wants to be caught.
Well, yes.
Because that's the way it is.
You can put a little salt on that dicky bird's tail,
and who knows, he might hold still for you.
Yes, I would never say, never try.
I would never say never, because after all,
as one grows desperate and the final moment approaches,
one is likely to try any stratagem.
It's a Bob hunt.
That's right.
It was just a Bob hunt.
It might as well have been a bug hunt.
It might as well have been, and it might yet be,
after Earth is remade, perhaps newly formed creatures
of a different bowel plan will take over.
Of course, our writings tell us that...
How is Bob be formed?
Our cities, or enough of them, will be left, according to the prophecy,
so that a coleopterus or beetle-like race can dwell in their ruins.
A pehe with a coleopterus...
Yeah, really, exactly.
I just read the novel The Beetle.
Have you ever read it?
No.
It was a big sensation in its day in the late Victorian period, in the 1890s.
It was more popular than Bram Stoker's Dracula for a while.
And it's just as good, I have to say.
The Beetle?
The Beetle is a being from ancient Egypt
who threatens the Victorian politicians and other people in the story
with unspeakable horrors and can transform into a large beetle.
A scary scarab.
The curse of the scarab skybees.
The scary skybees of the scarab.
No, no, the Beetle used to be...
It's like a British horror story that's book length,
and it's very well done, actually.
But what can I say?
The Beetle is the progenitor...
Yes.
...of future Earth life.
And here's one of those beetles now.
A child of Isis.
I think this is one of those beetles, right?
A be-be-be-be-be-beetle.
It's one of those.
It is, okay.
I'm Beetle.
Yes, it's been a hard day's nuit.
Nuit.
C'est ça, monsieur?
I'm spraying Renews It right now
on my horrendous lumps and insect bites,
which I got from standing out under the cherry tree.
Nobody else but me.
Yeah, I don't get bit.
Well, you just don't taste good, Stang.
You haven't cultivated your inner deliciousness.
I was explaining to Hal this morning
the reason that I fly him in
is to keep the skeeters off.
Just as the giant, gassed planet Jupiter
draws off dangerous meteor and asteroid,
and Bola Day strikes,
so I draw the worst of the blood-sucking
arthropods away from Ivan Stang.
I did not know that.
You could charge money for doing that.
You could keep the flies off of this watermelon.
Yes.
Yeah, a watermelon also works, too.
Leave a watermelon out there,
and all the flies will be immediately caught.
No, no, no.
Hal's here to keep the flies off that watermelon.
Ain't no flies on Jesus.
Oh, is this on?
Well, look, I...
It doesn't seem entirely fair.
We don't know that.
Jesus done been here.
Yes.
And did a radio show in Gaum.
Just all right with me,
but as far as the flies and so on,
these are ancient enemies of the human race.
Was not Baal-zebub the lord of the flies,
one of the princes of evil,
long after known in Palestine?
One fly above them all.
Ashena, the queen of the SS, or...
No, that was Esther.
No, no, it wasn't Esther.
It was...
Who was Isis?
Ishtar.
Ishtar, yes.
Heaven's queen and mother both.
Unstaffed.
Mooned Ashtaroth.
Ah, well, they all have to knuckle under
to the unbearable rigidity of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Thank Dobbs for that.
Their slack ends where Bob's fist begins.
Right at the knuckles.
The whore of Babylon had better get her sheets cleaned.
She'd better quaff her cup.
She'd better keep them sheets clean,
because Bob's a-coming.
Yes.
And the men from Planet X are coming.
Yes.
Bob's coming.
And the whore of Babylon better start running.
Although, wasn't she associated with Princess Ouillardeau,
queen of all the UFOs?
She was pictorially associated, yes.
Mounted upon a seven-headed beast with seven horns.
No, in her case it was a ten-headed chocolate triceratops.
Oh, that's right.
Now, the ten-headed chocolate triceratops,
I can think of nothing more likely.
Leaving a series of Hershey kisses behind.
Like a black monkey.
That's where you live.
The triceratops was Lye's idea, and the Hershey kisses were courtesy of St. Joe Riley.
Okay.
Another person.
Well, that's a spoiler trail.
Well, that's absolutely nothing, because you have to explain who he is in great detail
for the rest of the Listerd List audience to create fully the understanding of the meaning
of the, you know, uncomprehended and stuff.
I have a reflex by which I have to give credit for things.
I blurt out credits.
Mm-hmm.
Because I see that people posting graphics and videos without any credits on Facebook
all day long.
It's like, I look at, turn on Facebook, and there's this beautiful painting of a thousand
bobs that some guys post.
And I happen to know it was by the great artist Heart Ignition, wherever the hell he is now.
But these people just post this stuff as if they made it up themselves.
And I get a great kick out of going, wow, that's great.
Did you do that?
Because I've got the same picture as a poster on my wall.
How did that happen?
I think you're arguing with your nostrils, because you need to at least elucidate the
audience, incorrectly, of course, with no citation necessary.
At least fill in some blanks about the person that you mentioned, because, oh, that's by
the doctor's sister, Jean Fung-Foy.
Well, if you were cool, you'd know their names and fill in the blanks yourself.
But no, you don't know who Saint Joe Riley is.
You're cool.
You made the Bob mask.
Oh, wait a minute.
I know that one.
I've seen it before.
It's by a doctor, a Mr. Made-Up Church name.
Yeah, Mr. Reverend Funny named it.
Yeah, right.
So I'm familiar with this work, and it's fine.
It's very good.
I saw him at the Baltimore show.
Excellent stuff, really.
And there was too much wine to be drunk.
The Baltimore show, eh?
No, not that one.
How many went to the Orlando Divival with Don just recently?
Right.
Yeah.
Last night.
Tony Orlando and Don had a big meeting.

They were down there.
All the big-time subs were beating on the TomTom.
Everything to know that.
Now, the sponsors of that are coming to X Day, Reverend Fox and his fiancée.
Yes, the Tight T-Shirts Go Wild video crew is going to be accompanying them all the way
from Florida.
Unfortunately, it's men with that disease, men's mammalia disease.
Yeah, and they never give us the videos anyway.
It's all happening, folks.
It's all happening.
And we, the elect, will be saved with these books of subgenius stamps now finally assembled.
It ought to be a walk in the park.
Subgenius saving stamps?
Yes.
These books here.
But we, the selected?
I don't know if you were specifically referring to we are doe.
You said we, the selected?
The elected?
Well, we are doe, of course, yes, has been long ago selected.
So one is selected.
But not like everybody else who is, in the famous phrase, selected for extinction.
Yeah, but what if you guys all go like mosquito nostrils and things like that?
Oh, damn.
Well, that's a likelihood of me.
It could happen.
Mosquitoes are a little bit too forward in my case.
One errant thought, one misplaced errant thought on them flying away saucers on X Day and stuff.
Next thing you know, you're surrounded by Canadian soldiers and mayflies or other kinds

of birds.
And you've become one.
Clouds and stinging nightflies buzzing the restful slumber.
If you make an error in the course of rebuilding your own physical body on your escape vessel,
you can always just hit rewind.
You can play.
You can go back.
Yes, be kind.
So all I change on my mind.
Rewind the immediate time.
I don't want a row of breasts running down my back after all.
It just feels awful.
There's like a control Z or something that you can just.
Yeah.
I want giant bat wings.
Oh, my God.
These are heavy.
I don't want them.
Take them off.
Ouch.
Okay.
I want a giant brain.
Oh, no.
Oh, good.
Take it back.
I can never thank you adequately for this.
I want a bigger Johnson.
That's what half of them are going to say.
They want what?
A bigger Johnson.
And so they'll get a lifelike facsimile of the former.
Lyndon Baines Johnson.
Yes, of Lyndon Baines Johnson.
On the toilet.
To share their living space for eternity.
Oh, my God.
Yes.
I have them situated.
When I was a young lad, I had the Zappa, Zappa, Crappa and the Johnson on the Johnson poster
kind of like situated in kind of like an L shaped room.
All of us.
All of us.
Sleep.
All those in college.
Well, we need to do one.
You want to lose your body?
Sleep.
All had Zappa five Zappa, Crappa.
I didn't.
By the way, I don't Tommy the toilet poster by our crime instead.
That was much more rare.
I also.
I also had the black velvet painting of Chairman Mao with big sad eyes by a person I later much
later got to know quite well.
Now, that was really.
Farmer free.
Exactly.
I ordered it from Ripoff Press and my house got it in South Dakota and I still have it
South freaking Dakota.
Yes, I do.
South freaking.
I never knew about that strange.
That is where the real the true people live.
West by Dobbs, Cleveland Heights.
Well, I was right.
South Dakota.
Watch for the.
See, Chungo, Yonkei in South Dakota without seeing Orson Welles in your mind, like wearing
like a phony, you know, white guy, American Indian headdress.
Well, he's calling himself an arguing like a like a like a little robot monkey or some.
You know what I mean?
Well, I suppose you know Orson Welles in an Indian headdress.
Well, you said Rose.
But that was in Colorado.
Well, it it it hardly.
Well, that's how the elements got.
Now.
Okay.
Okay.
Now I'm okay.
Now I understand.
Didn't we have exactly the same conversation last week only without Dr. Howell?
Oh, dear.
I believe we did.
Yes, I believe we did.
I think we did.

Well, I was.
I see what I mean.
Dr. Howell, they've been interviewing us in the rest home and we don't even remember.
They technically augmented our response because our response wasn't good enough.
See, they're allowed to do that in the future.
But what a laugh.
They're forced by many common magnum laws of the municipalities of the state, especially
around here in this one.
They're condemned by law.
You're actually physically forced at the point of a gun to to do that.
To do what?
You have no choice.
Oh, well, you got I forgot what you guys just said you were doing.
And well, the emotional response is technically augmented.
That means they can they can mess with you to make your response more acceptable to viewers.
You know, viewers think that everybody ought to react big when they're watching.
They're just told that they have just one of the publishers clearinghouse contest or
that their loved one has been crushed.
Under us falling safe or something like that.
And you could also win.
Well, it's all possible.
It's a matter of the lottery.
But it just could be that you don't react immediately.
And then they think there's something wrong with you because you're not giving them a
big reaction.
So they have the leads hooked up to you and they give you the biggest emotional response
ever, which is all a matter of just turning the knob all the way over to the right.
I'm so excited.
I'm so excited.
I'm so excited about next day.
The aliens are going to come and make my whole world better.
See, as long as the dial is over here to the right, a river of sand goes on.
But let's turn the dial down a little bit because we don't want to harm his heart there.
But that's typical.
See, that's a face and pop.
This is at the low setting.
That's a little too low.
Now, the opposite danger could happen.
The heart might fail to fire.
There.
This is the middle setting.
This is where it should be.
See, this is Stan the way he normally is.
Amazing, you say?
Incredible?
Fantastic?
But this is real.
This is the Halbot 4000.
I am a robot.
Boop.
Where did he go?
What happened?
There was this huge, like, billy clun...
Margarine-type...
Large robot thing.
Open the bathroom door, please, Hal.
Robot.
Hal, open the bathroom door, please.
I am not a robot.
I'm sorry, Doug.
I don't believe I can do that.
I am not a robot.
See, that's what I like.
A theosophist.
Hal, open the bathroom door.
I'm not kidding.
This is really serious.
It's going to take me five minutes to get out of this space suit.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
You'll just have to go in your survival suit, Doug.
No, no.
I'm trying.
Take deep breaths.
You can actually breathe urine in space.
And it's quite a favor to treat to many of my...
I noticed the Russian crew that was sharing there on the last time with the American crew.
Oh, the Ruskies thought of it first.
Hello, this is Dr. Hal.
I'm on this frequency, too.
I'm listening to Lonesome Cowboy Dave right now.
Stang is spanned and out of control.






I'm going to go outside the personnel capsule.
I really need to go bad.
Yeah, we've got to get him in.
I have a retractor arm that's not responding.
Dave, can you operate the retractor arm from where you are?
Over.
I am a robot.
Oh, man.
We've got some bad news.
I'll give you the bad news first.
The supply ship blew up on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral.
With what?







With that load of comic books for those kids.
Yeah, the comic's going to say the comic books aren't going to make it to you, boys, or the
Playboys.
And so you're going to...
I know you've got enough food.
They all have turned into confetti in Earth's outer atmosphere.
But you're going to have to use your own urine for shampoo.
And I'm going to walk you through that if you will pick up the instruction manual 7SB.
Just remember, it's not really sham.
It's...
Yeah.
It's ShamWow.
Well, it's not really pee.
It's actually poo.
Exactly.
We'll let them in.

We'll let them in on that by degrees.
We'll let them in on that by degrees.
Shoot everybody else.
Anyway, and I'm sorry that you're still going to be stuck in that space station.
Ground control.
But we will be working on it.
There's room to expand in this cabin capsule.
Swing a cat.
Take off your survival suit.
Stretch out.
Put on your slippers.
Oh, there's our flashing dragon.
And the object, let's just take a little walk to the logarithm south, northeast by 25.
And here we are at Black Bear, where he's standing from.
And I'm going to go to the lab.




You know what it is, there's lots of vegetarian, different appliances for each and every heart's
desire you'd care to carry on with.
You're breaking up!
You're breaking up.
We can't understand you.
Roger that.
We have six degrees of yaw at your last position.
Boop.
Yaw.
Yaw, yaw.
We have six degrees.
Und it's yaw all the way down.
And Ibane, Persian.

sure that you're going to yaw again.
Oh, look, there he goes.
He's yawing all over the field.
Well, he was once a great player, huh?
I have a feeling from she-she-ya-ya-da-da.
What is that called?
It's called incipient baby talk syndrome,
and it is to be guarded against like the plague it is.
Yes, we cannot revert to the infantile
at this important juncture in history.
This is no time for baby talk, men.
We need manly men to climb out of the gravity well.
See there, kids?
Just look out the window there.
You can see Saturn flying by.
You think the men from Planet X are looking for a bunch of yelling babies?
Comet, Farrah, Fawcett, and Mages.
So, we're...
When I started the cadet care, well, the first days in the academy,
we were a little rough, but...
Yes, those hilarious, scatological Starfleet Academy movies,
but I think we're beyond.
All that.
Those days of youthful yoiks and hijinks are long gone
because now in our mature old age,
we're prepared to settle comfortably into our roles
as masters of the survivors of the human race.
Masters of the universe!
Key men!
Not she-girls!
Well, of course it's a she-girl.
I don't mean to exclude anyone.
I'll take that sandwich now.
Dude, whatever sandwiches we please.
Yes, we distride the earth like a colossus.
And watch how you talk about sandwiches.
In terror and woe, I throw my right arm to the north,
my left arm to the south,
and my feet stamp the nether abyss
in trembling and howling in dismay.
At what point in west and east, I wonder,
your carbuncles in your dairy area?
Yes, uh...
I'm not talking about the farm either.
You never outgrow your need for dairy in that area?
But, uh, we are transitioning on to something bigger,
bolder, brighter, and grander.
What about batter?
And cheesier.
Batter and cheese are part of the
inevitable panoply of deliciousness.
Better batter.
But cows are not forbidden in literature,
but some devious mayors, on the other hand,
encourage...
Cheeses from the udders of unspeakable alien cattle,
and nuts that grew in no-terrine gardens.
Encouraging.
Oh, you know what I mean?
Now you can hear the sacred bull of Apis bellowing.
Oh, let's go pat him, kids!
Come on, let's go!
I don't know about pine corn!
Praise Bob!
He said it very gently,
so he won't kick us in the forehead and not make us eat it.
I'm ready for some slack!
Easy, bossy.
Slack!
Yes, that horned one has many temptations to offer.
Praise Bob, huh?
Where's the frock?
No!
We can't feed these bulls.

They're beef critters on frock.
They've got to eat cellulose like their ancestors before them.
Whoa!
Check out the udders on her!
And ruminate on that.
Yes, it's true.
Oh, that's cellulite.
Did you know that cattle were carnivores?
Well, now it can be told.
They don't eat the vegetation that they consume,
but only the animalcules that are released from it.
What?
Yes, it's true.
What?
Cattle?
I've been eating meat for years.
Here you go.
Here you go.
My food has been eating germs for food?
My food has been eating meat?
That's right, and it's been traveling through their multiple stomachs.
I've been eating meat made of meat.
You see, you hear…
Digesting and pooping out and eating and digesting and pooping out and eating an endless cycle?
Get used to it.
You hear vegetarians talking about how every cow takes so many umpteen zillion gallons of
water, and it's true because they're fed on grains.
But, as you can see, they're feeding on meat, and that's all they're doing.






They're not supposed to be.
They're supposed to be eating grass.
They're supposed to be out there chewing cuds of cellulose
and not being fed on super expensive water-intensive grains.
They're bad for the beef critters, and they're bad for the humans, too,
giving them all sorts of digestive lapses, upsets, burps, farts.
And arthritis.
Yes, it's true.
Angry cow disease.
And mad cow breaches.
Easy, Wilbur.
Wilbur, don't worry.
We're going to take them two by two, the cattle and the kine,
onto the master saucer.
The two giraffes will line up over there,
and the pygmy hippos better stay in line.
I want to be with the dinosaurs.
And if you think you can be over there, you've got another thing coming.
Everybody in line now.
Meep, meep, meep, meep.
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you please step aside from the line for a brief moment?
I need to check something.
Moving, moving, moving.
Though they're disapproving.
Keep those doggies moving.
Row high.
Don't try to understand them.
Just walk through and brand them.
Soon they'll be lying on their side.
Lying by my side.
She builds our knees.
Come pen.
Come pen, come pen, come pen.
Row high.
Through wind and rain and weather.
Hell bent.
For the.
Leather.
I wishin' my gal was at my side.
At my side.
At my side.
Row high's calculatin'.
My true love will be waitin'.
Waitin' if they end up in the rain.
And we'll become youthful in the rain.
No offense.
Row high.
Row high.

Ow!
Ow!
Shut up.
It's not funny anymore.
Ow!
Mom, cut it out.
It's not funny.

Move him out.
Move him out.
Head him up.
Move him out.
Head him out.
Row high.
Ride him in.
Brand him on.
I'd like to be.
I'd like to be.
Row high.
Much better than the.
The more recent remakes of Diversion.
I'm getting too excited.
And I think all Diversion should get.
And look at the five pound tick on that one.
You really gotta watch out there.
Under the chestnut trees and wisteria, the huge ticks, like in that movie, they drop
down on ya.
You know, ticks drop on ya.
You're getting all scared again, Al.
There's spiders drop on ya, and a lot of things drop on ya.
Are you trying to make the.
I mean, can you.
The younger and the older and the in-betweeners don't survive.
But, you know, certain comely subgeniates groom other subgeniuses.
I saw Pantiera plucking these huge ticks off.
What's the guy's name?
You know, the.
Reverend Bastard.
The Virtuoso.
What's his name?
Virtuoso.
The Virtuoso.
The guy who played the violin real hard.
No one had a violin in the middle of the sump pond at X Day.
No.
Not even a toy.
The twangy ukulele was permitted to sully the damp air with its plaintive sounds.
Are you so very sure of that, my California friend, my friend of green house?
Well, I did see Pantiera grooming Doc Designflaw as they stood shivering in the middle of the
pond.
So, you see, we take care of each other.
We do not allow each other to have our flesh macerated by bulbous ticks.
Dr. Hal, frankly, the squeamish ones will leave you there to drown rather than get in
that water.
They will?
Yes.
I guess they will.
Now, he was describing a scene of pure subgenius compassion.
And here you are.
I'm telling the truth.
What's your feeling?
Half those kids won't even get near that pond because they're afraid somebody's going to
ask them to get in it.
But if you do.
And because of the amphibious devices in the military personnel, sure, every kid should
be afraid of that if it's pointed in the wrong direction.
You wouldn't want the same thing to happen to it.
Oh, when it was a swimming pool, though.
Don't you?
I'll jump in.
But now that it's got a giant prehistoric turtle down at the bottom of it, no bottom.
You see, it gets a little bit harder.
Suddenly, it's just that now they don't.
Oh, well, I'd rather we should have these in hotels like the sci-fi conventions.
It was easy at first.
But now, I think.
That's the boys talking, by the way.
We should be doing this in a motel.
I'd go to it if we were in a motel.
I'm not going to go out there and.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I think we're the same buns.
Throughout the entire weekend, he will be talking in the same fashion.
And it kind of like, like, you'd be wearing high heels.
And one of those nose pins and stuff that all the kids have to have nowadays.
And there in the wood, a piggy wig stood with a ring at the end of his nose.
His nose, a ring at the end of his nose.
Soon to be a hose.
I mean, you know, a vessel for getting rid of stuff.
Dear pig, are you willing?
to sell for a shilling your ring,
said the piggy, I will.
So they took it away
and were married next day
by the turkey who lives on the hill.
Oh, that's a terrible child's rhyme.
They dined upon mints
and on slices of quince,
which they ate with a runcible spoon.
Runcible spoon, kids.
And hand in hand at the edge of the sand,
they danced by the light of the moon.
The moon, they danced by the light of the moon.
By the hairy shudderings of our lunar surface,
I will not be condemned by your nasty, nasty words,
for you have profusely and profanely
disinformed all members of the public here
by what you just said,
because that is not true.
It's not always about you, Dave.
It's an intelligence test.
Can you dig it?
Yes, they have to decipher the secret meaning.
It's an intelligence test,
because I used to know that poem by heart.
Yes, I know.
I'm five years old.
I know.
My father can still recite it just like Hal did.
But can I?
Because I can start to.
I can jump in on the refrains a little bit.
But then the damage kicks in?
Man, I feel like I've been interviewed in the rest home
all for every day for years
and still don't remember any of it.
It'll come back to you.
Well, when you have to carry your bag around
and you forget it,
then you should remember.
Just a word.
A bag, eh?
What were we talking about?
Well, we were just talking about some...
Dr. Gary Prada?
You know, the thing you were talking about.
What you were calling?
You were talking about that hoochie-ma-whopper.
That brain problem we had.
Yeah, it's some kind of ding-futzer
you were yakking about.
Memento?
You know, it's...
The thingamajig.
The Fireside Theater thing.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
Uh, God.
B-L-N-D-N-P-G
That spells blind pig, don't you see?
Teacher said with some surprise
Gal, you've left out both the eyes
Then I said, now, teacher dear
Won't you please and listen here?
Blind pigs have no eyes, you see
You're right, the teacher said to me
Wah-wah-wah
Boop!
Well, I think that puts it in a nutshell.
Very good.



Well, uh, now we needn't make no further comments
since it's all been so paradigmatically expressed.
It only remains to insert a few commercials,
to keep the monetary flow into the coffers
of the Church of the Chub Genius
until the last possible moment,
to cover any emergency that may arise.
People experiencing last-minute panic attacks,
uh, arthropod infestations,
and conceivably unusual weather controversies and incidents.
And I don't want to alarm anyone, but, uh, bears,
and I think you know what kind of bear we're talking about...
Baby bears?
...have been sighted in the earth.
We're not worried about the baby bears.
We're all worried about the huge adult bears
who have crawled around in the garbage can.
I mean them with bare necessities,
old Mother Nature's recipes,
the simple bare necessities... Maybe there will be a judgment.
You would not talk about bad bears.
Bad bears? No, no.
But even if there were such bad bears,
as some have theorized,
they wouldn't bother Baby Bear,
because, uh, she is of their clade.
But everybody else would have to watch out.
Yeah, stay out of her way, boys.
Better watch out.
Well, uh, it hasn't happened yet.
Nobody's wanted to rub on her because she's just like honey?
Bears, man.
We're talking about these semi-legendary bears.
Not the ill-behaved campers at the campground.
Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm will be at the judgment.
There you go.
Dr. Dark will be at the judgment.
You know, this will be his 20th
ex-day...
...campout waiting for the saucers.
Oh, next year will be my...
Many of your denizens have never left these places.
They've camped there the rest of their lives
and started little micro-industries.
And began new lives
where things left off back in...
when days were bad.
At least in September when Milholly and Orwell left.
All together at one time.
Slapping their thighs and arguing with each other
about absolutely nothing at all.
It was a bad day for you, wasn't it?
And you promised yourself you'd never let anything like that
ever, ever happen again.
Boy, is my countenance crimson.
Well, uh, you can make the best resolutions,
but nonetheless, some...
How you just get caught up in the sheer cussedness of things.
It was just such a day.
I think it was in April.
A day like many others.
I appreciate you came to my window.
They spoke little soft words and...
I couldn't understand exactly what they were saying,
so I opened the window.
Big mistake.
Big stag.
Big stag?
Big mistake.
When you opened the window, I mean.
You know, because in there stepped a stately raven
of the saintly days of yore.
Anyway, you shouldn't open the window,
even if you think there's something at your window lattice.
We learn.
If we learn slowly.
These are sad lessons which we've now all absorbed.
Like bluffing people.
I stared nervously out the windows, but never opened the door.
That's what my grandfather used to say.
Because around the edge of a crack your feeling fingers can creep.
Come on in, little humans.
We'll tell you about the church of the subgenius, we will.
You can just sit over here on this apple box,
and that old granny tell you about the church
that leaves you alone for about 25 minutes.
Can we have some tea?
Can we have some candy, granny?
No!
Now shut up and listen.
Oh yes, of course you can, my dear.
Can we have pumpkins and big white things?
Look, the walls are made out of candy corn.
No, don't pull a piece out, it'll all fall.
Oh, you clumsy little schlimeels.
Well, it's unfortunate that the generations can't get along.
I want more candy.
All right, all right.
Calm down, calm down.
It's because of the actual lack of contact, Hal.
If you guys are not all together hugging,
then it's hard to make out the, well, it's kind of like the Cinque Fatte at the market.
You know, I'm going to tell you something actual and honest.
I'm going to get it off my chest here.
Each year I go to this thing in California called the Dragon's Breath Fire Festival,
where I'm a performer, and these, they're all hippies, they're out in the woods,
and there comes a certain point during the program
when I know they're going to call everyone down from the rocky seats of the amphitheater
for the big group hug.
And at that time, at that time I'm already moving back through the woods to avoid it.
Edging away.
Yes, I subtly remove myself from the circle of the firelight
so that when they're calling everyone down for this unspeakable ritual, I myself am...
I love you, too, Juan.
Oh, yeah, you too, also.
Yeah, one develops an instinct for these things.
Time for the amoeba hug.
Let's have an amoeba.
But I thought Tommy Amoeba wasn't coming.
Amoeba.
That's actually really fun, if you're on drugs.
Hugs, not drugs.
Oh, that's not fun.
I hate that feeling when people just suddenly decide,
people you don't know suddenly decide they're going to comfort you somehow
by wrapping their big slobbery nose,
and even trying to smooth your cheek like a little bastard child would,
you know, like when mommy's left home.
Hey, hands off.
Hands off?
I know you mean well, but do that again and I'll kill you.
Oh, is this on?
Well, you know, we all have different customs, and that...
Diversity, they call that.
That's what I think about diversity.
It's communist.
That's what Philo Drummond says.
He's constantly raging...
Communist!
Raging against the concept of diversity.
But...
Well, we're all diverse.
Well, he explained to me that that's because he's old.
We discussed that just the other day.
Oh, he did?
Philo, why do you hate everything?
It's because I'm old.
Well, I'm damn near as old as you, Philo, and I don't hate everything.
Yes, what about the little birds and the flowers,
the perfumes on the breeze,
the skunks and the pollens?
Stop and smell the skunks and the pollcats, man.
The badger and the armadillo.
Yeah.
The...
Yeah, the pollcats.
And what about all the youth in their little sequestered utility room,
sitting in school waiting for something to happen?
Well, you can't give everybody a pass.
Somebody's gonna have to go under.
We have to plow some under so that we can...
But they're crappy at everything, too.
Well, you have to make a judgment somewhere.
You know, there's no point in unrealistic, fatuous affection for everyone.
All right. Yeah.
Of course, might be done.
People say they want the affection of God in heaven,
but they're talking about some grandfather in heaven,
a benign, senile presence that lets you tug on its watch chain.
Yes, I tell you, it's gonna be slightly different.
Slightly different.
And it will be even more different because this show has come to a bitter close.
Oh, no!
Yes, the time has come...
Oh, no!
...for us to say goodbye, but just for a little while,
because we'll be back again next week,
which happens to take place within just a few minutes.
We will?
Yes, we will.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Because we are not going to leave.
I get you.
The listeners may leave.
Now I understand.
The internet listeners may leave.
You got me now.
I understand.
I was just a little slow on the uptake there.
Still on the uptake there, huh?
Yeah, exactly. I wasn't too fast on the...
And so, you've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack,
in its classic form...
Slack.
...with special guest Dr. Hallin-O.
Hi, folks.
And Princess Wiardo...
Hi.
...with lonesome cowboy Dave...
Hi, Dave.
...and your host, Reverend Eric Tseng.
Thank you.
And for more information, you may check out subgenius.com.
Check it out.
Dude.
And with that, Dave, you'll have to call back when, Dr. Sinister?
Sometime?
Try again in a little while?
Because...
I will try again.
I'll try and...
Because that way...
...I'll continuously...
You're fading.
...try to understand...
You're fading.
Just a brief...
There he goes, Dave.
...just a brief interlude.
...a tiny fading...
I got news for you, guys.
...at the bottom of the sound...
You guys are fading, too.
God, what is going on here?
Jeepers.
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen?
I know what's coming.
Have I got to beat you to make you understand?
It's...
The subgenius, Hour of Slack.
...with lonesome cowboy Dave.
...with lonesome cowboy Dave.


It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history.
