The big machine, 8,000 cubic miles of Kleistron relays, enough power for a whole population of subgeniuses.
Operated by remote control.
Operated by the electromagnetic impulses of individual subgeniuses' brains.
To what purpose?
In return, that ultimate machine would instantaneously project mob to any point on the planet.
In any shape or color they might imagine.
For any purpose.
Mob?
By mere thought.
Why haven't I seen this all along?
But like you, the subgeniuses forgot one deadly danger.
Their own subconscious hate and lust for mob.
The beast.
The mindless primitive.
And so those mindless beasts of the subgeniuses had access to a machine that could never be shut down.
The secret devil of every soul on the planet all set free at once to loot and maim.
And take revenge and kill mob.
After a million years of shining sanity, they could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.
Mob?

Ah, yes dear friends.
Here's an hour of slack.




We haven't used in years by Reverend Zoso Dada.
Those clips from Forbidden Planet a minute ago were from a new guy, Doc Cosmic.
But get ready because we're about to play a song by our friend Charleston Okafor,
who does the show just before this one at WCSB.
And yeah, I think you will be as amazed as I was.
Let's go.
Adorable, impeccable, your personality
Simplicity, so humble, in a special way
You think I'm in love, so deep it's my fault somebody's stopping me
On your ego, face to face, we got so bright
Then worry your eyes, because every day's a call
You smile at me, love just like a star on a map
We don't wear you out, we don't dassoot my soul
Rama Rama, Rama Krishna
Krishna Krishna
Rama Rama, Rama Krishna
Krishna Krishna
Rama Rama, Rama Rama
Girl in the hill, gently scoping you
You're my fantasy
You got me twisted
Oh, naughty girl
You're my apple wood
Fruit to my taste
Beer to my boo
I'm high on love in you
Said I'll drop on me
High above my reach
Still I'm digging you
Sunshine in your fears
Delicious choice for my love
Rama Rama Krishna Krishna Krishna
Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna


Whatever place!
Lamb of God, Lamb of God, Lamb of God, Lamb of God.

I don't suppose either one of you know why Bob's car is parked out in front?
Good question.
No.
However, I will say, Bob, please don't interrupt me, man, because I'm trying to stay focused.
Oh, whoa.
Excuse me.
Are the explosives really necessary here?
Man, who's boss is this thing to?
Bob, look, I'm paying.
Damn it.
Bob.
You son of a bitch.
You're not paying attention if you're messing around with the gun.
Now, quit.
Keep the gun on the table.
I can't focus unless the gun is on the table.
Well, you just paid for it.
Shut up, man.
Shut up.
Bob.
I'm warning you now.
Be quiet, please.
It's true.
Okay.
There.
Do you see the star?
It's me right there, and I'll be in there.
Bob, you're the zero out here in the car.
Okay, we're heading back to Bob's, so we're going to hit the road and go on the lane.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.


Go.


One thing.
Bob gets the spirit award on this case.
The contribution was never accepted.
Come here, Bob.
Come here.
Did you see the look he gave me?
Don't double cross this guy.
Don't even think about it.
You son of a bitch.
You're going to cut me up.
You're going to not wait a second.
Wait a second.
Bob.
That's a good haircut there that my friend needs to get.
Bob, you went like this.
Bob is a big boy.
Now, we are in the real world.
We don't settle our problems with hugs, man.
We settle them with bare knuckles and head shots.
Right now.
Let's go, Lord.
Let's go.
See you in a minute.


Bob!
Bob! Stop it!
Come on, Bob!
Come here, Bob.
I'm going to hug him.
I would like to have you on the team.
If you'll have to.
Pal and Philo are out there on the edge of the world now
with the one ring that will make everything different.
Yes, sir.
You can tell by the music.
When you start talking about gadgets,
gadgets, all conversation ceases and stops.
Comes to a dead stop.
Ceases and stops.
Yeah, see, now, it's an electronic world now.
They're lost in their little devices, the iPhone 36.
Oh, wow.
No, it's true, though.
I mean, who cares?
They work so well.
They do what we want them to do.
They're fantastic platforms for creativity.
It's just fun to whine about the change.
It's not the thing itself.
It's the dynamic of having to keep catching up
with them faster and faster.
It costs you some change.
Yeah, it costs you some change.
Change you can believe in.
Yeah, you have to believe in it,
because you just made it.
For the richest person on earth.
And every show,
because everybody's got their own show now.
Yes, you too can help buy someone who's richer
than most smaller nations,
buy yet another house.
Yeah.
We need a couple more houses.
I mean, they do.
Yeah, they do.
Us and them?
Philo's such a great man, he's going to give us and them
a few more houses.
I don't see how we can do that without making other people
feel included in our large ass.
That's the only way.
Well, that's a very handsome attitude.
We will bestow upon those.
Those seen as deserving,
although obviously
they would be as great
out of their depth.
They've tried.
Yes, they can't handle power tools.
Just look at that sloppy job.
Yep, look at those shoes.
Look at those floppy, sloppy socks.
Obviously, if you're wearing sloppy
hirachis, you don't care about your personal appearance.
No, you don't care.
And why should you?
It would be a
just be a horrible,
thing to impose upon an individual
asking that they're
about hygiene and
what would be the point?
It's just such a superfluous act,
a waste of time and effort.
So, I'm going to
when you're just going to get dirty and filthy and
filled with fetid rot
at some point in time in the future anyway, again.
Why advance that time?
Wait a minute.
I just said I'd do a show.
I didn't say I'd rot for that.
You wouldn't smell rot for the show?
When they went to try to depose the supposedly dead magician,
Maligris, that he cursed them and made them rot.
Though Maligris?
And where they stood.
Yes.
See, that's some strong ink in there.
I'll wipe this stuff off.
A church audience is rolling out
church secrets as he's talking about.
Oh, no more church secrets now.
Puzzling evidence.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
No, we...
What have we been listening to?
Oh, the Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.
Just some clips there.
Philo, Dr. Drummond.
I mean, Philo is Dr. Drummond.
Hal is Dr. Hal.
And Puzzling Evidence is actually the name of the show
and the man, Puzzling Evidence.
And once again, we played that song we played,
Rama Rama.
Rama Rama.
Coming in the template,
comes out on SID Metric implant heart



Come On.



is all it is.
The Era of The Verbal Eye,
is a hyperreb Mortal Art,
which after reading it.
имся
a weird mashup of an old religious chant
fits in perfectly.
The little chopped-up movie soundtrack,
I don't know what the movie was,
the armed bobbery there was by another new contributor,
Richie and Soren.
And I'm going to go back to reading a little bit
from our out-of-print bauble.
The Bobliographon.
Actually, the complete title is
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack.
Cyclopedia spelled with a P-S-Y.
That was Princess Wee's idea.
New revelations from J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And here's what Bob said.
To continue from last week,
I'm getting to where I have to take my glasses off to read now.
Slackers fighting back.
A contradiction in terms?
What then do we do about the conspiracy?
Asked the young subs of us elder hierarchs.
I want to rip them a new soul hole.
I have much feist in me.
Just tell me how to source it properly.
They say, well, some Native Americans have a piece of paper
that says they still own South Dakota.
Jesus has a piece of paper that says
he owns the moon.
But if he doesn't have enough lawyers, guns, and money,
he's got no more hope of holding onto his property
than the Indians did.
You cannot defeat the conspiracy.
In fact, you probably can't even weaken it.
But you can make yourself stronger.
You can make yourself less dependent on the conspiracy
or anybody else.
You're going to have to get out from under mom and dad.
Before you can take on big oil, though.
If you're on the dole, eventually you'll have to choose
between living off the system and overthrowing it.
By definition, you can't do both forever,
although we've certainly seen plenty try.
Voltaire said that if you want to change the world,
cultivate your garden.
Now, we agree.
First, mow your own damn yard.
Then you can tell everybody else what to plant.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
To end slacklessness,
the subgenius must have slack.
True slack.
That's self-evident.
Everybody who's anybody knows that.
And we're with everybody who's anybody.
But it's not for everybody.
We're only into it if it's only for everybody who's anybody.
We're too independent to follow the big crowd.
We only follow the small crowd.
Unless they're too small.
Everybody knows that everybody who's anybody already knew that,
except for the nobodies.
Nobody who's anybody doesn't know that.
See?
We're nobody's fools.
Nobody who's anybody, anyway.
This church is not the final weapon that will bring down the conspiracy.
It only provides an umbrella under which all of you misfits
can yourselves conspire for a while,
if you have enough sense to get in out of the rain.
So wake up!
Become a doctor.
Instantly.
777!
Well, that's what it says here, anyway.
Um...
Bob is here to fight the conspiracy by breeding new,
quote, humans, unquote, that are more like the oldest breed.
Stinky humans.
With instincts.
The flattening of the personality that comes with the average conspiracy,
uh,
life style,
has suppressed genetic instincts down through the millennia.
That's exactly why so many people injure or kill their own children,
or customers, or constituents.
It's why marriages don't work half the time,
and why the family's gotten a bad name.
It's why you keep screwing yourself!
As Dobbs said in 1967, while reading the front page,
Father...
Don't forgive them.
For they know exactly what they do.
Yes, my friends!
Each murder of Bob only refuels our holy flame throwers of vengeance!
That we may torch all pinkness!
That we may burn out, root out, and cauterize the evil and impurity
to sweep clean the filth from Earth Farm One!
Uh, the...
Exists would have done it years ago,
but for Bob's haggling to get a better price for it.
So what are you?
A human?
Or a subgenius?
Are you gonna let God and the conspiracy just walk all over ya?
If the church of the subgenius goes down,
civilization goes up in flames.
But,
as Reverend B.J. Maloney said,
when the world goes up in flames,
the subgenies will have the weenies.
Just as the characters in Hamlet never mention Shakespeare,
the Pink cannot see to what extent he depends upon our most insipid fantasies
for his entire lifestyle.
The Pink is like a blind, deaf albino snake crawling on the floor of a pitch-dark cave.
But ol' Spelunker Bob has a flashlight,
a snake bag,
and a gig in Spike.
Soon enough,
you'll be searching for Bob on the scaly roof of your mouth.
The church of the subgenius.
We put the ha in hate,
and the lo in love,
along with the fun in fundamentalism,
the uh in fundamentalism,
the mental in fundamentalism,
the ism in fundamentalism,
the fundamental in fundamentalism,
the da in fundamentalism,
the da and the fu,
and even the u.
That's you, friend.
So, yeah, that's all from the Bob Leografon,
the Encyclopedia of Slack,
out-of-print subgenius book.
Our first book, Book of the Subgenius, is still in print.
It's a,
it's even in some sort of really degenerated e-book format.
Uh, but yeah,
Thunder's Mouth Press was daring enough to publish this,
this wonderful newish subgenius book.
Well, it's nine years old now.
Old enough to marry in some countries.
Heh, heh, heh.
Eh, mm.
And, uh,
but, you know,
I suppose we could turn this thing into an e-book ourselves.
I believe the rights would revert back,
and all the artwork could be in color,
because on this book,
the artwork originated in color, most of it.
It just cost too much to print that way.
But an e-book,
why, color's the same as black and white.
We could even do it in 3D.
Ehh.
That would be weird.
I'd have,
you'd have to fake it all.
It'd be like the conspiracy fake 3D they use for movies now.
You know, most of those movies are not actually shot in real 3D.
They're just shot.
Yes, they impose 3D upon them in retrospect.
Yeah.
Or, hey, we saw,
on the way to the station,
we saw a guy walking down the street with a T-shirt that said,
Keeping Cleveland Retro.
I like that.
I like that line.
The guy fit.
I mean, he looked kind of retro.
Mm-hmm.
He looked kind of 90s.
Indeed he did.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, huh.
Keeping Cleveland.
It's like,
you know,
the problem is that once you say that,
it means it's already too late.
It's like in Austin,
you see the saddest bumper sticker,
Keep Austin Weird.
And you'll see that bumper sticker for the next 30 minutes,
if you happen to see it while you're on the expressway there,
because it's not weird anymore.
It's just another crowded,
horrible,
weird,





Silicon Valley,
Dallas-like,
nightmarish place.
Mm-mm-mm.
How come we're not seeing any,
uh,
It didn't know.
We're hearing Dave.
I don't quite get that.
Our Dave must call.
Princess,
you might want to keep your eye on this false phone line here,
which I can't see quite as well.
Okay.
I can do that.
I could always,
um,
you know,
if we're not interesting or funny,
I can always put on Puzzling Evidence again,
and,
and,
uh,
Dr. Howell,
and Philodrumon.
But,
Oh,
but surely Dave will call soon.
Well,
and besides that,
we're more intelligent and funny anyway.
I was about to read some more from this,
uh,
book,
but I can't read this section by Reverend Lemuel Atom.
Oh,
now I remember who Lemuel Atom is.
It's my cousin.
Oh,
my cousin in Portland.
But since he wants to be Lemuel Atom,
I better not say his name,
but his last name is,
uh,
uh,
Smedley.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Smedley.
Smedlab.
All right.
Oh,
the music in the background,
by the way,
is,
uh,
Esquivel,
the great,
the great Mexican composer.
I believe he is Mexican.
Esquivel.
Did you know that Brotherhood is a great,






great,


And did you know that Brother Cleve made an album with Esquivel just before Esquivel died?
Yes,
I did know that.
That's so phenomenal though.
I went to Cleve's house once,
and he held up these boxes of hand-lettered reel-to-reel tape and said,
this is Esquivel's handwriting.
These are his tapes.
I couldn't believe it.
And neither will Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
if he ever hears it.
The Lonesome?
You see?
I told you.
One,
one's one year.
No,
No, we don't pick up the phone until we're finished talking about you, Dave.
I thought it was until you got done doing the credits and stuff, something normal like that.
Oh, we hardly had any credits this time.
I didn't play very much.
I did play a song by Charleston.
Yes.
The guy who does the African Abstract show before us.
And you can hear that show.
I did music on that show.
Huh?
It's an excellent show.
I love it.
I love African Abstract.
How can you hear it in Ashtabula?
I could hear it before.
Oh, right.
And I still remember.
I don't think it's gotten bad or anything.
I think it's gotten better, so it was great to begin with.
You're just guessing, though.
You don't know.
No, but I'm pretty hip to some other things happening in world music,
and I know that he's right on top of everything.
And also erudite.
Yes, but he keeps it retro, too.
Tonight he was playing some old stuff, so he keeps a good mix going.
How would I know if something was old?
I'm so old, everything seems new to me.
If something is from the 60s, it's old.
That's me.
Oh, that reminds me.
I was...
But Charleston had...
I've been rereading the Time Life book.
Done in the 60s.
Oh, man, you are old.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, they...
Those books sucked!
No, no, actually, they're...
Well, they were...
They had a lot of details in them that would be considered wrong or incomplete now.
For instance, the book I was reading mentioned that computers...
They've been able to make computers so small that they can fit on a spaceship.
Fit on a what?
A spaceship.
A spaceship.
Yeah, they were planning to put...
They were making computers so small that they were planning to put one on the moon missions
that were proposed at the time of this book.
None of them had actually happened.
And it had these amazing...
Oh, let's see.
Here's this one.
But what is...
Microcircuits.
What is it?
This microcircuit was so small, no larger than the capital O.
Oh.
In this sentence.
And does the job of four transistors and two resistors.
They were impressed by that level of miniaturization in 1961.
Yeah, I was going to query you right now on the state of miniaturization and nanotechnology at this very moment.
It's ridiculous.
There are things that are so small now and they contain so many different information.
So much different...
So much information.
And they're so tiny.
They're so very tiny.
They're like...
How do you measure them?
Now, what were we talking about?
The brains of the presidential candidates?
Or the brains of the voters for the presidential candidates?
Nano small.
I'm for veterinary.
I'm going to write in Havelock veterinary for president.
That's what I've decided.
He's unfortunately fictitious.
He's the tyrant who controls Ankh-Morpork in the Discworld books by the late Sir Terry
Peele.
I honestly wrote the book.
Because I think it's pretty great, but ituh, uh, Caitlyn classem always talking about one
other band that's what reallyности night track think they're talking about want every
thing, you know, one thing and only reason is should never be the second choice in life.

pickup judgments.
Well, how about Mary Evan.
I remember when I got all these to.
Gary Hall was writing for the New York Times about this event.
And I'm starting to read him.
It was a Cameron'sغandbank investigatory Quiun, de BerGMox.
Yeah.
Luckily, that will never happen to us, right, Dave?
Well, I'm sure it'll happen to me.
But I think it could be protracted.
What do you mean, will?
Everybody gets it a little bit.
Everybody gets it a little bit when they, you know, when you turn 90 or something like that.
You're automatically getting a little bit more befuddled once in a while and ask questions like,
are we in the same building that we were just in three minutes ago?
90, I was going to say 16 or 17.
That's when it starts.
No, no, but 90 is the natural course of the river that flows through you gently,
through your over-muscled mind right now, I might say, as long as I'm acting like a chimp.
But it's 90 or even 90 years.
Supposedly.
I don't know.
Maybe I picked this up like a bad rash or something.
The average person doesn't live anywhere near that long.
Come on.
And they get stupid long before they die.
I can prove it.
I'm about to prove it with the next half hour's worth of sentences that I say.
So there.
It'll all be one repeating sentence.
And you'll ask it each time, every time you finish.
You'll ask if you've finished yet.
And then you'll want some more dinner.
And then you've already eaten.
And the next thing you know, you don't even like chocolate anymore unless someone smears it in your third nostril.
It's a hell of a...
Hell of a...
It's a hell of an afterlife.
Yeah.
A heavenly hell of an afterlife.
I've been thinking, Dave.
I was just sitting down the other day, and I was just thinking.
And I had this thought.
Things that are equal to the same things, I realized, are equal.
Logistically.
Logistically.
Or things that are equal to the same things are all equal.
And then I went, wait a minute.
If that's true, then if equals are added to equals, then the sum...
The sums are equal.
No, no.
It just occurred.
And I thought, man.
You'd think...
It's invalid.
No, no.
I'm certain of it.
And if equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
This all just hit me in like a huge fit.
Of spasmodic brain work.
Well, have you tried like Avogadro's Law or Pi or any of those other...
Oh, it's all self...
It's self-evident and axiomatic.
These aren't mere postulates.
It's like two and 20 after you wrote it down.
Especially when you smeared your nose all over it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know, but it's weird how one thought leads to another.
The next thing I was thinking, well, you know...
You can draw.
I picked up a pencil and I said, you know, you can draw a straight line from any point to any other point.
I'm sorry, Lennon.
And if it's...
My pants are chasing.
I'm sorry.
I think that the little place in the back of your head between the corpus callosum and your midbrain or, you know, closer to your neck there.
I think you need to take a little attention off that a little bit.
Just like...
Maybe turn to the left.
See if you get some drippage.
Oh, you're just anti-intellectual.
No, I'm not.
I'm anti-intellectual.
You think I'm crazy.
Oh, that part's true.
I definitely do think you're quite mad.
I know this for a fact.
And others would corroborate it, wouldn't they, we?
Yes.
Well, I don't know.
Try this experiment.
If you draw a circle and you can describe any point as the center.
And with a radius, the radius is going to be equal to any finite straight line drawn from the center.
The center of that circle.
Try it.
You'll be shocked.
But if you do that, it will come true every single time.
But how can you draw an infinite line?
It's a circle.
It's not...
Well, it can be infinitely large or infinitely small, I suppose.
But measuring it becomes a problem.
But on the other hand...
Now, this one...
Whether this is true or not requires measurement.
And you can't...
You can't...
That's...
There's something phylogistically incorrect, though.
In your...
Assumption, it's kind of like a closed state or something that doesn't really exist.
It's an ideal state.
No, that's different than...
Well, I don't know.
If you keep...
Infinity cannot be measured, though, by its nature.
Of course.
Which is, you know, running around barren...
Well, no.
You're limited by your tools, of course.
But in theory, in pure...
The pure thought that I was having that just occurred to me one day.
For instance...
Well, now, if I think about it...
If you...
Say you inscribe a bunch of triangles inside of a circle.
Well, each of those triangles is going to have a flat end.
So how can you...
How can it ever be a circle?
But if you make them ever smaller, ever more diminishing triangles,
they can become closer and closer.
And so that their bases start to sit on the circumference.
And eventually, of course, it becomes ridiculous.
Reducto ad infinitum.
Ridiculous.
Not even a computer would be able to figure it out.
And you'd just have pie in your face.
Because it would just be an irrational...
It'd be irrational.
And that was another thing.
I thought, some numbers make sense.
Irrationality, yes.
Some numbers make good sense.
Like one, two, three, even two and a half.
Three and a half.
But then you got these crazy numbers.
Like when you start trying to...
A square root of two.
Well, what are you going to do with that?
Well, if you like to play with...
You keep calculating it, and it just doesn't end.
It's like the triangles inside the circle.
It's like the repetition in nines.
In multiplication, addition, and subtraction.
And division.
The nines resurface.
And it's the basis for numerology.
But it was once a jolly, jolly, nice arithmetic system.
Which was supplied by the system of ten.
Which is a commercial system, as we all know.
We studied our archaeology.
And closely examined our nasal hair.
Well, the superior numeral system was the third.
Yeah, but it wasn't a 30-based one.
No, 60.
60-based.
Because you can divide 60 by more numbers than you could ever divide 10 by.
It's complicated though.
And there's a reason why the Mesopotamians finally dropped it, and picked up that silly
10-based thing.
Just cause everybody had 10 fingers.
Well, what about some of us with nine fingers?
Or 11 fingers?

Where are we to be in this brave new world of proofs?
Odd.
Very odd.


Odd?
Just odd.
You're calling me odd because I have 15 fingers and 45 feet?
Yes.
You calling me odd?
Well, no.
I'm not 45 actual feet.
45 temporal three-visit feet.
Well, now speaking of 45, it's what's really relaxing and reassuring to know is that all right angles are equal to each other.
If they're right angles, they're all equal to each other.
Same exact damn thing.
That just blows my mind, dude.
I sat down scribbling on a napkin.
I drew a little triangle.
I said, okay, now see, I got this triangle that I drew has two equal sides.
Oh, my God, the angles on the two opposite sides are exactly equal to each other.
And I just thought, if that's true, then what if you drew two straight lines?
The cross?
The cross.
The cross each other, not parallel.
They cross each other.
That's going to form four angles, and the opposite angles are always going to be equal.
But there is hope.
There is hope in this world.
Because there's symmetry?
Because there's some tiny, tiny bit of order, and at least I finally started thinking of it.
You know, I don't know.
It seems to me like, you know, from this basis, you could carry on.
You could build a whole science out of it.
Just like the Nazis.
That's the problem with your thinking right now.
You're rediscovering the laws of mathematics, the old ones,
and then you're making up some new ones that are hypothetically true based on your syllogistic logic.
However, you haven't taken it to its furthest extent.
You, on the one hand, say all angles were 45 circle degrees.
You know, that's stuff you learn in high school, everything like that.
What?
And then you've moved on to the second level where you've extrapolated somehow that everything is everything.
I didn't.
I didn't.
I didn't learn any of that stuff in high school.
They lied to me.
They just drew a bunch of crazy symbols on a chalkboard, and I was supposed to understand what was going on.
Of course, that was before my parents found out that I was effectively blind and also deaf.
But that hadn't slowed me down a bit.
I figure I worked all this stuff out on my own.
Do you know if you divide a circle exactly in half that its diameter will bisect it?
That perfectly?
And then it becomes a semicircle.
And any angle inscribed in that semicircle, guess what kind of an angle it's going to be?
A right angle.
Because if it was something else, it'd be the wrong angle.
Oh, now that was planned.
I could hear the dissonant sound of like a German or a neo-Nazi or maybe we probably could.
And I got to looking at that picture.
I was looking at that picture of the circle and I was thinking,
what if he made like a board?
A board that was shaped like that.
It could, you could move it and set it upright kind of,
and it would move easier than if it was laying down on its flat surface.
You'd have to drag it.
But if you put it upright, you could roll it.
And if you put a stick between that circle and another circle,
you could put a damn box on it and you wouldn't have to drag the box anywhere.
You could.
You could roll it.
And I thought, man, what an invention.
Only a subgenius could come up with this same thing over and over again.
I'm pretty sure I thought of it the week before last too.
You've lost a genius ear-shaking now.
There's not a wink of curiosity in any of this ostracage.
This is just the main lines of three critter violence and unusual behavior from out in the motor vehicle zones that we're so fond of lately.
It seems like everybody,
it seems like everybody,
wants to get there before they have any time to get there.
And next thing you know,
all mathematics equals all mathematics.
What does that have to do with mathematics?
And how could, I mean,
I guess I wasn't making any sense.
But now that Dave talks, I can see the sense in it.
I think it's the,
I think all that other stuff I was talking must have been a bunch of gobbledygook.
What you gonna do with that?
What is the point of knowing all these stupid angles and circles?
And pies and slices?
Well, before you invented the wheel,
it was the fact that I thought you were gonna lay it,
put an overlay on this huge circle that was divided into quadrants and also into like degrees and stuff of 360 of which there are 90 in this circle.
And 24 times 90 is 360.
And then you would put a solar map or perhaps even a map of the constellations.
It would be the overlay.
You could use it for mapping.
And you could tell how long it would take to get to Pegasus or Thesaurus or any of those other playthroughs that lived down there.
The constellation Thesaurus.
The dinosaur.
Also known as, also known as, also known as.
God-saurus.
Theosaurus, Theos-Thesaurus,
also known as the God lizard.
Is the most famous constellation in the night sky.
Even the primitives recognize the,
the head of the Tyrannosaurus and the tip of its tail, which we call the North Star.
And it was like, I think it was around midsummer time when the savages would grind their nuts into a firm paste and spread it out equally in four different portions of the wind.
I guess, northeast, south and west, which you can divide up into a thermometer too if you want to go that far.
Yeah, then you get your circles and your radii and all that stuff.
Yeah, then you get your circles and your radii and all that stuff.
You can do lobotomy, you know, you can test your barometric pressure.
You can do all kinds of stuff like that, but I think science is not Fortean.
It's, it's weak.
It just proves Reverend Stang's mind works in circles.
That's it.
Great men run in circles.
Too many video games.
It's like, you know, you discover something like you discover Avogadro's law or pi or nines or any of the other math stunts and stuff.
And you go, never mind, I'm sorry.
I got flat-swinged for a minute and I forgot everything was catching fire, so.
Them scientists, them scientists is stupid.
I think once they understand all this stuff and then they start to play around at the end, I think they're crazy.
You know, I could tell.
Wait a minute, are you saying that my...
I came up with a weapon that would automatically listen to everyone and shoot them at the same time and then heal them.

I'm in charge of that.
Or something like that, you know.
Maybe I should erase those notes I made about the circles and lines and stuff because that could lead to weapons.
That would be terrible.
It's best not to have knowledge.
Knowledge is, there are things that man was not meant to know.
And we've learned this from monster movie after monster movie.
When man dares to play God and trespasses into the realms of the world.
When man dares to play God and trespasses into the realms of the world.
When man is but a result of the divine, why...
Who will be surprised when Gorgo comes back to rescue her child.
And she turns out to be a lot bigger than baby Gorgo.
I thought baby Gorgo was big monster.
Like, go see mama Gorgo.
Well, that's where them scientist stuff will get ya.
Global warming.
It was cold yesterday.
It was so stupid.
See, that's where you can't tell your husband's from your business.
in this. You're so
inorderated of these different
functions that you're
considering right now. If they've all run
together right square in your mid-range,
close to your corpus callosum,
that part there where all the lines
go in different directions and tell different
parts of your brain different stuff you don't want
to communicate.
So, you've
got a hold of that, sure, but you're
just grasping it too firmly, and I think
you're going to put it out of its misery.
Oh, no.
It sounds like the isthmus
of business to me.
Of business, yeah.
But
Stan is only a commercial entrepreneur
on paper.
In reality, he's more like a
dandy.
An interstellar fop. Goes to different
planets and makes speeches.
He gets paid in
U.S. dollars, but
you know, who's paying
the checks? That's what I want to know.
Or the Slovenians.
Oh, Dave's...
That's a good question.
Okay, I get the hint, Dave. I get the hint.
Good question.
Okay, the checks. Okay, it's in the mail, okay?
No, I was talking
about the X, you know,
the X marks the
people, or whatever they are,
who signed them
for you.
I can't breathe.
No, I'm all right.
People don't even sign checks anymore.
No, that's why
cursive writing has come to a
dismal end.
And we're going to lose our...
Well, we're not going to lose our thumb
because of texting and stuff.
I'm glad that appendage,
the good old thumb,
good for putting in people's nostrils
or eyes or ears to throw them off
balance and perhaps
fight with them or...
It's important for
flipping coins and snapping your fingers.
Have you done that with your tongue?
The coin flipping?
No, I have not.
Yeah, because that...
It's pretty poisonous and toxic.
I guess this whole family
of Amish people somewhere close to where we're not
right now, we're not really there
right now.
But they all threw mushrooms
together with coins
to see if there was any copper meaning
poison in the mushrooms.
And they didn't know that there was
no copper in pennies anymore.
And so then they ate the mushrooms
and then they...
I had a public execution
or...
election or erection
or one of those words that starts with that E.
Oh my God, I just realized something.
Given a straight line and any point not on this line
through that point, there's only one line
that's parallel to the given line.
Good God.
Do you realize what this means?
One could invent a calculating machine.
An abacus, if you will.
Perhaps.
Or a tiny microchip computer
from 1983.
Or he could just hire some brainiac.
But where am I going to get the money
to hire the smart guy?
Rob the 7-Eleven!
Okay, I've got it figured out.
I know where we're going from here.
He's somehow obsessed
with straight lines between points.
I don't know what happened,
but something has happened.
It had to do with the timeline.
They're finite.
That's the interesting thing.
The reassuring thing...
is as long as it's between points,
then you can get some kind of a handle on it.
It's when you take one of them damn points away,
you better leave that one to Bob.
Let Bob follow that line.
Because ain't nobody but Bob's going to come to the end of that little booger.
It's a godzillion points long.
That's the party line he's been following for quite some time.
Oh yeah?
Well, if you're so smart, Mr. Holy Man,
what about a godzillion and one?
Well, I don't know.



Is there a number so big that God can't count up to it?
No, that's more like a little 11-amplifier.
Come on, Padre.
Come on, that's got to be an answer.
I like the way you call me Padre like that.
I can just see you like ripping the chest hair off.
Well, it's actually a merkin you're wearing right now,
but ripping your chest hair off.
Bless me, Father, thrive soon.
Three times in the last 45 seconds.
That's Catholic.
No, no, no.
Some Catholic priests aren't pedophiles, Dave.
You shouldn't spread those kind of stereotypes.
There are some that don't molest little boys.
What's that have to do with the chest merkin?
No, that's the Egyptian mystery scribe priest.
That's a whole different cult altogether.
They don't have chest hair.
They've wounded themselves with toilet or lacquer.
How about them Amazon ladies?
I bet they didn't have chest hairs.
I think they just pushed one booby down a little bit.
They were real hard and stuff.
And so if they had to shoot a bow and arrow,
if they were left-handed in their...
Never mind, that isn't worth seeing.
Now, okay, if an Amazonian was in a rock band and played guitar,
which side of her shoulder would she put the strap on?
Um...
Say she was in a topless guitar.
The reason I ask this is I saw a picture on the internet earlier today.
Of a 60s all-woman rock band who performed in strip clubs without their shirts on.
And wouldn't you know it, the subgeniuses were all going,
wow, look at their guitars.
Whoa, look at those old retro synthesizers.
I'm like slapping my head going,
boys, do we need to go back to sex ed 101 subgenius kindergarten style?
Does Kegazongas mean anything to you at all, lad?
That was, I couldn't, I couldn't...
I think you're forgetting some of the most important things in life.
I thought I was weird.
Jeez, man.
Now, there's some of them that don't think a girl is pretty
unless she doesn't look like a girl.
She has to look like a drawing and have the head of a beast.
An animal.
No, I'm not kidding.
There's a lot of people out there who have conventions now.
No, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.
I'm just saying, God, that's weird.
Yeah, really, how far are they going to go with this sort of...
It makes me want to bully them, you know?
It makes the bullying come out in me.
To me, it just makes the sarcastic critical,
now I'm going to go and hang myself part of them and come out.
Of course, that's a...
Well, that took long enough.
God.
Almost the whole show.
Usually we get into that point by the, you know,
the 25-minute mark.
No, no, I always find our conversations,
you and we are illuminating and exciting and somewhat fabricating,
at least, you know, from a suburban standpoint.
And I just like, I drool on my pants when I think of the many years
that you've managed to, you know, push this fall to roll
and have it fling so well.
I think I'll owe you a debt of gratitude and maybe more than $30,
but you're never going to get it, so why worry about it?
And so there.
I mean, it is a valid means of expression for some very lonely,
inarticulate, substandard people, but we keep trying.
We keep working towards that goal, comrade, whatever that might mean.
Um, the goal.
The goal.
Yeah, that's right.
The subgenus must have slack.
I knew there was a reason for all this.
Yes, that is the goal.
The slack is most important to me.
The subgenus must have slack.

The subgenus must have slack.
Okay, well, that settles it.
Now all we have to do is figure out what slack is.
For each and every single dues-paying subgenus.
The gimme bobs, we don't have to worry about them.
They think they get slack, but it's false slack.
And as Reverend Carter LeBlanc said, he said this.
He said, as G. Gordon Gordon said, false slack is better than no slack at all.
But false slack is no slack at all.
So there.
Praise Carter LeBlanc.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Praise be upon him.
For his knees are wobbly and his ears are strong and weak.
About time.
Hey, I have a conundrum in the last two.
Oh, wow, man.
I got one of those one time and I couldn't fit it all in right.
Well, we've only got about two and a half minutes left in the show for conundruming.
And my conundrum is.
Now, I've been playing songs lately by a subgenius called Reverend Max Slack.
Yes, yes.
And and it's because I was I've been assembling a new set of subgenius albums.
Actually, Suds and Pisces Pasha have been helping me.
We've been trying to assemble three new Bob songs albums.
Praise Suds and Pasha.
And there were two Max old songs by Max Slack.
On each album.
And we were about to release them.
But I thought I talked to that guy forever.
So I emailed him and said, we're thinking of using your various songs and they're going to be down.
They'll be pay per download.
They're not going to be on a.
Well, they were actually I would also put them on a CD.
And Max Slack said, no.
He said, you can play my music for free on your radio show.
And you can give it away for free, but you can't give it away.
You can't charge money for it.
And I said, OK, what if we charge for the other songs on the album but not charge for yours?
He goes, no, you can't play my song in any collection that has that makes any money for anybody.
So.
First thing I thought was, well, he must be rich.
And the second thing I thought was, well, that's a shame because I can't afford to give his stuff away for free.
So I have to quit giving it away for free.
But he did.
Send me one last song.
So this will be the last of the Max Slack songs.
But if you want to hear more of them, he's at his stuff is all at the easy to remember site called Max Slack dot net.
Don't you see?
You can sign that right here.
Max Slack dot net.
And I think I can play his his last song, which is called The Funny Side.
And this is the last.
Time I can give his stuff away for free because I'm going to play those other songs again on the show for another five years.
There'll be a rerun.
So and we can't put them.
We can't distribute them in a way that would make money because I guess some subgenius is are simply allergic or they're already overdosed on money.
Or there's so much cooler than me that I can't even imagine.
But the other thing is, when I when I had to remove two songs from those three albums, had to replace them with stuff.
The six fisted tales of Connie stuff that we found that was recorded at X days over the years was so much more subgenius.
So I'm happy.
Anyway, Dave, we have to go now.
Well, just before going, I'd like to say who cares about your happiness, man?
I mean, I'm more concerned with my own.
But on that note.
Okay, I ran Bob put it in on Randy.
He did.
Yeah, Bob put it in on Rand.
So it's a show just last week.
No.
Okay, Colonel.
See you later.
Finger licking good.
