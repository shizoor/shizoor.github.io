1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,360
You've got something in this room.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,640
Something strange and magnetic.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,880
Something behind the amplifier.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,100
The South China Sea.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,880
The South China Sea.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,180
Wow.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,140
He's probably groggy from lack of sleep.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
All right, you fuckers.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,660
You're forgetting this is the end of the world.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,980
It's time to start acting like it.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,460
It's happening right now.

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,420
If you're masturbating,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
wrap it up, make it a good one.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,700
It's the last masturbation you'll ever have.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,780
I actively don't plan anything for After X Day.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,500
Been doing it since 96.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,520
And it's like, yeah, if there's any chance,

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm not going to screw it up by not buying into this.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,980
Okay, folks, it's almost quarter past

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,620
four of seven in the morning, July 5th, 1998.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,160
Friends, it's not about when we get everything we want.

22
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,300
What it's really about, like every other religion,

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,880
it's about when the non-believers get what they deserve.

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,580
No, seriously now, and I do mean seriously,

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,440
you're going to get whatever you want,

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,980
but you're not going to get what you want.

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,240
The important thing is to really know what you want.

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,440
If your imagination is so limited that all you can think of

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,200
is a better version of your crappy apartment,

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,800
that's exactly what you'll get.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,420
And it won't seem that different after 7 a.m.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,700
Bob is teaching me things about disappointment,

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,580
except the disappointment in Bob is sweeter

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,060
than the disappointment in life.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,100
Ten seconds.

37
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,560
Life's disappointments are brutal.

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,040
Bob's are part of a joke that once you finally get over the butt hurt,

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,600
you start laughing at it.

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,900
Two, one.

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,100
Fuck them, they can't take my child.

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,920
Motherfucker.

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,840
For 30 years, almost none of us ever broke character.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,180
It threatens sometimes that the character might take over.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Once he gets over it, he's going to be a fucking jerk.

46
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,220
And that's when we find ourselves in that age-old traditional situation.

47
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,900
7 a.m. or something like that, something like July 5th,

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,000
something like 1998, something like the planet Earth,

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,460
we don't have any idea where or when we are,

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,120
and that is the point of the whole thing.

51
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,040
X day could happen any second.

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,500
It may not happen this year.

53
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,960
There have been times when we were so good at keeping a straight face,

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,640
that we could have had another Scientology.

55
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,920
We love fooling people, but we don't want to fool anybody that way.

56
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,480
The young people of our generation have no moral norm for their actions today.

57
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,940
They want somebody to stand up and say what is right and what is wrong.

58
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,800
How far can I go?

59
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,620
Nearly moment by moment, young people are bombarded by distorted visual images

60
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,240
that are saturating their minds and, yes, sabotaging their futures.

61
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,940
In the early 80s, we were outliers.

62
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,440
We were outside the norm.

63
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,920
People who had grown up in the 50s were just trying to come out of all of the weird stuff that had been heaped on us.

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,420
Once a person is perverted, it is practically impossible for that person

65
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,280
to adjust to normal attitudes.

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,780
The 60s were still echoing, but it turned into the 80s,

67
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,620
and that whole spirit got flipped on its head.

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
You are being deceived.

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,380
You are being brainwashed every day by the devil.

70
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,280
Everything's getting too square again.

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,240
The normalcy was oppressive to me.

72
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,520
I grew up in a cultural vacuum, a small, conservative Illinois town.

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,020
I kind of prided myself on being the outsider,

74
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,460
the guy that was so weird, no one would talk to him.

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,500
There is a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,020
working solely to rob you of your very abnormality.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,760
And I'm here to tell you tonight...

78
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,520
The conspiracy is them.

79
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,420
They're the ones that want to hold us down.

80
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,700
They're the ones in control.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,900
People always tell us how to talk, how to walk.

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,020
It was the war of the weirdos against the straights.

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,020
To enjoy the feeling.

84
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,940
The feeling of being with the in crowd is so seductive.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,540
Marion was rejected today.

86
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,660
If she felt accepted, the whole pattern of her life would be different.

87
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,780
We were grasping for this crazy religion to help us see the light.

88
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,780
It's the church of the subgenius.

89
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,480
Their prophet's name is Bob.

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,400
Bob Dobbs came to town to sit free.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,980
It was just this outpouring of expressing ourselves

92
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,100
and how wrong we thought the direction of society was.

93
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,540
I thought it was hilarious.

94
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
We're probably the only cult

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,900
that admits that we're ripping them off every day

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
and teaching them to enjoy it.

97
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,680
There must be discipline.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,620
It's wrong.

99
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,820
It's sin.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Just so you know.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,820
If Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves,

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,440
we could talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.

103
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,340
There's only one guaranteed way you can have peace.

104
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,400
The world will end in 1998.

105
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,100
God said judgment is going to come.

106
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,420
Repent. Quit your job.

107
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,180
Swag.

108
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,740
The idea of being able to...

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,000
get away from this shit zoo of a world...

110
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
it's a dream.

111
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
For those who've abandoned hope,

112
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,260
we'll restore hope and we'll welcome them into a great national crusade

113
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,200
to make America great again.

114
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,020
Great again.

115
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,960
Great again.

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Ah, yes, dear friends.

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,500
You guessed it.

118
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,580
That's a clip from the beginning of the subgenius documentary by Sandy Boone,

119
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,720
now showing on Amazon, YouTube, Apple TV, Fandango, a bunch of others.

120
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,060
All the details are on dobstown.org.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,160
Don't you wish you could see it?

122
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,500
Meanwhile, here are a couple of new tracks from Reverend Negative

123
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,220
from his album Losing My Religion.

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,440
Reverend Negative and Friends.

125
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,160
So here I am with our friend, The Pink.

126
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,800
Hi. I'm The Pink.

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,380
Hi, Pink.

128
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,500
Pink boy.

129
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,380
What are you doing, you bland normal?

130
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,120
Look at you.

131
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,700
Well, that may mean what you think.

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,920
Subgenius.

133
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,680
But I am a weirdo too.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
You're a what?

135
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,960
You're a weirdo too?

136
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,360
But you like football and mainstream media.

137
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,660
The Great Gates of Dobstown.

138
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Not unlike the Great Gates of Kiev,

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,380
but not with a piano.

140
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,720
The Great Gates of Tel Aviv.

141
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,700
We are both born aけど.

142
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:39,160
To be a good kid.

143
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,980
We all are from

144
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,380
Great Gates.

145
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,520
Well, take this.

146
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,520


147
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,620
Bring out your head

148
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
Bring out your head

149
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,080
Bring out your head

150
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,760
Bring out your head

151
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,380
Welcome to Dobbs, how are you?

152
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,840
Yes, you are weird just like us

153
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,380
Pony on down, or horse on down, or cow on down, or goat on down, or...

154
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,680
Bear on down, bear down, bear down, bear down to the cask after me

155
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,600
Get yourself a cup of Mutant Key

156
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes, have a Mutant Key

157
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,900
Bring out your head

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,060
Bring out your head

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,980
Ring out your head

160
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,780
Grab an ear in each hand

161
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,220
And twist

162
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,460
It's yours, so you can do it

163
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,960
You're loud, you're very loud

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,220
Ring it out, ring it out, ring it out, ring it out, ring it out

165
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,340
Riding, riding, riding, riding, riding, riding

166
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,660
Thanks to Reverend Negative. More to come.

167
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,060
By the way, our background music is the Empire Drive.

168
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,800
Jazz Orchestra.

169
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,240
Next up, a topical tune from a band that for broadcast radio purposes

170
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,280
I must call Crib Pooper, but the real name is Crib Shitter.

171
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,160
A song called COVID Cove.

172
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,300
Somewhere nestled between what is now Madison and Wanakee

173
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,920
there existed a gathering site for the ancients.

174
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,360
A harmonious confluence of the natural and mystical realms

175
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,060
is the Crib Pooper.

176
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,480
Its murky green waters are said to possess unimaginable healing powers.

177
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,220
Free from laws and sometimes clothing,

178
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,660
folks from all walks of life make the pilgrimage

179
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,800
to stew in the cleansing nectar of COVID Cove.

180
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,540
I pumped a fresh tank of premium, no ethanol

181
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,900
Used my Vuvuzela for a gas funnel

182
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,980
I'm fully Bluetooth connected, not infected

183
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,660
Big Mabel on the back, no towable

184
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,460
Rejected, yeah

185
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,920
It's a God-given right to congregate

186
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,040
We're just passing the vape instead of passing the plate

187
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,840
Gotta trim up the prop, protect the shaft

188
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,900
These sun-soaked days are my life raft

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,060
COVID Cove

190
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,860
When the sun is up, they'll be coming in droves

191
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,980
COVID Cove

192
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,140
It's a God-tank party trove

193
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,200
COVID Cove

194
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,800
Let our bodies stew in this viral man grove

195
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,980
COVID Cove

196
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,860
It's a cocktail molotov

197
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,340
Bikini top, she got her booty popped

198
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,380
Got my Tommy Bahamas and my aqua socks

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,320
Pulling up with a Yeti full of white claws

200
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,960
Hand in her mouth like I'm Santa Claus

201
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:41,960


202
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:41,960


203
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,400
Slap that body up against mine

204
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,380
My body's warm but my temp is fine

205
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,520
Some snowflakes telling me to wear a mask

206
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,300
I'll take a Zen 9 to 5 and wipe my ass

207
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,580
Life jacket types, Clorox wipes

208
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,540
Beelzebub, jumper, watch the numbers spike

209
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,340
Boat work is hard so I'm hardly working

210
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,820
A real man needs a woman with a freshwater merkin

211
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,480
Buy a merkin

212
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,980
COVID Cove

213
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,360
When the sun is up, they'll be coming in droves

214
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,560
COVID Cove

215
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,520
It's a God-tank party trove

216
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,600
COVID Cove

217
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,340
Let our bodies stew in this viral man grove

218
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,540
COVID Cove

219
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,340
It's a cocktail molotov

220
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,220
I've been coming out here for twenty odd years

221
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,960
Getting greased up, creased up, greased up

222
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
Twelve pack of beer

223
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,040
Broke in the boys and I'm making my toys

224
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,460
They never see it coming, yeah I had a metal oi

225
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,640
Pontoons, zooms, rhythm and booms

226
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,500
Cyanobacterial, failed to bloom

227
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,680
Slam a code red dewy, pop in a chewy

228
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,600
Keep her straight through the buoys like Tony Shalhoub

229
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,800
The sun's going down and we're slipping to the cuddy

230
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,740
It's so dang hot, my buddies looking at me flirty

231
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,180
Easy sweetheart grist, leading me

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Totally forgivable, COVID-19 flow

233
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,540
Tillers in the mist, gonna go all summer

234
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,360
Keep the shark in the pants unless you see a chummer

235
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,520
When the ice in the Yeti starts a-watering down

236
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,840
The sun starts setting on this little big town

237
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,400
Cold and cold, when the sun is up

238
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,340
They'll be coming in droves

239
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,440
Cold and cold, it's a half day pleasure trove

240
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Cold and cold, I just saw Hannah Montana on a wet banana

241
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,500
Cold and cold, it's a cultural party trove

242
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,920
To be cool, it's a text on yourdaily

243
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,580
Before Christmas, and Christmas

244
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,600
It's just a hoax

245
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:39,940
Moving in on yourkea

246
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:32,320
יכل

247
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,220
reaction? Well, that didn't sound normal to me. At least it didn't sound like a church.

248
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,620
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring? I mean, I could hardly

249
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,540
understand what went on there. I mean, was it meant to be funny or what? I mean, come

250
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,620
on, tell me, is it serious? Like, you know, do you have to, are they telling you to stop

251
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:07,520
listening to Top 40, give up things like watching Dynasty or eating Haagen-Dazs or maybe shopping

252
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:15,800
at home from an Esprit catalog? What? Huh? What are you trying to say? What is this note?

253
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,720
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas with a sign saying, U.S. Grade

254
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,860
A conspiracy dupe across your forehead. Hey, I don't know what that means, but I don't

255
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,740
like your attitude, okay? I mean, like, you asked me to come here and I mean, why did

256
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,600
you even ask me? What?

257
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,120
Just, just sit over there, okay? You try and experiment down here and it just doesn't

258
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:57,820
work. You try to bring an opposing viewpoint, a rebuttal, and you never can tell. This is

259
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,940
Sister Chris here.

260
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,320
Um, so, tell us about, um,

261
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,580
What?

262
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,160
No.

263
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,400


264
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,400


265
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,420
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,000
Are you okay?

267
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,820
No.

268
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:15,840


269
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:15,840


270
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:15,840


271
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:15,840


272
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,760
It was a dark, polarizing feeling.

273
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,240
Bizarre, informal, people.

274
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,480
Bizarre, informal.

275
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,840
I'm mean.

276
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm mean.

277
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,280


278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,160
I'm mean.

279
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,900
I love you.

280
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Cult of Seer did that.

281
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,120
Our old buddy, Mog.

282
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,320
Album called Better Living Through Confirmation Bias.

283
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,920
Zeer is spelled Z-I-R.

284
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,840
And now, back in time, a mere 35 years,

285
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,660
for Hour of Slack number 76,

286
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,500
with Dr. Philo Drummond, Doctors for Bob,

287
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,780
Pastor David Epley,

288
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Pope Sternodocs, and Dr. Hal.

289
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,080
Only we know what we don't know.

290
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,380
And when we do know it, we shall find out later

291
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,560
just exactly what we don't know.

292
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,900
What it was that we didn't know.

293
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,320
But, in the meantime,

294
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,720
we shall experiment further

295
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,060
and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind

296
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,560
to find out exactly what causes this device

297
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,060
not to function properly.

298
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?

299
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,780
Or the nose gland?

300
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Yes, possibly you did not know

301
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,120
that the nose and the feet are true glands.

302
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,760
The human body.

303
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,520
And only after permanent foot and nose glands gaping,

304
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,640
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose rhyme.

305
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,220
Which would mean, possibly, that you were backwards.

306
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,000
Or, built upside down.

307
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,980
But, you'll delve further into that

308
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,360
at the end of the broadcast,

309
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,460
when you and I cannot hear you.

310
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,840
Oh, that was Dr. Philodrummen, good friends.

311
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,200
And we can get into this too,

312
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,220
this psychoneurotic mastosurgery,

313
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,720
the techniques of which has been developed

314
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,420
by the many great doctors

315
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,200
who have come over to Dobbs

316
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,600
and from many of the other religious cults around the world.

317
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,700
It may have been the same as I had my frontal lobotomies.

318
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,660
And we've got Europeans and Lithuanians

319
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,280
and ice doctors and the big doctors.

320
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,340
and the doctors of the trees

321
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,620
and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.

322
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,360
We wrote a song about doctors.

323
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,160
And here, hypercletes, here it is.

324
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,400
Let's play.

325
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,360
Doctors for Bob.

326
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,360
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

327
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,360
Doctors and Bob and everything real in my life.

328
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,880
Oh, real in my life.

329
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,740
Damn pickup truck come out of the blue, doesn't run over my wife.

330
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,800
He's got the blues because they run over his wife.

331
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,880
Some of you are going to get mad at me.

332
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,900
Jesus ain't in the church.

333
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,060
Don't turn the radio off.

334
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,880
Keep it on.

335
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,000
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is Antichrist.

336
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,760
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made

337
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,480
and that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

338
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,700
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

339
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,940
There will be a day not in the too far distant future

340
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,180
in which Antichrist will be revealed.

341
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,520
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

342
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,440
And people will have a number in their hands and in their foreheads.

343
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,060
They'll be given a computerized number, if you please,

344
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,740
that will entitle them to do business in this world.

345
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,100
And with that, you can starve.

346
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,800
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

347
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,460
Boy, you aren't kidding.

348
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,260
And that's why we're here.

349
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,980
That's the way I've felt for quite a while.

350
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

351
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,180
Ah, you bet, honey.

352
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,180
That's what we're going to try to do.

353
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,240
I have never flown a city before.

354
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,040
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

355
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,640
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge.

356
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,360
The original concept was that throughout history,

357
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,120
all great geniuses,

358
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,720
had somebody at their side that was kind of steering them.

359
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,620
You know what I mean?

360
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,960
So you say that person is a subgenius.

361
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,260
That was the subgenius.

362
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,880
He was the guy that was really...

363
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,560
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.

364
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,240
Right.

365
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,660
And not a subgenius above the genius.

366
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,640
That's why the name is misleading, you know.

367
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,480
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service

368
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,080
where the Holy Spirit was using me with the gift of discernment.

369
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,240
I was ministering in the Spirit.

370
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,760
God was showing me things about people I didn't know,

371
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,460
I'd never seen before, but the Lord was talking to me.

372
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,460
God was talking and I was walking.

373
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,480
Listen to a little of this right now.

374
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,420
And you have come to the end of your rope.

375
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,140
Oh!

376
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,860
I don't know which way to turn.

377
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,920
Give me money!

378
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,240
It's starting to affect your nerves.

379
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,880
It's affecting my mind.

380
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,240
And sleepless nights.

381
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,180
It's affecting my mind. I want to kill my husband.

382
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,900
Today we're going to put this in the hand of God.

383
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,820
Kill my husband and my kids.

384
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,240
In the Bible in two different places.

385
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,620
A handful of meal brought a miracle.

386
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,160
I want you to hold that envelope open.

387
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,260
I'm going to give you a handful.

388
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm going to pour it in this envelope.

389
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,780
Now.

390
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,620
The future of your usefulness to us brought to you in living simulbursts.

391
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,400
Now.

392
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,480
In the depths of the third, fifth, and full lives of the Church of the Subgenius.

candelouch.

406
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,900
In some ways, the brain is less important to a subgenius than to a pink.

407
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,460
Being less intuitive, pinks need more brains than we do.

408
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,420
Their value system is based on intelligence rather than good sense,

409
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,160
which is related not so much to thinking as to the feelings of the heart and the foot.

410
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,720
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound,

411
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,220
a subgenius foot doubles as a gland, and a very complex gland at that.

412
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,060
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?

413
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,740
It treats you the way you need to be treated by intuiting the world around you

414
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,420
so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.

415
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,520
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond,

416
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,300
and he best explained its functioning in this excerpt from his daily radio show,

417
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,380
On the Road, so named because it is usually recorded in a car.

418
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,480
Self-worth.

419
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,700
Or money.

420
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,700
To love people because they need it.

421
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,300
Or their money.

422
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,800
I believe it's something God puts in us.

423
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,360
Or what else does God put in us?

424
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,440
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?

425
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,580
Yeah.

426
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,000
I want the money.

427
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,560
Oh, if we could truly know nothing only.

428
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,260
Reinforcing the powers of the brain and foot gland

429
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,700
is a small secondary brain at the base of the subgenius.

430
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,480
The subgenius spine, the mighty stegosaurus,

431
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,660
also possessed this organ, which made it tweet like a bird.

432
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,020
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems

433
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,700
that are so important to us.

434
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,360
Another gland unknown to normals is the peen gland in the brain,

435
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,740
which regulates the eight separate stages or character generations

436
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,200
through which the subgenius personality evolves during an average day.

437
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,260
Literally eight different personalities each have control

438
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,700
at the jessie helm of the brain.

439
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,700


440
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,700


441
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,700


442
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,700


443
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,700


444
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,700


445
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,040
In addition to the subgenius brain,

446
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
we also have the ability to control the behavior at varying intervals.

447
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,280
We each contain eight people in our corrugated,

448
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,680
rugated subconsciousness.

449
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,780
The actual average human has but four,

450
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,600
good, bad, bland and asleep,

451
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,480
the last thought by some scholars to overpower the others

452
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,960
for up to 18 hours a day.

453
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,740
These different personalities account for the compartmentalization

454
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,260
of the subgenius brain into eight distinct units or efficiencies

455
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,620
in the descending order of control.

456
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,240
First the left brain, the peen brain, which controls paranoia,

457
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,520
anal compulsion, overwork, trying too hard, thinking too much.

458
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,440
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain,

459
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,840
it handles jobs and money.

460
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,620
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain,

461
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,260
which covers the gray and limbic areas of speech, writing and lying.

462
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Then the hind brain, the me brain, the pivotal center brain,

463
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,480
the private you rides piggyback on the lord and is infected by drugs or religion.

464
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,980
Bob comes in on this channel.

465
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,900
Then the forebrain, the sane brain, which covers love, friendship,

466
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,920
traditional family values, called by some the tame brain.

467
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,320
The inner brain, or sex brain, is self-explanatory.

468
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,920
Finally the right brain, or lame brain, or more brain,

469
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,260
depending on your orientation, intuitive, art, music, drug addiction.

470
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:26,380
And the eighth brain, the outer brain, is a pseudo-physical shell.

471
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,880
Encasing not only the other brains, but the entire body.

472
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,740
This diffuse brain, larger but far less controllable than the others,

473
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
is the nenta life.

474
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,580
The nenta life represents fully half of our brain power.

475
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,800
But because it is so independent from us, we can rarely make use of it.

476
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,680
Occasionally a subgenius comes along whose nenta life is incorporated into his thinking

477
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,260
processes.

478
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,640
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci, Einstein, and currently Howard.

479
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,680
For most of us, however, the nenta life is a separate entity.

480
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,640
A semi-conscious ghost twin which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about,

481
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,320
but remains dormant throughout most of our lives.

482
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,360
Are we controlled by secret forces?

483
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,600
Are alien space monsters?

484
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:26,600


485
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,540
Are we the most powerful of all the other monsters bringing a startling new world?

486
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,360
Do people think you're strange?

487
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,420
Do you?

488
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,700
Then you may be on the right track.

489
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,660
Unpredictables are not alone and possess amazing hidden powers of their own.

490
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,520
Are you abnormal?

491
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,960
Then you are probably better than most people.

492
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,040
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

493
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,580
Praise the Lord.

494
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:26,320
Your power is ears, and mighty power

495
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,300
Praise Bob.

496
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,440
The Church of the Subgenius is the pan-religion of the future

497
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,700
and rebels against the namby-pamby,

498
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,860
goody-two-shoes, new age, and Aquarian ideals of most occult weirdos.

499
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,700
P-p-p-praise Bob!

500
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:09,860
P-p-p-praise Bob!

501
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,760
P-p-p-praise Bob!

502
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:50,300
P-p-praise Bob!

503
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,520
P-p-praise Bob!

504
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,160
P-p-praise Bob!

505
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,340
P-p-praise Bob!

506
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,740
Such people are fools.

507
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,960
They do not curse.

508
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,220
They have no understanding of the need for spiritual violence

509
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,840
in this modern space-age-a-go-go society.

510
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,940
The Subgenius wants no part of the new age.

511
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,020
It is already here, and it obviously sucks.

512
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,220
The Subgenius would rather retrieve

513
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,780
the manly past before 1971, or even 1953,

514
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,260
or else dwell in the naughty, fun-loving, remote future.

515
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,460
Music there by Reverend Negative.

516
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,520
Vocal by Onan Kenabite.

517
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,920
Words by Subgenius Foundation, which means me and Philo in this case.

518
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,560
And now, from his swinging album, Sunshine Supers Hits,

519
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,120
the Rudy Schwartz Project covering a pink,

520
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,760
Charles Osborn' classic.

521
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,680
We get it almost every night

522
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,660
When the moon is a big and shining bright

523
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,880
It's a supernatural delight

524
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,200
Everybody was dancin' in class,

525
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,200


526
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:45,920
The Sardine Cat asked a passing babe if he had seen any sardines.

527
00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:15,620
The Sardine Cat asked a passing babe if he had seen any sardines.

528
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:45,400
The Sardine Cat asked a passing babe if he had seen any sardines.

529
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,500
The Sardine Cat asked a passing babe if he had seen any sardines.

530
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,920
He also knew about masturbation, but he read that the problem was more mental than physical.

531
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,080
I'd like me some of them cream peas.

532
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,460
The Rudy Schwartz Project!

533
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,120
And now back to the subgenius documentary.

534
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,080
The clips in which Dr. Philo Drummond and I take turns explaining ourselves.

535
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,380
Don't you wish you could see the crazy subgenius home environments in which these interviews were filmed?

536
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:13,120
I grew up as a little white boy in America in the 1950s in a middle class home.

537
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,900
So I have...

538
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,900
nothing to complain about.

539
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,480
I feel like anybody who grew up in that situation has it better than most medieval kings.

540
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:28,560
Because we had aspirin and some people had air conditioning.

541
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,680
I'm one of those guys that was fortunate to have like an idyllic childhood.

542
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,700
My family was as normal as they could get.

543
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,900
I was forced to go to a fairly fundamental church for a year.

544
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:45,900


545
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:45,900


546
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:45,900


547
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,000
I was, uh, you know...

548
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,940
I got into Ahmadiyya Teachers制服 for the first 18 years of my life.

549
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,040
So that probably had some effect on why I rebelled so strongly

550
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,100
once I got in away from my folks.

551
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,920
I can't say that I'm rebelling against my religious upbringing or anything like that

552
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,200
because I didn't really have one.

553
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,200
I was raised basically secular humanist scientist.

554
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,820
This is Fort Worth Texas, I was surrounded by Baptists.

555
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,880
I was raised basically secular humanist scientist. This is Fort Worth Texas, I was surrounded by Baptists.

556
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:42,460
I was very much into comic books and any kind of alternate publications and music like Frank

557
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:50,780
Zappa and Captain Beefheart and people that were not mainstream. I did not feel like my classmates.

558
00:38:52,360 --> 00:39:01,240
Despite my very fun childhood, I had terrible teenage years. I had to hang around the theater

559
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:10,640
department in order to meet girls. That's how I met my first wife, in fact. I was discouraged

560
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,440
from participating in the theater department. I was discouraged from participating in the theater

561
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,180
department. I was discouraged from participating in the theater department. I was worried about

562
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,340
ij crazy film or remaining living in the theater. But I made

563
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,360
Lindsay Hatfield's choice, which is what? I was happy and Seed's movie.

564
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,080
My För Dies sauldhard is my favorite thing to do, and I really like filming and rock

565
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,140
music around. I think I can do toys магазins without having to put the money in the savings

566
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,720
account. Why do I think I should have brought my savings account with me to the theater

567
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,020
department? Because I knew thepet Dentists and Adaptivists were going to get the money

568
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,280
in the living room, and I just distinctly wanted to do that.

569
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
I feel that science is the real thing. Um...

570
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,080
All right.

571
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,780
I don't need friends.

572
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,820
So no, you might like this guy.

573
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,440
He collects comic books and he likes Captain Beefheart.

574
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,640
I thought, what?

575
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,340
Both comic books and Captain Beefheart?

576
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,900
We just became great friends.

577
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,960
He was the liberal.

578
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,740
I was the conservative.

579
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,880
But we were both so disaffected with politics,

580
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,000
we didn't believe any of it was true.

581
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,220
What we really had in common was collecting,

582
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,760
well, what we might call kook pamphlets,

583
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,080
or extremist literature of religious or political kinds.

584
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,500
You know, you'd go to a laundromat

585
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,760
and there would be The Watchtower from Jehovah's Witnesses

586
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,760
or a comic book from Chick Publications,

587
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,140
you know, This Is Your Life.

588
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,380
We loved the range of ridiculous things

589
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,980
that human beings can convince themselves

590
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:36,980


591
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,100
of, and that's what we're doing.

592
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,620
If I went out and made my daily quota,

593
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,980
the first thing I'd do is go over

594
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,500
and wake up Reverend Stang.

595
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,740
Let's get up, let's go do something,

596
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,600
let's have some fun.

597
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,060
We were trolls before they had that term.

598
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,900
The internet hadn't been invented, but CB radios had.

599
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,040
And Philo, because he had a real job, had a CB radio.

600
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,980
But we didn't use it to help the world, we used it to make a living.

601
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:06,980


602
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:06,980


603
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,300
it to puzzle and confuse strangers. We would get on and say things like,

604
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:21,860
Men of Earth, men of Earth, we are speaking to you from 50 million light years away in space.

605
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,920
Come in, Pink Boy. Well, there was these two guys that were doing it back to us. They were

606
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,480
trolling us, and they were saying, shut up, Pink Boy, shut up, Pink Boy. And we interpreted that

607
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,680
as, oh, the aliens are finally talking to us. And that was what they had to say. The next thing we

608
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,620
knew, Pink Boys were everybody we didn't like. Bosses, rude waiters, nasty clerks in stores.

609
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,520
We were surrounded by dumbasses. We knew that we were dumbasses too,

610
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,420
but we felt like it was a matter of degrees. People that we didn't want to have anything

611
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,300
to do with, the pinks and the mediocritans, the technoglorps.

612
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,640
Me was in terror of all of that. But there was also the terrible stress of having to,

613
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,860
you know, make the living and not lose your soul.

614
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:21,960
Well, if you want to get, if you want to be damned by Bob.

615
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,480


616
00:42:52,060 --> 00:43:01,080
Nearsighted Romeo had no problem reading the script. He had a problem with the script itself.

617
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:10,700
Hired by his headshot alone, Romeo was not well regarded among social circles

618
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:16,700
for his perceptiveness, nor his self-perceived talent.

619
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:25,540
Indeed, it is told that his dramatic performance prematurely brought the curtain down,

620
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,860
and in truth, his shrill, unmanly voice had offended countless,

621
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,120
stately,

622
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,880
patron barons.

623
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,600
What is this? he says, eyes scanning the script back and forth.

624
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,300
I cannot read this. What language is this? And see here.

625
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,360
He holds the book out at arm's length, fingers his chin with the other hand,

626
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,660
and cocks his eyebrow up in dramatic pause.

627
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,400
I die?

628
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:10,400
Bill, let's talk. You don't kill the hero. It's just not done. I'm the star.

629
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,640
Granted, I did not sign on to do a sequel because of my typecasting fears,

630
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,860
but this is no way to present my glorious exit.

631
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,200
Too bad! Action!

632
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,040
Clumsy.

633
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,060
Juliet enters.

634
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,980
Oh, how she lost her truancy.

635
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,380
From behind Romeo and squints to find her stage mark.

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:02,460


642
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:09,880
Juliet was awkward to a fault, and in fact needed her long dress trimmed, else she would

643
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,660
trip and fall again, as her replacement front teeth would attest to.

644
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,400
She was also, in turn, quite rude and obnoxious.

645
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:35,080
Come on with your line already there, sucknuts, she says in the echoing silent theatre.

646
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,600
That's Romeo to you, chiclet tits, he proclaims, and pushes her back onto her stage mark under

647
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,140
the low-budget spotlight.

648
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,420
Here for art I got.

649
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,620
Damn it, he declares, and produces a knife from his custom Harley-Davidson quick-release

650
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,560
special mail-order only belt.

651
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:11,480
He plunges the knife over and over into Juliet's flailing body, holding her by the hair, letting

652
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,440
her drop when he is exhausted.

653
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,460
Romeo stands panting in the spotlight, going dim as the batteries grew weak.

654
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:31,220
See, he shrieks, I don't have to die, I can take the bitch out instead.

655
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,340
We can get a new one for every performance.

656
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:39,280
She can even use her own name if she's too stupid to remember the character's name.

657
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,640
Romeo turns, at the sound of Juliet groaning.

658
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Fuck you, thumb dick.

659
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,320
Juliet gasps.

660
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,900
Romeo looks at the knife in his hand.

661
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,220
There is no blood.

662
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:08,120
It was a stage prop rubber knife from Archie McPhee, sellers of more fun and bizarre items

663
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,880
than you will ever need in your lifetime.

664
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,360
Juliet is rushed to the hospital.

665
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,300
Romeo is whisked off to the police station.

666
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:22,300


667
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:22,620
He is questioned.

668
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:33,600
Romeo sits in the chair at the interrogation desk, twiddling his idiot thumbs and occasionally

669
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:39,240
rattles the handcuffs because he likes the sound and refuses to talk.

670
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:49,420
Juliet, though not suffering any sharp puncture wounds to her body, had nonetheless taken

671
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,280
extreme blows to her neck, head, ribs, and neck.

672
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,280


673
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,280

687
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:34,380
One day, two strangers arrived to visit the now bold-legged Romeo.

688
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,880
Through the thick, scratched, bulletproof glass, they introduced themselves.

689
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,600
I'm Quentin Tantino, and this is Martin Scorsese.

We'd like you to star in our new western movie.

Yes, that was of course the inexplicable Sheridan of Cleveland.

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:14,880
What a character.

00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,520

00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,400
Thank you.

706
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:37,440
The Psychoskeletons did that song called A1 Hospital Food.

707
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,360
And now this.

708
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,800
Anyway, I had to cut in because the Will of Dobbs just got a call

709
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,440
from someone who said that they had called,

710
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:46,800
uh,

711
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,720
called the Cult Awareness group.

712
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,120
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness.

713
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,340
And, uh,

714
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,200
had called them up just to see what they would say about the Church of the

715
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,900
Subgenius.

716
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,460
And they taught,

717
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,040
taught,

718
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,440
the funny thing is that I,

719
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,820
when they first opened,

720
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,340
I called them up and said,

721
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,980
yeah,

722
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,380
I'm kind of concerned about these,

723
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,000
these insane cults myself.

724
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,920
And, uh,

725
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,040
I thought I'd send you some of our material and,

726
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,580
and, uh,

727
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,000
so you could,

728
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:12,860
you know,

729
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,580
you can refer people to us.

730
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,300
And they,

731
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:15,520
uh,

732
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,380
apparently,

733
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:16,600
they,

734
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,320
they didn't like the material I sent.

735
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,800
I'd never heard from them since then,

736
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,920
but they're now telling people,

737
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,860
whatever you do,

738
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,180
stay away from those guys.

739
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,040
That's subgenius.

740
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,560
Man,

741
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,280
that's the worst.

742
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,600
Well,

743
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,440
I guess they,

744
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:26,820
and,

745
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,640
and especially what,

746
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,180
keep your kids away from them,

747
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,440
especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius

748
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,740
because of the,

749
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:33,920
uh,

750
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,920
sexually explicit material.

751
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,420
Now see,

752
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,380
y'all that only listen to the radio show,

753
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,920
you don't know what,

754
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,340
you,

755
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,080
you don't know what you're missing.

756
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,440
Woo.

757
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,040
Woo.

758
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,800
And who don't order the tapes,

759
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,380
but I can't advertise that stuff.

760
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,300
And all you can really do is write for information from,

761
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:53,640
uh,

762
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,260
P.O.

763

76043.

767
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,160
For more information about Church of the Subgenius,

768
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,520
um,

769
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,260
and for that sexually explicit material,

770
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,520
which you don't get for free,

771
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,040
by the way,

772
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:09,860
not like,

773
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,140
I mean,

774
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,000
you get this radio show for free and get our information for free.

775
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,800
And,

776
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,120
uh,

777
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,940
it's not very sexually explicit,

778
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,200
uh,

779
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,280
but,

780
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,620
uh,

781
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,360
like I say,

782
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,520
you,

783
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,780
those of you who've been putting off writing to P.O.

784
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,280
Box 807,

785
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,060
Glen Rose,

786
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,940
Texas,

76043.

788
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,040
Fine.

789
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,060
I don't care.

790
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,000
I honestly,

791
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,120
I really don't.

792
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,240
It,

793
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,720
the last,

794
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,000
I always end up getting the last laugh,

795
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,520
dear friends.

796
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,580
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.

797
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,440
Uh,

798
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,580

00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,060

you know,

801
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,020
I can't,

802
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,020


803
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,020

00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,020


809
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,080
I can't tell you what the deal is with the money,

810
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,540
but,

811
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,100
I gotta get some money.

812

903
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,320
Has to do with

904
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,680
Doug Wallace

905
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,460
Has to do with

906
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:20,860
Over to the beach

907
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,860
Over to the

908
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,300
Has to do with

909
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,160
Michael McIntyre

910
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,560
Has to do with

911
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,980
I hate that old conspiracy

912
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,440
As much as it hates me

913
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,180
But me and Bob will get them

914
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,220
Just you wait and see

915
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,000
For as long as they have run things

916
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,680
They have turned them into

917
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,180
Bob

918
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:38,600
Bob

919
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,280
The time has come to get them back

920
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,240
Here's how I look at it

921
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,220
Now Bob has come to fight them

922
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,660
That's how we know we'll win

923
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,280
And we know to serve them

924
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,520
Is our only sin

925
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,300
We won't have long to wait now

926
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,620
The end is coming soon

927
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,040
We'll march happy toward the future

928
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,580
Cause we did what we must do

929
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,220
Underwater vacations

930
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,640
Bob will rule all the nations

931
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,040
We'll march happy toward the future

932
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,520
We'll be farming the vacation out on Mars

933
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,280
Cause we killed them and we ate them

934
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,820
Said boy we sure did hate them

935
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,320
And then we made the rounds of all the bars

936
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,040
Thank you Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

937
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,980
Great stuff

938
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,920
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

939
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,000
You're going to make fun of religion stuff right?

940
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,620
We never make fun of religion

941
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,320
Never make fun

942
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,080
You must understand

943
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,040
We're making money

944
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,660
We're making money off religion

945
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,000
But not fun of religion

946
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,520
No

947
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:41,940
No

948
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,820
No fun

949
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,680
No fun

950
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,080
No fun

951
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,540
We hope to erase the slack area

952
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,780
We are missionaries

953
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,700
This is hard work

954
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,360
This part of the country

955
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,340
Brutal and gruesome work

956
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,960
And hopefully

957
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,280
We'll

958
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,920
Yes I will

959
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,920
Really now

960
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,080
Are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks

961
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,560
Or do you

962
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,820
Mr. Wilsey isn't it a fact really

963
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,440
That you've invented this whole thing

964
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,100
That you've thought up all these little gimmicks

965
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,040
And you're taking advantage of a lot of people

966
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,720
And you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people

967
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,980
By getting money out of them

968
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,060
People who believe in you and your silly preachings

969
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,300
No it isn't Joe

970
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,920
The Illuminati will be unmasked

971
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,420
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that

972
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,260
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy

973
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,940
The Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it

974
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,660
The guys that drive up and down the street selling ice cream

975
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,360
All of that will be exposed

976
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,280
That's what America needs

977
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,060
To have their brains washed!

978
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,040
Clean up!

979
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,120
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage

980
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,040
And all that fear

981
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,240
And all that sickness and perversion

982
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,380
And all that junk that comes from the pit of hell

983
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,120
Radio announcer and many friends of the rail land

984
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,660
This is the old fashioned healing broadcast

985
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,120
Coming direct from the auditorium here in Dallas

986
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,240
This is a special night tonight

987
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,440
This is oil night

988
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,820
Would you love to have a heart like God

989
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,900
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil

990
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,300
That God has let me use for quite a few years now

991
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,820
And we're giving it out

992
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,480
Come and join the hundreds of people

993
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,440
Bring that bottle

994
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,560
And get some of this miracle oil

995
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,540
That's absolutely raised the dead

996
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,060
That's performed some of the greatest miracles

997
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,780
You name it

998
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,460
It's performed every known miracle

999
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,360
That it's happening

1000
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,720
But look it's

1001
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,540
No, Hal, look out!

1002
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,860
You clumsy fools!

1003
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,200
What have you done?

1004
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,800
The show, it's ruined!

1005
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,620
Ruined!

1006
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,180
Goodbye for all of us here

1007
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,480
This is Puzzle Dan and Slobius Rex

1008
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,800
Reverend Hal and Reverend Bob

1009
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,860
We tried

1010
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,720
Saying it's too late

1011
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,560
And we tried

1012
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,320
Goodbye folks!

1013
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,760
I don't know how it works!

1014
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,840
The whole thing's ridiculous

1015
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,240
Subgenius.com

1016
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,220
And until excesslessness

1017
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,460
It's Slack Friday

1018
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,760
And you can buy two memberships

1019
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,400
Two ordainment kits for the price of one

1020
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,720
Uh, normally they're 35 bucks each

1021
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,440
But you can get two for that!

1022
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,640
The postage is a little more

1023
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,200
Because they're heavy!

1024
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,320
They're each 10 ounces worth of paper

1025
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,040
And vinyl decals and pins and posters

1026
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,180
And most important your little saucer ticket

1027
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,500
Or a minister's card

1028
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,360
But yeah, two for one Slack sale

1029
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,360
It's Slack Friday sale

1030
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,420
At Subgenius.com

1031
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,440
And don't forget to try Triology!

1032
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,100
Actually, if you look at Subgenius.com

1033
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,740
There's links to all kinds of new

1034
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,020
Uh, forums and things

1035
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,340
The website itself is basically just an archive

1036
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,140
But the social life

1037
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,000
Well, it gives you links to the

1038
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,280
Perplexingly rich

1039
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,560
Uh, social media sites of the subgeniuses

1040
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,360
Some of which are

1041
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,480
Basically moderated somewhat by our friends

1042
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,540
Our old timer subgeniuses

1043
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,940
And some of which

1044
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,340
Are

1045
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,140
Basically a bunch of pink bobbies

1046
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,480
Who don't, literally can't spell Bob's name right

1047
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,960
And call everybody else bobbies

1048
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,980
It's like the sheeple that call everybody else sheeple

1049
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,680
I'm a real individual

1050
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,440
I stand in this crowd of people all dressed in the same hat

1051
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,120
I'm a individual

1052
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,780
I'm no sheeple

1053
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,920
I'm a sheeple

1054
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,500
Anyway, friends

1055
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,420
You can go to a subgenius event someday

1056
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,860
And stand around with people all wearing the same t-shirt

1057
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,940
Well, it's not a cult

1058
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,560
It's a fan club, officer

1059
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,600
Heck, Price Bob

1060
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,440
Help me somebody
