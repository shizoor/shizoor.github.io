1
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
And it comes down the street like a garbage wagon.

2
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,260
Okay.

3
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,980
So their brains may live on forever.

4
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,920
Fresh vending machine.

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,060
Has he created another?

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,840
By the miracle of recording.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm not very good at singing songs, but here's a try.

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,900
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,860
Ridiculous theory of evolution.

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,080
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,520
Peace or annihilation.

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,820
And thanks to Lee Murr for all that mess we just heard,

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,920
except for the very last part, which was by new guy Jason Myrick.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
And welcome to another non-standard Hour of Slack.

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,280
I, your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,760
was looking at a whole mess of editing I'd have to do

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,840
to polish up another show made from live winter star footage

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,400
or chopped up puzzling evidence or even a best of oldies show.

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,060
But I've got a ton of other stuff to do for Bob.

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
And then it struck me.

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,100
At some point in the past,

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,460
I had compiled enough new hymns and songs of a subgeniously nature

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,960
to make a seven.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,580
Bob song CD.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,160
But I'd never gotten around to making the packaging.

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,480
So this stuff hadn't been released except in dribs and drabs

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,280
on ancient hours of Slack from 2006.

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,580
So that solved my problem.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Here then is our of Slack number 1246

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,240
and all Bob songs episode and a sneak preview of our next official CD release,

31
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,820
which you now already have on MP3 from downloading this show.

32
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,700
But oh, well, Slack must come first in the life of every initiate.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,860
Lee Murr.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
Lee Murr shall start us off.

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
One, two, three.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,160
Bob.

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,220
Bob.

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,280
Bob.

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,440
Bob.

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,020
Bob.

42
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:23,440
Bob came and did something with all of us.

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,740
Quiet.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,520
No music on broadcasting.

45
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,300
Let your ass go to radio.

46
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,260
It's not a nightmare that's going to end.

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
It's just beginning because it's inside me.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,300
You have to love Bob.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,920
He loves you, Bob.

50
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,420
You love Bob.

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,540
You have to.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,260
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,180
He'll kill you.

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,940
He'll bob you out.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,140
Right now, I will give you all my money.

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
I will give you all my money.

57
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:59,280
I will give you all my money.

58
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,580
I will give you all my money.

59
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:59,280
I will give you all my money.

60
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,260
Attention.

61
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:10,560
I will give you all my money.

62
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,580
I will give you all my money.

63
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
Attention.

64
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,220
I will give you all my money.

65
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,140
Attention.

66
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,280
Attention.

67
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,800
Attention.

68
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,380
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

69
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,240
Attention.

70
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
Attention.

71
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,220
Attention.

72
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,340
Attention.

73
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,340


74
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,020
Attention.

75
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,100
Attention.

76
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:41,820


77
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:43,480
Attention.

78
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,440
Attention.

79
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,280
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

80
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,420
It's immortality.

81
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,240
Attention.

82
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,820
Attention.

83
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,820
Attention.

84
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,740
Attention.

85
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,300
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving.

86
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,720
But something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

87
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,240
Attention.

88
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,680
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

89
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,080
you can feel the wear.

90
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,680
I know from 342 years of experience that

91
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,160
time control can only go awry.

92
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,580
The Third World War might begin any minute and we'll all be killed.

93
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,660
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

94
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,400
Yes, maybe you're right.

95
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,700
I know how much you love your turtles.

96
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,560
But there are other things in life just as important, like having friends.

97
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,900
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles.

98
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,820
The End.

99
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,980
I will burn.

100
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:07,920
That Awe Yes from Pastor Epley signifies that that was the soundtrack of a video, Spazz Blaster,

101
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,220
for which I did the music and mix using a bunch of collages by Fernand and Andy Limer

102
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:19,880
as well as Byron Werner, Sivit Stang, Reverend Rosna, Sandy Smith, and Reverend New Monet.

103
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,060
By the way, if anybody can tell us what happened to New Monet, please do.

104
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,680
In the meantime, from norelpref.com,

105
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,840
Norel Pref and his composition Love Church.

106
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,880
I gotta tell ya,

107
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,180
man, I love church.

108
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,380
I just love church.

109
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,100
Bob!

110
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,520
Bob!

111
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,960
Love church.

112
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,220
Totally!

113
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,960
Yes, giving.

114
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,440
Yes, giving.

115
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,520
Bob!

116
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,040
I love this guy!

117
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,340
Come join the fun!

118
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,000
All of you have heard of

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,540
Bob!

120
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,940
Love church.

121
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,400
I gotta tell ya,

122
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:07,840
Bob to you.

123
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,720
Damn I am of 찾아 accomplishments.

124
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,100
No.

125
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
No I'm not having fun here today

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:16,800


127
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:16,860
Seriously.

128
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:16,860


129
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:16,860


130
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,480
Real.

131
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,940
Yes.

132
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,920
And the T joke is that I didn't teach my friends how to sing and

133
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:25,920


134
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,960
Giving. Yes, giving.

135
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,320
Bob!

136
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,260
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

137
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,160
We all thought you were dead.

138
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,140
No, no, still here.

139
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,340
How are you, Bob?

140
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:11,320
How are you, Bob?

141
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:18,520
You're a whirlwind, wrapping your dishes and plates, and then unpacking them and placing them back on the shelf.

142
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,500
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act.

143
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:33,500
Unless you are willing to admit that you are a gnome, a pink boy, a nini, a twig.

144
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,440
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you.

145
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,800
But we know inherently that we are all created good by Jehovah One.

146
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:54,000
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life, you couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie.

147
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,060
This is when you should look to Bob.

148
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
When you look to Jehovah One and say,

149
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,160
Bob, come into my life.

150
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,080
And you should see one set of footprints in the sand.

151
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,420
And that is when you...

152
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,080
You will know that Bob has charged you $5.99 to carry you to the nearest taxi.

153
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,060
Praise Bob and his divine ways.

154
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,620
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin.

155
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,140
A baby inside of a twin inside of a woman's belly.

156
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,980
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be.

157
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,020
You gotta raise up above this wiggly world.

158
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,900
And grab the hand of Bob.

159
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,640
Praise him and all that flows from Bob.

160
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,520
And praise Reverend Raymond Lafferty who did that classic.

161
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,640
A wiggly world indeed.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,740
To help solidify things, we'll now hear Bob's audition by, not Bob, but the Psychoskeletons.

163
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,080
BOOS GOES Hiyopi

164
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,260
Feels kinda like I'm in Space Land.

165
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,260
That's a contradiction in terms.

166
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,900
And Bob's shining down on me.

167
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,080
And no one's aiming a rifle at me.

168
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Holy dammit.

169
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
That's a contradiction in terms.

170
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,020
And Bob is the giant hepatitis penis of destruction bursting forth from the portable johnny.

171
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,400
Now let's...

172
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,220
ALL be a contradiction in terms.

173
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,000
Herds of benign cattle wander across the earth.

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000


175
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,460
the acid-washed, flush-drained landscape, all belonging to their own friendship families,

176
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:52,260
none loving any other than Bob. The flow between adjacent points of reference, points on the

177
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:59,260
line segment between the concrete to absolute oblivious eternity, sweet lord Bob. When we

178
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:05,480
all act together as men, as people, we could distinguish ourselves and betray any other.

179
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,600
As it was before time, but still within space, all who bow down and submit to their fractals.

180
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:52,220
My shorter, persevere. My shorter, persevere.

181
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,360
My shorter, persevere.

182
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,520
My shorter perseviour

183
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,900
My shorter perseviour

184
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,380
My shorter perseviour

185
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
My shorter perseviour

186
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,920
My shorter perseviour

187
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,060
My shorter perseviour

188
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,720
Cigarette butts on the ground

189
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,680
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack

190
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,940
Goes on and on and on

191
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,480
Just like the sun, the sky, my slack

192
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,980
Goes on and on and on and on

193
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,140
Praise Bob

194
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,660
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack

195
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,960
Goes on and on and on

196
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,480
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack

197
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,860
Goes on and on and on and on

198
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,200
Praise Bob

199
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:45,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

200
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,660
Hey little brothers and sisters

201
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,200
Why don't you get around?

202
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,900
I've got something important to say to you

203
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,280
Something I think you need to hear

204
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,860
Come on now

205
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,500
Are you sure you got your life together?

206
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,920
You think you're on top of the world

207
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,240
But reality is about to reel its ugly head, my friends

208
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,260
Are you ready to face the music?

209
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,520
You're pink

210
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,200
You're pink

211
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,020
We think

212
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,740
You're pink

213
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,920
You're a little girl

214
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,360
You drive that big ol' SUV

215
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,660
Draining your wallet into used to be

216
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,060
You're in a material race you just can't win

217
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,840
Following society is your greatest sin

218
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,800
You are destined to fail, my friend

219
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,320
You're gonna be poor and alone in the end

220
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,240
You got your treasures, you got your hoard

221
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,100
You got your treasures, you got your hoard

222
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,040
But you're only gonna end up broken bored

223
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,420
Come on, friends

224
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
It's time to turn over a new leaf

225
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,340
Unleash your weakness and get some relief

226
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,960
Slack is king and nothing else matters

227
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,440
Don't be pink

228
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Pull yourself up by your latex undergarments

229
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,760
Toss away all your commercial influences

230
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,080
The slack will be broken, it's gonna be broken

231
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,080


232
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,280
Within you can be born again

233
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,960
Act now, this is a limited time offer

234
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,200
Get yours now while supplies last

235
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,640
Offer void in Alaska and Hawaii

236
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,120
Be sure to consult your doctor about any risks that might be associated with slack

237
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah, I hope you learned something today

238
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,020
Now I'm going to get myself some slack

239
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,700
And add some variety with a bunch of� ate

240
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
Dowdy, RichУman, Don't let these factors even be focused

241
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,140
Get your class buddies reading

242
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,140


243
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,140


244
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,780
Admittedly, Nato bomber

245
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,880
Remembr NXT

246
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:53,880


247
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,620
I'm changing resource

248
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:54,620


249
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,060
That's the line

250
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,060


251
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,560
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

252
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,960
I bring you a warning.

253
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,220
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.

254
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,020
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

255
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,860
Launch the sky.

256
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,340
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

257
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,020
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

258
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:38,900
Shazam.

259
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,160
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being sick.

260
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,160
You, you, you, you bloated idiot.

261
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,520
You stupid.

262
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,260
You.

263
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,280
There are a bunch of art critics and we're looking for people who like to draw.

264
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,580
You are not safe.

265
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm safe.

266
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,500
Come on.

267
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,240
Come on.

268
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,240


269
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,240


270
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,740
Come on.

271
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,280
Come on.

272
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Come on.

273
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,380
It's quite a joke.

274
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,660
It's quite a joke.

275
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,700
I tried to buy.

276
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,980
Me.

277
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,600
Right Bob? Bob? Bob?

278
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,600
Wait a minute, how did this happen? Where's Smocks and all this?

279
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,260
Apparently not.

280
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,340
Tom Simms

281
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,140
Bob

282
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,380
Bob

283
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,760
Bob

284
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,720
Bob

285
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:34,900
Bob

286
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,260
Bob

287
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,400
Bob

288
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,540
Bob

289
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,540


290
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,960
Bob

291
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,080
Bob

292
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,760
Long cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

293
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,060
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

294
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,400
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

295
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,120
And I'd say, as long as you're alive, you'll make noise.

296
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
You don't want to hurt us.

297
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,420
You don't want to hurt us.

298
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,760
You turn up like hell.

299
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,360
And you ain't earned the last, Ernest T. Bass.

300
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,220
You don't want to hurt us.

301
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,740
You don't want to hurt us.

302
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:24,820
You don't want to hurt us.

303
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
You can't touch no now.

304
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:40,880
You can't touch no now.

305
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,380
And I perform the head.

306
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,640
The head.

307
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
What about the head?

308
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,300
What about the scary poster dog thing?

309
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,900
That evil head.

310
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,060
There's no sign of Wellman.

311
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,280
There's no sign of Wellman.

312
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
We're just landlady.

313
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,800
Wellman's gone.

314
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,400
Wellman's gone.

315
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,660
Yeah, Wellman's gone.

316
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,180
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

317
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,380
Friends, beware that head.

318
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,400
Save it.

319
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,840
I left a little Wellman at home, but he won't.

320
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:36,860
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens.

321
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,220
Down at Onion Creek Country.

322
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,240
The

323
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,420
The bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood.

324
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:10,220
It hovered briefly over the sand trap and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion at an angle of about 44.32 degrees.

325
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,500
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

326
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,660
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.

327
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

328
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,480
The population, the population of South East Austin went wild.

329
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,260
They tore off their clothes.

330
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,980
They danced in the streets and said, the bloody head has come.

331
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,720
The time is here.

332
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,220
Take off your clothes and be someone else.

333
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,220


334
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.

335
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,280
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently, buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

336
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:06,780
And slowly, still, ever moving upwards, it wobbled slightly, spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it.

337
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:15,140
Healing two old ladies and giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

338
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,820
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant at Barksdorm Air Force Base.

339
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,680
Three interceptors were scrambled.

340
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,640
One of which crashed.

341
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,480
The other crashed on takeoff.

342
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,820
They could find nothing.

343
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,680
The radar was still strikingly dead.

344
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:52,200
The bloody head moved north, rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.

345
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:02,960
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was moving north-northeast,

346
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,600
while ascending still upwards.

347
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,760
Towards the constant...

348
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,600
The population were crying.

349
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,060
The bloody head moved on.

350
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:20,820
Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

351
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,500
Keep your hands out of each other's marsupial pockets, boys.

352
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:36,900
What?

353
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,400
That's right.

354
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,260
Yes, the ballad of the bleeding head, a real oldie from the great Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and Doctors for Extreme Prejudice.

355
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm not sure, but I think one of the musicians on that finally got out of prison after serving a term for murder.

356
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,160
And now, the news.

357
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,620
From NPR News in Washington, I'm delayed by heavy snow.

358
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:04,460
Pope Benedict XVI is instructing Irish Roman Catholic clergy to cooperate in the sex involving priests and children.

359
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,760
The Vatican says Benedict does expressly...

360
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,520
Express profound sexual regret, this time at the Vancouver Olympics.

361
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,840
On Wall Street, 15, 10, 2, 14, 21.

362
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,480
Pope Benedict says this is PR.

363
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,860
Your news is flawed.

364
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,280
Three instead of three and a half.

365
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,540
President Obama says...

366
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,580
And this is only the tripling.

367
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,860
Astronauts killed 18 people and injured 71 others aboard the International Space Station.

368
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,120
The astronauts need to encourage development of PR news from Washington.

369
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,380
Come on.

370
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,440
Come on.

371
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,300
Change out of this city...

372
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,200
What do we do with this country's

373
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,820
This Chelsea

374
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,920
Yep, Trump is a eureka

375
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,460
A***

376
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,700
Thank you.

377
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,800
Thank you.

378
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,700
Thank you.

379
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,540
Thank you.

380
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,680
Thank you.

381
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,200
Thank you.

382
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,920
Thank you.

383
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,900
Thank you.

384
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,640
Thank you.

385
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,500
Thank you.

386
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:46,920
Thank you.

387
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,140


388
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,260
The mighty Reverend Artemia Salina engineered that one.

389
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,840
Nothing shrimpy about him.

390
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,880
And such a briny fellow.

391
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,120
Next up, well, I'm sorry.

392
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,380
I promised I wouldn't do this.

393
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,760
But with the help of Princess Wee and inspired by the Pneuma Pneuma Enterprises,

394
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,480
I sang.

395
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,740
This is the Subgenius Pneuma Pneuma song with our English translation

396
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,040
phonetically derived from the Romanian boy band original.

397
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:24,140
The title was phonetically changed from Dragos Ja Dente to rather Bob Didn't Stay.

398
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:31,380
But soon, sun's born, just eat a comb.

399
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,760
I know you'll be like my sub-spoon.

400
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,220
Genius.

401
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,000
Fettuccine.

402
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,500
Allo.

403
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,520
Allo.

404
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,560
St. Paraschew.

405
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,900
Big ass wholesome that beef.

406
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,920
She's so unique.

407
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,080
That's if she won't share the meek.

408
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,220
Love will come, but Connie goes away.

409
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,020
Connie goes away.

410
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,340
Connie goes away, away.

411
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,740
Bob may care to cheney all the day.

412
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,180
But not today.

413
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,760
Not today.

414
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,760


415
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,760


416
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,760


417
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,760


418
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,760


419
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,760


420
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,060
She did all today.

421
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,040
Face of dogs don't ever go away.

422
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,860
Never go away.

423
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,180
Never go or go away.

424
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,360
She'd rebel.

425
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,480
She'd rather fucking stay.

426
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,140
Now at best we'll all keep paying.

427
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
My sub G.

428
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,660
My sub who.

429
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,400
My sub ho.

430
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,800
My sub ha ha.

431
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,160
My sub G.

432
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,060
My sub who.

433
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,840
My sub ho.

434
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,760
My sub ha ha.

435
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,760
My sub G.

436
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,120
My sub ha ha.

437
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,600
My sub G.

438
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,320
My sub who.

439
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,200
My sub ho.

440
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,480
My sub ha ha.

441
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,080
My sub G.

442
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,040
My sub who.

443
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,720
My sub ho.

444
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,900
My sub ha ha.

445
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,540
My sub G.

446
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,540


447
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,540


448
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,540


449
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,540


450
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,020
She's a happy girl today.

451
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,740
Because she quit her job.

452
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,760
The clothes are up.

453
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


454
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


455
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


456
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


457
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


458
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


459
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


460
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


461
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


462
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,760


463
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,860
The solution

464
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,580
Has it been

465
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,760
Purified

466
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,260
I brush my teeth today

467
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,400
Just to see if I could feel

468
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,360
I focus on the pain

469
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,260
The only thing that's real

470
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
I brush my teeth today

471
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,340
Just to see if I could feel

472
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
I focus on the pain

473
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,480
The only thing that's real

474
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,460
Listen all y'all

475
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,320
Cause we're steppin' hardcore

476
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,860
Listen all y'all

477
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,760
Cause we're steppin' hardcore

478
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,260
Listen all y'all

479
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,160
Cause we're steppin' hardcore

480
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,760
Don't break it, don't break it

481
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,420
This is a public service matter

482
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Do you often brainstorm ideas for getting some cash

483
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,880
As you empty logs of poo from your garments?

484
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,400
Maybe you could benefit from smack

485
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,060
I mean slack

486
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,880
I had a dream

487
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,060
I saw it twice

488
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,300
I had a dream

489
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,300


490
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,260
I saw it twice

491
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,760
Say dearth of day or even chocolate night

492
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,420
Nicotine breeze at night

493
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,440
Misrepresented sense of tunnel

494
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,160
A most beef-heartian song or homage

495
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,840
Called

496
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,140
Called slack solution by the psycho skeletons

497
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,920
Another song that also brings to mind Captain Beefheart

498
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,180
Although not for any good reason

499
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,320
Is this masterpiece by the great Dr. Gary Gabrog Fran

500
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,120
Titled Tar Baby of Bob

501
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,620
I got no money but I got no Bob

502
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,560
Stuck to the Tar Baby of Bob

503
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,740
Said spray spray spray Luiza

504
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:25,740


505
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:32,600
A studied out when a grew boy

506
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Said the tiger could Reap new try

507
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,200
A coolallows for sale

508
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,200


509
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Belong to a girl

510
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,580
That was dashing from home

511
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,380
For an open bed

512
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,960
A thing she bets on

513
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,540
Red much a touch under the sky

514
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,860
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

515
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,280
Instead of this church where my socks just rot

516
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

517
00:37:51,500 --> 00:38:06,240
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

518
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:46,040
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

519
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:21,480
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

520
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:51,480
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

521
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:18,460
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

522
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:51,480
I was stuck in a big ball of frog

523
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,240
I wonder what you'd do

524
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,400
Can't get an ATM card

525
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,840
And no computers too

526
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,960
Imagine all sub-dini's

527
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,480
Living life in slack

528
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,100
Imagine there's no modems

529
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,420
And sitcoms on TV

530
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,520
We'd hunker down in mud huts

531
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,420
And take some LSD

532
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,480
And we'd be the only ones

533
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,280
To get the money

534
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,280


535
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,400
You may say I'm sub-genius

536
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,360
But I'm not the only one

537
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,880
Gotta wonder if I'm really one

538
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,360
What I'm losing out on

539
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:21,480
What I'm losing out on

540
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,480


541
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,480


542
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,480


543
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,560
Imagine no McDonald's

544
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,540
And no Big Mac with cheese

545
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,940
No email and no voicemail

546
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,120
And no more songs like these

547
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,720
Imagine the sub-dini's

548
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,220
Life without the con

549
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,260
You

550
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,100
Hoo hoo hoo

551
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,420
Gotta wonder

552
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,300
If I'm really one

553
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,340
What I'm losing out on

554
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,480
What I'm losing out on

555
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,320
What I'm losing out on

556
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,400
Look into my eyes

557
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,120
What do you trust?

558
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,500
The church of the sub-genius

559
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,340
I know your slack

560
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,400
I know your trap

561
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,260
I've been everything

562
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,020
So spit and cuss

563
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,300
I'm the church of the sub-genius

564
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,460
I'm the church of the sub-genius

565
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,460


566
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,460


567
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,200
I know your бок and bro downstairs

568
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,140
Don't be quiet

569
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,460
And I do like it

570
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,460


571
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,120
To, coddle me.

572
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,640
Only you, can, paint, to me.

573
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,820
I smell the things, you need to be.

574
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,000
Church of the sub-genius.

575
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,980
I explore you, don't make a fuss.

576
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,500
I tell you when and when and when makes a fuss.

577
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,540
I'm the church of the sub-genius.

578
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,040
Like J.R. Bob Dobbs and Old Festus.

579
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,700
I'm the church of the sub-genius.

580
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Church of the sub-genius.

581
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,520
Church of the sub-genius.

582
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,100
Lonesome cowboy Dave.

583
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,920
I love women.

584
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,480
A sub-genius rants, that sub-genius lies.

585
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,200
You don't have, to follow me.

586
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,040
Only, you, can, paint freely.

587
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,800
Freely, you gave me frock.

588
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,900
A sub-genius rants, that sub-genius lies.

589
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,740
Doctor Howe, princess queen.

590
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,240
Mr. Lemo, lemo, lemo.

591
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,660
Will crash the next, next game.

592
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,860
You don't have, to, follow me.

593
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,360
Only, you, can, paint freely.

594
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,200
You gave me frap.

595
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,520
You gave me slack.

596
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,960
You gave me power from Bob Dobbs' bald sack.

597
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,380
I am every person.

598
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,660
You need to be so get on the bus, puss.

599
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,000
Don't need to discuss much.

600
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,220
I am the church of the subgenius.

601
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:54,260
I'm the church of, I'm the church of, I'm the church of the subgenius.

602
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,880
I am the church of the subgenius.

603
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:29,740
I am the church of the subgenius.

604
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:43,460
So while sometimes days, I guess I sure believe, maybe next year will be better than the last.

605
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,140
I still remember.

606
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:48,200


607
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,320
Remember the last thing that Bob said as he was eating?

608
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,180
Now the drills go by so fast.

609
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,140
And it's one more day up in the saucer.

610
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,180
And it's one more night in Rushwood.

611
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,360
If a Friday Jones could be my island.

612
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,260
I wish she would.

613
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,380
Na, na, na, na.

614
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,820
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

615
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,700
Na, na, na, na, yeah.

616
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,380
The smell of big boys and of normals.

617
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,720
And the feeling that they all can't love but sit in my face.

618
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,180
With my throat.

619
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,920
With her eye I look across the mill.

620
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,760
The way to see he exists.

621
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,300
On their way to burn this place.

622
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,260
And it's one more day up in the saucer.

623
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,180
And it's one more night in Rushwood.

624
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,560
If saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie.

625
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,220
Maybe I could.

626
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,460
na, na, na, na.

627
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,640
Na, na, na, na, yeah.

628
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:40,160
La, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah.

629
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,160


630
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,780
La, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah.

631
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,120
La, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah.

632
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:52,360
I cruise the slatter mansion sometime after 2am

633
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,720
And talk a little while about the church

634
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,400
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower

635
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,940
Makes you talk a little lower about the day that we take over

636
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:18,500
It's been a while since X-Day and I guess I will believe

637
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,860
Maybe next year will be better than the last

638
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,760
I can't remember all the times I played the hour of slack

639
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,540
And wished my wish would make it come to pass

640
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,780
So it's 6.59 on Gordon's Saucer

641
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,740
But it's 7.01 in Brushwood

642
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,040
I have never made it to an X-Day

643
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,540
I guess I should

644
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,480
Really tested how shallow it is

645
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,200
And also, what that doesn't understand

646
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,200


647
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,200


648
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,100
But then being on the same page makes me feel relatively secure

649
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,220
And make me talk passerby

650
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,820
When I had cut some records

651
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,040
Wasn't being able to get London on Notice

652
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,020
on my night shift

653
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,280
Thank you.

654
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:19,720
Thank you.

655
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,700
Thank you.

656
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:13,960
Thank you.

657
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,060
Thank you.

658
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,620
Thank you.

659
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,680
Thank you.

660
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,740
Thank you.

661
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,680
Thank you.

662
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,700
Thank you.

663
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,340
Thank you.

664
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,820
Thank you.

665
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,920
Thank you.

666
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,020
Bob?

667
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:49,980
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

668
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,680
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

669
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,740
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

670
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,820
Bob!

671
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,540
I'll sing you a song about Bob!
