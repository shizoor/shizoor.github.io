1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,060
Hi everybody, nice to be back with you.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,380
Well, first of all, I bring a personal message to Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,240
his deepest appreciation to all of you for the many sacrifices you have made.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,480
And, of course, his congratulations on your discovery, which may well prove to be among

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,100
the most significant in the history of science.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,960
Listen, Howell, there's never been any instance at all of a computer error occurring in a

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,360
9000 series, has there?

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Of course I have.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,280
Sorry about this.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,180
I know it's a bit silly.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,280
Just a moment.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,060
Just a moment.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,460
Yes.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,940
It's puzzling.

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,120
How is old Bob?

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,300
Oh, he's doing good.

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,980
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,960
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,740
The subgenius.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,900
Our old subgenius.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,700
Watch me.

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,780
The major one, push me,

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,220
We'll be back here very soon.

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,220


25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,440
Where's the tape? There it is.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Oh, there. Yes.

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,420
Yes, but all things shall pass, they say.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, listen, you can hear the guard dogs.

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,540
Listen to that.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,580
That's the sound of the new subgenius house.

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,140
It's scary, isn't it?

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,040
I suppose I should probably go see who's at the door.

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:34,320
Oh, the phone rang twice more since I went to the door.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,520
Let's see.

35
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,120
What's some good background music here?

36
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,760
Friends, what an auspicious start to another show.

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
That was a little old lady at the door.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,420
See, I've just moved into a new skyscraper studio here,

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,660
and there was no one else here but me

40
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,020
and the guard dogs.

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,020


42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,560
And this little old lady was at the door,

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,480
and she went out.

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,440
I live with Miss Barry.

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,220
I live on the house I run behind the road there.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
And we're trying to get speed bumps put in

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,160
because people just drive much too fast down that road there.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,840
And the fire department says they need it for emergency use,

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,760
but there aren't that many emergencies.

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,380
And I thought, well, lady, you don't live my life.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,260
But I...

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,120
So...

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,000
So she wanted to think about me all day long,

54
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,580
and I think you got that question as really good or wrong?

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,000
I had lost my

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,420
I had lost my

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,600
left over dress

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,620
and dress I had roll��

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,080
horrible old gray hair running halfway down my back and everything.

60
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,260
And then the phone rings some more, and then it was Palmer,

61
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,940
and then it was the editor from New York, and then it was my agent.

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,220
And friends, you know, tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

63
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,700
creeps in this petty outer space from day to day

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,460
to the last tailed leader of recorded tapes.

65
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,440
And all our yesterfrops have lighted subgeniuses the way to bad breath.

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Out, out brief flashlight batteries.

67
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,500
Life is but a walking shadow,

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,540
a poor pocket pool player who struts and frets his hour of slack

69
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,400
upon the airwaves and then is heard no more.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,180
It is a rant yelled by idiots,

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,080
full of sound and fury,

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,840
signifying Dobbs.

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack, dear friends.

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,900
The voice of the church of the subgenius.

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,320
A celebration of peace, love, and understanding.

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,100
It just happens to take the form of pain, hate, and confusion

77
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,060
for this global village of the damned.

78
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,060
Oh, and it's also about slack and Bob.

79
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,120
Dear friends, yes, we mustn't forget those fine things,

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,660
lest we will be indeed the global village of the damned.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,300
Yes, friends, this old show, this old show has been through many changes recently.

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,540
First, losing the station in Dallas,

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,040
and having to rebuild a down and dirty mini studio here at the home office.

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,340
And then we had to move the home office.

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,780
Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,200
The Subgenius Foundation Incorporated and Bulldada Time Control,

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,040
not to mention everything I personally own in this world,

89
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,740
and that includes a hell of a lot of comic books, friends,

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,420
has all been physically moved to new digs in another part of Dallas,

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,860
a new skyscraper.

92
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,380
And, friends, it's been hell.

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,260
And I don't mean no subgenius hell either.

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,240
Oh, that'd be a party.

95
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,400
Because we're not talking about a single bedroom efficiency

96
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,720
with flimsy modern aluminum furniture.

97
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,600
We're talking about a new home.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,400
We're talking about countless heavy, massive antiques

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,880
upon which all our flimsy recording equipment is sitting.

100
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,080
Directly behind me as I sit here, seen on screen three,

101
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,820
is a 17-foot wall to ceiling, floor-to-ceiling wall, friends,

102
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,420
of tapes, videos, films, albums, CDs, Cats and Nine Tails.

103
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,840
We've got a new phone number, a new physical address.

104
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,700
Although market, friends,

105
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,360
our virtual address, the sacred P.O. box,

106
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,960
1403-06, in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

107
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,600
That, my friend, is eternal,

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,240
and shall ne'er change while Bob lives, and while I live.

109
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,980
But anyway, we had to put off producing the show for two weeks,

110
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,440
and I'm just lucky there's so much tape laying around here,

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,900
screaming and begging to be broadcast.

112
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
You can almost hear them.

113
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,080
They're in the background.

114
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,920
But, friends, we're in a new building, too.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,900
And you know what that means?

116
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,260
That means that nothing works,

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,840
because it was made in America by union idiots,

118
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,240
and every single fixture sprang a leak,

119
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,620
even the electrical ones.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,020
And it was like a Three Stooges comedy brought to life.

121
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,140
I mean, it really was.

122
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,220
But, you know, they say subgeniuses work best under pressure,

123
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,140
and, of course,

124
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,700
we always cause that incredible pressure to build up

125
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,700
by blowing everything off until the last minute.

126
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,520
And then, then, only then,

127
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,880
with total disaster breathing down our necks with its hot breath,

128
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,320
we perform magnificently, far beyond mere hume expectations.

129
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,820
It's the fear that amplifies the intelligence, friends.

130
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,360
It's the fight-or-flight syndrome.

131
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,320
Makes you 20 times smarter than normal, unless you're a human.

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,820
And then it's just pure panic.

133
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,500
Pure panic.

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,160
It's like my daughter's theory about the lucidity of the moment of death.

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,740
My little cute 13-year-old says that if you know you're about to die,

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,140
like the Mack truck is coming straight at you or whatever,

137
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,240
your brain automatically switches into a higher gear than it has ever been in before.

138
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,000
And not only is your whole life replayed in an instant, complete with smells,

139
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,660
but you also realize you suddenly,

140
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,720
for the first time, realize the perfect, foolproof, and most of all, extremely easy scheme

141
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,540
that would have saved the planet and made you a billionaire instantly.

142
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,440
But along with that, in those last microseconds of life,

143
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,920
comes the frustration of realizing how utterly obvious it should have been to you all along,

144
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,280
how stupid you were not to think of it.

145
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,320
Eh, too late now, though.

146
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,220
And what's worse, as Greedy's pointed out,

147
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,900
is that if you happen to live through it,

148
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,700
you forget.

149
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,860
Bummer, man.

150
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,240
Anyway, that's the way things are now.

151
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,480
No sooner did we move the entire church coffers and all the gear to a new place

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,820
and finally unpack and fix the disasters,

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,780
than I get a phone call this morning that basically says

154
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,480
that if I don't fly to San Francisco right now to ensure, no matter what,

155
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,280
that the new subgenius book, Revelation X, Final Layout,

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,460
will be done in two weeks, then we're cancelled. Period.

157
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,160
The project is cancelled.

158
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,140
That's right, that's how late we were.

159
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,040
So, it's easy, friends. I just have to drop everything else,

160
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,820
spend my life savings getting to the far-off cave of Paul Mavridis and Hal Robbins,

161
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,300
and help them finish a chapter a day, and do all the corrections,

162
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,460
and hand-carry the material to the publishers and newsletters,

163
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,860
and do the five overdue hour of slack radio shows before I leave.

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:18,680
So, this, dear friends, is the ultimate slack of subgenius horror, or something like that.

165
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,440
It's the hand that Dobbs dealt us.

166
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,840
Will we then be jokers? Or aces?

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,560
Or, more likely, just pull a black queen and explode?

168
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,440
Only the next time.

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,540
The next fourteen days will tell, so wish me luck in assembling today

170
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,240
two months' worth of tapes into five hours of slack between now and tomorrow, would you?

171
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,440
And send, after that, your prayers towards the bay

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,500
for me and Mavridis and Dr. Howell to somehow have the energy and brilliance

173
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,960
to finish what we started three long years ago before the conspiracy pulls the plug.

174
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,100
Leaving us with the greatest unpublished book in all history,

175
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,260
and a bill for twenty thousand dollars.

176
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,320
Amen.

177
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,800
Well, I guess, first let's go to outer space, friends, with lonesome cowboy Dave.

178
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah, I think we'll do that. That hardly takes any editing.

179
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,120
This was originally broadcast...

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,300
Whoa!

181
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,300
They're coming in again.

182
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,100
They're coming in again.

183
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,880
I can't believe this!

184
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,420
On top of moving, I have to deal with these!

185
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,640
Okay, this coming up was originally broadcast July on WCSB radio in Cleveland.

186
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,980
Swamp radio, the show of Chaz Smith and lonesome cowboy Dave.

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,320
I've been saving this stuff, friends, for just such an occasion.

188
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,080
Praise the god.

189
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,560
Father...

190
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,620
Father...

191
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,840
Father...

192
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,240
Father...

193
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,720
No kind of world for an old man no more.

194
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,860
Well, after this espousal, I can only wonder what kind of surgery you must have gone under

195
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,120
to get the pipe-like grin and also some of the weird brain fusions.

196
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,420
Oh, they tell me I was born... I'm not a joker, man, I'm an ace. I want you to understand that.

197
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,920
I can't understand the difference between the cards yet. I know I'm trying, but...

198
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,840
You're not a joker, man.

199
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm not an ace neither. It's more like a quagmire I'm lost in.

200
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,880
It's just a splattering of 52 different numbers in the deck and I can't figure out which one to go with.

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,200
I thought I'd like to be a ten of clubs, but it turned out I was a ten of club foots.

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,340
Yeah, that'll get you out of Vietnam. That got me out of Vietnam.

203
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,880
Why did you want to go there?

204
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,780
I didn't want to go. I wanted to get out. Luckily, my ten clubs of feet did it.

205
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,460
So you can get out of Vietnam by having club feet?

206
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,540
Yeah, tell them. They're going to ship you off if you don't.

207
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,680
Just all you got to do is take your shoes off in front of the psychiatrist.

208
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,300
Well, I thought they were going to ship me off to one of those off-planet little spin containers.

209
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,100
Those little tuna fish cans.

210
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,300
Well, Vietnam is slang for Venus.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,300
Oh, the capital city, Retz, right?

212
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,760
Yeah, and Iran is slang for Mars.

213
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,880
We say, oh, we're having a war with Iraq.

214
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,360
What that means is that's North Mars.

215
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,680
North Mars.

216
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,360
Or South Mars.

217
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,580
Well, I thought...

218
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,160
Iran is North Mars.

219
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,120
Vietnam, that was Venus, man.

220
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:54,060
The media tricks you into thinking that we're in this primitive 1990s technology when actually they're shipping people off all the time.

221
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,600
Well, there's slavery.

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,280
There's slavery.

223
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,860
It's like killing all the wars

224
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:25,900
There you go.

225
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,220
It was Tesla's brother and actually came up with the sport.

226
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,900
Oppenheimer and all those guys all went to the moon.

227
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,780
Oppenheimer went to the moon?

228
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:40,320
Yeah, they didn't, you know, the thing you saw in 1969 was a, that was fake.

229
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,140
You know, that was like they wanted to, they had run out of funds for their secret space program.

230
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,960
So they said, okay, let's tell them we're going to go to the moon for the first time.

231
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,580
So they made a big deal.

232
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,620
They didn't even really go.

233
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,960
I mean, they already had, they couldn't have shown that footage on, there's cities there.

234
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,500
There's cities on the moon?

235
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,920
Well, they're mostly underground, but I mean, you would, almost anywhere you go there, you see signs, you know, little smokestacks and stuff.

236
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,820
Can you get a good gyros there?

237
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,180
You know, I heard that some of these places that had been previously inhabited, that they just keep on repopulating them with new kinds of people.

238
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,060
There's always more where that last one came from.

239
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,220
People are considered cockroaches to these, the owners of these bases.

240
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,840
Well, what do they want the cockroaches to do there other than like bug them and get on top of the turntable or something?

241
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,920
Well, it's a farm.

242
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,160
It's a farm.

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
This is all a farm.

244
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,800
The whole solar system is a farm, Dave.

245
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,760
You're part of the, you're not one of the farmers.

246
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,180
You're one of the spuds or turnips that's being pwned.

247
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,260
I thought I made cheese.

248
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,380
You had once said that these are beings.

249
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:54,860
These farmers are too hideous to behold, that their faces are all squares and cockeyed angles, and if they were to come into this world and were...

250
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,600
You'd rip your face.

251
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,600


252
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,600


253
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,600


254
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,600


255
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,600


256
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,720
...your face apart in terror were you to behold one physically.

257
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,940
How do they make their way through the abyss?

258
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,500
Do they just blow themselves in there, or do they just like, have they always been...

259
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,820
There is no abyss to them.

260
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,960
It is all, they are in no space.

261
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,700
All things are touching.

262
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,460
They have cosmic consciousness, man.

263
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,240
There's some bad...

264
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,180
All the time.

265
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,480
...macky-fackies, I guess.

266
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:15,940
Yeah.

267
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,260
Well, we can't get away from them?

268
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,700
I mean...

269
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,480
Through Bob, you certainly may.

270
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,620
But only through Bob.

271
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:31,240
Only by, in fact, not merely through faith or slack in Bob, but through works.

272
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,420
Money, Dave, money.

273
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,140
That $30 is all important.

274
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,360
That makes the difference between those who Bob knows trust him and those that Bob doesn't even notice.

275
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,500
You can worship him all you want, but if he doesn't whiff your name on that check, then you're just another pink boy.

276
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,420
You're no better than the pink.

277
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Now, remember, we are...

278
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:54,760
Sorry.

279
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,840
...a non-profit radio station.

280
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah, but Bob's a non-profit.

281
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,500
I bet you said that a thousand times.

282
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,480
That's the first time.

283
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,040
Well, that was the first time...

284
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,360
It's the first time it ever came up.

285
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,700
Well, I don't know if I feel like giving...

286
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Again, we come back to, is your soul up?

287
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,840
Is your soul up, dear friends?

288
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,060
Soul up.

289
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,880
Or did you sell out?

290
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,340
Have you sold out?

291
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,820
I certainly hope not.

292
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,580
We're...

293
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,120
We've done our best to walk that tightrope ourselves.

294
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,160
Well, I just thought I'd take a break here from the swamp radio there from WCSB.

295
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,260
And just to experience this lovely music that Nenslo sent us.

296
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,440
A special tape compilation of background music.

297
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,820
Yes, background music that you'll be hearing.

298
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,760
You'll be hearing irritatingly over and over again in the future on these shows.

299
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,440
This particular piece, Nenslo calls...

Parentheses.

303
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,260
Seriously.

304
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,180
Unparentheses.

Unquote.

306
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,360
Hmm.

307
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,800
Let's just listen for a while before we go back deep into outer space with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, shall we?

308
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,980
Yes.

Listen to famine and the poke going round hell and everyone to breed.

312
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,640
Cause God don't think that we got enough folks making poop in the river, making poop in the stream.

313
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,360
Taking money from the folks spending on a fancy poker.

314

Oh daddy.

Pappy.

Crammy.

Crammy.

330

Everybody's talking about hell sometime.

331
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,180
There's a...

332
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,720
A pop hope special and Bob sings silver bells.

333
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,860
Walking in the fake snow.

334
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,180
Walking with a bimbo.

335
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,480
Wrapped in a furry coat.

336
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,140
Everybody's happy and there ain't no pussy jokes.

337
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,200
Oh daddy.

351
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,060
Pappy.

352
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,400
Pappy.

353
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,660
Pappy.

354
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,580
Everybody's wondering why the president's a dumb shit.

355
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,900
Talking like he's got a big skinny old fish.

356
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,440
Happy round in his skull and the fans get caught.

357
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,620
And he plodded the brain that's supposed to make the president know that he ain't supposed to go to Japan.

358
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,400
And vomit at the dinner table.

359
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,700
Make himself a damn fool.

360
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,660
Oh daddy.

361
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,040
Oh daddy.

362
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,540
Oh mammy.

363
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,920
Oh mammy.

364
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,040
Oh pappy.

365
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,340
Oh pappy.

366
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,800
Oh grammy.

367
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,080
Oh grammy.

368
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,600
Daddy.

369
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,300
Daddy.

370
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,860
Mammy.

371
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,740
Mammy.

372
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,220
Pappy.

373
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,940
Pappy.

374
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,740
Crammy.

375
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,340
Crammy.

376
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Jimmerous.

377
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,880
Carrierous.

378
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,660
Oh daddy.

379
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,620
Jimmerous.

380
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,400
Carrierous.

381
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,180
Oh daddy.

382
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,580
Sleeping on the couch with a hound dog.

383
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:26,960
Silly.

384
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,180
Sleeping on the couch with a hound dog.

385
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,540
Silly.

386
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,020
Green tamaringo.

387
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,940
Tangle, tangle.

388
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Ding, ding.

389
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
Green tamaringo.

390
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,620
Jammer, jackal.

391
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,060
Ding, ding.

392
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,300
Nigga named begotta.

393
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,060
Help me out.

394
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,460
Silly.

395
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,780
Oh daddy.

396
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,180
Oh daddy.

397
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,440
Oh mammy.

398
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,940
Oh mammy.

399
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,280
Oh mammy.

400
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,320
Oh pappy.

401
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,900
Oh grammy.

402
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,140
Oh grammy.

403
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,640
Daddy.

404
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,340
Daddy.

405
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,120
Mammy.

406
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,740
Mammy.

407
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,240
Mammy.

408
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,780
Daddy.

409
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:51,960
Mammy.

410
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,820
Mammy.

411
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,400
Mammy.

412
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,980
Mammy.

413
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,380
Mammy.

414
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,020
Mammy.

415
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,020
Mammy.

416
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,820
Mammy.

417
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,140
Pappy.

418
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,140


419
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,140


420
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,140


421
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,140


422
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,700
Oh mammy.

423
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,020
Mammy.

424
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,020


425
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,960
Pappy.

426
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:11,960


427
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:11,960


428
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:11,960


429
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,500
Mammy.

430
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:12,600
Mammy.

431
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:12,600


432
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
Pappy.

433
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,540
Mammy.

434
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:17,780
Mammy.

435
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,440
Mammy.

436
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,500
Mammy.

437
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,340
Mammy.

438
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,740
Mammy.

439
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:21,740


440
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
Oh, yes.

441
00:21:51,740 --> 00:22:01,460
Dear friends, that was the amazing, truly amazing Joe Newman there from his tape Yodel and Sighton.

442
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,860
Oh, yes.

443
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,480
Joe Newman, our musical short derper, Seth.

444
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,660
Just amazing stuff.

445
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:17,520
And let's go back now into outer space with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and just see what happens here.

446
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,720
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

447
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,160
make out its veracity to check and to go through various biblical sources

448
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:04,340
and see if it indeed did indicate some sort of apocalypse coming in the year 1998.

449
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,200
Nostradamus said that from the sky would come the great king of Jacare,

450
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,700
or could it be perhaps pronounced Jokere, or could we stretch it that far?

451
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,520
He predicted Hitler.

452
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,120
Hitler, though he spelled it Hister.

453
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,680
But yet he said in 1999 from the sky would come the great king.

454
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,780
Edgar Cayce said that 1998 would be that time.

455
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,280
Would be Jacques Couture's time to come back from...

456
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,180
And Jacques Cousteau said that it would be 7 o'clock in the morning on July 5th.

457
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,780
Wearing pampers out on the broad Jamaican sea, staring scurvy.

458
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,040
People used to watch television and make peanut butter jelly sandwiches and leave other people alone.

459
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,020
That's Jacques Cousteau right now.

460
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,240
Yeah.

461
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,980
That was the meteor magnate, or the meteor man.

462
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,480
Is that the weatherman?

463
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,500
That's Peppy in the background. I'm home again. I'm dreaming. I think it's Peppy. Listen.

464
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,660
Wake up, Dave.

465
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,200
Peppy.

466
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Wake up, Dave.

467
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,240
I stepped on Peppy.

468
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,840
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

469
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,720
It's just a dream, Dave.

470
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,080
I never had no dog named Peppy.

471
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,720
Your friends are still here. Me, the Tin Linceman.

472
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,500
Tin Lizzy.

473
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,020
Yeah.

474
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,500
You're much fatter now.

475
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm the cowardly lion here.

476
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,340
I'm the cowardly.

477
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:21,940
Yes.

478
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,220
Yes.

479
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,240
It was only a dream, that horrible, boring world of trucks and sidewalks.

480
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,820
And sausages.

481
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,400
It was just a terrible dream.

482
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
And fatal onions.

483
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,880
You've been here in Oz all along.

484
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,040
Oh, it's my... These flakes on my mouth, it's so dry. I've been here all along?

485
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,180
Yeah, you were just... You got knocked out.

486
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,300
Well, how the hell did I get knocked out?

487
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,040
When they dropped that house on your head.

488
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,380
Oh, I thought it was when I was arguing with that bitch.

489
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,960
You know what I mean.

490
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,660
Yeah.

491
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,960
Yeah.

492
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,000
God was...

493
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
Don't cry.

494
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,380
Don't cry.

495
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,680
Don't cry.

496
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:51,720


497
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,720
The problem was, you know, what the hell, she was giving me some stuff, so I might as well...

498
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,300
Oh, there.

499
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,260
Here it goes again.

500
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,720
Am I in there?

501
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,300
Boy, I think something's missing here now.

502
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,780
This looks like a little teeny tiny room.

503
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,880
Now, how the hell did I get in here?

504
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,280
We've been orbiting the whole time, Dave.

505
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,260
You're still in a little tuna can in space, remember?

506
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,300
It's going to be another nine months before we get on all the way over to Jupiter.

507
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,540
Yeah, but when do they hatch?

508
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,360
Do we get to get out before they hatch, or we got to wait?

509
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,740
Oh, you'll know when they're hatching.

510
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,020
I thought I'd be in some kind of hibernation chamber or something.

511
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,640
Well, but most people wake up for the last few seconds of their life as the thing is

512
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,580
bursting their chest open.

513
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,200
Well, what the hell are we doing this for, then?

514
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,020
Well, you signed up.

515
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,760
Yeah.

516
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,500
You signed up.

517
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,380
The contract is in the computer.

518
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,140
Well, I...

519
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,480
You thought the corporation was a great idea.

520
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,140
You said we should all climb into the little...

521
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,720
Little...

522
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,760
Little capsule, and we'd get paid.

523
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,900
By the time we got to Jupiter, we'd be paid a million bucks each, and sure enough, we

524
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,140
will.

525
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,780
It's just that it's our estate that gets it.

526
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,300
Yeah, but it's...

527
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,700
Because you didn't read the fine print, Dave, and now we're all stuck here with you for

528
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,860
another nine months.

529
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

530
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,780
I was never capable of reading a fine print.

531
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,320
I just...

532
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,160
And you just keep having these dreams and going off into fantasy land, thinking you're

533
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,320
back on Earth doing radio shows.

534
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,960
We have to keep nursing back.

535
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:21,900
Yeah.

536
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,880
And every time I have a dream, how come one of you guys changes?

537
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,380
Like I dreamed my wife was attacking me with a car, and next thing I know, out there I

538
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,660
was out in the side room, and some Russian was talking to me, and a woman was attacking

539
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,400
me with a car.

540
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,960
Somehow, I think you guys were involved in this.

541
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,420
Yeah.

542
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,240
Yeah.

543
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,700
And what are you keeping back there?

544
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,980
What's in that big box, anyway?

545
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,420
Well, that's our space hyena.

546
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,160
Well, what's the...

547
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,920
Rover.

548
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,380
And it's...

549
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,040
And the...

550
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,080
The scorpion rooster creature.

551
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,600
Excuse me.

552
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,840
That we picked up on Mars.

553
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,720
Well, how come we don't get to lick at him?

554
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,840
You can't lick him.

555
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
You can't lick him any time you want.

556
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Remember what happened last time you licked him, though?

557
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
What, the eye socket thing?

558
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:02,780
Yeah.

559
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,740
Well...

560
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,120
It wasn't easy getting that scorpion rooster barb out of your eye socket.

561
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,740
Well, I thought you said that was another dream.

562
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,540
Give me a mirror.

563
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,580
I want to see if there's anything wrong with my eye socket, man.

564
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,320
Let me look in the monitor.

565
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,240
You can't look at your own eye, Dave.

566
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,140
Yes, you can.

567
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,420
If I look in the monitor, I can look at my own eye.

568
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,400
I'm not listening to you right now.

569
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,580
I'm not listening to you right now.

570
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:21,580


571
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,400
What the hell?

572
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,520
I have no eyes in there.

573
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,300
Why don't you calm down and take a stress pill, Dave?

574
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,120
I don't see what difference that's going to make.

575
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,300
Now, I'm looking in there and I'm not...

576
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,320
Am I hallucinating or something?

577
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,500
I have absolutely no eyeballs in my socket.

578
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,480
Now, this isn't what happened in the eye socket and before.

579
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,640
Usually just like ripped out a chunk of the side of my face.

580
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,460
You can't see your own eyes, Dave.

581
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,880
You can't run from your own legs.

582
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,760
Jayner told you that a long, long time ago.

583
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,420
Yeah, but you can't talk to your own voice.

584
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,240
You can't...

585
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,260
You can't swallow your own throat.

586
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,000
Well, now wait a minute.

587
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,320
If they pull one eye out, just before the optic nerve severs, that one eye just for

588
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,820
one second can look at the other eye.

589
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,460
Is that not subtle?

590
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,040
That's true.

591
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,780
If you pull it out, and we did this with Jayner, we pull it out just enough and turn it around.

592
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,500
You have to be very careful turning it.

593
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,240
One eye can actually be seeing the other eye, but that's not really the point.

594
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,780
The point is, say a one eye.

595
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,560
You can't see your own eye.

596
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,420
You can't see your own eye with that eye that's seeing.

597
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,060
You can see your other eye, but you can't see that your eye that is doing the seeing.

598
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,640
You can only see the other eye.

599
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,020
You can look in the mirror, but that doesn't count either.

600
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,900
This is all mere metaphysical...

601
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
You can't digest your own stomach, Dave.

602
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,200
Junk league and juxtaposition.

603
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,440
And you can't hide from Bob, because he's stupider than you.

604
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,880
I can't believe that.

605
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,880
No, it's true.

606
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,060
That's the miracle of it.

607
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,560
That's the beautiful thing.

608
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,940
That's why Bob hates you.

609
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,840
Well, I don't know...

610
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Bob's the miracle whip.

611
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,180
I didn't want to lose that.

612
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
I didn't want to...

613
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:14,060
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

614
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,040
Somebody...

615
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,200
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than the whole planet.

616
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,540
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

617
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:21,540


618
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,440
You can't hide from God.

619
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,860
He's bigger than all the universe.

620
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,300
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than all infinity.

621
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,240
He's bigger than all reality.

622
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,560
Help me somebody.

623
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,540
You can't hide from God.

624
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,160
You can't hide from God in a reefer.

625
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,700
You can't hide from God in a glass of alcohol.

626
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,520
You can't hide from God in a see?

627
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,880
Because he's bigger than you.

628
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,200
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

629
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,880
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's got more black and white little dots

630
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,060
in his face than you do.

631
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,140
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

632
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs, his face has been mimeographed and put up in more places than yours has.

633
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,800
You can't hide from God.

634
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,900
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because more people worship him than worship you.

635
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
You can't hide from Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

636
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,880
Who the hell is somebody?

637
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,280
You can't run from your own legs.

638
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,380
How are you going to run from your own legs?

639
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,880
Because if you run from your own legs, where are you going to run from them with?

640
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,160
If you use them to run, run from them with, where do you go run away?

641
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,540
Continue, J.R. Hypercleet's Doctors for Bob.

642
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,280
You can't swallow your own throat.

643
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,360
How are you going to swallow your own throat?

644
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,800
Because if you use your own throat to swallow it with, where are you going to swallow?

645
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,700
If you swallow your own throat, where are you going to use to swallow it with?

646
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,680
You can't swallow your own throat. You can't run from your own legs.

647
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,740
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs, who's stupid you are.

648
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,440
You can't hide from God, who's bigger than you, who's bigger than all infinity.

649
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,400
Help me, somebody.

650
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,700
She ain't got no legs. Pull the lever and down you go.

651
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,440
Preacher, my legs are on fire.

652
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,980
Need some help. Need some help. Praise Dobbs.

653
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,980
You can't digest your own stomach.

654
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,960
How you gonna digest your own stomach?

655
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,300
You can't digest your own stomach.

656
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,980
You can't swallow your own throat.

657
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,080
You can't run from your own legs.

658
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,220
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs, who's stupid you are.

659
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,440
You can't hide from God, who's bigger than you, who's bigger than all infinity.

660
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,760
If I feel like giving something...

661
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,140
Again, we come back to, is your soul up?

662
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,880
Is the magic light gone off?

663
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,820
But there is no up.

664
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,860
There is no up and down in that realm.

665
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,520
There's no up and down?

666
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,140
No, there is sideways, but only in one direction.

667
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,740
So it's not a world where we could use the spatula.

668
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,460
It's basically what we'd like.

669
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,140
No, it's very linear.

670
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,620
It's more like the needle.

671
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,100
You might be able to use the needle, but never the spatula.

672
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,300
The spatula is too three-dimensional.

673
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:30,800
Yes.

674
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,580
And the beach ball would be out of the question.

675
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,680
Yes, and also the inclement...

676
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,140
The angles are all wrong.

677
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,880
This is non-Euclidean geometry.

678
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,460
The geometries.

679
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,860
Jeez.

680
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,180
Just the frequencies of this broadcast are non-Euclidean.

681
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,740
But do they operate on a similar principle?

682
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,480
Is the wave magnetics involved in hearing our voices through this medium?

683
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,640
That's the only way.

684
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,260
That's the only thing that hears our voices in this medium.

685
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,580
So are they talking deep into the cervical clavichord

686
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,220
and beneath the subcutaneous matter?

687
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,740
Are they talking inside our subcutaneous matter?

688
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,400
Sure, but it's pointless.

689
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,840
Who cares?

690
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,220
It's just all going out into the void, Dave.

691
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,820
You're all alone.

692
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,600
This vast, huge universe spinning around in this little tuna can.

693
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,660
And thirty bucks.

694
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,880
Five years from now, you're gonna hit Alpha Centauri.

695
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,700
Yep.

696
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,280
You'll be the first man there, though, Dave.

697
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,440
It's a great honor.

698
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,880
I'll be the first tuna sandwich on Alpha Centauri.

699
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,940
You're not just some guinea pig.

700
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,220
You're not just some Russian dog that's been sent up in a Sputnik.

701
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,180
A guinea pig and a Russian dog.

702
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,260
Oh, you're a hero.

703
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,300
I got that. No, I'm sorry.

704
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,900
I'm a sandwich.

705
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
You're the vanguard of the human race.

706
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,700
Well, the subgenius race, anyway.

707
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,340
And if Lenny Riefenstahl were to make my film,

708
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,940
and to have me as the top tuna,

709
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,560
above all the rest, standing below there holding flags and everything,

710
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,100
and then I forgot the rest of it, too.

711
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,540
It'd be really good photography.

712
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,720
It would be great stuff.

713
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,320
I think we could all get uniforms and everything,

714
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,600
and forget Bob, and just there'd be a million of me.

715
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:02,740
Yeah, just be Dave.

716
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,560
Praise Dave.

717
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,820
Thousands and millions of them.

718
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,640
Praise Dave, that's right.

719
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,880
No individual personalities.

720
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,640
Just blend with everything.

721
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,880
Like in a big magic.

722
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,440
A massive mush pudding.

723
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,480
Tuna pudding.

724
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,280
They all start thinking that way

725
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,380
when they've been in the tuna can long enough.

726
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,580
When they've been spinning through the void for six months,

727
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,000
they start fantasizing that they're on Earth in a radio station,

728
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,160
taking over the world with the brilliance of their new discoveries.

729
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,440
It's still pretty hot and oily in here.

730
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,200
I don't know how much longer I can take it.

731
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,960
I suppose you haven't.

732
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,840
I just take off these Brazilian slippers here and relax for a while.

733
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,720
Maybe something will happen.

734
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,720
Maybe.

735
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,260
Maybe something will.

736
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,380
Just enjoy the stars going by outside the window.

737
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,220
Of course, they don't really seem to be moving.

738
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,700
We're not going fast enough.

739
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,080
It's not like Star Trek.

740
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,140
It's just the same.

741
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,400
And of course, that window has to be...

742
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,160
shielded completely.

743
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,380
The radiation, if you stuck your hand out there for a second,

744
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,820
it would burn your finger off.

745
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,740
If the vacuum didn't get you first, Dave.

746
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,340
But don't worry.

747
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,880
You know, we spent a lot of money on this capsule.

748
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,860
Well, just as long as I...

749
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,160
I guess as long as I'm protected in here, I can fantasize.

750
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,020
And you've got lots of tapes.

751
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,540
I hope you like mid-60s top 40.

752
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,000
You want to hear good vibrations again?

753
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

754
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,200
Remember that one Hendrix tape?

755
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,480
I think it was...

756
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,800
Oh, that was the one that got torn up.

757
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,460
That was the...

758
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,780
No, no.

759
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,980
That's the one you liked.

760
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,400
Yeah, the Mormon choir doing Hendrix's greatest hits.

761
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,620
You said you'd let me listen to that one again.

762
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,940
Can you just, like, put it up one more time?

763
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,180
Their version of Machine Gun was really original.

764
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,900
I never would have thought I could...

765
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,760
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir doing Machine Gun with just voices.

766
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,460
Boy, there's a lot you can do with a human voice.

767
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Help!

768
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,820
Help!

769
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,180
Help!

770
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:25,940
Help!

771
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,380
It's a good thing his suit provides the medication

772
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,400
when he freaks out like that.

773
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,940
I don't know...

774
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,560
It feels better now, doesn't it?

775
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,640
Everything's computerized.

776
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,520
We've got Dave tucked in, tucked into his little space capsule,

777
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,620
this creaky chair, his self-medicating space suit.

778
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,480
Just me.

779
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,720
All the buttons in front of him and flashing lights are just props,

780
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,540
make him feel good, make him feel like he's in control.

781
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,500
Actually, he basically was shot out of a glorified blow gun,

782
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,760
along with about a thousand other people in Little Tin Can.

783
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
And we're just hoping that one or two of them

784
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,460
actually makes it to Alpha Centauri.

785
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,820
And we hope it's still there by the time they get there.

786
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,880
Carrying their little letters from J.R. Bob Dobbs

787
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,740
to the kings of any other inhabited planets they might fall onto.

788
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,740
We would have loved to have put you in suspended animation

789
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,460
for this five-year voyage, Dave, but...

790
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,360
The taxpayers would have had to pay for that.

791
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,380
The cruelty level would not...

792
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,520
The committee decided that you could just hack it out.

793
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Tough it out.

794
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,420
Five years of black void sitting here in Orlando,

795
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,260
pretending to be blown out by a puffed-up dart gun.

796
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,680
You're here with us. The voice is inside your head, Dave.

797
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,560
You'll never be alone.

798
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,500
You can't even fall asleep.

799
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,560
Your suit will make sure of that.

800
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,940
Let's see now.

801
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,000
The first duchy of Poland was started in 1264

802
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,460
by a count from the Ukraine named Vladimir Ashbat.

803
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,960
Oh, gee, that's boring.

804
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,980
Oh, geez.

805
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,620
Oh, it's Winoma time in southern New Mexico.

806
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,540
The Winoma Indians are doing the...

807
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,540


808
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,720
the annual Akoma dance.

809
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,480
Let's see.

810
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,380
Oh, oh, there's a new wine bar in Cincinnati.

811
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,280
Now, don't forget you've got 90 channels of cable TV,

812
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,760
although we will admit there's no sound.

813
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Yeah, but they're all like shopping channels,

814
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,740
and I don't have no money up here,

815
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,900
and you keep trying to get money out of me,

816
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,180
and...

817
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,480
Hey, wait a minute. You're a voice in my head, aren't I?

818
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,040
You're building up credits all the time back on Earth.

819
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,360
If you ever make it back,

820
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,840
you'll be a very rich man.

821
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, I'm building up credits.

822
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm building up credits all the time.

823
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,660
Of course, if you don't make it back,

824
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,880
they go into the J.R. Bob Dobbs Memorial Fund.

825
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,460
You'll be remembered very fondly

826
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,840
by those of us who had to stay back here on Earth,

827
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,280
talking to you by radio, Dave.

828
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,540
I'm kind of connected...

829
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,960
We wish we could be out there with you in the void,

830
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,920
carrying on the torch of humanity.

831
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,240
I can feel you.

832
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,680
Discovery.

833
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,000
The amazing sense of discovery you must feel.

834
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,140
We all here on Earth,

835
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,020
we all here on Earth envy you, Dave.

836
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,800
I can touch you back there.

837
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,260
I am...

838
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm blown out here.

839
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,780
You signed up.

840
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,020
You wanted to go for the easy money, Dave.

841
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,500
Yeah, but...

842
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,340
You answered that classified ad in the paper.

843
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,660
Yeah, but they said...

844
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,780
Off-world farming.

845
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,160
Big future.

846
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Big bucks while you sleep.

847
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,940
It doesn't sound like such a scam.

848
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,900
Off-world farming.

849
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,740
What could you possibly have to do but sleep?

850
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,720
Sea monkeys are going to be a big cash crop in the future, Dave,

851
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,500
for people on your new colonized planet.

852
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,860
Oh, my God.

853
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,100
I gotta check out the sea monkeys.

854
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,180
The sea monkeys were all bloated yesterday,

855
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,880
and I had to give them their estrogen tablets.

856
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,740
Let's see.

857
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,880
One, two, three, four, third, one, fourth, one.

858
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,260
This hammer is all disconnected here.

859
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,340
I hope the sea monkeys aren't dead, Dave.

860
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,260
They're your only source of nutrients.

861
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,300
Check them, check them, check the sea monkeys.

862
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,460
Pry this top off.

863
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,500
Oh, .

864
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,220
Sea monkeys are bloated again.

865
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,440
Are you an invalid?

866
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,540
Hey.

867
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,800
Who are you?

868
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,060
What?

869
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,180
Who are you?

870
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,000
You're a different voice in my head.

871
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,220
Are you one of the discarnated dead sea monkeys talking to me,

872
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,340
like the ghost of them?

873
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,340
You posted a WCS feed.

874
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,540
I'm supposed to tell you what I want to hear.

875
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,660
Hey, this is getting more realistic and lifelike.

876
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,560
There's like retarded people calling me up and talking in my head.

877
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,000
I doubt if we'll ever be able to resurrect these sea monkeys.

878
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,220
Look at this one.

879
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,780
It's sprouting a whole new head.

880
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,320
I wonder if it's going to be able to resurrect the sea monkeys.

881
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,320


882
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,320


883
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,180
I wonder if I mix this solution back in again.

884
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,600
Maybe some of them, they could take a spore from one of them and reclone the spore.

885
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,320
I'm going to just go take a nap and write a little report to the committee.

886
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm telling you.

887
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,560
Bob?

888
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,080
Bob?

889
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,380
I haven't heard the voice of Bob.

890
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,540
Bob?

891
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,360
There's just something in the background there.

892
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,220
I can't make that voice out.

893
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I can't make that voice out.

894
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,520
Well, the only thing for me to do on this shift is, well, I got to remember to call the bathroom.

895
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,660
And I got to remember to eat that stuff they call food.

896
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,840
I could work out again.

897
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,400
Yeah, what's that?

898
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,880
I'll go read some more technical manuals.

899
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,340
Take on some more stuff on the monitor.

900
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,660
Hell with that.

901
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,540
I'll try on this Mr. Peanut suit.

902
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,680
Yeah, this thing's been laying around for weeks and I haven't had any fun with that.

903
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,080
He's hallucinating the peanut suit again.

904
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,580
You'll have to make note of that.

905
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,080
Tell the psychiatrist.

906
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,600
When I was little, Mr. Peanut used to come to all the fairs.

907
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,460
And he'd pass out donuts and give favors to the kids and bags of peanuts, of course.

908
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,620
I love that monocled eye.

909
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,360
You know what's funny?

910
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,720
All of those volunteer, quote, astronauts, unquote, start imagining the peanut suit.

911
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,460
Something about Mr. Peanut.

912
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,740
Do you suppose the Russians had something to do with that?

913
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,600
Could they have breached security and implanted the Mr. Peanut fantasy?

914
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,480
Hello, boys and girls.

915
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,480
Hello, little fella.

916
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,000
Look, he thinks he's Mr. Peanut again.

917
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:18,360
Here for a bag of peanut pits.

918
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,820
I'm Mr. Peanut.

919
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,480
And if it's not Mr. Peanut, it's Reddy Kilowatt.

920
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,640
My mom and dad, they enjoyed the opening of the 7-Eleven.

921
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,720
Remember, it's a child-flaming corporation.

922
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,420
It's kind of sad in a way.

923
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,520
Oh, boy.

924
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,140
I'm taller than all the other Mr. Peanut men.

925
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,560
This is a very, very big, important convention of Mr. Peanut men.

926
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,500
I think I'm standing...

927
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,860
Do you suppose his suit is over-medicating him?

928
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,260
It's possible.

929
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,340
I wonder if I'd stand up even taller if I would stand up much more from the rest of the world.

930
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,820
But why old advertising figures?

931
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,300
I mean, Mr. Peanut's not even used anymore in marketing, I don't think.

932
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,600
It's something from his past.

933
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,500
Yes, they're comforting things.

934
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,820
Oh, Mr. Potato Head.

935
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,460
One of the people on the way to Proxima Regulus were all turned into Mr. Potato Head.

936
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,800
Around the six-month mark, just like him.

937
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,880
We'll have to remember that.

938
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,440
Yes, we'll make a note of it.

939
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,180
We'll have to tell the psychology department.

940
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,640
Oh, now I'm blonde, Mr. Potato Head.

941
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,440
And now I've got red hair.

942
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,040
We ought to tell the cruelty department, too.

943
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,760
They can start implanting evil Mr. Potato Head and evil Mr. Peanuts.

944
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,180
I no wonder they gave me a shriveled-up Mr. Potato Head.

945
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,060
Because now I can scare the children.

946
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,740
I like this mask.

947
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,500
Oh!

948
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,160
Mr. Tuber costume.

949
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,800
It's the big sweet potato head.

950
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,700
Oh, I love this one the best.

951
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,660
It's carved out in the middle.

952
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:06,580
Do you suppose he has any inkling that all of his silly antics are being broadcast to all the people on Earth?

953
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,520
Oh, I don't think so.

954
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,420
On the crazy astronaut channel?

955
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,040
He's fully lost.

956
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,160
Hey, if somebody was on the show,

957
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,460
he'd be watching the show.

958
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,780
One of these days he's going to switch through those channels

959
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,600
and he's going to come upon the channel with him on it.

960
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,680
Oh, man.

961
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,160
I might as well look at the box for a while.

962
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,180
This is getting boring.

963
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,600
Dave, your gyros need stabilizing.

964
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,380
Dave, check your computer.

965
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,660
Your gyro, your, your, your, your spinning.

966
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,160
You're in a spin, Dave.

967
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,380
Whose voice is this?

968
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,640
Stabilize the gyros.

969
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,740
Is this a real voice or is this a real voice?

970
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,960
Turn up the oxygen switch.

971
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,740
Oh, I get lightheaded in here.

972
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,580
Reach for the oxygen switch, Dave.

973
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,440
I'll think I'll turn on the oxygen switch.

974
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,800
Oh, there, he did it.

975
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,280
At least he thought it was the oxygen switch.

976
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,800
What's wrong with switching?

977
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,740
Just green stuff going on.

978
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,920
Good, he needed a good washing.

979
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,700
Oh, my God.

980
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,180
They always panic when the suit fills up with the cleansing fluid.

981
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,480
My kneecaps are so shiny.

982
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,040
Right up to their nostrils.

983
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,080
Oh, my God.

984
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,420
It's like he doesn't...

985
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,720
Church air switch.

986
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,000
My hands are clean.

987
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,660
My face is clean.

988
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,680
Hello. Hello, Dave.

989
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,400
Feeling better now, Dave?

990
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,640
Feeling better now, Dave?

991
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:33,720
What?

992
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,600
Everything I say itches.

993
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,980
No, no, no, we're not doing that, it says.

994
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:40,900
Well...

995
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,660
It's just...

996
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,760
It's just us, Dave.

997
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,540
The voices in your head.

998
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,720
We didn't want you to be alone.

999
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,700
I bet I could write a whole symphony on these hollow potato.

1000
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,480
That would be something to do for five years.

1001
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,780
We'd sit around going mad.

1002
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,260
It's that all time to do.

1003
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,660
There have been great symphonies written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

1004
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,180
Why don't you try it?

1005
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,820
It'll keep you busy for a month or so.

1006
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,380
Yeah, why don't I try it?

1007
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,840
I could, like, make thousands and thousands of little holes,

1008
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,400
like some sort of chromatic key.

1009
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,340
I could just get a little...

1010
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,900
Dave, the cat's loose in the spaceship.

1011
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,700
So let me check the motor for...

1012
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,760
It seems a little...

1013
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,560
The cat's loose.

1014
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,820
Damn cat.

1015
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,260
It's crawling all over all those...

1016
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,420
You'd better catch that cat, Dave.

1017
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,160
It's walking across the control panel.

1018
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,860
It's right near the control panel.

1019
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,040
You're going into a spin again.

1020
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,700
You're destabilizing.

1021
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,280
Oh, my God.

1022
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,620
I'm gonna destabilize.

1023
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,840
This thing's gonna start flipping.

1024
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,220
If I don't get down there right away...

1025
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,440
Ginger.

1026
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:50,820
Ginger.

1027
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,400
Ginger.

1028
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,940
Oh, good, look.

1029
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,000
Princess Wee the cat's mutated.

1030
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,980
Just as we were hoping.

1031
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,200
What the hell is this?

1032
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,820
He let it wander into the cargo hold where it was exposed.

1033
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,780
What is that?

1034
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,140
Ginger?

1035
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,220
Is that you?

1036
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,200
Jeez.

1037
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,460
What the hell is this slime all over your neck?

1038
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,520
What you getting into?

1039
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,660
Just let me get a little closer, okay?

1040
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,420
What's wrong?

1041
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,740
Try to make friends with it, Dave.

1042
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,140
I'll try and make friends with it.

1043
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,540
Try to make friends with...

1044
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,240
With Ginger.

1045
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,420
Yeah, Ginger was always a nice little kitty.

1046
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,960
It's just sick or something.

1047
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,100
I'll make friends.

1048
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,360
I'll pet it and take it back out of here.

1049
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,360
Ginger?

1050
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,260
No.

1051
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,460
Now settle down, Dave.

1052
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,960
Try to communicate with it.

1053
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,300
It's a new form of life.

1054
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,780
No one's ever seen a cat spider before.

1055
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,560
It could teach us things.

1056
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,920
Oh, my God.

1057
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,320
Think what it could mean to science.

1058
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:02,560
What is it?

1059
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,260
Go on in there, Dave.

1060
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,000
Can I get rid of the...

1061
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,140
Go on back into that cargo hold with that giant mutated cat spider.

1062
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,220
If I could just talk to her, maybe.

1063
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,080
It's got to be intelligent if it's mutated this far.

1064
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,360
It maybe has something to tell me.

1065
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,220
A little kitty or whatever the hell you are now.

1066
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,200
What the hell's up?

1067
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,260
What's up?

1068
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,160
Oh, it just needs to be comforted, Dave.

1069
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,740
Your music soothes the savage beast.

1070
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,460
Why don't you put on some music?

1071
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,420
Oh, Ginger, I was going to play a little song for you.

1072
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,240
Maybe you should put out some milk for it.

1073
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,220
A little tray of milk.

1074
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,960
I was wondering...

1075
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,800
Be careful now.

1076
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,320
Don't let it get hurt.

1077
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,300
You know, its blood can burn a hole directly through the spaceship hole.

1078
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,600
It would create a terrible vacuum and suck you out into space like toothpaste.

1079
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,660
It would make you look like toothpaste out of a tube.

1080
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,660
It looks like you're going for it, man.

1081
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,800
And whatever you do, don't let any harm come to Ginger.

1082
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,960
The War Department is very interested in your little tabby.

1083
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,920
I don't think we can deal with this right now.

1084
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,700
I think we should just get out of here and close the door.

1085
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,500
The War Department don't want to...

1086
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,560
And we'll be back to the lonesome cowboy Dave flipping out in outer space channel.

1087
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,400
After these words from our controller.

1088
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,120
Cue up the... cue up the controller tape.

1089
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,040
Dealing with overpopulation involves more than birth control.

1090
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,900
That idea will take center stage at an upcoming conference in Egypt.

1091
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,300
I'm Steve Pomplin for Earthwatch Radio.

1092
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,580
I say kill them all, let God sort them out.

1093
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,580
I say send them back to Earth.

1094
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:00,580


1095
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,080
Look, man.

1096
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,100
I'm into the voluntary human extinction movement.

1097
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,060
I say let them eat green cheese.

1098
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,460
Let them eat green cheese and let the cat sort them out.

1099
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,060
Let the mutated spider cat.

1100
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,200
I said exterminate all these funky monsters.

1101
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,440
Everything's peeled off and stealing.

1102
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,460
Stop the whole genetic theory.

1103
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,260
Stop it. Stop it.

1104
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,560
I'm really into it.

1105
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,000
Is there any coffee on this spaceship?

1106
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,640
Now come on, Dave.

1107
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,740
I know you got some of that whiskey stashed somewhere.

1108
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,380
Back with the bio samples from Mars.

1109
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,400
The samples are stuck in my hollow.

1110
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,320
I'm coming up.

1111
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,520
I'm going to the Magikarp.

1112
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,580
I'm going to go back to when you came.

1113
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,440
And I want you to just have a dream.

1114
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,460
We can't understand a word you're saying, Dave.

1115
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,380
I'm a cyropussy, that's for sure.

1116
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,220
That's what the...

1117
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,200
That's good, man.

1118
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,140
I think you got things looking good, Dad.

1119
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,440
He's lost in space, friends.

1120
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,180
It's sad.

1121
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,040
Sometimes.

1122
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,200
But it's part of the risks these astronauts take.

1123
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Thank God cremora don't make you sleepy like some of the other ones do.

1124
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,940
Well, at 1 o'clock, your suit will put you to sleep.

1125
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,560
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

1126
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,920
I'm waiting for my suit to put me to sleep.

1127
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:46,160
Over the last five and a half hours, my suit has enthralled me.

1128
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,420
My suit has put me to sleep and waked me up again.

1129
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,200
My suit fed me.

1130
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,000
My suit evacuated my bowels.

1131
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,360
My suit lulled me into a false sense of security.

1132
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,020
It's comforting.

1133
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,500
My suit talked to me.

1134
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,300
My suit made me feel very insecure.

1135
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,800
My suit...

1136
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,700
My suit expanded and contracted a few times.

1137
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,480
I didn't understand what that was about.

1138
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,260
It was punishing you, Dave.

1139
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,420
The suit punishes.

1140
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,640
The suit punishes and the suit rewards.

1141
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,080
The suit rewards you, Dave.

1142
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,240
My world is in the suit.

1143
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,940
This is my entire world.

1144
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,780
The suit is your friend.

1145
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,980
It's a nurturing cocoon.

1146
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,900
Oh, look at the cut of my socks.

1147
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,040
This is the kind of seasoning that would make any, any young man in America jealous as hell.

1148
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,440
I'm a true hero.

1149
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,820
Wearing this suit made me a hero.

1150
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm proud of it.

1151
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,540
I'm glad I signed up now.

1152
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,280
I think my suit's filling me with pride.

1153
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,120
Oh, dee do, dee do, dee do.

1154
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,660
I'm afraid that's not pride, Dave.

1155
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,380
You shouldn't have eaten those freeze-dried beans this morning.

1156
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,020
They just had a little fuzz on them.

1157
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,460
I didn't see nothing wrong with those beans.

1158
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,020
Yeah, your suit may be filling up with a lot more than mere pride.

1159
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,620
Oh, there you go.

1160
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,740
He's using the zero-gravity toilet again.

1161
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,300
Oh, boy, this is kind of a...

1162
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:11,660
Whoopee!

1163
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,540
Oh, no, he left the flap open.

1164
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,320
Look, the stuff is floating around inside the cabin now.

1165
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,480
It's coating the windows.

1166
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,900
I can't catch that stuff.

1167
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,520
Oh, on the window.

1168
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,700
Way to go, Dave.

1169
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,900
Smooth move.

1170
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:27,980
Oh, no.

1171
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:30,980
Oh, no.

1172
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,540
Well, now the emergency lights have gone off.

1173
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,040
Oh, activate the cleaning unit, please.

1174
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,900
Little robots have to come out and clean up after you again, Dave.

1175
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,080
Activate the cleaning unit, please.

1176
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,400
Hello?

1177
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,300
Activate the cleaning unit.

1178
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,020
The suit's going to have to punish you again, Dave.

1179
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,300
Hello?

1180
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,820
I need a clean-up on the front window.

1181
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,100
Oh, shh, shh.

1182
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,420
The thing's going to be stuck there for weeks now.

1183
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,880
Of course, in this vacuum, it's going to be a little bit more.

1184
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,040
The vacuum's atmosphere won't smell much, I don't suppose.

1185
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah, just don't take your helmet off.

1186
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,820
I wonder what would happen if I took my helmet off.

1187
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,440
I never tried it.

1188
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,960
No, don't do that, Dave.

1189
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:06,780
Wait a minute.

1190
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,460
Maybe something might...

1191
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,240
I don't know, maybe...

1192
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,280
This is not a pressurized cabin.

1193
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,780
Might not be such a good idea after all.

1194
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,720
Fiddle around with these.

1195
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,440
Oh, look, he's trying to light a cigarette again.

1196
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,860
He can't get it up to his lips.

1197
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,820
He just steps through that helmet.

1198
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,020
That must be the 5,000th time he's done that.

1199
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,600
16 cartons of luggage and I can't smoke a damn cigarette.

1200
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,180
It was a brilliant move on the part of the psychology department

1201
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,260
to put that no smoking sign blinking in there

1202
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,480
and those 20 cartons of cigarettes that...

1203
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,600
keeps up the sort of tension that keeps the astronauts...

1204
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,560
Oddly enough, it keeps them mentally healthy.

1205
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,200
You know, it's so alone out here.

1206
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,080
I got my own guitar.

1207
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,180
Lucille, you've been with me through thick and thin.

1208
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,700
Can't smoke, can't really eat a good meal,

1209
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,000
but I can still sing a song.

1210
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,040
I think I'll sing a song about my intergalactic exploits.

1211
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,920
Scott can't even hardly touch these fragile, these big mitts on.

1212
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,140
.

1213
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:23,860
.

1214
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,760
.

1215
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,360
.

1216
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,580
.

1217
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:39,600
.

1218
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:39,620
.

1219
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:39,640
.

1220
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:39,860
.

1221
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,140
.

1222
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,220
.

1223
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,140
.

1224
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,080
.

1225
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,100
.

1226
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:52,280
.

1227
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:52,380
.

1228
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:52,400
.

1229
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,420
.

1230
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:52,540
.

1231
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,060
.

1232
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,080
.

1233
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:53,980
.

1234
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,180
.

1235
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:07,720
.

1236
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:07,760
.

1237
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:07,820
.

1238
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:07,840
.

1239
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:07,940
.

1240
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:07,960
.

1241
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:07,980
.

1242
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,000
.

1243
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,000


1244
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,000


1245
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,020
I could see it right now.

1246
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,340
I could be like the Woody Guthrie of Alpha Centauri.

1247
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,140
You'll be the only musician in the whole star system, Dave.

1248
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,160
Of course, yeah.

1249
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,100
I'll be the only musician in the whole star system.

1250
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,200
You'll be the only music fan in the whole star system.

1251
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,240
Ken, my head will be shaped like a gigantic fan,

1252
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,780
like one of those Komodo dragons,

1253
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,460
or what do they call them, monitor lizards,

1254
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,560
when they get mad.

1255
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,920
Good, we've got him doing stream of consciousness again.

1256
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,840
That should keep him amused for a few more days.

1257
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,840
I wonder if they've got a reefer on Alpha Centauri.

1258
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,060
I wonder if they've got hot like earth-type babes on Alpha Centauri.

1259
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,160
The suit is your girlfriend, Dave.

1260
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,760
It's clamping down.

1261
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,360
It's constricting.

1262
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,680
It's tightening up.

1263
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,400
It's form-fitting, isn't it?

1264
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,780
Oh, I didn't know this suit.

1265
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,320
I could do this.

1266
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,240
What the heck is going on?

1267
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,180
All right, that's enough.

1268
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,440
Turn off that function of the suit.

1269
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,840
Now let's make him exercise.

1270
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,680
Put the suit in exercise mode.

1271
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,040
There we go.

1272
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,020
He's plumping up and down.

1273
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,300
He's flopping.

1274
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,340
My knee joint's going out again.

1275
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,400
What the hell is this music?

1276
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,000
And some good aerobicized music.

1277
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,900
We must keep our astronauts in good shape.

1278
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,640
He's come to resist calisthenics and jumping jacks at this time of the morning.

1279
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,780
It'll be five years of this if he's lucky.

1280
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,140
Oh, man, I can't do this for five years.

1281
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,900
I can't do this for another minute longer.

1282
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:55,360
If he doesn't happen to hit one of the planets, if there are any, in the Alpha Centauri system,

1283
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:01,220
then he'll just have to go on to the next star system 20 years past that.

1284
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,900
But you'll probably hit a planet, some sort of a planet, or a moon, or something.

1285
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,700
Some asteroid or something.

1286
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,420
Some body of rock floating around in space.

1287
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:21,500
Think of the romantic cartoon man on a desert island with nothing but one palm tree and a shark swimming around.

1288
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:22,960
Yeah.

1289
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,180
That romantic fantasy will be yours.

1290
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,840
Yeah.

1291
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,940
Only high-tech style, Dave.

1292
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,620
I'm a high-tech style romantic hero figure.

1293
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,580
Abandoned on a distant moon.

1294
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,140
Cast into space like some piece of effluvio on the sea.

1295
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,900
Someday I'll be home.

1296
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,080
Someday I'll touch the shore.

1297
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,140
A distant shore somewhere.

1298
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,100
Much longer of a wait.

1299
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,020
I'll get there someday.

1300
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:05,940
If you get bored, Dave, you can always just put a note in a bottle and send it out into the radio waves.

1301
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,360
Like you've just done for the last two hours.

1302
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,580
This has been ESO Radio.

1303
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,460
I'm WCSB Cleveland with my guest, lonesome cowboy Dave,

1304
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,620
the Reverend Ivan Stang,

1305
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,960
and the Princess, Rhi Ardo.

1306
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,380
My name is Chaz, and I'll see you all next week.

1307
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,720
Yay for Chaz.

1308
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,940
He's the mix master.

1309
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,380
And the mix boss.

1310
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:54,220
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1311
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,340
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1312
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,000
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1313
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,980
Got your pencil ready?

1314
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:06,700
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1315
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,440
75214.

1316
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:14,040
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1317
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,580
75214.

1318
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,520
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1319
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,140
Grrrr!

1320
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,200
Grrrr!

1321
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,660
Grrrr!

1322
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,380
Grrrr!

1323
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,900
Well, then...

1324
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,800
Dennis locked me in this little box.

1325
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,820
I can't feel anything.

1326
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,100
I can't see anything.

1327
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,600
It's totally black.

1328
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,020
I have no sensation in my hands.

1329
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,840
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

1330
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,240
I'm just in this little box.

1331
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,940
He said I could talk to you.

1332
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,920
He said you know what to do if you wanted to help me.

1333
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh, good, happy Feet-a-Well-man.

1334
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,400
I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

1335
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,280
And whatever you want.

1336
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:00,940
I mean, anything.

1337
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,920
Te-te-te-te-tevis.

1338
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:03,940
You can have tevis.

1339
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,940
Just get me out of this box, Wellman.

1340
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,260
Please don't.

1341
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:07,520
No.

1342
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,620
Don't believe what Paul told you.

1343
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,460
It's all a lie.

1344
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,420
It's all a lie.

1345
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,280
Whatever I did, I-I-I...
