Ah, yes, dear friends, it's the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, but this week
I'm so tired, I'm so tired from moving into the new offices, it's going to be a rerun
of a beautiful Suzy the Floozy show from WREK in Atlanta.
So friends, you just sit back and enjoy this incredible barrage edit and some great music
on the subject dear to the heart of every subgenius, stupidity.
I don't know, but I've been told that Jerry Lewis never wears the same side play.
I don't know, but I've been told that Jerry Lewis never wears the same side play.
Ah, ha, ha, hey, yes, let's drop Reverend Suzy the Floozy.
The most dependable subgenius for hour of Slack reruns.
No love, take a buzzer, big time.

He's in a five-year probationary depression.
Welcome, seekers, to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse, the April Fool's Stupidity Spectacular.
I'm Reverend Susie the Floozy, manning the switches here for an incredibly stupid evening.
So watch out for those plummeting IQs, kids.
I'll see you next time.
I'll see you next time.
I'll be it for me to question your stupid civilization or its dumb customs.
But is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything?
I'll see you next time.

in a manner that can be described as is stupid of the remaining five percent two percent are in
hiding two percent are incarcerated in mental institutions and the final one percent is
actively engaged in stealing everyone else blind oh i'm sorry the phrase is kbbl is gonna give me

I told the teacher that I thought it was insanity for me to try to pretend,
one, that these people were living human beings in the first place,
and two, that the man who wrote them was anything but a demented idiot.
And I couldn't understand why in the world I should take my mind
and try to get my mind to follow the labyrinths of ridiculous reasoning
of non-existent minds of creatures of absolute fiction
made up in the mind of what I thought was an idiot.
Now, maybe Shakespeare was not an idiot.
My apology to anyone who really believed Shakespeare was a marvelous writer
and really a great, a great literate, and so on, which he may well have been.
I didn't really study him all that much.
Matter of fact, that was my only acquaintanceship with Hamlet.
And as you can probably well understand, I read very little of him.
I received a D in that court.
If your land looks very far
Sitting in your house afar
And your brains ain't up too far
And your ears stick out too far
I don't care how I look
I don't care what you think about me
I don't care what you think about me
I don't care how you respond
I may look foolish or some folk
But I'm made up in my mind
You, she-man
Well, I've been to one world fair, a postage in a rodeo,
and that's the stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones.
I'm too stupid, I thought you'd call
I'm too blind, but I saw you wave
I'm too sick, and I get sick shows
I'm too gross, I should go home
I'm too old, and I fight down the constantly
And do things the only way
Cause you make me so creepy
You make me so creepy
You make me so creepy
You make me so crazy
I see an ihmispicable cone of ignorance.
What turmoil filled my heart?
I'm sick and tired, I toarn, I am real


I saw myself so stupid and so ignorant.
I must seem like an animal to you, oh God.
You know, let me ask you this, and you may not even want to answer it.
I don't know. I didn't get much education myself.
Did you go to school? How far did you get in school?
Well, I went seven or eight years, but didn't get into sixth grade.
Oh, you went seven or eight years, didn't get into sixth grade?
Didn't learn too fast.
Oh, you didn't learn too fast?
Well, I wonder, was there any reason, I reckon?
He's a little slow.
Huh?
Huh?
Something was said. Not good. What was it?
Don't yell at Homer.
No, that's okay.
What was it?
Slow.
They called you slow.
How dare you call me that?
Hey, Homer, you still here?
Oh, hey, you are slow.
Which one of these is the salt?
Too bad I'm an idiot, because my school closed.
Oh, well.
No, that's the red poison.
That was great.
You know, humor is a sign of innocence.
I wish I had those miracles smart pills.
I met a girl the other day in the most unusual way we were introduced.
Now, very unusual girl.
As a matter of fact, I might mention she was sort of stupid, too.
She thought a dry dock was a thirsty physician.
She fell in love with these two sailors down in San Diego.
She didn't know which one she loved, so she put out to sea.
Or took her voyage someplace.
And really, she doesn't appreciate it at all.
Understands not a word that I say, really.
Really.
I think she may understand bone, if I say that in a conversation.
She understands the word sick.
But really, very limited.
This baby's wasted on an idiot like you.
She's a head.
Spun down at night.
Come on, get a plate.
Say, lost in space.
And she's a head.
Bars of interest.
Cost precarious.
Get serious.
And she's a head.
Tend to contact.
Don't change the fact that rock is black.
And she's a head.
Why I'm in class with the length of those legs.
She's nothing intellectual, Jordan.
I'm a whole lot of idiots.
Don't you see?
So don't say a word.
Believe me.
My mother's a fool.

It's like the definition of an idiot. That's the guy who rips a girl's brow off and invites her on
the ear. Hey, moron, you got your clothes on backwards. Oh, God, this is fun. Hi, stupid. Hi, ugly.
Hey, I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kind of stupid.
Oh, daytime TV is muy estupido. Come on, Homer, act all stupid like you do on TV. Yeah, come on,
dumb, dumb, do something unintelligent there. Now let's get stupid with our first contestant,
the human garbage disposal. Unbelievable. We're rewarding people for acting like buffoons.
Get him some slack. We are a town of no brows, no brows, and ignoramai. We have eight malls,
but no symphony. Thirty-two bars, but no alternative theater. Thirteen stores that
became a city of the dead. We have a town of no bars, but no alternative theater. Thirteen stores

that became a city of the dead. I begin with le sex. I write this letter not to nag or whine,
but to prod. Nice stupid and whining. Where do we live in a town where the smartest have no power
and the stupidest run everything? Maybe we should just move back to Alabama. No, we should fix
things here. If we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish.

The only people I knew as the people I had formally worked with and provisions.
Think.
And they're all not too bright.
Come on.
I can say I love them all.
I think they're great people.
They're just a little slow in some areas.
And I can honestly say that because we showed them all the business and none of them got in.
I can say I love them all.

And it's all your fault.

This is the DJ-3000.

Hey, hey, how about that weather out there?
Whoa, that was the caller from hell.
Well, hot dog, we have a wiener.
Man, that thing's great.
Don't praise the machine.
Come on, you idiot.
Let's take it back.
This is tough.
Yeah, let's make litter out of these litter-otties.
That's too clever, you one-eyed-ass.
What do you think of the children?
Are these morons getting dumber or just louder?
Dumber, sir.
Hey, you're so dumb.
You're stupid as can be.
You are only more than you mean nothing to me.
Hey, for your mother, who's not avoiding you.
Hey, it's just boring, and I don't like you.
Hey, yeah.
You're so dumb.
Hey, you're so dumb.
You're so dumb.
Hey, it's for your dad, because he don't know you.
Hey, it's for your ugly suicide, I want it, hey.
Hey, it's for your mouth, because it never stops.
Hey, it's for your brain, you're as dumb as a rock.

There's some other way that's really not a valid part of the economy.
It's not my nature to complain, but so far today, we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of magazine time.
I just don't feel challenged.
Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining,
furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation.
It peeks out of the cracks of its cave, brow furrowed in mock consideration of the pulverized remains of a rat.
It's memory, peering out into the lumbering forest of gods.
Its lips twitch prayers past the racket of evolution, just a cat gorging on garbage.
Its eyes glaze and fade away from simian mandates to a clear and concise expose upon the subjects at hand,
being those which have dogged the inquisitive mind from the occasion of its inception.
And it may appear that way to you, but you're an idiot.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I'm 16, and I'm going to live for 16,000 more years.
Now those who have stupid children are safe enough.
Those children will laugh at evolution and be happy fools all the days of their lives.
But to those who have bright, intelligent children, the day will come when those children will come home and say,
You can get some people's attention with a two-by-four, whop, you know, and you've got his attention.
Other people just make him mad, and you won't get his attention.
You can knock him completely out, and just make him madder and madder and madder.
You could bring him back to consciousness, knock him out again, and you never will.
You'll get him to like getting hit with that two-by-four and to listen to what you're going to say.
Nobody home.
Nobody home.
Nobody home.
Nobody home.
I don't do what I want to do.
No, I don't, I don't gotta do.
I don't do what I want to do.
What I do, I don't wanna do.
Baby, baby, I'm a drug.
My mind is blown.
I'm all alone.
So give me a call.
I'll telephone.
I'll be there if I don't need you.
Nobody home.
Nobody home.

The students who show more aptitude end up as bigger cogs.
But damn few of them show any sort of creative cognition.
Those who do have, have developed this on their own.
Sometimes by accident and sometimes through sheer defiance of a system
that promotes unthinking passive conformity.
Well, good for them.
Unfortunately, many more never even conceive of such a notion
and the educational system can't be held entirely responsible.
It only holds its victims for a limited time before they're released to produce and consume.
From that point on, the mass media entirely takes over the job of intelligence suppression.
Or rather, it's injection into the...
...this rock.
But sleep bears down with the pressure of the oceans
and these fragile epiphanies evaporate outside of their natural environment.
But what are you going to do?
It's my own fault.
There's an abundance of data on the subject.
But to be honest, for a change, I thought I could just muscle through it as I do most situations.
I underestimated the effect of my prolonged self-imposed isolation up there.
Nothing could be absolutely more stupid...
...or obtuse...
...or ridiculous if you look at the statistics of anti-gun laws in New York City and Washington, D.C.,
where crime has continued to rise.

Smartest person in the world
I know.
I was worried that they don't fit in.
When everyone's running this way, they're always running that way.
The smartest person I know was worried about their career.
Their work was once important, now it's empty and redundant.
I wonder if I'm up on something about a fifth wheel.
I told the smartest person I know, big wheels turn real slow.
When you finally get a bone to throw, there's no dog around to catch it.
The trouble with you is your life.
You're awkward because you're normal.
You're worthlessly overqualified and hopelessly hopeful.
The trouble with you is your life.
You're the smartest person I know.
That's why you feel like a fifth wheel.
The trouble with you is your life.
Isn't that most inspiring?
Really such a comfort.
Useful and encouraging.
The trouble with you is your life.
And the smartest person you know also probably feels like a fifth wheel.
Your mind is a tree to wander on.
You can be thinking around you.
But your body works without the theory of what you're ever trying.
It knows what to be.
There's no guidance.
Sometimes, you're right.
But things you do not know are a deceitful version.
You're a process of self-explanatory steps.
The way you do this is what you do to yourself.
You're the smartest person I know.
I feel the smartest person I know.
Big wheels turn real slow.
When you finally get a phone to throw, there's no dog around to catch it.
The trouble with you is your life.
You got value, so you're immoral.
You struggle because you work too hard.
Not cool because you're too real.
The trouble with you is your life.
Like this other person I know who says,
I'm the smartest person they know.
And be glad that I know.


I feel like a fifth wheel.
I mean, I know they're there to stop stupid people running into the street and killing themselves.
But we're not all stupid.
We don't all need nursemaiding.
I mean, why not just have a stupid...
Stupidity tax!
Just tax the stupid people!
Die!
Why didn't someone tell me?
Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself.
I'm so slack.
I'll never ever do another stupid thing.
Good night.
Did you die?
No.
guys, please stop sleeping.
You, just lay there and read your books,


Oh, hey, guys, I know everyone is there forever and working out.

When I need something to help me unwind

Smart guys are nowhere, they make demands
Give me your moron, talented hands

The way he grabbed and threw me through it really got me hot
But the way he growled and bit me, I hope he had a shot

I like them big and stupid

I like them big and stupid
I like them big and stupid

The bigger they come, the harder I fall in love

Oh, Seagull!
Ah, slap me!
Get me breathing again!
Oh, I think we made it to the end!
Yes, it's the end of the April Fool's stupidity episode
of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse
and it was my pleasure to serve up the following dishes
We heard Little Grunt Pat starting out with Bozo Big Time
and the Uh-Oh song by I think it was Robert Earl Orle
who was the first to sing the song about the world
Oh, what a name. How could I forget it?
Marty Feldman Eyes by Bruce Babyman Baum.
Woody Woodbury popped in with a little lounge act shtick there.
Alan Sherman.
Oh, that nee-nee-noo-noo-na-na thing was by Dickie Do and the Don'ts.
Oh, I swear to Bob I didn't make that up.
And then You Make Me Feel Creepy was by Tom Owen.
Oh, yeah, the same label that puts out Little Grunt Pack puts out Tom Owen's serious records in Baltimore.
I'm quite enchanted with them.
Oh, and then we heard Little Thomas Dolby with Airhead.
Had to put it in.
Diva with Social Fools from the Troublemakers comp.
And the Jackie Papers with Everything I Know Is Wrong.
Mickey and Sylvia hopped in there.
D-U-N.
M-B.
That was a different version of the song by the Nobodies.
By the Nobodies.
Speeding this one up a bit.
A little Orson Scott card with a secular humanist revival.
Nobody Home was by Scratch Bongo Wax.
Oh, and I know one of my seekers is having seizures
because I played a little bit from the folk rock musical about Jesus.
Natural High.
Ooh.
Man, that can cause flashbacks.
Oh, and there was even a little bit of Edie Gourmet in there somewhere.
And some Stang and a little Doc P. Ellis popped in.
And then I had to do things with Frank Sinatra.
That's okay.
I cleaned up after him with the Ramones.
Oh, and then there was Robert Goulet and Steve Lawrence.
Both of them in the same show.
Fool Mule was by Dossie Thunderbird Terry and his orchestra.
Oh, Reverend Such and Such had all the fool stuff.
I can't remember his name.
Damn it, they used so much of him.
Oh, Ron Ball had the Art of Being Stupid stuff.
Oh, a lot of Garner Ted Armstrong's raving.
Three Amway tapes.
Oh, little Pastor Arnold Murray.
The Waitresses were the smartest person I know.
And I had to cut in.
And Dr. Notov, Denmark, talking about attaining that spiritual balance through washing dishes.
He is the slackest, smartest guy I can think of offhand.
Oh, and Julie Brown.
I like him big and stupid.
Oh, and yes, I guess I'll follow it up with Zilch Fletcher doing catatonic stupid.
Oh, but let's go through the background.
Let's see.
We're listening to Ken Thorne and his orchestra right now.
We've heard the Hollywood Strings.
Richard Marino and his orchestra.
Paul Moriarty and his orchestra.
The Hollywood Strings.
Holly Ridge Strings again.
And then Arthur Greenslade and his orchestra.
And Andre Costellan.
It's Robert Maxwell, his harp and orchestra.
And Roger Williams and his damn piano.
And Floyd Kramer with his damn piano.
And Robert Maxwell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.





Yeah.
and the harp and then the ventures and the living strings and Norman Percival and his
orchestra.
Arthur Fiedler's super star with manama.
Claude Don John and the Moog synthesizer.
Percy's faith strings.
A little of the sleepwalk guitars of Dan and Dale.
I'll be bringing them up in a moment.
Oh, Susie, you have brought us everything.

all up. But you won't be bringing them up
