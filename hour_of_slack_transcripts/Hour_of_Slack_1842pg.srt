1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,140
Behold.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,020
Go back to your compartments and resume the schedule.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,620
The ship is off.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,200
Wait!

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,740
No, I have something to say.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,340
Listen.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,060
Listen to what I have to say.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,900
This is what I have to say.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,640
The subgenius power of swat.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,800
What are you going to do?

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,220
I'm going to smash the earth.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,540
The cool green earth.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,320
Fools!

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,300
Can't you understand?

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,460
Minnesota.

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,420
The land of the sky blue water.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,500
Minnesota.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,940
Minnesota became the butter state.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,420
Minnesota in the 20th century.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,860
This is Minnesota.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,360
I've never been to Minnesota.

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:11,820
Minnesota.

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,640
Got lots of lakes.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,640
Minnesota.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,460
Got plenty of lakes.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,940
Look at them lakes.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,960
In Minnesota.

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,640
Lots of lakes.

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,760
In Minnesota.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,660
In Minnesota.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,440
In Minnesota.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,320
Mm.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,320


34
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,260


35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,360
Initiative new federation the families that plï¿½ Bellevue.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,520
At one point they'll call one of the older neighborhoods and they indicated that they

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,540
won't be able to see a little of the sea beyond Minnesota.

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,540
And the average Disney determinant would say, Ill graph on Z, I have nothing.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,180
The maxim has to be.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,160
hydration include a shellfish, four Cat's.

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,940
What happened?

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,480
I have never been to Minnesota

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,820
Minnesota

45
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,980
Minnesota

46
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,660
Got lots of lakes

47
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,840
Lots of lakes

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Minnesota

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,200
Minnesota

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Minnesota

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,460
Got lots of lakes

52
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,600
Lots of lakes

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
Look at them lakes

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,080
Look at them lakes

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,820
It's Minnesota

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,780
Minnesota

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,740
Plenty of lakes

58
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,820
Plenty of lakes

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,760
in Minnesota

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,480
Minnesota

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,380
Minnesota

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,660
Minnesota

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,840
Minnesota

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,060
Minnesota

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,040
Minnesota

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,640
Minnesota

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,440
Minnesota became

68
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Minnesota

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
The Bucker State.

70
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,380
The Rudy Schwartz Project did it.

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,880
For this episode, friends, number 1,842,

72
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,720
we're going to go back to the day before X day.

73
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,760
They got the sound system working better,

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,640
and the panelists on this live hour of Slack are Dr. Hal,

75
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,500
Reverend Pease, Reverend Fid Chooley,

76
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,840
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,320
Fid first, and then Pease, actually.

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,980
A highlight, in my opinion, is Dr. Hal and I doing a duet

79
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,380
on the song Cool Water, but that comes later, as did Pease.

80
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,720
Although those two things don't always happen in that order.

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,800
This microphone is on the left.

82
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,400
This one here is in the middle.

83
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,480
And this one's on the right.

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,480


85
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,900
That one on the right.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,820
Check 1. Check 1.

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,240
Check 2. Check 2. Check 2.

88
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,540
And Check 3.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,840
Okay.

90
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,380
Conclude recording.

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,480
Well, they also butt tough!

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,480


93
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,480


94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,000
coffee.

95
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,520
Dr. Fox, how are we looking

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
on mix?

97
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,060
This is test chatter.

98
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm merely talking

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,640
into the microphone, not to convey

100
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,060
any actual

101
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,320
information, but merely

102
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,960
to put audio

103
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
into the mic so that

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,500
Dr. Fox can twist

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,200
those robot

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,480
nipples enough so that

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,780
we can get on

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,400
rethink radio.

109
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,780
You're doing a really good show,

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
Finn. Thank you,

111
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,220
Pease. Do I need to...

112
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,180
Tell them about the bit.

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Oh, the, yeah. So

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,560
Pease had this idea

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,340
that was really funny. He said

116
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,420
we should do a bit. And I was like, yeah.

117
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,980
That is a good idea, Pease.

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,080
So...

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm gonna chew the fat

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,640
with Finn Chewy later.

121
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,580
Do we have the fat?

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,960
I've almost caught that chicken

123
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,800
three times, so just give me

124
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,920
a couple more chances, and I'll

125
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
have some fat.

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,880
I remember bits, but only

127
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,980
bits. Bits

128
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,440
and pieces.

129
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,900
But yeah, I remember back in the day, we used

130
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,920
to do bits, but we

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,720
either we lost them or the exes took them,

132
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,780
one by one, along with

133
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,740
things like my spinal fluid,

134
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,540
my hair,

135
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,460
my memory,

136
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,140
my morals.

137
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,480
All gone.

138
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,220
All gone. I'll get them back tomorrow.

139
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
You're still doing better than me.

140
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, I need to...

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,820
I got some catching up to do.

142
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,260
I'll admit,

143
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,200
since there's no girls here, anyway,

144
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,800
I lost a couple of d***s over the years.

145
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,640
I still got most of them.

146
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,340
Oh, that's okay. They grow back.

147
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,660
The main one works.

148
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,460
Well, at least for one thing.

149
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Yes, Pease.

150
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,500
Everybody

151
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,260
pees. Okay?

152
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Anybody with a

153
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,980
functioning urethra

154
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,180
is allowed to join

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,120
for free for only

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,360
$***.

157
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
Well, hey.

158
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,560
Shout out to Dobscord and shout out

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,140
to freethinkradio.com.

160
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,320
We are

161
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,580
piping hot.

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,460
Streaming. Streaming.

163
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
Piping hot.

164
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,460
Super. Ooh.

165
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,680
Getting the stage set up

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,600
for the hour of slack

167
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,800
coming very soon

168
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
to an ear hole

169
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,500
near your face.

170
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,140
And, uh,

171
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,760
I am going to

172
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,600
p*** my pants. Live.

173
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,900
Later on, too.

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,020
So stay tuned for that.

175
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,820
Did you guys get all the

176
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,540
fat samples for the chewing

177
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,580
event?

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Well, that was Pease's job.

179
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,220
And, uh, if I've learned... Oh, well...

180
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,740
If you've learned anything from this X-States,

181
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,140
don't put Pease in charge.

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,060
Right. Okay.

183
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,560
Of anything.

184
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,860
Yep. I got my plane ticket home

185
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,020
for Stang Ivan.

186
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,160
Actually, I should double check that.

187
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
Or get to the airport

188
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,060
at real early.

189
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,820
I don't know if they fixed the return ticket

190
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,360
or not.

191
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,260
Well, to be fair, um,

192
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,140
me and Fox put Pease in charge of your ticket,

193
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,120
so I don't know who the real dummy is.

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
Is it Pease or is it us for putting

195
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,540
Pease in charge?

196
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,540
Why not both?

197
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,720
I got you.

198
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,980
That's what I say.

199
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,280
I need a direct flight, but...

200
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
I'm sure they'll have Pease drive you.

201
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,660
He never screws up.

202
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,480
Yeah, you won't have to

203
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,140
howl. The world's gonna end.

204
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,700
It really better end this time.

205
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm just going to... Oh, yeah, that's right.

206
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,540
Nobody made any plans at all for after.

207
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,120
All the credit cards are maxed out.

208
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,060
Why did I even bother

209
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,400
to pay for these new glasses?

210
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,380
I'll put my bag...

211
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,740
Yeah, I've often asked myself,

212
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,220
why did I spend all day paying bills

213
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,460
just before X Day?

214
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,000
What kind of idiot am I?

215
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,460
Well, Hal, we're still

216
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,360
managing to

217
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,120
get ourselves up those three steps

218
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,240
to this stage.

219
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,580
Yes, well, this chair will definitely

220
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,260
cripple me before long.

221
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,020
As I was saying, it's like every

222
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,300
X Day, the X's take a little

223
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,480
bit or a little piece.

224
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,280
Yes, like old man Death, who takes

225
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,360
little pieces of you while you're lying in your bed.

226
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,820
You're in your box till you're all gone.

227
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,920
Oh, Bob.

228
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,640
Won't you spare me over for another year?

229
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,120
Won't you spare me over for another year?

230
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,820
Don't you take my brain.

231
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,720
Oh, Bob.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,920
He's Bob.

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,660
Won't you leave me sane?

234
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,520
Bob don't ever change.

235
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,880
He's Bob.

236
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,460
Wish I knew your name.

237
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,640
Always will be Bob.

238
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,920
I always thought that song should

239
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,280
have percussion of chain gang.

240
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,020
Yeah, it should have that kind of...

241
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,360
Rocks with picks.

242
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,160
We need the loop of that.

243
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,580
Bob had a woman named Connie.

244
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,300
She was a

245
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,920
righteous frail.

246
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,180
She had a lot of friends

247
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,200
named Johnny. When Bob

248
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,760
he hit the trail.

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,760
He's Bob.

250
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,380
They told me to

251
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,560
praise him and they told me to pay him.

252
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,580
But I just want to be him.

253
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,800
He's Bob.

254
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,460
Always will be Bob.

255
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,280
Hi, Bob.

256
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,920
Bob was the

257
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,400
god of the forest.

258
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,760
Who claimed his jungle bride.

259
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,260
His pet was a

260
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,020
brontosaurus.

261
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,720
That Bob he used to ride.

262
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,000
He's Bob.

263
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Bob don't ever change.

264
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,520
He's Bob.

265
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,400
Always will be Bob.

266
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,380
Or

267
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,160
There's a dark

268
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,280
and a shadow side of Bob.

269
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
That's Bob.

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,180
That every subgenius knows

271
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,060
is true.

272
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,940
I played that song on

273
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,100
Hour of Slightness in the last two weeks.

274
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,560
Also,

275
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,040
Papa Joe's fiery

276
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,180
speech, Five Minutes to Midnight.

277
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,240
I need to tell him that.

278
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,980
Recorded in Germany.

279
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,780
In full dress.

280
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm sure they loved that over there.

281
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,480
It was nervy, actually.

282
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,260
Five minutes to midnight!

283
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,940
It was a wonderful

284
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,340
rant, perfectly written just to do it.

285
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,920
The Hamburg

286
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,200
Devival.

287
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,960
He's got friends up in the sky.

288
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,140
He's immortal and can fly.

289
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,440
Otherwise he's just a guy like me and you.

290
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,300
There's a

291
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,580
dead armadillo

292
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,860
on the road.

293
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,940
And Bob's bumper, he hit it fair

294
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,640
and square.

295
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,180
There's a twinkle in his eye.

296
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,300
Not a tear as he drives by.

297
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,120
Cause mean old Bob

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,660
Dobbs, he just don't care.

299
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,980
So keep on the

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,060
grinning side, always on the

301
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,100
grinning side. Keep on the

302
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,440
grinning side of Bob.

303
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,140
He may look friendly like your

304
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,320
dad, but you don't want to make him

305
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,260
mad. So keep on

306
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,120
the grinning side of Bob.

307
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,800
Philo wrote that verse.

308
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,240
Yeah.

309
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,880
Well,

310
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,460
you know,

311
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,880
those folks that want to do the

312
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,600
Dr. Hal art, but maybe they should

313
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,100
put the lyrics of your hymns

314
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,120
in there. There's at least five

315
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,100
of them. Nobody ever sings

316
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,080
those things, but

317
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh, but we've

318
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,580
seen two remixes of

319
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,240
He's Bob. That's true. Somebody did

320
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,340
make those. I had them

321
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,160
on my computer, that is several

322
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,180
computers ago. I don't have them on my

323
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,840
contemporary computer.

324
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,160
I actually have all the

325
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,420
audio that I've

326
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,220
ever digitized all on one gigantic

327
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,180
18 gigabyte

328
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,000
hard drive now. So I can pull up

329
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,140
just about anything if it's got

330
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,480
a decent file name.

331
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,220
Like for instance, if I type in Hal

332
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,120
it'll pull up everything, every

333
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,400
file name that has your

334
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,140
name on it.

335
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,420
Which would probably be hundreds.

336
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,940
Why is it so

337
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,800
buzzy?

338
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,300
I can call up anything that has an X.

339
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,220
Of course that includes sex

340
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,080
and a lot of other things.

341
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Secret codes. All that

342
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
xylophone footage you have.

343
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,060
X dash, X dash

344
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,800
D, just X D.

345
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,300
You never know

346
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,820
how the file was named exactly

347
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,100
for X-Day. Sometimes you save time

348
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,300
and leave out the dash. A dash of

349
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,400
this, a dash of that

350
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
serves seven billion.

351
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,140
There you go.

352
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,340
Just a spoonful of punctuation

353
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,160
helps the medicine go down.

354
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,880
More Dobstown Weekly

355
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,140
whiff reader headlines.

356
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,380
Ivan Stang's secret recipe

357
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,460
for imitation skyline

358
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,920
chili. Well that's pretty funny.

359
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,020
Oh boy. A brown paper bag.

360
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,300
Yeah, with a big M on it

361
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,020
for Mason's Masonic.

362
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,200
How beautiful, thank you.

363
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,600
Tainted frop stash endangers dozens.

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Thrills even more.

365
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,680
Yes, we'll deal with that in a moment.

366
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,180
Paparazzi perplexed

367
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,220
by Walter Kosmack's new fleet

368
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,040
of anti-glamour drones.

369
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,340
I like the alliteration there.

370
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,020
Reverend P's

371
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,220
greatest boner.

372
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,860
Las Vegas actually shameful.

373
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,120
Sexy swamp apes seeking

374
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,640
sultry meetups.

375
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,260
Details inside.

376
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,180
You know we had those back in Ohio.

377
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,560
The Loveland frogmen were a cryptid species

378
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,100
that you had to worry about there.

379
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,660
Now we have the sexy swamp apes.

380
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,840
Oh that's nothing like the Land O' Lakes frogmen.

381
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,080
Oh no. They uh,

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,100
they like the frog

383
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,140
way.

384
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,960
We're being told to talk into the microphones.

385
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,220
Stage douche

386
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,680
Argus Fox is instructing

387
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,820
the performers to

388
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,100
remember to articulate clearly

389
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
into the microphones.

390
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
Reverend Stang, are you familiar with this

391
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,540
publication, Mind Shaft?

392
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,720
No, I've heard

393
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,400
about it. I haven't actually seen it.

394
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,220
It's what all the cartoonists are doing

395
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,980
these days and I'm in the next issue.

396
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,820
The one that's coming out.

397
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,940
This one just came out.

398
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,960
Who's doing this?

399
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,800
Well uh...

400
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,840
Contributors are Crumb, Christopher Miller, Mary Flaner,

401
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,700
Sophie Crumb.

402
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,280
Nepotism.

403
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,640
Sophie's got...

404
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,220
Dennis Kitchen, is he still alive?

405
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,720
He's still alive and his drawings and cartoons

406
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,480
look just like they always did.

407
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:55,900
Huh.

408
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,240
But uh, we lost Jay Lynch and Skip Williamson.

409
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,440
Yeah, oh I didn't know Skip Williamson died.

410
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,240
Skip Williamson was so upset that

411
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,860
Jay Lynch died that he died.

412
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,760
Aww.

413
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,860
Yeah.

414
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,940
Like two old dogs that just can't live apart.

415
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,560
2015.

416
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,640
It was sudden.

417
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,160
The fellow in the Bright Night

418
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,620
gown.

419
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,980
Sudden is not so bad.

420
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,900
I've heard.

421
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,300
No actually I haven't heard.

422
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
Don't read Daniel.

423
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,200
Well it says right here in the

424
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,240
Dobstown Weekly

425
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,780
WIF reader that Dr.

426
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,900
Howell has announced

427
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,360
the new Universal

428
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,160
Poet Laureate.

429
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah.

430
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,740
Well it's gotta be true. It's in print.

431
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,220
That news came out weeks ago.

432
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,720
That old. Yeah that's old news.

433
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,100
If you haven't got your copy

434
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,880

435
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,940

station.

438
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,260
Over at that pretty turquoise

439
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,620
building.

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,180
That's right your bag of

443
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,940
free art supplies is waiting

444
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,640
for you. It's cold.

445
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,500
It's alone. It's crying.

446
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,060
It says how come I don't have

447
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,220
a mommy. Well you can be

448
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040

449
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,980
mommy right now. Come to the

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,700
stage get your free bag of art supplies

451
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,300
and get a doodling.

452
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,300
It says tangy

453
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,220
barbecue sauce therefore it must

454
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,740
be tangy barbecue sauce.

455
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,920
Friends it's ah yes

456
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,720
welcome to hour of slight number

457
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,820
1800 and

458
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,020
Exactly.

459
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
That innumerate

460
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,180
designation. It's all

461
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,300
the same stuff produced from

462
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,620
the same spigot.

463
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,820
Once again

464
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,800
live at X Day

465
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,760
in a new location

466
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,200
Land O' Lakes Florida

467
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,240
the Land O' Id nudist

468
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,100
resort. I thought it was the Land

469
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,560
of Fid.

470
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,100
Well I guess

471
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,500
you could change all the signs.

472
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
Change them to what?

473
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,580
Land of Fid

474
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,840
says

475
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
Dr. Fid Chooley

476
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,880
who's joined us on this panel.

477
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,060
Well he made such a sacrifice with his

478
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,380
attack on his legs and feet

479
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,820
the other day.

480
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,180
He was so bloodied he should have been

481
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,820
in Fox's Book of Martyrs.

482
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,980
That's right you've injured yourself

483
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,940
horribly and didn't even know how you did it right?

484
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,680
That's true.

485
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,400
That is true. It looked like a catamount

486
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,940
or a wild cat

487
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,100
had leapt on your bare legs and

488
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,060
scratched and marred them.

489
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,220
I actually

490
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,940
died yesterday.

491
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,740
I die every night.

492
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,600
It looked pretty bad.

493
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,820
But I was having such a good time

494
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,540
I figured I'd hang around a little bit

495
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,120
not to let a little thing like death

496
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,500
keep me from a good party.

497
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,140
Maybe you actually did pass

498
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,880
and sunk into the swamp which

499
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,260
revised you as it did Lon Chaney

500
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,520
in The Mummy's Curse.

501
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,280
Lon Chaney Jr. that is.

502
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,340
That's right. Yeah the Mummy

503
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,940
the Universal Mummy was last seen in Florida.

504
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,720
He went to the south. Yes.

505
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,700
Not only that he was hanging out with a woman

506
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,740
named Aunt Bertha

507
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,340
played by Virginia Christine

508
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,720
and Mrs. Olsen in all the coffee commercials.

509
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,080
Oh really? Yes.

510
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,280
Oh man, wait until Sternow hears that.

511
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,140
He's really hot for Mrs. Olsen.

512
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
She had a movie career

513
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
in a bunch of movies where just when

514
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,180
you're not expecting to see the lady

515
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,360
from the coffee commercials

516
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,060
she pops in. Like in Billy the Kid

517
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,500
meets Dracula for example.

518
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,080
Was that the

519
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,040
coffee commercials where she was horrified

520
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,320
that her husband asked for a second cup?

521
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,260
The husband is going to kill the wife

522
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,260
or something because her coffee is so bad.

523
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,980
My husband hates my coffee.

524
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,880
Well it's mountain grown.

525
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,960
He never asked for a second cup of my coffee.

526
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,200
And then there's a scene of the clock

527
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
ticking in suspense

528
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,380
as the hubby drinks the coffee

529
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,280
and the wife is a bundle of nerves

530
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,060
as she waits and then the husband

531
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,660
finally moos at her.

532
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,280
Honey, that's good coffee.

533
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,080
And she

534
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,200
shoo

535
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,520
relaxes out of her kitchen.

536
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,060
No beating tonight. Yes.

537
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,960
You won't have to go to the special room

538
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,920
tonight, baby.

539
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,560
I had that experience

540
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,760
last night.

541
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,440
That's for Mrs. Olsen and Folgers.

542
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,540
Dr. Fox

543
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,160
usually never asks

544
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,800
for a second helping of my

545
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,240
frop but last night

546
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,980
somebody gave him some frop and he wanted

547
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,080
some more and I was taken

548
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,060
by it.

549
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,740
I didn't know what to do with myself.

550
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,620
I was going to kill myself

551
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,220
again.

552
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,820
Well practice makes perfect.

553
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,440
Dr. Fox never asked for a second helping of my frop.

554
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,000
At X Day they give you hamburgers for breakfast.

555
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,920
Hey, you know what goes good

556
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,840
with X Day Breakfast?

557
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Bloody Mary's.

558
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,740
There's some free Bloody Mary's

559
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,100
service happening right now.

560
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,160
General announcement.

561
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,080
If you want to get your

562
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,080
thang twisted into a spang.

563
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,780
But the sun ain't even high

564
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,020
over the yardarm yet, matey.

565
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
We're going to start boozing it up

566
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,260
with Bloody Mary's.

567
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,260


568
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,560
Bloody Mary's?

569
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,460
I don't know, maybe we are.

570
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,400
It's an exceptional set of circumstances.

571
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,260
An unusual holiday.

572
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,800
All the limitations kicked away.

573
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,680
Well I'm going to go

574
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,800
acquire one for myself.

575
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,940
Because it's

576
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,660
X Day.

577
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,740
This is it.

578
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,520
It better happen this year.

579
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,620
Who's with me? Come on.

580
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,720
Or else what, pilgrim?

581
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
Or else I have to go home.

582
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,720
And then go back

583
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,380
to work.

584
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,100
Well, whether your home

585
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,320
is a cardboard box on the street

586
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,040
or a palace on board

587
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
the X's saucers,

588
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,680
you will be home.

589
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,820
I can't wait for

590
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,000
tomorrow because

591
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,840
Princess We told me that

592
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,140
my two older dogs are pining

593
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,700
for me.

594
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,920
So the first thing I'm going to do

595
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,140
about 7.05 is beam my dogs

596
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,200
up and have

597
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,780
them rejoin me. And

598
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,460
I'm going to have them

599
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,600
join Princess We.

600
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,640
Be careful they're not

601
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,760
reassembled at gigantic size.

602
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,080
They already have.

603
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,840
They already have grown to gigantic size.

604
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,400
But, oh, I'm thinking of the puppies.

605
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,560
Professor Diemer's formula.

606
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,540
Just the old dogs.

607
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,960
In fact, last night I missed

608
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,380
some of the show because I was on

609
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,760
FaceTime trying to console the dog.

610
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
It didn't work.

611
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,440
The dog didn't recognize my voice

612
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,080
over Wee's phone. It's all right, puppy.

613
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,300
I'm going to have to

614
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,680
get you to the phone.

615
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,860
No, it's a FaceTime call.

616
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,320
So they can see me too.

617
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,380
But they can't smell you and so they know it's fake.

618
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,320
Yeah. Now my oldest,

619
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,180
previous dog, Dammit,

620
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,600
we brought him to Cleveland.

621
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,260
Really? That was the name of Chicken's dog.

622
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Yeah, I know. My dad's name's

623
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,940
Dammit, Dammit, though.

624
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,860
Constantly heard his name called.

625
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,020
It was embarrassing in crowds.

626
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,180
You know, Dammit, come.

627
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,660
People look at you funny.

628
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,540
Then he died and then I got a dog

629
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,340
named Buddy. Already named Buddy.

630
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
Anyway, Dammit would...

631
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,020
When I went off to the radio station,

632
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,340
sometimes Princess Wee

633
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,960
would stay home.

634
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,100
I was recording it at home and

635
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,000
my voice was on the big speakers.

636
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,180
When my voice came on

637
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,260
live, the dog would snap

638
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,900
to attention. He

639
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,980
recognized it.

640
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,360
But that was on good speakers.

641
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,820
It was live radio, not

642
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,780
satellite, you know,

643
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,520
microphone, tinny little sound.

644
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,280
Poor Claudia.

645
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,460
Still waiting by the window,

646
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,880
staring at the driveway,

647
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,140
waiting for Daddy to come back.

648
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,840
I miss those dogs.

649
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,780
You know, at the end of the world,

650
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,920
the things that are most important

651
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,420
to you come to the forefront.

652
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,380
And I think in my case,

653
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,940
it's the damn dogs.

654
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,840
You know, I'm not worried

655
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,320
about my human family.

656
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm worried about my doggies.

657
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,260
They don't know what's going on.

658
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,680
They're just idiots.

659
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,720
They're so innocent.

660
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,820
Unlike any humans that I know.

661
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,800
Man's commensal species.

662
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,220
Did you see that movie

663
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,720
Alpha?

664
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,040
No, I didn't, but that's not

665
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,340
the one where they had a computer generated dog.

666
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
No, no, that's

667
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,820
Call of the Wild.

668
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,240
It's the real dog in Alpha that looked very wolf-like.

669
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah, Call of the Wild.

670
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,960
It would be

671
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,500
a very realistic dog,

672
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,120
except that it acts too perfect.

673
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,860
It poses

674
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,200
in shots like a real

675
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,380
dog would never do.

676
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,180
There's no nipple slips.

677
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,320
No accidents.

678
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,640
Dogs are all about those.

679
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,080
That gives it the uncanny valley.

680
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,720
Well, one out of eight ain't bad.

681
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,740
Otherwise, it's a

682
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,600
good, it's a fun movie.

683
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,100
I heard it was a good version of the story.

684
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
Yeah, but if only somebody

685
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,180
who didn't have a real dog would be fooled.

686
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,060
Yes.

687
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,680
As realistic as it is.

688
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,580
I mean, they got hair down pretty well.

689
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,260
Well, hell, they can fake anything now.

690
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,100
You don't even need millions of dollars of special effects.

691
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,040
You can stick your face onto anybody

692
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,760
using a damn phone.

693
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,920
Well, Lassie and

694
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,640
Rin Tin Tin, let's give them credit,

695
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,480
could really act.

696
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,100
I could stick your face on Rin Tin Tin

697
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,340
and vice versa.

698
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,960
Please don't. Rin Tin Tin has been sleeping

699
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
with his ancestors for years.

700
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,560
Surgically, we can do that tomorrow.

701
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,320
A ghastly match-up.

702
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,960
Mmm.

703
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,480
Peanut butter.

704
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
If you can hold Hal down, I can scrape it on the inside

705
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,600
of the roof of his mouth with a popsicle stick.

706
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,260
Peanut butter not good for

707
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,700
humans of advanced age.

708
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,040
The peanut itself,

709
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,120
not a nut, but a legume

710
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,660
that grows on a tree.

711
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,600
Same with the cashew.

712
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,800
Almonds are alright.

713
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,260
Ah.

714
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,400
Well, I brought all this

715
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
dope up here, so we're going to

716
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,140
smoke it while we meander as

717
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,560
we do.

718
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,960
Smoke that dope.

719
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,320
In this tiny little pipe, there's, I mean,

720
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,900
you have to keep smoking to get it out.

721
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,920
I'll be interested

722
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,560
to see if gift

723
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,700
memberships will save

724
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,060
people tomorrow. For instance,

725
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,180
my kids never spent

726
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,420
the 35 bucks. They're grown-ups

727
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,060
now. Well, they have the

728
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,780
document and they...

729
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,440
I gave them

730
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,240
membership packs. One Christmas, I gave

731
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,200
everybody in the family membership packs, but

732
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,520
there's only one, only my niece

733
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,140
has ever

734
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,240
actually bought one.

735
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,340
And she's a regular listener

736
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,500
to our slaps. She would know

737
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,080
who you are and everything.

738
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,260
But what happens if you didn't

739
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,780
buy your membership pack yourself,

740
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,040
if somebody just gave it to you, are you

741
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,240
saved? If you don't

742
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,780
give a sh**, if you really

743
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,100
don't even believe in Bob, like my kids.

744
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,380
As long as somebody...

745
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
Well, that's not black in their name.

746
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,260
No doubt the exists will listen to that.

747
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,520
They will listen to these records as well.

748
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,260
They will know how thorough they are.

749
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,980
Of course, there is that transfer of

750
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,000
documentation, but a similar change

751
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,260
happens in the germplasm

752
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,280
at that time.

753
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,560
As long as somebody paid for it.

754
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,220
Because that's one of

755
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,980
the more insidious

756
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,160
uses of the

757
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,460
membership packet is

758
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,020
you can ordain somebody

759
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,440
else against their will

760
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,560
just by paying for a membership packet.

761
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,960
Just like the Mormons. They can throw you

762
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,600
to your dead.

763
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah, you can save your dead ancestors.

764
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,520
Just like the Mormons do.

765
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,840
And like Coca-Cola, which brings their beloved

766
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,380
ancestors back from the dead.

767
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,820
Or you can just take somebody that you know hates

768
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,900
the Church of the Subgenius, send them

769
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,400
your $35. I hate the Church of the Subgenius.

770
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
I hate it.

771
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,840
Guess what? Oh, you do? Well, you're in the

772
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
Book of Life now.

773
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,620
How do you like that? How does that taste?

774
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,900
Does his name appear in the

775
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,980
Book of Life? Well, I can't

776
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,180
find him here, Lord. Unless maybe it's spelled

777
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,240
differently. Then with

778
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,040
sorrow I say unto you,

779
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,680
into the eternal fire,

780
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,240
prepared for Satan and his fallen angel

781
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,300
buddies. You had a chance

782
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,920
when I sent that boring preacher

783
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,100
to your door and you laughed at him

784
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,120
and turned him away and embraced this

785
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,940
guy with the pipe.

786
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,080
Just better hope Reverend Pease wasn't the one

787
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,640
who wrote your name in the Book of Life.

788
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,080
The recording

789
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,480
angel does that.

790
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,320
You know, how come it's huge and thick

791
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,080
like a dictionary when everyone

792
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,980
at the Last Judgement is automatically

793
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,100
guilty and it's all a show

794
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,040
trial? Whose names

795
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,200
are in that there Book of

796
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,280
Life? Mostly Neanderthals.

797
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,700
Mark Twain wrote about Captain

798
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,120
Stormfield's visit to

799
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,880
heaven. He went

800
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,240
wrong and has traveled through

801
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,040
space and first of all ended up in

802
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,140
alien heaven. But he finally ended

803
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,100
up in human heaven and he found there were

804
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,880
the whole place was overwhelmed by

805
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,120
what he called engines, which were

806
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,620
Neanderthals, primitives,

807
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,000
cavemen,

808
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,540
pre-Adamic

809
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,240
men. You know, they outnumber

810
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
everybody else and so with

811
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,340
their tom-tom beating and so

812
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,040
on they make heaven resound.

813
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,240
I wonder if River

814
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,160
World owes Mark Twain

815
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,800
an explanation.

816
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,300
They have him in there, don't

817
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,520
they?

818
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,220
Did you ever see

819
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,180
the thing that's based on it? I

820
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,260
had an opportunity to watch it on the plane, but I

821
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,880
didn't want to. I would have had to watch it

822
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,280
silent. Which? The River World

823
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,000
show or River World

824
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,140
movie based on Philip King. I did

825
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,820
see the River World movie. Jose

826
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,140
Flaman. It sucked and on top of that they didn't

827
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,340
show everybody naked. Oh, that's

828
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,100
terrible. I especially wanted to see

829
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,880
Alice Blesent's Liddell

830
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,260
naked and having sex like in

831
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,240
the story. No, no. It was a TV

832
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,660
movie so it was lame.

833
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,280
Well, made for TV, that says it all.

834
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,740
C'est no more. C'est no more.

835
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,380
Wow.

836
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,060
Yeah, very little relation to the

837
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,920
book.

838
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,560
I mean, really.

839
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,600
There's a problem here about

840
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,360
COVID and everything and putting

841
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,240
our lips on this thing. Do you have one of these?

842
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,360
I've got one. Don't worry. I'm fine.

843
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,200
Okay, great. You know, I'm

844
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,400
at work. I don't

845
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,540
I don't frop at work.

846
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,320
Everybody's drinking

847
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
on the job.

848
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,320
Really? Well, you shame me, but

849
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,720
on the other hand...

850
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,240
Actually, I used to.

851
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,320
Back before

852
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,040
9-11.

853
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,280
When you could open the

854
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,320
radio station windows.

855
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,740
After 9-11, they locked

856
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,980
everything up. Total

857
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,200
lockdown was as bad as COVID.

858
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,160
And no more fropping in the

859
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,040
stations. After COVID, they locked the

860
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,020
station itself so no one could... Right.

861
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,120
And then there was no stations, but that

862
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,160
worked out fine

863
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,260
for me. I was already locked out of

864
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,060
any stations, doing it from home.

865
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,100
And...

866
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,320
I managed to get

867
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,480
the stations to accept

868
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,100
mp3 downloads so I didn't have to mail

869
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,360
them CDs anymore, which was expensive.

870
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,220
And most

871
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,300
of them weren't paying anyway.

872
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,440
But it's free advertising.

873
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,360
The great thing about

874
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,040
real radio as opposed to

875
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,120
podcasts is somebody can hear it

876
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,160
by accident. Just driving

877
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,140
along their car, putting it on

878
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,700
scan, and suddenly

879
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,920
they'll hear this crazy

880
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,020
stuff. And that's the...

881
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,180
That's really fun to

882
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,260
think of. And I've heard examples

883
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,240
of that. I've also heard it

884
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,160
happening in reverse. Thank you.

885
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,940
This one woman, she was actually

886
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,840
the station manager

887
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,880
at the Dallas station.

888
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,660
She was driving back from Austin

889
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,480
and it was 9 o'clock

890
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,120
Sunday and she thought, well I'll listen

891
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,980
to the Hour of Slack. She turned on the radio, but

892
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,700
she wasn't anywhere near Dallas.

893
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,180
And she thought she was listening to my

894
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,160
show for about half an hour

895
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
before she realized she had it tuned between

896
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,240
a rock station and a preacher station.

897
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,580
A rock station and a hard place station.

898
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,060
She was hearing rock music with idiot

899
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,320
preachers and figured that was Hour of Slack.

900
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,640
So...

901
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,180
Yeah, I used to do the same thing

902
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,460
with scrambled porn.

903
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,320
You just gotta pick what kind of stations

904
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,380
to put the needle

905
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,280
between. So you hear

906
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,040
both of them, back and forth.

907
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,300
Quick, what's in the needle?

908
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,340
Hey bees,

909
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,180
why don't you come up here and occupy this mic

910
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,020
so I can, uh,

911
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,880
cure for myself.

912
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,860
Occupy X Day.

913
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,060
I'm gonna go occupy a Bloody Mary.

914
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,900
Occupy X Day.

915
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,560
Or be occupied.

916
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,900
Hey, do you scratch these things

917
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,560
or do you peel them off the front?

918
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,380
We could start a new, uh,

919
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,820
subversive movement called

920
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,500
Anti-Pie for Anti-Pink.

921
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Anti-Pie.

922
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,860
Hmm. Well, uh,

923
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,520
they should know that we're anti-

924
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,880
pink. Wow, look.

925
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,200
And tea pick. Ice cold water.

926
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,940
Dr. Pease has been real careful about making sure

927
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,280
people hydrate.

928
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,800
But don't get my valuable

929
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,280
mindset. Especially when he sees somebody

930
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,640
stumbling along about to pass out.

931
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,880
He'll follow along behind him.

932
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,120
Drink this, drink this.

933
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,720
Don't drink that, drink this.

934
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,140
Without a taste of water.

935
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,560
Cool water.

936
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,360
Water.

937
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,380
Water, water.

938
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,260
Keep up.

939
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,520
Keep up the movin', Dan. Don't you listen to him, Dan.

940
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,280
He's a devil, not a man.

941
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,020
And he spreads the burning sand

942
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,260
with water.

943
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,100
Water. Water.

944
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,140
Dan, don't you see there's a

945
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,280
big green tree with the water

946
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,940
running free and there's water

947
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,020
running there for me and

948
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,540
you.

949
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,220
The shadows

950
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,060
sway and seem

951
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,920
to say, tonight

952
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,120
we'll pray for water.

953
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,880
Cool

954
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,100
water.

955
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,780
Water.

956
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,960
And way up there, he'll hear

957
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
our prayer and show

958
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,360
us where

959
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,380
there's water.

960
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,000
Water.

961
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,920
Clear, cool

962
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,740
water.

963
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,620
Water.

964
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
Sons of the

965
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,460
Pioneers was the version I grew up with.

966
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,620
Yeah.

967
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,240
The hearing

968
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,260
aids are constantly shortening

969
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,160
out from sweat running into them.

970
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,300
And so I put this umbrella made of

971
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,960
McDonald's napkin over my left one.

972
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,500
Speaking of McDonald's, there seems to be

973
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,440
an extra bacon

974
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,860
mix-something here.

975
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,940
I feel foolish.

976
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,940
You can have that.

977
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
I'll have it, all right.

978
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,300
Or you can save it for later.

979
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,840
There is no later.

980
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,060
I feel foolish because

981
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,300
I saw you with the napkin on your ear.

982
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,520
Time

983
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,640
is running

984
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,700
out.

985
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
So it's a fabulous day here next day.

986
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,200
But there is no July 5th in this building.

987
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,680
Yes, that's going to be a problem.

988
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,280
I can't believe this.

989
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,640
Look at my arm.

990
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,020
Insect.

991
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
More water coming out of me than there is in that

992
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,120
store-bought water bottle.

993
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,260
That's why if you smoke

994
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,300
frop like me, you'll find your temperature

995
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,220
was regulated.

996
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,840
Perhaps you've reached your saturation level.

997
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,140
I used to get, in Arizona, when it

998
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,580
was super hot, I found if I

999
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,620
smoked some pot, I adjusted my temperature.

1000
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,860
Where did peas come from?

1001
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,200
It's horrible.

1002
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,320
It's an X-Day miracle.

1003
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,120
The X-Day miracle

1004
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,000
for me was the rain of prairie

1005
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,400
squid from the sky yesterday.

1006
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,760
God, that was so fun.

1007
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,900
It was so crazy.

1008
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,060
It was the torrential rain and suddenly there were

1009
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,360
these flopping, stinking

1010
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,920
prairie squid, only they

1011
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
were wet.

1012
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,020
They actually weren't prairie squid.

1013
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,480
Raymond Burr in his wheelchair.

1014
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,400
People were calling them walking catfish.

1015
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,640
They were making their way to the pool

1016
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,540
and we had to put a stop to it.

1017
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,200
They were coming out of the pond trying to get to the

1018
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,500
pool because

1019
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,140
they wanted cool, clear water.

1020
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,780
They weren't reckoning on pouring.

1021
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Which I think would be bad for them.

1022
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,140
In fact,

1023
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,960
I saved one from poisoning.

1024
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,360
I saw you with that net.

1025
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,160
He resisted your attempts

1026
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
to save him, much like many of the

1027
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,160
subgeniuses.

1028
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,740
Well, yeah. I guess that was a pink

1029
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,000
walking catfish.

1030
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,640
He didn't want to be saved.

1031
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,140
I don't need any

1032
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,800
more friends.

1033
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,060
You really remembered

1034
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,940
that one, didn't you?

1035
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,100
It was a wonderful tale.

1036
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,040
Well, it's typical subgenius.

1037
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,200
You don't want to go to some party and meet new people.

1038
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,740
Well, I think that's the thing.

1039
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,860
We've all experienced that feeling

1040
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,160
and probably all done

1041
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,200
the exact same thing. You've got a friend

1042
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,940
that says, hey, I know this guy.

1043
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,100
You're really going to like him. He's so awesome.

1044
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,140
And you're like, leave me alone. I've got all the

1045
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,840
friends I need.

1046
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,100
Well, what convinced me to go meet

1047
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,860
the Drummond family was that

1048
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,280
my sister-in-law said,

1049
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,360
well, he's really into Captain Beefheart

1050
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,720
and he collects comic books.

1051
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,760
And, of course, now that describes

1052
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,020
about half the subgeniuses. But then,

1053
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,140
in 1976,

1054
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,020
I didn't know anybody

1055
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,160
like that. And it's like, well, okay.

1056
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,080
We go over to this

1057
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,380
suburban house

1058
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,640
and there's Philo Drummond

1059
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,020
and he looks just as pink as

1060
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,880
a newborn babe

1061
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,940
with this corporate haircut

1062
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,840
and a sportcaster mustache

1063
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,960
and he's playing darts.

1064
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,780
He's a jock.

1065
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,340
And he brings me over

1066
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,680
and he says, here, throw some darts.

1067
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,720
Let's throw some darts while those women talk.

1068
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,100
And I go,

1069
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,960
I don't know. I've never thrown darts.

1070
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,420
I don't know anything about this.

1071
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,380
He goes, go ahead and try.

1072
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,580
I give it a try. Bullseye!

1073
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,020
Right dead center! My first try.

1074
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,800
Total beginner's luck.

1075
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,920
Philo's thinking,

1076
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,600
That shark.

1077
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,680
He's like a card shark.

1078
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,300
He's an expert at darts

1079
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,120
and he convinced me that he was a nervous amateur.

1080
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,000
So we both were suspicious

1081
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,840
from the get-go. But then,

1082
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,440
he said, hey, I found something cool the other day

1083
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,600
and he brought it out and it was like

1084
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,120
a Chick track or a John Birch Society pamphlet.

1085
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,260
Something like that.

1086
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,580
And I was like, wow.

1087
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
He's interested in the same

1088
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,100
that I am.

1089
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,700
And next thing we knew,

1090
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,020
we were,

1091
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,440
he was telling me about this

1092
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,360
special person.

1093
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,400
But because, I know, I normally would have

1094
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,340
fled at that point when he started telling me

1095
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,260
about Bob, but he had such good

1096
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,740
frop.

1097
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,740
That was the other thing.

1098
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,340
That was the thing my sister-in-law

1099
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,220
should have told me.

1100
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,000
He's got real good frop.

1101
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,960
That's what frop was then.

1102
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,960
So it wouldn't have helped much.

1103
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,500
But he gave me this stuff.

1104
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,340
I guess I thought it was marijuana at the time.

1105
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,940
So I tried it for the first time.

1106
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,000
Well, that's all it takes.

1107
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,360
One hit, you're done.

1108
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,340
You're going to be high the rest of your life.

1109
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,140
You don't ever need another hit.

1110
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,620
Oddly enough, I see people just

1111
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,860
keep coming back for more all day long

1112
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,880
the rest of their lives.

1113
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,880
Even though you don't get any higher generally.

1114
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,240
You're kind of stuck

1115
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,960
in one level of extremely

1116
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,320
high all the time.

1117
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,120
Consistently. Too high.

1118
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,200
And the rest, as they say...

1119
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,720
But look at me!

1120
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,280
I'm fine!

1121
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,040
Aside from my backbone and my memory

1122
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,720
and my eyesight and hearing,

1123
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,060
I have a picture of health.

1124
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,400
My lungs, allergies,

1125
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,900
hospital visits...

1126
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,740
Memory problems. You say you have memory problems?

1127
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,960
You remember the money you owe me, right?

1128
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,800
No, it's the money you owe me.

1129
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,720
You see, that's the...

1130
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,060
Yeah, there are some...

1131
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,740
Some things are not lost to memory.

1132
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,040
The exes have those.

1133
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,900
The exes have those memories and we'll get them back tomorrow.

1134
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,060
We'll settle it then.

1135
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,420
Alright, that sounds fair.

1136
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,960
I'll see you on the saucer, mister.

1137
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,900
Yeah, we'll let Mwom settle this one.

1138
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,540
In the casino.

1139
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,820
Speaking of the saucer,

1140
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,100
you have an especially exquisite

1141
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,580
saucer plan for yourself

1142
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,060
with many national monuments

1143
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,400
and tchotchkes, if I'm not mistaken.

1144
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,300
Right, I've just got to beat legume to them.

1145
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,120
Well, hasn't he got a head start?

1146
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,280
Yeah, but

1147
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,140
I guess the official chase

1148
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,900
doesn't start until 7am.

1149
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Oh, okay, that's good.

1150
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,520
But he does have a head start, yeah.

1151
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,480
And he knows exactly what I want the most.

1152
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,440
And he's a devil.

1153
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,460
In the end, he'll let me have him back,

1154
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,940
but I'll have to fight him for him.

1155
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,360
They'll be on his ship at first.

1156
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,760
Yeah, I know how he is.

1157
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,440
You'll have to trade it for something.

1158
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah, like my memory.

1159
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,920
Sacred nose hairs,

1160
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
a strand of the sacred ponytail,

1161
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,360
all of these will be

1162
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,580
the currency of the future.

1163
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,340
Relics left here on this

1164
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,460
burning hulk of an earth.

1165
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,320
I thought you'd forgotten

1166
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,100
about the ponytail.

1167
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,400
He still got his eye on my ponytail.

1168
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,040
Circling back.

1169
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,820
He's jealous.

1170
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,620
That's what makes it funny, you circle back.

1171
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,980
Look at that.

1172
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,960
It used to be big, long.

1173
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,900
I'm going to tell you something,

1174
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,360
that is going to make the most fabulous keychain for me.

1175
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,600
I mean,

1176
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,560
people are going to see that.

1177
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,040
It's hanging out of my pocket.

1178
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,180
You mean not on your belt?

1179
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,340
You can have it.

1180
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm going to have a whole new body tomorrow.

1181
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,360
Now, I'm going to go for a robot body,

1182
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,140
but I'm going to have an extra arm

1183
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,260
for doing stuff

1184
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,440
when I'm doing stuff with my regular arms.

1185
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,320
What kind of robot?

1186
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,960
I know what you mean.

1187
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,820
You just need one right hand.

1188
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,660
It only has to do one thing, pump up.

1189
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,720
It's a pleasure saucer, by definition.

1190
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,080
You're going to need that extra arm.

1191
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,740
Now, don't be foolish

1192
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,840
and just get the arm.

1193
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,600
Order the hand option.

1194
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,080
It needs a wrist.

1195
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,320
It needs a flexible wrist.

1196
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,160
Otherwise, it just gets too repetitious.

1197
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,140
Take the claw!

1198
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,460
You get calluses.

1199
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,780
You just get calluses.

1200
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,040
After a while,

1201
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,120
everything loses sensitivity.

1202
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,020
Take my word for it.

1203
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,860
I know how that is.

1204
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,440
He's right.

1205
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,640
Some people say

1206
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,720
they're just going to keep

1207
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,040
their regular old body.

1208
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,880
Ratnar, among others,

1209
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,020
strangely enough.

1210
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
Have you seen his body?

1211
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,880
I've seen every bit of Ratnar's body.

1212
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,140
What did he do to it?

1213
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,860
He's a very large,

1214
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,060
very pink-colored fellow.

1215
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,840
He's a large-sized subgenius?

1216
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,380
Soft.

1217
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,880
His body is very big.

1218
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,120
His skin looks like it has never seen the sun.

1219
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,560
He'd come to X-Day

1220
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,780
and sunburn himself horribly

1221
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,960
in the first hour.

1222
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,760
And then be miserable.

1223
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,520
Invariably, he'd set up his tent

1224
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,000
ineptly

1225
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,700
and it would rain and soak everything

1226
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,000
including his brand new video cameras

1227
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,880
and so forth.

1228
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
Then he'd be sure that

1229
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,320
somebody else had sabotaged it.

1230
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,880
Why did Bob pick on me?

1231
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,460
I just wanted to come here and have fun.

1232
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,780
Well, Bob didn't, but some of his followers

1233
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,060
did.

1234
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,380
Ratnar quit coming to X-Day,

1235
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,140
but I kind of miss him.

1236
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,180
He was such a regular

1237
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,940
and he was kind of a...

1238
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,400
I don't know.

1239
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,120
He had served one of the functions of peace

1240
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,980
as a punching bag.

1241
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,580
He was an acolyte.

1242
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,660
A classic acolyte.

1243
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,640
Like a vampire is familiar.

1244
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,980
I was sitting there one X-Day

1245
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,300
looking around, oh no, Ratnar's here.

1246
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,360
Here comes Ratnar.

1247
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,300
He goes, Stang, I've got something for you.

1248
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,360
He was in cash.

1249
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,720
He had saved up from his

1250
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,540
Pizza Hut delivery job.

1251
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,000
He gave me

1252
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,520
a whole bunch of Pizza Hut plastic

1253
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,080
red glasses, which turned out

1254
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,520
to be my very favorite drinking glasses.

1255
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,240
I look for those things.

1256
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,920
I steal them when I go to Pizza Hut.

1257
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,980
Those were more valuable to me than the thousand bucks.

1258
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,700
At that point, I changed my mind

1259
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,780
about him instantly.

1260
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,280
I said, Ratnar, it wouldn't be the same

1261
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,440
without you at X-Day.

1262
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,720
I was thinking, maybe he'll bring another

1263
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,080
$200,000 next year.

1264
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,900
He ended up running for Governor of Kentucky.

1265
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,320
I think he got 23 votes.

1266
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,800
That's a magical number, as you know.

1267
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,220
His plan

1268
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,640
was to solve

1269
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,640
the war problems by

1270
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,900
sending out

1271
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,580
robot dog

1272
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,780
mule soldiers instead of

1273
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,680
human soldiers.

1274
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,460
I said, wouldn't that be kind of expensive?

1275
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,460
How would the Army pay for that?

1276
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,560
He said, with legalized

1277
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,760
equipment.

1278
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,100
He said, with the

1279
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,100


1280
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,100


1281
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,700
get all 23 votes.

1282
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,520
He got the discordian vote.

1283
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,400
If he had gotten

1284
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,620
a subgenius vote, it would be

1285
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,440
273, not just 23.

1286
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,920
23 is common.

1287
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,040
It comes up every 23 times.

1288
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,820
273 is much more rare.

1289
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,640
Now, 1303

1290
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,660
or 13013,

1291
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,380
that's

1292
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,340
really the most sacred number.

1293
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,260
Thank you.

1294
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,720
That's a different type of number.

1295
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,200
999 is a good one.

1296
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,980
That was actually the number

1297
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,040
of the anti-Bob.

1298
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,480
I think the most sacred number

1299
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,540
is 35.

1300
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,240
35

1301
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,620
measly dollars.

1302
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,620
We've got to

1303
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,620
raise it, man. It's been 35 bucks

1304
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,980
for 20 years or something.

1305
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,920
I think we're going to suddenly raise it.

1306
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,860
$35.50.

1307
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,280
It should have been $33.

1308
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,420
But now we've gone past that.

1309
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,100
But maybe that will include postage

1310
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,220
unless it's overseas.

1311
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,720
It costs $26 to send a

1312
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,540
membership pack to England

1313
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,720
and $22 to

1314
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,560
send one to Canada or

1315
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,060
Mexico.

1316
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,880
Not that anyone's ever ordered one from Mexico.

1317
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,480
I think we had two members.

1318
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,640
Don't you think you should do it in steps though?

1319
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,220
It may cost more if they

1320
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,620
Like when Marvel would raise the price on the comic,

1321
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,720
they'd put a little starburst on the cover

1322
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,000
and say,

1323
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,600
Still only $0.35.

1324
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,840
Oh, I remember still only $0.10.

1325
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,780
Still only $0.12.

1326
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,620
Still only $0.20.

1327
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,280
When it hit still only $0.50

1328
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,200
and it was half ads,

1329
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,760
I quit buying comic books.

1330
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,140
Also, I had a kid to support

1331
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,740
and read comic books.

1332
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,920
The price of the comic books

1333
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,960
outpaced the normal

1334
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,100
allotment of ducats and dollars

1335
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,780
that a young child might have.

1336
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,960
So you'd start out

1337
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,500
with 12 books and then

1338
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,460
they'd raise the price and you'd get down to

1339
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,060
$0.07 or $0.08. And then like you said,

1340
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,460
when it was $0.50, well, Jesus, that's half

1341
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,400
my allowance for this week.

1342
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,560
No, I was 18 when it hit $0.50.

1343
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,120
Well, now that those

1344
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,800
children are adults, they find

1345
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,520
that the same comic books are

1346
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,760
still economically out of

1347
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,280
their reach.

1348
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,240
Well, here's the funny thing though.

1349
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,860
All those $0.50

1350
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,520
and dollar comics from

1351
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,860
the 70s

1352
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,440
and 80s,

1353
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,740
my wife inherited from a collector.

1354
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,020
Jeff Rosenbaum,

1355
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,720
who started Starwood,

1356
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,640
was a crazy

1357
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,980
comic book collector also.

1358
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,600
He had Marvels and DCs

1359
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,340
of everything

1360
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,780
from the 70s and 80s and he kept

1361
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,100
them really nicely in these

1362
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,540
plastic and these big comic

1363
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,860
book boxes. He had a room full of them.

1364
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,320
There's a room full of them in Cleveland.

1365
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,900
I managed to grab two boxes

1366
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,440
at random and take to Texas.

1367
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,460
That's one reason my back is destroyed.

1368
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,600
Those boxes were extremely

1369
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,680
heavy and it was the last day before

1370
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,580
we left. It was like there was just enough

1371
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,740
room left in the car to get some

1372
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,820
comic books in. Have you looked in the box

1373
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,920
yet? Oh, the box, we managed

1374
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,520
to get the box into the house and

1375
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,800
I even read a whole bunch of the Batman

1376
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,420
stuff. I hope they were good.

1377
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,500
They were, but they're still

1378
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,800
there and

1379
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,660
they were jointly

1380
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,660
inherited by my wife and my neighbor

1381
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,640
Joe, but Joe doesn't care about them.

1382
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,800
I don't know how we're ever

1383
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,440
going to get them back to Texas though.

1384
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,200
That's literally

1385
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,900
tons and tons of comics.

1386
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,540
None of which are worth very much.

1387
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,620
Well, ship them at a low rate.

1388
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,480
A low book rate or something.

1389
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,300
Hey, look at this.

1390
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,640
Alright.

1391
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,600
I still haven't scratched

1392
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,740
the one you gave me. Three more dollars.

1393
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,700
I've cleared 40 bucks

1394
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,700
now. Well, I had 30

1395
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,540
to start with and I've gotten another

1396
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,160
10 bucks worth of these things.

1397
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,700
Thank you again.

1398
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,640
I'm going to eat out tonight.

1399
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,500
The luck plane is tilting in your direction,

1400
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,140
Ivanstang.

1401
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,520
This doesn't happen every day.

1402
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,560
It's $10 in payout

1403
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,940
tripler lottery cards.

1404
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,560
Well, that's how much one would have to pay.

1405
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,020
That's how I know how much they are.

1406
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,100
You don't rub it again.

1407
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,160
I'm about to rub

1408
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,820
one of them myself.

1409
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,900
Oh, this is exciting.

1410
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,760
That's an excellent

1411
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,860
scratching technique, Dr. Howell.

1412
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,460
It seems efficient

1413
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,220
and yet

1414
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,640
adventurous.

1415
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,500
Well, actually, whenever I have

1416
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,760
an opportunity to scratch something like

1417
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,700
this, which I find irritating

1418
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,600
and unnecessary, I

1419
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,520
actually use a little metal picture

1420
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,880
of Bob that is the perfect

1421
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,860
scratcher. But I don't

1422
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,600
have that with me.

1423
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,840
I hope it doesn't hurt the luck

1424
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,280
involved. It's made at

1425
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,940
Tucson Trade Engraving and it's engraved

1426
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,740
on metal and it's a reverse

1427
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,980
image of Bob.

1428
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,560
I just put these things,

1429
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,760
I tuck them into my dog's ear and then

1430
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,500
he scratches them with his hind leg.

1431
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,360
Let the dog do it.

1432
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,860
Boy, those German Shepherd

1433
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,700
puppies have turned out to be a bit of a

1434
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,140
terror in that they

1435
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,820
they're right at the age where they

1436
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,780
want to see what

1437
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,700
things taste like, especially

1438
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,680
if they've been handled by me. They know,

1439
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,740
they seem to know it for a long time

1440
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,440
that stuff on the floor was

1441
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,600
fair game, but things on

1442
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,740
shelves were daddy stuff, don't mess

1443
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,540
with them. But then they got more

1444
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,600
adventurous and they tasted

1445
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,380
several

1446
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,920
video game controllers.

1447
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,740
They really like those. How old are

1448
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,840
the pups now? They're about seven months now.

1449
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,800
So they're going through

1450
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,500
secondary teething right now

1451
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,640
and I would get a wash rag and

1452
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,880
get it wet and put it in

1453
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,620
the freezer and give them that to chew

1454
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,760
because they're looking around for things to

1455
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,820
chew now because it relieves

1456
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,220
the massacration.

1457
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,340
They've got tons of stuff to chew.

1458
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,140
My house is covered

1459
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,480
with dog toys and cat toys

1460
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,700
and stuff. And we give them

1461
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,660
new ones all the time, but you know, they want

1462
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,020
a taste of furniture. The fossils.

1463
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,680
Yeah, actually

1464
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,760
I did one of the... You wouldn't think

1465
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,560
a dog would give a hoot about a fossil.

1466
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,660
I wouldn't. Daddy's been playing

1467
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,620
with them. I want to check it out. German Shepherds are great

1468
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,660
dogs and they're so inquisitive and

1469
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,060
so intelligent and

1470
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,800
you're just going to have a whole awesome time

1471
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,820
up ahead of you. Especially as they

1472
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,860
mature a little bit and they take

1473
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,060
on their shepherd personas.

1474
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,640
Well a good dog or a good

1475
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,760
cat will teach you why you

1476
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,900
want a dog or a cat in the first place.

1477
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,380
Because they're so

1478
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,900
sympathetic and empathetic and

1479
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,920
they're far more than you ever believed

1480
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,140
possible and so

1481
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,720
from then on you want every dog and

1482
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,920
cat to hit that high standard.

1483
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,640
And they often don't.

1484
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,200
Well,

1485
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,860
those dogs are going to have some real treats waiting for them.

1486
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,860
Tomorrow morning. Very good.

1487
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,640
Now you'll

1488
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,640
circle back to get everybody

1489
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,780
at the ranch, right?

1490
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,140
That's what I said. The first thing I'm going to do,

1491
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,340
7-0-5 is get the... Because they're

1492
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,600
pining for me. Princess Wee said

1493
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,700
that Claudia's just going...

1494
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,560
She just stares out the window waiting.

1495
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,760
I tried to talk to her on

1496
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,680
FaceTime yesterday but it didn't work.

1497
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,840
So yeah, first thing I'm going

1498
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,780
to do is beam up my lonesome

1499
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,840
dogs and give them

1500
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,100
something to play with. And then we?

1501
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,800
Yeah, and then my wife.

1502
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,760
And then I'll see if my kids... I want to just see

1503
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,680
if my kids automatically get beamed up

1504
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,760
or if their faithlessness leaves

1505
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,560
them down there.

1506
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,640
But just for the sake of my

1507
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,200
grandkids, I'll go ahead and

1508
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,900
probably beam up the whole gang.

1509
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,580
You're a better man than me because I was

1510
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,440
going to go, you know, tool around

1511
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,880
a little bit to get the feel of the saucer

1512
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,460
before I went back to get carrots.

1513
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,360
You won't have to. You don't think so?

1514
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,540
No, everything will be automatic.

1515
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,000
Everything will be automatic.

1516
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,140
Anywhere on and in an instant.

1517
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,800
One will know before you think of it

1518
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,720
what you want. Or as you're thinking

1519
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,700
of it, it will pick

1520
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,440
up on it. I always want to say, she.

1521
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,620
Just like the government.

1522
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,020
Yeah, kind of.

1523
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,660
Well, that's not the

1524
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,620
problem with it, you know. After a while

1525
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,820
you're going, no, this is too perfect. I'm freaking out.

1526
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,160
That's the

1527
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,560
phase we don't tell everybody about.

1528
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,200
All I want is a thought to myself

1529
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,800
in my own mind.

1530
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,320
Do you want to know the secret of how to deal with that?

1531
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,920
That's a very important secret.

1532
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,500
What's that, Dr. Howe?

1533
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,700
The secret is that you also put a

1534
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,660
spell on yourself

1535
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,740
so that you don't know all these

1536
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,680
things you arranged are going to happen

1537
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,380
to you and you can just think

1538
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,920
you're very lucky and so on. Every now and then

1539
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,780
you get a reminder. But in

1540
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,800
your case, you see, you don't

1541
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,420
let yourself know

1542
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,940
that everything is perfect.

1543
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,760
Now that is a brilliant tip

1544
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,860
from the keeper of the mystic

1545
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,860
secrets of the Church of the Sun. That's why everybody

1546
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,940
goes wrong who makes a deal

1547
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,680
with the devil or whatever

1548
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,740
because you cannot

1549
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,920
take satisfaction when you know the game

1550
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,200
is rigged in your favor.

1551
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,580
So first you rig it in your favor

1552
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,840
and then you create

1553
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,660
limited oblivion for yourself

1554
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,760
so you can enjoy it

1555
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,900
as if it's your actual

1556
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
just desserts.

1557
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,780
And you forget that you sold your soul.

1558
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,920
Yes, which is also good

1559
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,100
because you don't fret about it all the time.

1560
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,060
That takes it off your mind.

1561
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,580
You can worry about that later

1562
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,180
when the devil takes you to hell

1563
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:48,940
for eternity.

1564
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,780
He rises up through the floor at an inconvenient

1565
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,180
time and holds the document

1566
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,080
and reminds you and so forth.

1567
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,020
And you have to beg and wheedle

1568
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,180
for a little more time.

1569
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,100
I know they say hell's

1570
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,740
going to be bad but

1571
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,520
what if it's not?

1572
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,060
What if it's like super awesome and all your friends

1573
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:08,580
are there?

1574
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,780
I'm glad I'm not involved in any of that stuff

1575
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,860
because I'll be on the pleasure saucer. But I want

1576
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,000
to know what you think about it.

1577
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,460
I wonder about all the other people.

1578
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,580
Jack T. Chick denies it.

1579
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,660
However, isn't it part of the subgenius

1580
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,780
lore that the

1581
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,660
Christian heaven is subgenius hell

1582
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,760
or something like that?

1583
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,300
You have to have

1584
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,180
subgenius hell as practice

1585
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,420
for subgenius heaven.

1586
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,400
They're both fun

1587
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,180
but subgenius heaven is so

1588
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,140
fun you'd lose your mind

1589
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,760
if you didn't go through boot camp.

1590
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,320
You tend to lose your mind

1591
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,340
if you don't go through boot camp.

1592
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,020
Anyway, you have to be able to live with yourself

1593
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,900
forever so the slightest flaw

1594
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,080
becomes of an infinite size.

1595
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,720
So you've got to watch out for that.

1596
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,880
Only the part that is

1597
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,440
worthy of moving on

1598
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,500
to the next dimension

1599
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,260
or whatever.

1600
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:03,900
Look at that.

1601
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,780
The thing that's supposed to protect my hearing aid

1602
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,360
is soaked.

1603
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,240
I'd have to put a new napkin up there every 10 minutes.

1604
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,480
Do you want a new napkin?

1605
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,760
I believe I might have one.

1606
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,240
I'll get one.

1607
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,220
I need to finish this bottle of water

1608
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,240
so that I'll have something to catch the sweat in.

1609
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,580
I can refill it in about five minutes.

1610
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,940
I do like to remind people

1611
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,080
to please stay hydrated.

1612
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,140
You've got to drink some water today.

1613
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,840
We have a lot of fabulous

1614
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,520
barley beverages

1615
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,600
that were donated by the

1616
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,100
Orange Blossom Beer Company

1617
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,480
and they're fabulous.

1618
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,340
We got them ice cold for you

1619
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,340
and we want you to enjoy them

1620
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,860
but we also want to make sure that

1621
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,300
everybody has a good time

1622
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,280
so drink some water.

1623
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,260
Ironically friends, good old Pease himself

1624
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,100
neglected to drink enough water

1625
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,240
even though he remembered to drink enough beer.

1626
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,840
And by the afternoon of July 5th

1627
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,060
he was really messed up.

1628
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,520
But then, what subgenius wasn't?

1629
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,820
Which leads us to our

1630
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,900
closing song by the Swingin' Love Corpses

1631
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,460
a personal fave called

1632
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,640
TFBAB Bummer

1633
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,100
which stands for

1634
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,600
Total F***ing Badass Bummer.

1635
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,700
The version

1636
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,280
heard by the internet audience

1637
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,540
will vary greatly from that

1638
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,140
heard by our beloved

1639
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,900
broadcast radio listeners.

1640
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,660
Afterwards, you must always

1641
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,300
learn everything from

1642
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,420
subgenius.com

1643
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,760
Two hundred thousand people

1644
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,140
killed in an industrial accident

1645
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:46,920
in India

1646
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,980
was a bummer.

1647
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,220
Total bummer.

1648
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,820
Hurricane killed

1649
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,680
25 in Florida

1650
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,780
It's a bummer

1651
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,620
a real damn bummer.

1652
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,440
I'm from Thailand

1653
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,540
I'm from the

1654
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,140
It was a bummer

1655
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,560
TFBAB Bummer

1656
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,800
It was a bummer

1657
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:22,800


1658
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,300
TFBAB Bummer

1659
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,240
There's some bad

1660
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,480
s*** going down

1661
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,560
There's some bad

1662
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:33,560


1663
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,020
There's some bad

1664
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,860
s*** going down

1665
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:43,360
There's some bad

1666
00:57:51,300 --> 00:58:13,340
s*** coming down

1667
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1668
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1669
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1670
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1671
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1672
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1673
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340


1674
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,340
