1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
I think it's working now.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,560
You said that speed of answer is measured mechanically.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,460
Courtesy, however, is not measured mechanically.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,280
It's done by a person known as a service observer.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,540
I'm here.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,460
Hi, Henry. This is the hottest piece of manpower in the world.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,560
Scary, scary, puzzling evidence show.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
Keep the phone on the amplifier.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,140
The power comes so in-quiet.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,400
You sound like him.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,700
I don't even look like him.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Yes, I do feel like him.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
But I'm not him, you understand?

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,660
Papa wasn't so desperate.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,280
What are you desperate for, money?

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,740
Power?

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
Are you reading the bottom line?

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,240
There becomes time.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,060
You are a man.

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,060


21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,060


22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,360
The Soul Genius Hour of Sight.

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,880
What?

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,640
The Soul Genius Hour of Sight

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,420
And the Reverend will be discussing how he came up with a religion and household...

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:17,980
What?

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,000
How he came up with his own religion.

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,500
It's about how Bob...

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,140
Uh...

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
Tuned into the very aethers of the underverse.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,740
You know, and all that's like that there.

33
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,880
Hey, what...

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,220
Who was that lovely voice I just heard giggling and laughing over the collar well?

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,740
I would like to take my pleasure with it.

36
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,800
Oh my God, I...

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,920
You wanted to take...

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,240
Since you walked in here, you've attempted to take your pleasure with five pieces of furniture...

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,680
Two Pepsi cans...

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,100
Those are music.

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,720
One real flesh and blood woman...

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,740
Three guys...

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,760
And a console.

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,640
Could you please...

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
No, it was three...

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,180
But let's get these...

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,740
Two of those furniture pieces were musical instruments.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,360
They were Chaz's experimental classical...

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,260
Zop twangers?

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,260
Yeah, it's twangers.

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,560
And... But still, they're laden with sperm and pieces of other flotsam which come from the insides of your body.

52
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,620
Are you any less guilty, lonesome cowboy Dave?

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,480
Step now before the board of judgment.

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,880
Is it not true that you, lonesome cowboy Dave, on a night in 1994, made jokes about religion?

55
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,660
Play the tape.

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,300
So God is like this big stupid vacuum thing, don't even really exist.

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,400
Ma'am, I bet if I said that in front of some fundamentalists...

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Play that again, wait a minute, play that.

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,820
I could get into a mess of hell.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,600
No, no, no, no, no.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,600


62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,060
What was that?

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,840
Oh boy, God is just like a really big vacuum, it's a bunch of mashed and stuff.

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,620
It's a bunch of flammable...

65
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,380
Wait, once again, I heard it.

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,100
There, right there.

67
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,620
There.

68
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,500
It's a bunch of fundamentalists here.

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,080
Right there.

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,380
Cease playing the tape.

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
We've seen enough.

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:22,260
You, lonesome cowboy Dave, knowingly made satires of organized religion in your brief stay on Earth.

73
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,720
And you missed church several Sundays during your life.

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,920
Do you have anything to say for yourself before the judgment is passed?

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,080
I didn't mean to mangle the person in my briefs.

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,040
I tried to do, I didn't know if it was...

77
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,100
Enough!

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,780
Recording angels, does his name appear in the book of humans?

79
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,900
Nay, Lord.

80
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,580
Then the judgment is passed.

81
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,240
Nay, Lord.

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,680
Cast him into the lake of naked women.

83
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,300
No, no, wait a minute.

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,840
Wait, no, wait.

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,620
Naked women.

86
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,240
Oh, wait, okay, alright.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,940
Ah, so that is what he wanted.

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,940
Now we know the truth.

89
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,200
Toss him into the lake of fire and be done with it.

90
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,140
No, wait a minute, please.

91
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,220
Call the next lost soul.

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
No, you have no more repentance now, Dave.

93
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,380
And you're married now to that hideous demon.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,240
That bewarted, three-teeted demon.

95
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,020
You're a monstrous toad-like abhorrence.

96
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,120
I'm so happy.

97
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,380
Robbing and hopping fitfully in the dank pit for eternity.

98
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,420
Oh, thank you.

99
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,660
I'm so happy.

100
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:41,060
I now pronounce you tormented in hell eternally, soul and wife.

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,100
Oh, thank you, Reverend.

102
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,860
I smell bad, sir.

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,460
Could I please?

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,960
Could I please requisition the fellowship for a small order of requisite to something

105
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
that smells better than all this stuff?

106
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,680
We'll put you on the waiting list.

107
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,360
Well, I guess we'll just see y'all next week.

108
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,660
That's gonna be it for another week's show, kids.

109
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,560
I'd like to thank my guests, Reverend Ivan Stang, the Princess We Are Doe, Lonesome Cowboy

110
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,760
Dave, Psychopath Finder, and my apprentice for doing the first half hour of the show,

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,520
Keith.

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,860
So, um, I guess we'll see y'all next week.

113
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,420
You guys can babble the rest of the show away, so go right ahead.

114
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,440
Come back next week for the show.

115
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


117
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


118
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


119
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


120
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


121
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


123
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


124
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


125
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,440


126
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm gonna watch Bob Chow for a lucky radio comedy.

127
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,920
It'll tickle your funny bones.

128
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,280
Next week?

129
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,560
Oh, boy.

130
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,200
It'll be more fun than a barrel full of monkeys.

131
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,340
My kneecaps are crushed.

132
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,400
Die.

133
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,620
Oh, boy.

134
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:10,840
Oh, boy.

135
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,360
Oh, boy.

136
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,860
Oh, boy.

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,140
Oh, boy.

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,360
Oh, boy.

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,360


140
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,360


141
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,360


142
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh, boy.

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,940
Oh, boy.

144
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,940


145
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,940


146
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,940


147
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,940


148
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,940


149
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:19,940


150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:33,460
No gets it

151
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,680
charm.

152
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,320
You can launch these.

153
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,100
Oh, I don't have the

154
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,480
script. I

155
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,580
I think

156
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,540
they're 50 cents.

157
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,740
They're all

158
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,920
a bunch of fakes.

159
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,140
I've had enough of this.

160
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,940
They're all a bunch of fakes.

161
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,740
Wait a minute.

162
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,660
You forgot your briefcase,

163
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:20,980
man.

164
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
Hey, man.

165
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,020
What about these heads?

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,200
Hey, man.

167
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,660
Hey, man.

168
00:08:36,660 --> 00:09:06,600
Hey, man.

169
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,000
Rush.

170
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,320
I send greetings from Chepuchescu, from fascist heaven where he earned his wings.

171
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,100
They say there's still lots of room here for Bill Clinton and his highness, Dung Chow Ying.

172
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,500
Many blessings from Chepuchescu.

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,960
May your bloodbath be complete.

174
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Let's bow down to the new world order where oppression and fantasy meet.

175
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm sending greetings from Chepuchescu.

176
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,280
I'm sending greetings from Chepuchescu.

177
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,980
Bartles. Actually, Bartles and Arpad.

178
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,080
There's the credit on that song there.

179
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,840
Greetings from Chepuchescu.

180
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,580
Wonderful new tape from John Bartles.

181
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,460
I think we may actually be able to play most of it over the next few hours of Slack.

182
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,440
Despite the language.

183
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,940
And before that, of course, some brain rot.

184
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,200
On ESO radio.

185
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,840
On WCSB Cleveland.

186
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,980
Starring, in this case, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

187
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,040
And Chaz Smith mixing.

188
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,280
And it's always fun to take Lonesome Cowboy Dave to hell.

189
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,120
He's such a simpleton.

190
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,220
He's such a sap.

191
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,040
He's such an easy mark.

192
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,020
You know what I mean?

193
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
And we'll get back to that.

194
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,800
There's some...

195
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Some just frolicking fun and games on those tapes.

196
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,900
I did want to mention a couple of things.

197
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Oh, this background sound is from a CD that was sent to us by Chris Korda.

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,200
It's called Demons in My Head by Chris Korda.

199
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,380
And where is the letter he sent with it that explained that it really did have demons on it?

200
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,340
It really is about demons.

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,760
But for right now, I don't want to talk about demons.

202
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,860
No.

203
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,320
But about video cameras in cop cars.

204
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,280
Apparently, since Texas started putting video cameras in our cop cars.

205
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,200
Maybe it was Dallas.

206
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,760
I don't know.

207
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,900
It's now become very common.

208
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,140
And the police all over the place are putting video cameras there.

209
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,460
So that they can get a good record of what actually happened.

210
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,660
And you'd think it would.

211
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,720
It would be a good idea.

212
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,540
And it certainly is.

213
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,900
I mean, if you think about it.

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,440
There's...

215
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Cameras on Cops is big time showbiz now, folks.

216
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,320
Wait a minute.

217
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

218
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,760
That background music was not supposed to happen that way.

219
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,660
Okay.

220
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,760
That's queued up enough.

221
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,620
It was supposed to be this background music.

222
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,600
Nerd Twins.

223
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,300
There.

224
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,560
Yeah.

225
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,980
Cameras on Cops.

226
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,660
It's...

227
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,640
All these TV shows.

228
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,020
And you know, in the science fiction world.

229
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,900
They've always had the ultra-violence channel.

230
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,140
If you know what I mean.

231
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,640
Like in THX 1138.

232
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,540
And Clockwork Orange.

233
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,900
And World of the Future.

234
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,700
And just about any proper dystopian sci-fi movie.

235
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,280
The people always have a sex channel and a violence channel.

236
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,180
Well, um...

237
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,640
Channel 21?

238
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,280
27?

239
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:24,860
33?

240
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,040
In the evening?

241
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,500
You know, turn it on any day.

242
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,080
You'll get one of those cop or rescue shows.

243
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,800
Which means the camera strapped to the helmet.

244
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,040
It's my daughter's favorite shows.

245
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,460
It's...

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
You know, strap that camera on the cop.

247
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,420
And go in there after a boy's kicking doors down.

248
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
Hauling the drug dealers out of bed.

249
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,340
Breaking up the Pobucker family fights and all that.

250
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,020
All the poor drunken Pobuckers who you know sign a release.

251
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,300
Those idiots sign a release.

252
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,620
It's their big chance.

253
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,820
You know, they're thinking about...

254
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,980
I guess when they sign it, they're thinking about Geraldo.

255
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,420
Burying their sins.

256
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
It's their 15 minutes of fame.

257
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,840
But it's part of that ultra-violence channel.

258
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,440
And...

259
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,220
I don't know, friends.

260
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,080
I think I've been reading too many science fiction books.

261
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,080
Um...

262
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,360
I've read about 4 or 5 in a row now that were written only recently.

263
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,940
Like 5 or 10 years ago.

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,800
And they're supposed to detect now.

265
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,980
The 1990s.

266
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,980
Those are really fun ones to read.

267
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,600
Because the horrible thing is, they really do depict now.

268
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,420
They're pretty accurate.

269
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,600
And they're supposed to be real scary.

270
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,140
You're supposed to read them and just react with disgust and dread.

271
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,560
And instead, you just kind of go, huh.

272
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,440
Well, gosh, that science fiction writer was right.

273
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,280
Funny.

274
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,400
You know, now that all that terrible stuff is happening, it just seems kind of normal.

275
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,300
Um...

276
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,620
Um...

277
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,880
I've read End of the World News by Anthony Burgess.

278
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,200
And also The Wanting Sea by Anthony Burgess.

279
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,300
Who's famous for Clockwork Orange.

280
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:12,120
John Bruner has several of those 1990s, more or less, sci-fi books.

281
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,000
Written on some of them 20 years ago.

282
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,480
Children of Thunder.

283
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,380
Stand on Zanzibar.

284
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,180
And The Sheep Look Up.

285
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,840
Are all kind of old classics now.

286
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,780
What else?

287
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,100
Um...

288
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,420
Nature's End by Whitley Stryber.

289
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,640
And War Day.

290
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,540
And you read these.

291
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:35,920
I end up saying to myself, yeah, well, I know this is supposed to be dystopian science fiction warning about the perils to come.

292
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,180
If we continue in this ridiculous, greedy path humanity is taking.

293
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,180
And we did continue.

294
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,140
And now we're right in the middle of those perils to come.

295
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,780
And we're perfectly used to them.

296
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,480
I mean, there is a terrible ecological or human disaster on the news every day.

297
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,080
Several every day.

298
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,820
And thousands of new laws designed to cramp your personal freedoms bit by bit.

299
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,900
So you don't even notice when they're gone.

300
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,180
And it all comes off as boring current affairs.

301
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,160
You know, or at best, a techno-thriller sort of a setting.

302
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,600
And it's supposed to be terrifying sci-fi of awful things that just might possibly come true.

303
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,860
Were the human race stupid enough to let those things happen even after reading those sci-fi?

304
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,080
I mean, you know, there's a lot of sci-fi books.

305
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,580
And, um, oh, J.R. Bob Dobbs used to write sci-fi as a hobby.

306
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,400
Um, Dobbstown University Press.

307
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,840
They're pretty hard to get a hold of.

308
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,500
But, uh, and a lot of my friends write near-future sci-fi, you know.

309
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:52,240
And does that mean that the absurd baloney that we come up with thinking, oh, it's going to be so funny and satirical.

310
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,740
But kind of grisly and scary.

311
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,840
At the same time.

312
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh, boy.

313
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,460
I mean, friends.

314
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,940
Think about it.

315
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:08,880
What if, what if the Yakatisma do get here before the Axis?

316
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,460
Just think about that, my friend.

317
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,260
And, uh.

318
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,700
Oh, here's one last, um.

319
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,560
Before we go to any deeper, I think.

320
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,880
Into, um.

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,840
The, the hilarious comedic thing.

322
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,760
We'll do one more piece of, uh.

323
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,260
Oh, socially relevant.

324
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah, this is socially relevant music.

325
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,520
It really is.

326
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,000
Applies to subgeniuses.

327
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
This is, uh.

328
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,860
Lost Souls Incorporated.

329
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,680
Who, by the way, they're a Dallas band.

330
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,060
They're going to be playing at Commerce Street Bar on April 1st.

331
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,820
Really.

332
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,060
April 1st.

333
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,220
They really will be there.

334
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,060
Uh-huh.

335
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,540
The District Attorney in Abilene

336
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,580
Found the First Amendment a little obscene

337
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,300
So he burnt the Constitution

338
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,840
To meet his prime.

339
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,060
And, um.

340
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,480
Last week, he gave back

341
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,500
to the West

342
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,620
Uh-huh.

343
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,880
That's a Hands-Up.

344
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,380
Uh-huh.

345
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,600
So.

346
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,020
Well, uh.

347
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,780
It's gonna be a complete mess 1300 on April 1st.

348
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,120
about

349
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,700
and I don't know if I'm more angry

350
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,780
or scared when my father says

351
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,720
son these days you gotta take care

352
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,440
you gotta watch what you say

353
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,780
who you say it to and this world

354
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,940
was never fair

355
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,780
so don't ask me where I

356
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,760
stand am I

357
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,660
trying to change this

358
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,380
world

359
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,040
the huddled masses

360
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,340
in Hymie town been up to their

361
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,260
necks in shit so long they never

362
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,280
sit down and you can't walk

363
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,380
the streets without bodyguards around

364
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,460
it's a problem

365
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,520
yeah

366
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,740
so some anal retentives

367
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,640
on prudent committees stated

368
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,240
these so called artists and those who

369
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,040
pen ditties are the cause of this

370
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,280
violence despite their insistence

371
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,000
that those songs are merely

372
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,560
symptoms

373
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,020
well we'll round them up next week to teach

374
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,080
them a lesson we'll read them Miranda

375
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,120
let them know that they're messing with

376
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,860
the toughest God fearing Christian

377
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,960
upstanding people in the world

378
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,860
yeah let's get them

379
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,900
and I quiver with anger

380
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,980
as I watch the news and I

381
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,040
worry if Dan rather share

382
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,120
in their views and I grow very

383
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,060
quiet till I hardly

384
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,120
utter a word

385
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,440
of it

386
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
when you

387
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,280
ask me where I stand

388
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,660
am I trying to change this

389
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,340
world

390
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,720
do you wanna have to teach your children

391
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,020
to self censor all they say

392
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,200
and will I

393
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,660
still be trying to read Solzhenitsyn

394
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,320
when they

395
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,180
throw the key away

396
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
unless I

397
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,680
pack my bags for the relative liberty

398
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,080
of where had been East Berlin

399
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,260
and is there

400
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,100
really only so much freedom to go around

401
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,240
we had to forfeit ours for them

402
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,340
do you think so

403
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,900
I don't think so

404
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,940
no oh no

405
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,520
but the irony

406
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,620
cannot escape me so

407
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,800
whatever you do

408
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,820
don't ask me where I stand

409
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,080
am I trying to

410
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,100
change the world

411
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,380
don't ask me where I stand

412
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,940
am I trying

413
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,680
to change this

414
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,580
If I knew what there was going to be

415
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,780
ibilitating your future

416
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,260
that I tried

417
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,020
without fear

418
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,200
we would never rebuild

419
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,180
I must lose my head

420
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,780
There's one thing exciting me a year

421
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,720
YES!

422
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,740
HAHAHAHAHA!

423
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

424
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Done as if by order.

425
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,420
Heathen men sacked God's church at Lindisfarne.

426
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,420
Thomas is dead.

427
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,740
Ha, ha, laugh, curtain old boy.

428
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,860
It's a great joke played on us by the Lord or fate or nature,

429
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,460
whatever you prefer, on whoever, whatever brain is,

430
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,500
certainly in a sense of humor.

431
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,200
There was also a nun there, Prioresse,

432
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,520
that of his smiling was full simple and coy.

433
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,800
Her greatest ooth was but by center loy.

434
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,720
The first around Tampico, wait for it.

435
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,300
Watch your ears.

436
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,080
And this is the country where the nuggets of gold

437
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,320
are just crying for you to take them out of the ground.

438
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,620
Gosh, spam sandwich eating man,

439
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,900
it seems like we've been waiting for our kids here forever.

440
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,440
So have you seen any of the Olympics?

441
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,580
I've seen them.

442
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,860
I saw the thing when Bob was dressed as a woman

443
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,640
and did it a routine.

444
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,980
I thought I saw Bob doing the aerial flipping thing.

445
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,820
Twist flips with the skis on and stuff.

446
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,920
That was something to behold, that cute little dress,

447
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,840
that cute little skirt and those flashy legs and hyper buttocks

448
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,480
and that silly ass stupid pipe smoking face.

449
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,460
No wonder.

450
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,900
It took all the judges by surprise.

451
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,740
What a routine.

452
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,700
I was.

453
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I was kind of thrilled and inspired.

454
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,880
Well, you know why they gave him that high score

455
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,300
was when he skated around and that little parasol he had

456
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,760
that he had like tucked up in his tutu part of the time.

457
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,620
I like that.

458
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,620
And he pulled out the parasol and twirled it a couple of times

459
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
and then it turned like into a hammer

460
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,940
and he went over there to Tonya Harding

461
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,020
and hit her forcefully on the knee with that hammer.

462
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,520
You know, and then God Bless America played

463
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,880
and they brought out the Olympics.

464
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,640
I cried.

465
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,360
Killed her and then they fined him.

466
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,600
Yeah, it was.

467
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,640
It made my nipples awful hard, I'll tell you.

468
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,520
Of course, my nipples are always awfully hard.

469
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,880
Yeah, but they're not very big.

470
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,240
I know, but they're.

471
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,360
Come on now, admit it.

472
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,700
They're dinky.

473
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,320
They're like men's nipples.

474
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,540
Well, they're like raisins.

475
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,720
Of course, they're very small.

476
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm not bragging.

477
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm just talking.

478
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,420
They're like teats on a hog.

479
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,800
Teats on a hog.

480
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,600
It's quite poignant, actually.

481
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,180
Hello?

482
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,500
That's a beautiful illusion.

483
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,460
I like teats on a prairie squid.

484
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,080
I think they would be much, much, much, much tastier.

485
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,360
No, because teats on a prairie squid have a function.

486
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,860
Whereas teats on a male hog are useless.

487
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,760
That's the origin of the old southern metaphor.

488
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,380
Now, a prairie squid.

489
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,700
Well, what would you say, a bull hog?

490
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,360
A prairie squid without teats.

491
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,280
I don't know what the hell you do with them.

492
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,540
Millions and thousands of tiny teats,

493
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,780
like little rupturing cups surrounding our foreheads

494
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,560
in the middle of the night.

495
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,640
Sometimes we can't wake up because of it.

496
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,360
Oh, okay.

497
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,720
What you do is you pet the squid.

498
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,440
You take it and you tickle it and pet it and squeeze.

499
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,940
And it starts to ooze from those little tiny teats,

500
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,660
the stuff that looks like rubber cement.

501
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,220
Oh, yeah.

502
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,120
You take a glass slide or something

503
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,860
and you scrape it along the little teats.

504
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,480
And you let it dry for like a couple hours.

505
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,900
And then you can roll it up in little balls.

506
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,480
Tasty, tasty.

507
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,180
And you put it in the little pipe

508
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,380
and you can smoke the prairie squid toxic teat secretion.

509
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,300
So the lactic expressions of that squid monster

510
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,000
are actually smokable from?

511
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,400
Yeah, that actually made the papers.

512
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,020
I learn something every day.

513
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,940
That made the papers, but they used toads instead.

514
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,480
They said it was toads instead of prairie squids.

515
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,100
Now, what's the difference, though, actually,

516
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,520
between a toad and a prairie squid?

517
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,060
I've heard as a southern anachronistic euphemism

518
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,400
that a toad and a prairie squid are just the same thing

519
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
as one of them big old bullfrog toads.

520
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,220
That's what a prairie squid is.

521
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,140
I lied, didn't I?

522
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,320
I forget sometimes that I'm in a big city.

524
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,680
You know, you sophisticated people know everything about...

525
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,400
That's like saying,

526
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,420
oh, what's the difference between a beautiful woman and a...

527
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,840
Donut?

528
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,080
Yeah, donut.

529
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,420
Well, no, there's not all...

530
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,500
More like an old, stinky, broken ironing board in a junk pile.

531
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,420
That's like the difference

532
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,400
between those two.

533
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,020
I'm cracks flustered, though.

534
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,200
Which side is it on?

535
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,020
Now, I know it was amphibian, but a prairie squid...

536
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,880
No, a prairie squid is a cephalopod.

537
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,320
Oh, I thought it was a hydropod.

538
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,620
A toad is an amphibian,

539
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,740
and a prairie squid is just like a regular ocean-going squid.

540
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,620
Only...

541
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,160
You kiss the squid enough, it will turn into a toad.

542
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,580
Yeah, you kiss the squid enough...

543
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,040
Well, see, then there you've got the idea of the original succubus

544
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,640
and the original incubus,

545
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,720
because when the great fairies came down from the Beyond Realm kingdom

546
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,000
and suckled all the maidens...

547
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,260
You want to fancy it up with all that big, highfalutin scientific terminology,

548
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,020
sure, but that takes all the spontaneity out of it.

549
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,700
What about plain old prairie squid?

550
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,520
Is nothing more than a plain old prairie squid?

551
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,620
There's nothing wrong with a young man or a young lady

552
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,540
taking their favorite pet prairie squid up in the hayloft

553
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,180
and with some big red straps and a little tactical nuclear weapon

554
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,220
and having just a good old-fashioned romp in the hay

555
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,740
with their little shaved cephalopod.

556
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,000
You know...

557
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,680
Now, have you ever done slugs?

558
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,940
You know, slugs are attracted to beer,

559
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,380
and what you do is you dip it...

560
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,360
Oh, Christ, no wonder they're...

561
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,100
I'm not going to get into too much detail,

562
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,140
but basically you dip it in the beer

563
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,940
and then you drop it through a hole in the back porch or something

564
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,940
and just wait for them slugs, and they love beer.

565
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,120
Well, I...

566
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,160
I...

567
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,160


568
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,080
You just lay there about half an hour before, you know,

569
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,440
you'll be covered with them.

570
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,580
That's what I noticed while my belly was covered with slugs.

571
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,080
I wondered what had happened,

572
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,360
if there'd been maybe some kind of metabiological change in my body,

573
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,000
if something had...

574
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,900
It was some dribbling beer down on your belly,

575
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,380
and those little slugs come up.

576
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,080
Well, I think some of the beer was, like,

577
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
was expanding through my pores,

578
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,820
was actually coming out of me,

579
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,940
and I think that's what the slugs got onto.

580
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,580
They got a whiff of that, and they came running for miles, buddy.

581
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll tell you.

582
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,040
You just dropped your beer bottle.

583
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,020
I was like, don't do that.

584
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,040
I can't keep my...

585
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,240
I told you about this.

586
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,840
Oh, man.

587
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,540
You heard the aphorism about the man with the withered...

588
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm sorry.

589
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,400
If I can have one more, I promise I won't drop it.

590
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,940
Don't drop the bottles around.

591
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I won't drop...

592
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,580
Oh, dang.

593
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,000
That's not me.

594
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm sorry about what I did to your radio station, you guys.

595
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,480
I...

596
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,500
I hope that they...

597
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,040
Man, this is pretty unprofessional.

598
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,300
I hope you don't get in trouble

599
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,560
for having a...

600
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh, Dave, be careful.

601
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,120
I fell down.

602
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,160
Liquid frog.

603
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,900
My legs.

604
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,320
Lick it up.

605
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,040
My knees feel all rubbery.

606
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,860
Can you lick up your guitar, dude?

607
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,920
I'll try.

608
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,420
I'll try and help you.

609
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,700
Stop on the slugs.

610
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,380
They're my friends.

611
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,660
He's in a peri-squid.

612
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,680
They're my little friends, my slugs.

613
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,300
Chef Lepaud...

614
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,180
I love them.

615
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,240
...gave birth to the tiny, tiny microworlds.

616
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,740
Millions and billions of microworlds expanding.

617
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,800
It was a cephalopod who did it first.

618
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,020
A shrimpy-shrimper, a shrimpy-shrimper or a mollusk.

619
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,960
Or maybe a one-celled uniquag.

620
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,380
Uniquag.

621
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:25,380


622
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:25,580
Uniquag.

623
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


624
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


625
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


626
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


627
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,580


628
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,720
Uniquag.

629
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:25,780
Uniquag.

630
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,000
Uniquag.

631
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,040
Uniquag.

632
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,300
Uniquag.

633
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,320
Uniquag.

634
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,340
Uniquag.

635
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,200
Uniquag.

636
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,240
Uniquag.

637
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,280
Uniquag.

638
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,580
Uniquag.

639
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,420
Uniquag.

640
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,520
Uniquag.

641
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,600
Uniquag.

642
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,820
Saigon!

643
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,960
Saigon!

644
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,920
I am this world on this planet Earth.

645
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,580
This is a top secret tape.

646
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,280
I am the man, Jesus Christ, and God, as the late President John F. Kennedy said,

647
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,880
as referred to by shouting out loud, that we have control of the mind, shaking all over.

648
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,760
That's us, friends! We got it, finally!

649
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,100
Uh, there was a Jane-er Nguyen, and...

650
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,640
Now take Mr. Crawfish right in your hand...

651
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, take that crawfish.

652
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,820
Dear friends, and take some potatoes.

653
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,760
This is the potatoes from right here in lovely Dallas, Texas.

654
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,560
Thank you.

655
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,860
Hey, man, your underwear is showing!

656
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,640
One, two, three, four!

657
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,500
And five.

658
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,240
The rampaging line of Judah.

659
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,520
.

660
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,520


661
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,740
.

662
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,860
.

663
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,380
.

664
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,480
.

665
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,640
.

666
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,680
.

667
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:49,760
.

668
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,920
I and I

669
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,980
Rastaman

670
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,060
Not the big man

671
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,260
The big

672
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,540
Oh yeah

673
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,240
Rastaman

674
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,740
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen

675
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,320
Here are the potatoes from Dallas

676
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,340
Can we get five more

677
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,020
Fine Richard Dobbs

678
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,800
Made out of that good

679
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,180
Miss Honey

680
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,540
You're on your way north

681
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,140
I reckon we can't blame him too much

682
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,900
What do you mean

683
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,080
I mean he's not a real killer as killers go

684
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,060
I think he's on as the next fella

685
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:24,940
Almost

686
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,720
He's not only going to get me a whole lot of time

687
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,820
And you ain't going

688
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,200
But we'll be up to it

689
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,540
We need money too

690
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,840
How much is the pay

691
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,100
You pay shows

692
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,540
Oh

693
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,220
Hey, did I know you from someplace?

694
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,720
Nobody respects me except for those slugs.

695
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,380
Well, you're a dick.

696
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,080
Look at this.

697
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,840
Look at the shape you're in.

698
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Where's my little conservative body?

699
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,740
Well, for crying out loud, you just vomit stained and your hair's all mushed up.

700
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,120
Why could anybody respect you anyway?

701
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,800
That's pretty funny, isn't it?

702
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
No, that's not funny.

703
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,160
Gigi Allen was my friend.

704
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,460
I married Gigi Allen.

705
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,980
I love Gigi.

706
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,420
And Jane-er.

707
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,840
Jane-er and Gigi.

708
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,200
They were anything for a lady.

709
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,940
They were a laugh trio.

710
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,900
If Jane-er could see you now with your pants all urine-stained and your stubbly beard,

711
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,280
I don't think anybody would be proud of you then.

712
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,340
Oh, screw Bob.

713
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,740
I'm not afraid of Bob.

714
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,340
Chance, could you get in here?

715
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,360
This guy's losing it right in here right now.

716
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,900
I'm not going to preach.

717
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,420
All right, we've got some more questions here.

718
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,960
I've been preaching long enough.

719
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm a farce.

720
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,740
It's a stupid joke.

721
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,500
I'm tired.

722
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,040
Okay, Doug.

723
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,860
I mean, Reverend.

724
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,900
I'm tired of it.

725
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,340
Could you please put your shirt back on for crying out loud?

726
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,580
Hey, Bob, you can take a bite out of this.

727
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,620
Don't go by the window, please.

728
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,700
Could somebody get him away from the window?

729
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,020
He's a friend.

730
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,640
Go ahead.

731
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,020
Try to stop me.

732
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Just please come back here from the window a little bit.

733
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,640
You're getting a lot of people very nervous.

734
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,000
Bob's a smart, fine words.

735
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,940
You listeners, Bob's a fat.

736
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,100
I've seen it.

737
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,440
Princess, we are going.

738
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,920
Do you want to help me get this guy away from the window?

739
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,440
The rabbit was already in the hat.

740
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,280
The rabbit was already in the hat, Bob.

741
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,120
I'm full of it.

742
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,460
Stick it in, pull it out.

743
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,140
Stick it in, pull it out.

744
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Don't start crying now.

745
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,100
Don't get all mottled on.

746
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,580
Just come on back to the microphone.

747
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,140
I'm sorry, Bob.

748
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,300
I'm sorry.

749
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,200
It's okay, Bob.

750
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,520
I hope you didn't hear me.

751
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,120
I'm sorry.

752
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,500
We'll get something going again.

753
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:17,960
Listen to this.

754
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,840
I get very emotional.

755
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,940
I get very emotional when I am on Bob.

756
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,420
Excuse me.

757
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,480
I feel very bad right now.

758
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,180
Well, I think I've seen a personal self-defrocking happen right here in our studio.

759
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,120
I don't know if we should go to some calls right now.

760
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,440
If we should just kind of lose the ref for a second.

761
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,940
He looks pretty bad.

762
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,740
No, that's okay.

763
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,600
I'm ready to preach the word of God now.

764
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,200
I mean, Bob, what the hell with you?

765
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,480
Okay.

766
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,500
Wait, what are you doing?

767
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,500


768
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,860
Wow.

769
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,120
Yeah.

770
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,120


771
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
Gotcha.

772
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,780
員!

773
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,260
All right, you sound başlangigy.

774
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,740
Myiu.

775
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:57,740


776
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,680
You guys have no moreт

777
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,040
you do.

778
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,040


779
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,260
THAT's what you got don in希望.

780
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,260


781
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,260


782
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,260


783
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,080
That's not so very big of a deal.

784
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,660
Yeah.

785
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,120
He is.

786
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,120


787
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,220
You get a 19-year qualifications.

788
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,140
blabber Incorrect.

789
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,260
Blabber Incorrect.

790
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,820
You think one of them is nothing but ch commands, but you think it's not so şey or something?

791
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,980
Which one?

792
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,340
Little one.

793
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,120
Oh!

794
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,120


795
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:18,880
allies okay, BTW.

796
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:26,500
time. Bob said that. Bob said that you were a genius sometime. Oh, come on now, Rev. Let's

797
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,020
just, let's just calm down. I know you're all worked up. You've been flying and your

798
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,880
arms are tired and all that other bull crap and everything like that. You're trying to

799
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,860
wind down a little bit before you do your thing. Don't you think it's, it's a little

800
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:46,820
bit absurd for you to behave this way? Connie's a slut too. I don't mind saying it. So you

801
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:55,680
can prove it. I have had experiences with Connie Dobbs and I don't think Mr. Bob Dobbs

802
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:04,540
would be so happy to hear about. Would you Bob? How's your pipe smoking tobacco face?

803
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:15,720
Is Smiling an idiot? He looks like an idiot. I'm sorry, Bob. I'm sorry. I've been working

804
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,460
too hard.

805
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,040
Well, I should say you should be sorry. You humiliated a pregnant woman on the radio and

806
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,700
you cursed all the, all of the elder gods in one mighty sentence.

807
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,040
I did?

808
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,280
I, oh, I think you might have.

809
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,780
I don't remember.

810
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,640
Well, I think you're in one hell of a load of trouble right now, buddy.

811
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,300
I'm sorry. I'm, I'm sorry. I don't usually get like this.

812
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,540
Well, is there something in his contract that says we have to go on with this? If the guy's

813
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,700
blasted, can't we go to something else for a minute?

814
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,420
And maybe you'll get him a coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, carrot.

815
00:38:50,740 --> 00:39:00,160
I think we must look towards Mecca.

816
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,800
I don't know what that's going to do for us.

817
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,740
That big rocket Mecca is nothing but a chunk of hash that fell out of space. Bob told me.

818
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,680
It's a big black chunk of hash and they smoke it, they seep God.

819
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,340
Pull it up.

820
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,080
They seep God.

821
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,660
Well, we have some musclemen here and listeners, and I don't think they would like you referring

822
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:30,000
to the Kaaba stone or the sacred rock which fell and was witnessed by Fatima's veil of

823
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,460
tear bombs as a piece of hash.

824
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,640
Bob was there. He tried it with the Sultan.

825
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,060
Come on, Reverend Stang, you're just, you're, you're, you're so out of whack tonight. You're

826
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,520
just saying anything that comes to your mind. You know, what are you going to give up this

827
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,620
shtick and quit the drinking too, by the way?

828
00:39:52,900 --> 00:40:01,260
Right, Bob? It's the sacred doctrine of verisability. I didn't do it. I wasn't here. You didn't

829
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:01,820
hear that.

830
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,000
Okay, I don't want to be harsh with you, but how long?

831
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,340
I did not say that.

832
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,660
How long can you?

833
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,760
I am not here.

834
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,040
A recovering alcoholic like yourself. Oh, recovering indeed. How long can you, you

835
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,920
expect to spread the gospel, the mission of Bob Dobbs, if you can't even stand on your

836
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,600
own two feet?

837
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,420
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

838
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:35,400
Jesus was the savior that was pure, but he couldn't understand the sinners. And David

839
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:46,040
Koresh, lonesome cowboy David Koresh said to me, son, the new Messiah is a sinner. And

840
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,040


841
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,040


842
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,040


843
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,040


844
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:57,260
then Bob shot him and plugged him good. And then the feds gave him the bag of money. I swear

845
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,260


846
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,900
Are you there, caller?

847
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,740
I didn't have anything to do with it.

848
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,640
Listen there for a second.

849
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,580
Oh, oh, I, whoa. Somebody.

850
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:02,860
Hello?

851
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,760
Are we on the air?

852
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,140
Yes.

853
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,540
I'm sorry. I go ahead.

854
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:05,840
Hello?

855
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,180
Yes. Hello?

856
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,840
Hello?

857
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,020
Yes, you are on the air.

858
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,860
Yes, please be so sweet.

859
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm on the air?

860
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,840
You're all fierce.

861
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,040
Who's that?

862
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,460
Who's all down there?

863
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,220
Get him out of here. Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

864
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,760
Hello?

865
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,980
You're all just a bunch of damn humans.

866
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,020
What?

867
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,220
How dare you? How dare you? A human? What do you mean, human?

868
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,760
Were you guys linked by some kind of Smith genetic wavelength or something? Some kind

869
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,600
of brain fusion?

870
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,700
Yes? Yes, caller.

871
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,760
It's all right.

872
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,900
It's all right.

873
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,580
Your breath smells like pus.

874
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,120
That's all you wanted to tell us.

875
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,540
I just wanted to say what's up.

876
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh, but it's not all right.

877
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,020
It's all right.

878
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,020


879
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,280
It's not all right at all.

880
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,700
Call the police.

881
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,300
Not since the beginning of the days of the egg has it been all right.

882
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,760
No, no, it's never been all right.

883
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,640
The sacred egg.

884
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,780
The sacred holy smoking egg.

885
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,800
They had the sacred egg.

886
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,180
The giant smooth-brained subgenius egg.

887
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,300
At the opening of the Winter Olympics, they had the sacred egg came out and the sacred

888
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,940
bird came out of the sacred egg.

889
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,520
And we...

890
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,360
And then the sacred cook came out and wrung the sacred bird's neck and made the sacred

891
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,640
fried chicken...

892
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,380
On the torch.

893
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,760
And beat them until bored.

894
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,000
The Olympic torch.

895
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,620
The Olympic flame.

896
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,440
The Olympic flamer.

897
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,860
What are they going to add torturing to the Olympics?

898
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
That's what I'm about ready to see.

899
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,420
Olympic-style torture.

900
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,880
And it looks like Garry Fasswell, the tiny little dwarf from Minnesota, has gone three

901
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,100
and a half long hours...

902
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,740
Dwarf throwing is, I think, soon going to be in it.

903
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,660
Each country gets to start a new sport when they get to host the Olympics.

904
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,460
We're talking about actual duration of pain.

905
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,700
It's Sydney, Australia.

906
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:45,980
It'll be a long time.

907
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It'll be the dwarf tossing.

908
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,680
Are we on dwarf tossing again?

909
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,300
The last time I was in town, you guys were talking about that.

910
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,100
This part's been deleted right now.

911
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,720
Thank you.

912
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:03,320
Oh, one of the discarnate ones trying to make their way back to the ether.

913
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,560
That was an inorganic being, I'm sure.

914
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,300
A bean.

915
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,640
I've heard that...

916
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,500
Those have a low level of flatulence and productivity.

917
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,520
They do.

918
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,640
They're spiritual beings.

919
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:15,980
They're not.

920
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:15,980


921
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,260
The more spiritual you are, the less flatulence you are.

922
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,960
They make a spiritual exhalation from your body.

923
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,800
It's like a wave, a waft of spearmint.

924
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,980
It's like a holy myrrh and frankincense smell.

925
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,420
There's no Alpo gravy sauce or any kind of other diseased moment.

926
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,000
It's the kind bob cuts.

927
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,420
It's the kind bob cuts.

928
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,160
Like roses.

929
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,800
And wouldn't we all love to smell the kind bob cuts in our own homes?

930
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,580
And now for limited time only.

931
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:51,800
We can get the kind bob cuts in this little tiny can at any time we open, Reverend, just

932
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,360
like so.

933
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,540
And we have the aromas of Bob's flatulences.

934
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,540
Now, how'd you come up with a brilliant product like this?

935
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,720
What gave you the idea for this marketing thing?

936
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:06,900
Well, we were sitting around one day and Philo, well, he led a Philo, if you know what

937
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,260
I mean.

938
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,980
And Janer said, hey, Bob's out.

939
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,440
And I said, well, I'm not going to do that.

940
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:14,440


941
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,100
And what are you going to do about that?

942
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:26,360
They said, well, if you hadn't, you could produce a heart Thought we'd like you to use

943
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,340
liquid yUM Fest.

944
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:28,340


945
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,220
When you they said you couldn't do it, they went home and just ran away.

946
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,180
God bless you and thank you.

947
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,820
You won't have the chance.

948
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,580
Now this whole thing is a family, so I'm everywhere you would even go to, here we go.

949
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:32,580


950
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,880
for it, but they're the cause you know, we're gonna name this little dog purse, which I

951
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,460
have them for that.

952
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,180
Look, people came and asked me what the heck does Jill's top hat look like, and I said,

953
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,260
that's real.

954
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,420
The他 is from the classic fray we have out there.

955
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:51,740
the drippings from the enlightened holy men and holy actresses.

956
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,560
Holy actresses actually contributed to the Guru Pitta?

957
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,460
Yes, Hypatia Lee.

958
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,440
Hypatia Lee?

959
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:04,180
We have Kita Natividad bottled, and the young one, Tracy Lord, retired.

960
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,280
Oh, my, that would be a pungent, that would be a rather pungent people.

961
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,720
Negative land is stupid.

962
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,660
Christianity is good.

963
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,300
You're anti-Bob.

964
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,380
Anti-Bob?

965
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,740
I am the Reverend Nicodemus.

966
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,240
Why don't you speak to me? Speak to me with your dire knowledge.

967
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,060
What do you got to say? You ain't got no words to speak to me?

968
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,580
Are you a type?

969
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,840
Am I Italian?

970
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,220
Are you a type?

971
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:33,740
No.

972
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,520
Or are you real?

973
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,380
This is a real phone call.

974
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,300
Am I real?

975
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,560
I think, I don't think, I think he's a type.

976
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,600
A type?

977
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,060
I think you're just a loop.

978
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,340
That's your asshole?

979
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,400
You're one of Chaz's loops, aren't you?

980
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,300
I'm the Reverend Nicodemus.

981
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,400
You shall speak to me with respect, young man.

982
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,160
That's pretty clever, Chaz.

983
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,500
Having it sound like he's responding.

984
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,660
We saw the parts go in there perfectly.

985
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,720
You used the multi-index memory bank to pull up a random caller voice.

986
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,100
Are you guys fakies?

987
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,540
Oh, look, he typed a different one in there.

988
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,340
Are you fakies?

989
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,120
Are you a fakie?

990
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,000
A fakie.

991
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,700
He said it twice.

992
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,800
That must be the loop.

993
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,700
Are you a fakie?

994
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,620
I think our Reverend Ivan Stang is the lead fakie.

995
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,060
Yeah.

996
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,220
No, no.

997
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,120
I'm just work.

998
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,520
For the lead fakie.

999
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:15,580


1000
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,220
Why don't you guys talk some knowledge?

1001
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,700
Some knowledge?

1002
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,900
Yes, the knowledge of the ages.

1003
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,960
Some silent knowledge.

1004
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,920
This man thirsts for knowledge.

1005
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,880
How come, how come if you spell Bob backwards, it spells Bob?

1006
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,620
Get him off the air.

1007
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,900
We are about to impart to you the ultimate knowledge.

1008
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,120
Your knowledge.

1009
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,840
Is there a reason for spelling Bob backwards?

1010
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,700
Silent knowledge.

1011
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,920
Now you have three dollars, and you are enlightened.

1012
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,120
Silent.

1013
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,980
That will be twenty dollars.

1014
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,240


1015
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,240


1016
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,540
Silent.

1017
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:00,940
Silent.

1018
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,420
Silent.

1019
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,760
But all I got is three dollars.

1020
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,660
Oh, here we are now.

1021
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,300
Why don't you hold the headphones and I'm gonna go check the tape.

1022
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,400
Okay, I really can't expect this to be a new one.

1023
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1024
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1025
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1026
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1027
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1028
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1029
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,400


1030
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,240
salvation for only $20.

1031
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,260
There's got to be more to it than that.

1032
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,540
Dave, you haven't been in the same room with a female

1033
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,940
in about, what, 30 years now?

1034
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,360
No, I think it's like 24.

1035
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,420
And there's one sitting right on the other side of that microphone.

1036
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,280
Yep, that's right.

1037
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,880
I'm in a room with an actual female now.

1038
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,940
And she's crazy.

1039
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,860
Listen to that voice.

1040
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,920
I know those are the kind you like, though.

1041
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,600
Well, I enjoy laughing as much as the next person

1042
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,680
if you know what I mean.

1043
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,320
Did you know that Stimpy was the originator

1044
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,880
of bottled secretions?

1045
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,340
No, I did not know that Stimpy was your orangutan

1046
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,940
of bottled secretions.

1047
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,780
Yes, yes, it was Stimpy himself, yes.

1048
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,840
And when did this occur?

1049
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,120
Or a crap, whichever you willed.

1050
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,640
This was in the Curseful Lucy universe?

1051
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah.

1052
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,240
Yes, yes, this is the origin of the bottled effluence

1053
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,580
that we have been...

1054
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,600
Incoming.

1055
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,780
...formally incarnating, yes.

1056
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,260
I thought somebody was tapping on my drill helmet.

1057
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,660
Oh, wait a minute, this is the wrong one.

1058
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,980
I'm wearing the wrong one right now.

1059
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,800
Now get the signals better on this one.

1060
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,700
The tapping is coming from within.

1061
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,480
B-O-R-B.

1062
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,600
B-O-R-B.

1063
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,680
Down, my leg.

1064
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,580
Spotty.

1065
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,200
You know, I was wondering,

1066
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,160
if I could ask you a question, Princess Weiradon.

1067
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,220
Yes?

1068
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:41,680
Yes.

1069
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,380
Um, since...

1070
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,440
Since none of these questions like

1071
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,340
the ephemeral nature of radio performance

1072
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,020
or Stimpy or any of that make any...

1073
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,020
or Bob as a woman describe...

1074
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,600
No, I don't like that.

1075
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,940
I'd like to know what, if you may,

1076
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,120
is the diet of the exes?

1077
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,160
And also, how come yetis can't move their scapulas

1078
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,220
because they have a different shoulder blade?

1079
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,100
Oh.

1080
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,320
Have you read about that or heard about that?

1081
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:07,860
Yes.

1082
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,220
That when they turn to a side,

1083
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,040
they have to turn their whole torsos?

1084
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:11,800
Yes.

1085
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:12,740
Yes.

1086
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:13,180
Yes.

1087
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,600
It's quite complex, actually, yes.

1088
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,200
It's a...

1089
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,160
I'm not sure that I'd actually want to broach a subject such as that.

1090
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,240
Now, diet of the exes,

1091
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,740
that is another quite interesting...

1092
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,920
Well, what did I live on?

1093
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,200
Like rotisserie gold chicken and stuff like that, or...

1094
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,840
Parasitic growth...

1095
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,100
Syndrome.

1096
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay, now, I understand now the work you've been doing

1097
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,920
for the Church of the Subgenies for last year,

1098
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,880
as a doctor and dietitian, and also as a loose canon,

1099
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,720
that you've studied the exes' diet for quite a while now,

1100
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,660
and you're quite an expert.

1101
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,420
This...

1102
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,900
They're not flatulent, as the Reverend said,

1103
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,920
because they are spiritual,

1104
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,140
or are the exes unspiritual and therefore flatulent?

1105
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,120
No, I believe the former.

1106
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,400
They are not spiritual, and therefore they are not flatulent.

1107
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,600
So they neither reap nor do they sow,

1108
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,840
and they don't...

1109
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,320
Neither do they fart.

1110
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,400
This is all true.

1111
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,120
I...

1112
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,280
This is all true, yes.

1113
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,500
So then they don't...

1114
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,880
What kind of diet would create such a condition?

1115
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,640
As I said, parasitic growths, mostly parasitic growths, yes.

1116
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,100
Now, are these parasitic growths,

1117
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,860
is there something that you and I could have?

1118
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,060
Or, like, say, you and I would go out for dinner

1119
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,120
or something like that, and spend an evening,

1120
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,260
and, like, there'd be parasitic growths on us

1121
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,040
or something like that?

1122
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,000
No.

1123
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,440
No.

1124
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,040
It's actually not available to us.

1125
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,400
We...

1126
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,040
Because the things that these...

1127
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,180
Parasites grow on are things that we don't have around us.

1128
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,500
Jeez, that's something, because, you know...

1129
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,340
In our mundane world.

1130
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,100
So it's not...

1131
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,440
In the Munda Organ, it's not available right now.

1132
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,380
Actually, no.

1133
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:56,900
I...

1134
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,800
See, because, like, all this yuppie, you know,

1135
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,580
so many things, Ethiopian restaurants, you know,

1136
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,320
and just all this different stuff,

1137
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,100
I was wondering if I could get these parasitic growths somewhere.

1138
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:06,720
No.

1139
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,240
No.

1140
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,200
They're just simply not available.

1141
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,620
How about the, like, say, for instance, the hacha?

1142
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,860
Of my panties.

1143
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,260
Or some other grievous misshapen article on my body.

1144
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,200
Would that perhaps hold them?

1145
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,960
Or, like, contain them for...

1146
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,420
They might be tempted by that, yes.

1147
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,640
But I'm not sure that it would quite sustain them.

1148
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,900
So, there you have it.

1149
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,480
The particular parasitic growths.

1150
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,400
That one growth.

1151
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:33,980
Yes.

1152
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,560
Well, that's just amazing.

1153
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,980
Now, I understand the Reverend Stinkish went to go on duty

1154
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,460
or had to blow his bathroom or something like that,

1155
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,400
laid down on floor four?

1156
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,000
Something like that, yes.

1157
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,320
Yes.

1158
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,340
He was from...

1159
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,120
But why is he...

1160
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,120
Now, I know we should talk about this on the air

1161
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,080
because he's a lovely man and everything,

1162
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,560
but now, don't you think he's drinking too much?

1163
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,860
Well, you see,

1164
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,820
there is an instrument that's being played

1165
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,760
that is a trance-inducing instrument,

1166
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,160
and listeners actually may find themselves,

1167
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,660
without knowing it,

1168
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,080
falling into a deep and very mesmerizing trance.

1169
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,680
And this is what has brought on the drunken behavior,

1170
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,680
Reverend Stank.

1171
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,680
Contrary to what may appear to be a simple alcoholic feeling,

1172
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,760
it's actually a trance.

1173
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,160
So, he hears his bootlet rumbling

1174
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,580
and then just as soon as it passed into his auditory canals,

1175
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,700
he became imbibed as if he'd been drinking.

1176
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,640
Exact amount.

1177
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,020
Oh, crikes, oh, plenty.

1178
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,400
Jesus, Lord.

1179
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,240
So, are we going to become imbibed by hearing this sound, too?

1180
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,840
Because I don't feel no different right now.

1181
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,020
Well, you have to relax and just let it happen,

1182
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,980
and it will happen.

1183
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,720
Well, I suppose I could take a big, deep breath

1184
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,660
in this bottled green area.

1185
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,360
Yes, just take several deep breaths.

1186
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,580
Yes, just let it go.

1187
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,480
Let it flow.

1188
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,240
Oh, yes.

1189
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,640
Yes.

1190
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,440
It's fragrant.

1191
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,160
Starting to feel anything, Dave?

1192
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,620
Starting to feel anything, listener?

1193
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,920
We certainly hope so.

1194
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,260
And if you have entered into that deep trance

1195
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,620
that we try to induce with this show,

1196
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,460
then you will write for the free information

1197
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,800
at the post office box number I'm about to give.

1198
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,300
Ah, yes.

1199
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:32,940
Yes.

1200
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,280
That number to write, dear friends, of course,

1201
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,020
is, uh...

1202
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,380
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306

1203
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,500
in Dallas, Texas

1204
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:57,020
at zip code 75214.

1205
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,640
That's right.

1206
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,920
You can get the free information

1207
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,120
from the Church of the Subgenius

1208
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,360
that explains everything.

1209
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,740
How to come down from that trance

1210
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,400
that has been induced during the last few minutes.

1211
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,020
Uh, once again, that number is...

1212
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,920
Box 140306.

1213
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,900
Dallas, Texas.

1214
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,600
A-7-5-2-1-4.

1215
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,360
And, uh...

1216
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,360
Well, it's getting down late in the show,

1217
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,520
and with, uh, John Bartles to take us away,

1218
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,460
I think we've got to run.

1219
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,740
We've got to run.

1220
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,680
We've got to get out.

1221
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,140
They won't shut up.

1222
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,480
They won't shut their mouth.

1223
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,060
I'm getting claustrophobic,

1224
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,220
hypertension, anaerobic.

1225
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,040
I'm going nuts.

1226
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,440
I'm drinking like a freaking alcoholic.

1227
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,800
I've drank myself to death,

1228
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,000
so quit the freaking crap.

1229
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,300
I'd stop and kick your ass,

1230
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,420
but I need another drink.

1231
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,600
I've got to run.

1232
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,600
I've got to take off.

1233
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,980
You've got to shut your mouth

1234
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,420
before I pour your head off.

1235
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,060
I'd like to stop and kill you,

1236
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,120
but I haven't got the time.

1237
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,340
You are the freaking reason

1238
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,560
that I lost my freaking mind.

1239
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,980
My friends all say I look like I am in a freaking trance.

1240
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,140
I'll come back and kill you

1241
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,360
when I get a freaking chance.

1242
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,560
I've got to run.

1243
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,460
I've got to get out.

1244
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,060
You're driving me crazy.

1245
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,200
Shut your freaking mouth.

1246
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,940
I'm going to come back to get you

1247
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,080
until it's nice and freaking dark.

1248
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,320
I'll chop you up in pieces

1249
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,380
and I'll feed you to the car.

1250
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,680
Your body, it will disappear

1251
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,920
without a freaking trace.

1252
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,220
I'll be doing a big favor

1253
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,300
for the freaking human race.

1254
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,020
I'll be doing a big favor

1255
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,020


1256
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:43,020
for the freaking human race.

1257
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:10,720
I'll be doing a big favor

1258
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,300
for the freaking human race.

1259
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1260
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1261
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1262
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1263
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1264
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1265
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1266
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,300


1267
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,460
Oh, I hate having to appear like that.

1268
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,780
It really is the most tart

1269
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,140
and the noisiest manifestation.

1270
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,880
It's a great joke,

1271
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,760
