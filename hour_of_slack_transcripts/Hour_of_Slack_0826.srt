1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
My name's crazy, honey. What's yours?

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,420
Bernice!

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,840
The Stone Genius.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,060
Our love.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,840
The Stone Genius.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,620
As long as the wind blows and the rains don't come too soon,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
we may live.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,200
That is, if we're not destroyed by other forces.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,800
What other forces?

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,080
Never mind that now.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,720
For now I show thee signs in the heavens

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,920
and signs in the earth.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,700
Blood fetches from the earth.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,480
My lights in the sky

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,700
rebuke thee.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,180
The children of heaven

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,260
and the angels from hell

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,880
are among thee.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,860
Spreading lies and deception.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,600
And we'll take some convincing

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,820
before I believe you're the man.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,360
The man that our church wants

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,480
preaching at us every Sunday.

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,500
I thought we'd all be dead by now.

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:15,960
We're not.

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,520
Even Raddick got out of bed today.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,520
Gives me the creeps.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,960
Logically, he should have been dead by now.

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,460
For deadening his mouth and carrying on the way he did 2,000 years ago,

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,780
that not only crucified,

31
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,240
but crucified him again.

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,480
We'd probably see it on TV.

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,140
I respectfully disagree with that.

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,660
I respectfully disagree with that.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,380
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,660
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,260
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,340
I think that the commonality of the problems and the concerns

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,140
of people all over the world

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,920
should make us brothers and sisters

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
and not adversaries.

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,480
And if you believe that, you'll buy this watch.

43
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,200
Oh, we're dead serious.

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,300
This is all too real, George.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,680
No, the Church of the Subgenius

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
is not incorporated, registered, licensed,

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
certified, approved, or anything

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,860
by any creature of man's so-called state.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,980
It recognizes no head

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,500
except the Dobbs head,

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,300
secular or sacred.

52
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,220
Only that head of Dobbs.

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,600
It recognizes the lordship of Bob

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
as the only sovereign,

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,820
the king of kings, salesman, and judge of all.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,420
It is a missionary effort, you see,

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
to educate both the masses

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,820
and those in high places

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,020
that Bob lives, Bob sells,

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,120
and Bob has a law that should be kept

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,400
obeyed and enforced as a society.

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,140
Well, we're back here

63
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,040
in the Cathedral of Monkeys

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,400
where the children are born,

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,280
full-grown, and can be

66
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,220
completely covered

67
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,880
in every bit of beautiful

68
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,600
hammocks, hairs,

69
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,360
some of them carrying the chicken bones

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,160
they try to eat and swallow

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,540
later in their own table.

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
Is this what the white people are listening to?

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,620
Yeah, this is what the normals and everybody

74
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,780
they're into this stuff.

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,100
I did it again.

76
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,420
I played with your heart.

77
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,940
Got lost in the game.

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,740
Oh, baby, baby,

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,360
oops, you think I'm in love.

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Oops, you think I'm in love.

81
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,340
That I came from above.

82
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm not that sinless.

83
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,620
I deal with the goddamn customers

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,260
so the engineers don't have to.

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,080
I have people skills.

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,580
I am good at dealing with people.

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
Can't you understand that?

88
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,140
What the hell is wrong with you people?

89
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,460
You know perfectly well

90
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,420
what is the matter with you.

91
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,200
You've known it for years,

92
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,560
though you've fought against the knowledge.

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
You are mentally deranged.

94
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,040
Ha, ha, ha.

95
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,440
You know perfectly well

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,180
what is the matter with you.

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,120
You've known it for years,

98
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,260
though you've fought against the knowledge.

99
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,540
You are mentally deranged.

100
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,280
And...

101
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,160
Ha, ha, ha.

102
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,340
And...

103
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,040
Ha, ha, ha.

104
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,300
And...

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,160
Ha, ha, ha.

106
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,260
And...

107
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,440
You know, Patrick, you're out of place.

108
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm not kidding.

109
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,820
You've known it for years.

110
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,900
Are you a portugese now?

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,240
You are mentally deranged.

112
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,700
And I should...

113
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,040
And I should...

114
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,040
And I should...

115
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
And I should...

116
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,240
3.19 a.m.

117
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,320
I worship your penis.

118
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,480
End of message.

119
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,700
You know, Patrick, you're out of place.

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm not kidding.

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,180
You've known it for years.

122
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,160
Are you a portugese now?

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,500
You are mentally deranged.

124
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,060
12.41 a.m.

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,640
I am wondering if you have time,

126
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,180
and if it's not too much trouble,

127
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,740
on your next outgoing message,

128
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,200
would you please slap your nipples up against the phone receiver?

129
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,120
Thank you very much.

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
We'd all appreciate it.

That's it.

135
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,920
Hmm.

136
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,240
Who is that standing out the window?

137
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,280
What's his name?

138
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,140
Bob.

139
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,640
Bob.

140
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,800
Ain't that a bitch?

141
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,600
You're dry in vain.

142
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,220
You can't explain

143
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,660
the charming, alarming, blonde women.

144
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,120
They fascinate.

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,580
They captivate.

146
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,500
Beware the amazing blonde women.

147
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,500
Be careful when you meet the sweet, blonde stranger.

148
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,820
You may not know it,

149
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,380
but you are reaching danger.

150
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,500
You're dry in vain.

151
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,960
You can't explain

152
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,260
the charming, alarming, blonde women.

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,020


158
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,020


159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, Bob and the Fighting Jesus, we're talking to you now.

160
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,940
And we can feel it coming through in the spirit.

161
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:52,460
And we know there's a lot of special laid-up members and people with genetic things that are all different.

162
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,640
And they're needing to feel the power of you.

163
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:01,360
And some of them got tumors, some of them got cancers, and some of them got things in their brain that won't go out.

164
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,740
And some of them see little bitty men everywhere that they don't think are real.

165
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,780
But we know they're real, and we want you to make them feel right with all of this.

166
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,280
You should be destroyed.

167
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,540
Good.

168
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,220
Now, Jim, it's important to us that he live.

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,100
But why?

170
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,780
I'm not sure yet.

171
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,580
Oh, yes, dear friends, a little bit of Media Barrage number five there.

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:33,200
It's a show of new songs, weird clips, Einstein's secret orchestra swamp radio, and rants.

173
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,180
Yes, rants, all kinds of things.

174
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,040
And we've got new people, well, relatively new people, contributing.

175
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:48,220
We're going to the show by way of alt.binary slack this week, including the good Godex, whoever the hell that is.

176
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,660
Probably somebody we already knew using a different name.

177
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,960
And the great Fernando Dande-Limor.

178
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,020
Normally a graphic artist has been contributing bits and clips and things.

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,520
It's fun, but it's a lot of work, actually.

180
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,180
And there shall be slack.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Not a good cover, is it?

182
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,100
No.

183
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:19,060
It's like a little reggae-ish kind of ska sort of Jamaican accent doing schmooze version of jet plane.

184
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,940
She's the worst singer that we can buy.

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,120
Just like we've got the best government money can buy.

186
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,200
Britney's example of our cultural malaise.

187
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,840
Why?

188
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,160
What's wrong with America?

189
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,700
Well, just being a little overly critical.

190
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,180
Well, if you lived in another land, wouldn't you think this was vapid?

191
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,620
But I don't. I live here.

192
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,320
So if you live where they serve shit sandwiches, they're going to taste pretty good after a while.

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,980
Screw them.

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,060
It's just got to say, screw them.

195
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Yeah, screw them all.

196
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,860
That's right.

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,720
Don't let any more in.

198
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,180
Don't let any more in.

199
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,140
Kick out some of the ones you are in.

200
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
Except me.

201
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
I think they should kick out...

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,600
I think...

203
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
How's this? Will this work for a plan?

204
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,560
Let's kick the...

205
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,340
The richest 10% and the lowest poorest 10% out of the country.

206
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,060
Why the poorest 10%? What did they do?

207
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,320
Did they take all the...

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,660
Oh, they're just stupid.

209
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,580
Yeah, they're just stupid.

210
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm tired of giving them handouts.

211
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,300
Oh, I see.

212
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,920
And the upper 10%, which is...

213
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,300
All the rich people, because, you know, it's like 10% of the population owns 90% of the...

214
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,820
They don't really live in this country, do they?

215
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,240
Or are they the ones that have...

216
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,160
As before, yes.

217
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,960
Just kick them out.

218
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,020
Don't let them have any bank accounts or anything.

219
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,140
Kill them if you have to.

220
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,120
Speak angrily about everyone else except for them.

221
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,360
And talk about genocide on their own people's system.

222
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,980
Then you'll get all the middle management people will then take over the country.

223
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,280
You know, that top 10% would not be very many.

224
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,580
How bourgeois.

225
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,760
How bourgeois.

226
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,220
But we are bourgeois, aren't we?

227
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,800
When we think about it, we don't have the revolutionary zeal to pull it off or pull it out even.

228
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Please don't eat the brown asses.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm warning you.

230
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,700
Please get off those towers.

231
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,740
I had long hair before any of you jerk-offs.

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,100
Get on off those towers, you hard-ons.

233
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
Don't eat the brown asses.

234
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm warning you.

235
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,380
And somebody find me a whore.

236
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,340
Grandpa bought a rubber.

237
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,460
Welcome to...

238
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
...Dobstown, you sexy ass of genius.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
Welcome to Dobstown, you sexy ass of genius.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,220
Welcome to Dobstown, Big Boy.

241
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,880
You always wondered how computers have sex?

242
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,840
This is Hyle.

243
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,520
Prepare to be pleasured.

244
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,440
Welcome to Dobstown, Big Boy.

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,440


246
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,440


247
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,060
you sexy ass subgenius.

248
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,480
Welcome to Dobbs Town,

249
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,140
big boy.

250
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,220
Yes, dear friends,

251
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,140
we're all gonna go to Dobbs Town,

252
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,600
you know. Heart Ignition

253
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,320
knows how to take a person to

254
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,340
Dobbs Town, and we're

255
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,240
gonna take you on

256
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,060
down, down, down,

257
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,140
friends, because you know the Church of the

258
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,320
Subgenius is what, it is that

259
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
thing which is on the march to

260
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,120
restore order, virtue,

261
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,960
and perversion,

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,340
and put them back into their proper perspective

263
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,380
for the good and survival

264
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,240
of civilized society, my friends,

265
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
because the Church of the Subgenius is what

266
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,160
has been twisted, and all that

267
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,080
has been perverted by sick, demented, and

268
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,180
depraved minds is to return to

269
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,020
the source of order. Order comes through law,

270
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,020
and perfect law comes only from

271
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,580
Bob.

272
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,740
I don't know, I still find

273
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,360
American.

274
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,840
This radio by IRC,

275
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,100
internet radio chat, so he's

276
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,220
a little bit behind. Well, actually, I'm

277
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,000
doing it by fornicated hollow zig.

278
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,060
If you've, uh, the new technology

279
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,180
is the real stuff.

280
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm actually hollow zig. I don't have any...

281
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,340
Every zig.

282
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
There's no form here, there's no real molecules

283
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
popping around, there's, um,

284
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,180
just a

285
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,900
big, fat piece of cheese

286
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,800
staring at you.

287
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,440
Staring blankly into space.

288
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,300
Crying.

289
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,740
To those Americans who just

290
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,340
will not stand firmly and

291
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,360
totally enough in support of whatever it is

292
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,020
we're supporting.

293
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,460
Well, we're supporting the drug war, right?

294
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,520
It's the war on drugs. It's the same thing

295
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,580
as the war on them.

296
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,200
Because them are drugs,

297
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,080
right? It's the same exact

298
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,100
thing. And drugs are not

299
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,320
beer and wine

300
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,580
and liquor, because those are legal,

301
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,980
so they're not terrorists.

302
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,500
I am the drugs. And coffee.

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,000
I am coffee. And MTV.

304
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Yeah.

305
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,060
No, you are Salvador Dali. You are the persistence

306
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,480
of religion. I am

307
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,660
you are

308
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,020
I think that song kicks butt.

309
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,340
I think that song kicks butt.

310
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,000
And why am I telling any of you this silly thing?

311
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,860
Why, for almost no reason whatsoever.

312
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,420
Except maybe to get a cheap laugh.

313
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,520
And when was the last time a televangelist or a Taliban

314
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,900
screwed and did that for anyone?

315
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,120
Okay, then.

316
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,040
It should also be pointed out that any comparison

317
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,620
between subgeniuses and animals

318
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,740
includes the fact that we both will drop a load

319
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,700
anywhere we please.

320
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
There will be a test later,

321
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,460
but it won't matter because we'll just

322
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,780
crap on the desk, hump the teacher, and then jump out the window.

323
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,560
So what if the South had won

324
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
the Civil War? What would have happened then?

325
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:53,820
Huh?

326
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,720
What if the

327
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,560
Spanish had won the Spanish-American

328
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,120
War?

329
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
Well, if the South had won the Civil War, we probably would have been

330
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,040
able to have another...

331
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
What if the Germans had won

332
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,300
World War...

333
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,300
Six?

334
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,680
Then we'd have to frat.

335
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,660
I think it's time to frat.

336
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,420
Okay.

337
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,840
All right.

338
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,980
I'm sure glad that happened.

339
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,940
Okay, uh...

340
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,500
I want to be glad.

341
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,960
The thing is,

342
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,440
the Civil War never ended.

343
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,300
It's still going on.

344
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,840
The South winning, if you haven't noticed.

345
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,540
It never started.

346
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,280
It started, all right.

347
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,540
No, no, no.

348
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,280
It was the uncertainty.

349
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
It was the Civil War that started.

350
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,760
There's nothing civil about that war.

351
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,420
Well, you got them.

352
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,860
That was a damnable war.

353
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,680
Romantic.

354
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,440
Yeah, but what would James Joyce have said about it?

355
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,120
What would Aunt Bertha have said about it?

356
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,620
What would...

357
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,900
Yeah, what would Aunt Bertha have said?

358
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,880
Jesus did not always stay a baby.

359
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,080
Although I think he must have been the most

360
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,620
adorable baby you ever saw.

361
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,280
Still, he was the kindest baby

362
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,100
and he grew, just as you

363
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,300
boys and girls have grown.

364
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,960
No, boy.

365
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,440
Don't say that to me.

366
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,560
You?

367
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,660
Oh, let go.

368
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,140
It is wonderful to know that Jesus

369
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,300
was once a child like me

370
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,960
and lived on earth and worked and played

371
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,080
in his home in Galilee.

372
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,820
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus

373
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,120
who was once a child like me.

374
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,780
Thank you.

375
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,740
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus

376
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,100
like him I want to be.

377
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,840
Before his parents could hardly believe it,

378
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,840
Jesus was 12 years old.

379
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,780
He was a fine lad.

380
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,480
And Luke tells us in chapter 2,

381
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,260
verses 41 through 52,

382
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,960
a beautiful story about Jesus

383
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
when he was 12 years old.

384
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm sorry.

385
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,540
I hope you're prepared somewhat beforehand.

386
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,040
This is a mutant.

387
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,060
You've been breeding them here for ages

388
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,920
to do menial work.

389
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,520
Well, actually, they're similar to some of the

390
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,780
insect life on your own planet.

391
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,600
Larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.

392
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,320
I beg of you, go inside.

393
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,960
Cooperate voluntarily.

394
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,400
If you do, I give you my word that you will not be harmed

395
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,760
or your minds changed in any way.

396
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,500
Do you believe him, Cal?

397
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,940
In this place, I wouldn't believe my grandmother.

398
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,720
.

399
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:36,720


400
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:36,720


401
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,980
.

402
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:40,980


403
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,080
.

404
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,580
.

405
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:53,960
.

406
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,200
.

407
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,240
.

408
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
.

409
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,260
.

410
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,420
.

411
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,420


412
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,200
Well, that's settled.

413
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,620
Let's order a pizza.

414
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,900
A what?

415
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,880
A pizza.

416
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,880
A what?

417
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,860
A pizza.

418
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,800
A what?

419
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,680
A pizza.

420
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,920
You know, round, flat dough with tomatoes

421
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,000
and toppings and cheese.

422
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
I know what a pizza is.

423
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,280
Well, how fabulous for you, darling.

424
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,400
Because I could use a little mortal pleasure.

425
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,420
You know, sex.

426
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,340
I don't get it.

427
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,520
I've seen a number of your porno movies, and I've noticed that the pizza men tend to be rather

428
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,700
Well hung and quite over sexed

429
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,520
No, they still like Bob

430
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,280
Good

431
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,500
Like this traffic light change

432
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,280
Suddenly realized within the last few years. It's more of a not what you know and what you do, but who you know game

433
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:25,920
The smell of success is never too sweet

434
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,720
Yeah, I think we're being sold a bill big bill of good oh

435
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,920
Yes, and he

436
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,980
Ain't he ain't got superpowers paint from another planet

437
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:48,480
Hey, he ain't some some something that we have to bow down and kiss to you can pull Bob's leg

438
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,760
And bobble bobble chuckle right along with you because Bob

439
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,640
Bob's been a fool just like you or me. He's been a he's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you friends

440
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,760
Say our Bob Dobbs will be a fool again. He's a fool today

441
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,900
He's a fool

442
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:12,940
He's a fool tomorrow. He's the same Bob the same Bob. He's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me

443
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,740
Let's go out in the field

444
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,080
Look at all those lizards man. I didn't know they could enlist

445
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,960
Man, they're tall

446
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,100
Wow man tails and everything and

447
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,600
Man, I can't imagine they can get those helmets on those guys with those weird heads

448
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,780
They look like kind of just tied on underneath. They look pretty human from a distance from a distance man

449
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,840
When you get a man this this showing up straight-up lizards man beyond that

450
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,680
Man, so Dave enlisted so I guess now everything's really true that United Nations really

451
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,780
Taken over our backyards

452
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,000
The barbecue pit and everything they'll be coming for you dude pretty soon Dave pretty well to the top of their relations

453
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,580
I could lick one of those lizards really easy man. He said look all you have to do is blow some cool

454
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,800
And staying are really high up on the list

455
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,880
You how did you get off the list man?

456
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,100
Well known high places. Yes, he has a job ah

457
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,860
Princess we has a job so she's not on the list some people have jobs other people have to work well. That's different

458
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,020
Yeah, that's the difference between

459
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,060
Eloy I truly truly feel sorry for the poor schmucks after work. Yeah the people who have to dig off wallpaper and

460
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,800
Remove things from their buttocks every night

461
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,940
carve little tiny pixels out of the art mines tiny little cars actually lodged in their colons

462
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,220
people have to be to watch cartoons

463
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,240
They have to make them frame by frame and can't even understand the cartoons

464
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:55,020
Cobbling them together and the cave wall and then run through the cave real fast each guy with a torch. That's

465
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,580
That's how you get off the flickering of fleck makes it look like we're really bad multimedia, dude

466
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,780
blinking I don't really think they improve that

467
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,140
on it.

468
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, the camp is Futurama,

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,880
so what's there to live

470
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,740
for? Please don't remind me.

471
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,700
I can't believe it. Actually, our man

472
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,720
on the inside says that that might not be

473
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,760
true, that every season they do that

474
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
to Matt Granig because the executives

475
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,180
at Fox hate

476
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,740
The Simpsons and hate Futurama

477
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,740
because, especially The Simpsons,

478
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,360
because it makes them so much money,

479
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,520
but the cartoonists refuse

480
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,680
to heed any of the

481
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
suggestions from the executives.

482
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,760
And that's what this is all about.

483
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,700
It's a guys who wear

484
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,580
suits in offices thing

485
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,140
and I wouldn't understand.

486
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,560
They're all mind-controlled as well, all those

487
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,820
executives in suits. Who do you think they take

488
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,600
their orders from? Who do you think is

489
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,980
whispering in their ears?

490
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,620
Just not.

491
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,120
Did they give you your gun yet?

492
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,420
I got so depressed last

493
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,200
week one day.

494
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,200
I was reading the news and

495
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,340
they said that one day

496
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,720
George Bush said,

497
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,040
we're going to continue

498
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
this war on drug

499
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,540
terrorists and

500
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,180
everyone who, you know,

501
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,720
the nail that

502
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,920
sticks up will be hammered down,

503
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,000
George said. And then they raided

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,600
all the medical marijuana

505
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,580
places in, not

506
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,040
all of them, but a lot of them in L.A. and San

507
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,720
Francisco. They've been making war.

508
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,420
They've been making war.

509
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,960
Those cancer patients

510
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,120
and aid patients have,

511
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,620
better drugs they can get hold of

512
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,560
that are conspiracy approved

513
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,800
and part of the Lilly Corporation

514
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,700
with, you know, the right

515
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,740
stockholders. We all know the Lilly Corporation

516
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,680
has many...

517
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,260
It's like a needle full of

518
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,540
Dilaudid. Right after that,

519
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,980
I read that

520
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,300
Futurama was cancelled

521
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,840
and then I read that we were

522
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,920
going to take over the world

523
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,740
and that this was the Death

524
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,840
Star. Don't you think it's odd that

525
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,540
Lilly, behind all that stuff,

526
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,660
we are looking over Dave's shoulder as he

527
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,900
has his first night

528
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,840
in boot camp. Trying to sneak up on a

529
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,420
lizard behind and see if

530
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,940
Dave, if you're good at this soldiering stuff,

531
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,900
they'll let you push one of the big buttons.

532
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,000
You can push the big button and you

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,620
won't have to be a grunt like this if you work your way up.

534
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,040
I have been pounding on this big button with my

535
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,420
fist. No, you gotta

536
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,020
climb up on the backs of your

537
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,780
fellow soldiers until you're the

538
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,180
last man standing on the button.

539
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,100
Hey, Stang, tell me again, which button

540
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,560
is it that we put when we have,

541
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,860
to eject out of

542
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,540
our injection into his,

543
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,820
our nano-injection into Dave's eyebrow?

544
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,440
That's the blue pill. Like when he gets killed

545
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,000
with the bullet, you know, and

546
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,620
when we actually need to get out of there?

547
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,060
Oh. It's the blue pill?

548
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,780
I know the evacuation pill's for y'all

549
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,680
and I'm sorry, you'll have to remain in the

550
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,600
corpse to run along with it.

551
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,180
He ain't gonna live.

552
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,820
No, wait a minute.

553
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
No, you wait a minute. I love that

554
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,300
area.

555
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,400
The heat stress is going to be

556
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,500
associated with it. Our current,

557
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,680
uh, uh, protective ensemble does not

558
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,620
provide for bodily function, so

559
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,480
there's any way around it, any way

560
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,920
you look at it, that we're going to

561
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,780
have suffering or degradation.

562
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,340
Okay, just keep driving slow.

563
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,740
Just keep driving slow, but don't...

564
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,480
Yeah, just...

565
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
Yeah, just keep cool. Keep cool.

566
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,620
All we can do is hope he doesn't

567
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,600
start shooting. Oh, no! He's shooting!

568
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,620
He's bustling out the back window!

569
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,400
Oh, look out!

570
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,080
Ah!

571
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,100
Stay down! Stay down!

572
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,000
Ah! Chill!

573
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,360
Get down, Philo!

574
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,820
Friends, we've been hearing a ton of, uh,

575
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,280
the old subgenius

576
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,700
media barrage called Media Barrage

577
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,620
Number 5, which I've been

578
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,560
remastering, uh, for...

579
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,200
What? What? What?

580
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,520
What?

581
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,040
Bob Dobbs.

582
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,400
El Hijo.

583
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,700
De una gran puta.

584
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,340
Uh, yes.

585
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,480
Bob loves you,

586
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,580
and he knows love from the

587
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,740
inside out.

588
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,480
The old media barrage

589
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,760
tapes being slowly,

590
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,400
uh, reconverted

591
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,260
digitally, uh, came...

592
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,540
Originally were edited by, uh, yours truly

593
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,100
with puzzling evidence.

594
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,880
Uh, Byron Werner,

595
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,020
the great Saint Byron Werner,

596
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
and, uh, oh, uh,

597
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,340
I think, uh,

598
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,540
uh, Reverend, uh,

599
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,220
Stevie Hambone helped on that one.

600
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,400
Helped Pope Huey.

601
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,460
Edited quite a bit of the original

602
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,220
old, uh, Media Barrage Number 5 tape.

603
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,360
Uh, bits and pieces out of that.

604
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,920
Came from his ancient show,

605
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,260
uh, from, uh, from Texas,

606
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,080
a state which has banned

607
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,060
all subgenius broadcast.

608
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,920
Did you know that?

609
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,800
You could have...

610
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,660
But this, this church started in Texas,

611
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,660
in Dallas, Texas,

612
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,860
and yet all of the independent

613
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,340
and, uh, college radio stations

614
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,640
in Texas banned,

615
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,460
the church of the subgenius for being...

616
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,480
Well, I...

617
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
I guess we didn't empower

618
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,840
the right people, you might say.

619
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,360
But, friends, this,

620
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,260
this church, this church

621
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,280
is not, uh,

622
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,180
uh, some, uh,

623
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,460
pathetic little, uh,

624
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,460
giveaway church. We're not trying to give away

625
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,380
our enlightenment. We're not trying to give away

626
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,340
Bob, because, friends, you get what you

627
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,380
pay for. And this is

628
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,920
an independent effort

629
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,580
of concerned citizens,

630
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,540
subgeniuses, not part of any associated

631
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,080
ministry or organization,

632
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,960
officially or otherwise, except

633
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,920
possibly in spirit,

634
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,540
the spirit of slack, and prayer,

635
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,480
the prayer of to Bob,

636
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,160
which is committed by

637
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,420
committing your name to the line

638
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,480
and the check, the check that goes to

639
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
Bob. My friend, we don't apologize

640
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,180
for telling it like it is.

641
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,780
The truth and reality of normalcy

642
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,000
and normality,

643
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,580
that is what is offensive.

644
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,920
The conspiracy did not,

645
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,140
bring this perversion into the open,

646
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,940
but now that it is in the open,

647
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,240
we have to deal with it. And the way to deal

648
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,220
with that is to deal with reality.

649
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,040
Yeah, and, uh,

650
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,720
and that reality is

651
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,360
this!

652
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,080
My pussycat was

653
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,260

654
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,180
Scratched so long

655
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,040
Poor pussy got sore

Friendly little cat

My pussycat was rocking in the rocking chair

680
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,100
Rocked so long, he was in the rocking chair

681
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,500

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,300
now I don't want to sound too unaggregative

720
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,000
I know I could have wound up with my A-frame

721
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
wrapped around a bad case of scoliosis

722
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,940
been beaten by big black coat hangers

723
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,480
wielded by Bing Crosby or

724
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,100
been born a one-eyed one legged black lesbian in Somalia

725
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,460
where the price of a good nice hum is a slice of aged pork without so many flies on it later

726
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,500
it just gets hard trying to hold on as hard as you can

727
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,060
so as to keep from being thrown to the wolves when the last guy who grabbed the golden ring

728
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:22,400
left an unsightly trace of his disquiet on the damn thing and reverse graced me with a truly grittily case of bodacious ingracious magnine round the corner de-infestation of the fine tuning gland

729
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,600
as payback for my daring yet precariously

730
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,460
over the new style of take your damn chance you quivering quagmire across the land and then you're gone

731
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,000
the wires publish or die are published and die but just lay there and you'll die for sure anyway get an amen

732
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,020
amen

736
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,840
now it's a long running game show call let's make Jesus puke

737
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,620
it's like supermarket sweep except that you put your children in their dreams on a dice and hack at them with incense braziers

738
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,160
and badly produced video epics about burning in hell if you don't think the baptism before you even have full control of your own bladder

739
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,440
if a child with potential falls in the forest of bad thing and lost opportunities is God still meek?

740
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,940
if you don't get this well I don't know look around you

741
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,280
we are defining in practical terms the immutable ideals that have guided us from the beginning

742
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,460
or kill me these were the words of J.R. Bob Dobbs in that single sentence

743
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,720
Dobbs set forth the real problem facing all humanity

744
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,640
and it's an especially poignant one today for Americans

745
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,360
in a real sense it is a rephrasing of a statement made thousands of years ago to the first couple

746
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,900
and because that first couple embraced that enlightened redefinition

747
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,660
the course of humanity was forever changed

748
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:52,660
and J.R. Bob Dobbs and many others today in our society are still asking you to embrace the idea that we really know is a better way

749
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,900
that we can define good and evil based upon contemporary popular opinion

750
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,780
that you can define life and your relationships to others in your own terms

751
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,440
in essence that you will be like God

752
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,260
you

753
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:58,440


754
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,960
Determine the truth

755
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,600
Emotions

756
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:14,600


757
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:14,600


758
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,800
Doings

759
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,240
Pro остановi

760
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,960
Consume

761
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:22,960


762
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:22,960


763
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:22,960


764
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:22,960


765
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,040
Nie

766
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,040


767
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,040


768
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,040


769
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,820
Darn

770
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,180
Curse

771
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,600
This

772
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,300
denotes

773
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,560
Your

774
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,700
Boys with the horns get down and blow.

775
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,560
They rear back, aim their bells at the stars.

776
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,680
They said, feed me, Big Daddy.

777
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,540
Hey, to the bar.

778
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,460
I did not put you here to suffer.

779
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,160
I did not put you here to whine.

780
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,000
I put you here to love one another.

781
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,400
And the kid has had a good time now, now, now.

782
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,220
Let the people go now.

783
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,640
Don't let my people go, go, go.

784
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,060
Let my people go, go, go.

785
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,360
Don't let my people go.

786
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,280
What I say.

787
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,860
Now, Jesus went out for a walk with his mother.

788
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,860
The scribes and the Pharisees, plot and hugger mugger.

789
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,580
They locked him up and they threw away the key.

790
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,360
He said, why is everybody always picking on me?

791
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,400
I did not put you here to suffer.

792
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,220
No, I did not put you here to whine.

793
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,840
I put you here to love one another.

794
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,360
I did not put you here to have a good time now, now, now.

795
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,300
Let my people go, go, go.

796
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,320
Let my people go, go, go.

798
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Hey, you gotta, oh, you gotta.

799
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,240
Let my people go, go, go.

800
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,140
You gotta let my people go, go, go.

801
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,860
Let my people go, go, go.

802
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,040
Sing it loud, I'm feeling so proud about being alive.

803
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,740
Let my people go, go, go.

804
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,340
You know, I think we're putting it out loud.

805
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,520
Good time.

806
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,480
Let my people go, go, go.

807
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,980
Oh, yeah.

808
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,820
Let my people go.

809
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,860
Got to let my people go.

810
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:35,580
Oh!

811
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
All right!

812
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,000
Let my people go.

813
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,440
The Rainmakers, dear friends.

814
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,020
A great old favorite band.

815
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,460
A band of mine from the day.

816
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,200
They disbanded, unfortunately.

817
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,760
The subgenius-like person behind that band was named Bob Walkenhorst.

818
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,640
But you can still find the Rainmakers here and there.

819
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,080
I'm going to try to resurrect their great legend here on the Hour of Slack.

820
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,780
Thank you.

821
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,820
Can you think of a better gift than something that helps a guy look good and feel good every single day of the year?

822
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,860
Can you?

823
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:55,100
Yes, now that I don't have to worry about how good and woeful you all are.

824
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,140
Actually, with things like compassion, positive karma and stinginess, don't you think it's...

825
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,360
Palin!

826
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,360


827
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,360


828
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,400
Come to Max gets p vaya

829
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:55,400


830
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,200
Oh, Michael Jackson!

831
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


832
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


833
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


834
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,200


835
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,020
The Shaving Head.

836
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,540
Down go the Shaving Head.

837
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,700
That's all they're gonna do.

838
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,660
Give you a close-up shake.

839
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,880
Clean you up as you walk.

840
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,300
Love.

841
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,900
Cleans you, thrills you, may even keep you from getting busted.

842
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,300
What happened to...

843
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,180
This is certainly the end of the road.

844
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,060
Dave, were you up for the draft during the Vietnam years?

845
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,800
Yeah.

846
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,800
How'd you get out of that, man?

847
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,640
How the hell did you get out of that?

848
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,680
I faked crazy, man.

849
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,800
Did you really?

850
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,720
I went to an...

851
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,620
How'd you get out of that?

852
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,060
Because you're a prime age for Vietnam, man.

853
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,500
I went to a Navy psychiatrist and he said,

854
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,520
Get out of here.

855
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,840
I don't want you in no U.S. Navy or Army.

856
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,240
Yes.

857
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,880
He said I was not the type.

858
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,660
Dave's insane.

859
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,740
He's truly considered insane by the U.S. government.

860
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,060
Yes, that's true.

861
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,180
I was considered flat-footed.

862
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,440
Wow.

863
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,540
I was number 30 in the lottery.

864
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,820
And they gave me wonderful drugs that made me crazier.

865
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,160
Wow.

866
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,080
I see three things.

867
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,560
Yeah, that's a sure ticket.

868
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,180
It was a sure ticket to Hamburger Hill.

869
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,200
But...

870
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,360
And I went in and I'd heard, you know,

871
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,740
that you put peanut butter up the crack of your...

872
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,560
Well, if you want to do that...

873
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,960
And all of that, and you do a lot of...

874
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,720
Why do you do that?

875
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,140
You run your...

876
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,360
It's a fun thing to do.

877
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,880
This is if you don't want to be in the Army, okay?

878
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,580
Why would you put peanut butter up your bunghole?

879
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,680
So that when they...

880
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,720
Look back there.

881
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
...bend over and call...

882
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,360
They feel like a snack.

883
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,840
You reach back there and grab yourself a snack

884
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,940
and lick your finger.

885
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,240
And they let you out of...

886
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,020
They, you know, mark you for...

887
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,560
They do their duty as well.

888
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,620
But it's an old gag.

889
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,500
I'm surprised you hadn't heard of that.

890
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,560
No, that must be one of those Texas ones.

891
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,260
No, it's a draft dodger routine from the Vietnam years.

892
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,660
Well, up here in Cleveland, they just went across the border.

893
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,960
Yeah, well, we didn't want to go across the border where we were.

894
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,980
No, senor.

895
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,760
You don't want to come here, by God.

896
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,740
It was...

897
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,200
But I tried everything.

898
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,580
I told them that I was...

899
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
And they still drafted you.

900
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,700
Notice how they have the borders nice and tight now?

901
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,840
I told them I was a homosexual.

902
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,320
I told them everything that they didn't want to hear.

903
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,600
They didn't care about your personal life.

904
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
They laughed at me.

905
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
The guy said...

906
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,920
That's what laughed at me.

907
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,280
There's a lot of boys in there, buddy.

908
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,140
Hey, well, notice this.

909
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,600
The borders are nice and tight now, right?

910
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,580
In the name of national security,

911
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,140
don't want to let them in, right?

912
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,820
Don't let them out either.

913
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Yeah, right.

914
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:15,820
Right.

915
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,660
Now they can bring back the draft

916
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,680
and we won't have what happened with Vietnam.

917
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,120
They won't be running over the border up to Canada.

918
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,580
You will not be living some...

919
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:23,680
Living in some...

920
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,920
...happy-doopy...

921
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,000
...pot-smoking...

922
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,000


923
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,080
...poison-spoken sex life up in Toronto.

924
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,160
Toronto, yeah.

925
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,060
You know, walking them blues to you, man.

926
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,500
Ain't getting away this time.

927
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,880
We got the borders sealed now.

928
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,100
Yeah, and the border seals are some of the toughest mammal carnivores

929
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,300
ever, ever enlisted from the Arctic forces.

930
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,820
They're not going to let any Canucks down here

931
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,440
or any Yohus up there.

932
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,800
No Canucks, no way.

933
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,320
Guarding against Canadian attack.

934
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,900
And no funny pink wigs either.

935
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,760
List county coast watchers.

936
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,260
I'm a member.

937
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,640
Yeah.

938
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,180
Yep.

939
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,440
And he's been dismembered for so long now

940
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,000
that he can't even...

941
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,320
He can't even remember where he left that scotch.

942
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,100
I don't trust them Canadians at all.

943
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,020
And I am one.

944
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,380
You are one?

945
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,760
Well, scotch-Canadian.

946
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,540
Well, I see what's going on here.

947
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,500
Everybody's loyalty in question.

948
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,060
And you're the Canadian.

949
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,080
You're the Canadian.

950
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,880
Yeah, I'm born right here on this side of the lake.

951
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,780
I thought you were a real Smith.

952
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,960
I thought I heard you say...

953
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,460
I am.

954
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,020
A scotter Smith is as real as scotter Smith's get.

955
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,740
Yeah, I heard you say a boot a couple times.

956
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,000
Not if they go to Scotia.

957
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,320
It comes right from Scotland.

958
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,980
Not if they go to Scotland.

959
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:25,980


960
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:25,980


961
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,020
They're filtered through the bladder of Canada.

962
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,420
The mighty bladder of Canada.

963
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,160
Nova Scotia is not part of Canada.

964
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
You come to laugh along with us

965
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,180
as we take a train to the bladder of Canada.

966
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,240
Get in the canoe, my friend.

967
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,880
We shall go down the urinary track

968
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,240
and get some furs,

969
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,200
and then we shall...

970
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,360
Oh, look.

971
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,240
I know it's going...

972
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,320
At least I can trace it directly.

973
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,960
You know, it's Cleveland, Nova Scotia, Scotland.

974
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,240
How the hell does Texas get in there somehow?

975
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,660
Well, some races have always...

976
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,360
You're like a wetback army dildo.

977
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,960
Some races have always been in Texas.

978
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,440
They...

979
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,400
Texans.

980
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,680
Ah.

981
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,420
You are one of the people of the core.

982
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,260
There's Angloid Texans.

983
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,440
There's Black Texans.

984
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:11,920
There's...

985
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,440
Krauts.

986
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,720
Mexican Texans.

987
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,780
There's all kinds of Texans.

988
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,760
Yes, how many Krauts?

989
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,900
There's even Jewish Texans

990
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,460
that sound just like me.

991
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,220
Yeah, they say,

992
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,300
Oy vey, don't you?

993
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,680
That's what they say right there.

994
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,700
And Chinese Texans

995
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:25,980
that sound just like me.

996
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,160
They say,

997
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,740
Gun hay, fai, choi, stang,

998
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,800
it's a year of the horse.

999
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,860
It's a type of...

1000
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,480
It's actually a subspecies

1001
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,700
of the human race.

1002
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,880
It's kind of Chinese Texans.

1003
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,880
How did they end up there?

1004
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,000
The Texans exist to irritate

1005
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,060
all the other people everywhere.

1006
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,060
Except the Australians.

1007
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,080
We're kind of in with the Australians

1008
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,020
and doing the same

1009
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,240
because they're in the same business

1010
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,060
as the Texans.

1011
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,200
Yeah, big tall guys growing up

1012
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,400
beating the hell out of everybody.

1013
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,060
Some Brazilians

1014
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,980
from the United States.

1015
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,080
Some Brazilians

1016
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,900
from the fields,

1017
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,060
the high plains area

1018
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,780
are like that.

1019
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,820
Yes, but Brazilians

1020
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,940
are annoying in a different kind of way

1021
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,300
than Australians and Texans

1022
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,740
which are more like macho.

1023
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,300
Yeah, they're kind of sexy.

1024
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,760
No, they have a lot of sex

1025
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,680
in the streets

1026
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,080
and all that kind of stuff.

1027
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,120
They don't have no carnival down there.

1028
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
They're better looking

1029
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,220
but it's not that much less uptight

1030
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,900
in Brazil.

1031
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,760
Oh, I thought you were talking

1032
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,080
about the Texas carnival

1033
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,580
where they wear the big chaps

1034
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,360
and the 20-gallon hatchet

1035
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,440
and they show their cuckoo

1036
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,260
and dingy lingus.

1037
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,420
In the woods in Brazil

1038
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,520
they know how to party.

1039
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,440
Oh, yeah.

1040
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Those wood,

1041
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,380
the bark snuff puffers.

1042
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,620
Bark puffers, yeah.

1043
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,980
The yano puffers.

1044
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:40,840
Bark snuffers.

1045
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,100
You know my momma, people.

1046
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,020
I smell a bark snuff puffer.

1047
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,920
And I like it.

1048
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,860
I like the National Geographic babes

1049
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,080
that grow out in the jungle

1050
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,100
with the little

1051
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,460
mo haircut.

1052
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,040
Oh, what was that?

1053
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,080
That's a little bull.

1054
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,320
The little unicorn thing

1055
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,500
in the middle of their foreheads.

1056
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:58,900
Red ochre makeup

1057
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,020
they spread on there.

1058
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,440
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,700
And that's also when they die

1060
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,180
they spread red ochre

1061
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,540
all over their genitalia too

1062
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,400
as a sign of,

1063
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,660
I guess just like a road sign

1064
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,180
or something.

1065
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,900
And it's not running out

1066
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,500
of their faces

1067
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,740
because of the drugs

1068
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,180
they shoot up their noses

1069
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,780
with bamboo.

1070
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,300
I'm not hearing

1071
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,720
any of this actually.

1072
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,340
I just seem to be

1073
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,820
You want my nose, honey?

1074
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,320
You can blow another punch.

1075
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,320
I'm not hearing

1076
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,560
any of this actually.

1077
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:25,560


1078
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:25,560


1079
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:25,560


1080
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,900
I'm not hearing

1081
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:26,900


1082
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:26,900


1083
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:26,900


1084
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,540
Slowly towards the bathroom.

1085
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,300
I'm going to talk

1086
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:29,680
to the god now.

1087
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,340
A dog that's like

1088
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,080
me and John.

1089
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,940
He could tell

1090
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,640
that he was occupied.

1091
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,420
That means spirit

1092
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,560
from doing them drugs.

1093
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm going to talk

1094
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,340


1095
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,200
Occupied by a foreign army.

1096
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,320
Not only a foreign army

1097
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,840
but an alien army.

1098
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,600
Yes, an alien army

1099
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,480
had invaded

1100
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,040
his private inner sanctum

1101
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,880
and has inched his way.

1102
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,240
Saw the light

1103
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,000
listening,

1104
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,960
glimmering,

1105
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,620
a chef

1106
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,640
bursting out

1107
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,860
and striking him

1108
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,300
on the forehead.

1109
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:55,560
He's like,

1110
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:55,860
I fell down

1111
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,340
and I'm on a sneeze.

1112
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,240
And there it was

1113
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,180
upon the throat.

1114
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,060
And the,

1115
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,360
the,

1116
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,920
the visage

1117
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,960
of the man himself

1118
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,860
rammed

1119
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,240
down

1120
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,800
the face

1121
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,320
of the

1122
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,360
the thing

1123
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,680
that,

1124
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,420
that

1125
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,800
incredibly

1126
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,320
emaciated

1127
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,980
the face

1128
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,600
of the

1129
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,780
We'll return

1130
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,440
with

1131
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,420
The Vampire

1132
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,200
on the Block

1133
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,680
after this word

1134
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,940
from Selby Sotes

1135
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,340
made from

1136
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,860
real human hands.

1137
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,320
You are

1138
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,720
our soap.

1139
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
My fellow Americans.

1140
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,260
We have a serious

1141
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:34,900
responsibility

1142
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,720
to halt

1143
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,160
all evil

1144
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,660
everywhere.

1145
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,720
Especially that evil

1146
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,940
which is undefined.

1147
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,320
You know what to do.

1148
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,540
That can only be defined

1149
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,660
in the mind

1150
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,840
of one glorious

1151
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,120
brilliant man.

1152
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,900
A man who rose

1153
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,880
much like Napoleon

1154
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,660
on his horse

1155
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,220
to the high reins

1156
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,840
of highness.

1157
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,980
George W.

1158
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,340
Oh, I thought you were

1159
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,900
gonna say Bob

1160
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,480
Jub, Jub-ya-Dob.

1161
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,360
Jub, Jub-ya-Dob.

1162
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,080
See baby

1163
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,200
we're on fire!

1164
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,500
Why?

1165
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,120
Why?

1166
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:07,640
Why?

1167
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:07,820


1168
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,380
Why?

1169
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,360
Why?

1170
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:10,400
Why?

1171
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,960
Why?

1172
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1173
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1174
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1175
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1176
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1177
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1178
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1179
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,960


1180
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,060
Why?

1181
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,340
Why?

1182
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:11,960
Why?

1183
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,260
Why?

1184
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,720
Why?

1185
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,280
Why?

1186
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,960
Who are you?

1187
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,800
Seems very expected.

1188
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,160
This guys is a

1189
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,360
snob.

1190
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:28,760


1191
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,220
Ah

1192
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,620
What are you waiting for?

1193
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,400
Are you trying to

1194
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,660
goFace my

1195
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:39,800
yogurt?

1196
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:39,860


1197
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,160
You love

1198
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:41,940
White gum?

1199
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,040
Ona and Canobite for some of the scripting on tonight's show.

1200
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,080
And you have been listening to the subgenius radio ministry,

1201
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,180
Hour of Slack.

1202
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:57,100
Praise be the stations that carry this godforsaken show.

1203
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,360
Those which pay for it, and even those which don't.

1204
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,500
But especially those who do,

1205
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,300
such as the independent subscribers to this show,

1206
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,820
the good doctors, and they actually are real doctors.

1207
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,340
Praise Dr. Tillis, and praise Dr. Johnson,

1208
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,280
the doctors, the surgeons,

1209
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,320
who help support this show by subscribing to it,

1210
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,320
just as if they themselves were radio stations,

1211
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,360
and as a result they hear the untrammeled, uncut version,

1212
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,680
sort of like on the internet version,

1213
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,280
but in 44.1 kilohertz.

1214
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,300
This is the subgenius radio hour of Slack.

1215
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,240
You can address your questions in the postcards too.

1216
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,860
Reverend Ivan Stang, post office box 181417.

1217
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:07,760
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1218
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,120
Thank goodness, there's this different kind of dinner roll.

1219
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,780
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1220
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,160
was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine,

1221
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,520
and I didn't know who he was.

1222
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:20,940
Exactly.

1223
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,880
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

1224
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,900
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

1225
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,400
Disciples.

1226
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,400
Disciples.

1227
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,200
Disciples.

1228
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:31,340


1229
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,100
Yeah.

1230
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:32,860
All right.

1231
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,540
You know, it's funny.

1232
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,220
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

1233
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,540
Or Bob.

1234
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,940
Oh, my God.

1235
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:38,280
Oh, my God.

1236
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,520
Oh, my God.

1237
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,980
Oh, my God.

1238
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,500
Oh, my God.

1239
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,560
Oh, my God.

1240
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,320
What the fuck did you call me here?

1241
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:30,920
Murder.

1242
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,060
Liars.

1243
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,100
Producers.

1244
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,880
You'll probably Vale it way better.

1245
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,760
Bitch.

1246
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,760
You did it.

1247
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,540
Elrond Hubbard, your sins against humanity will sacrifice your life force in order to

1248
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:20,840
form a virus. To undo the damage you've created, your spirit will be turned into a word virus,

1249
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,380
triggered by your very name. Every time your name is mentioned, your organization will

1250
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,400
be destroyed, visualized, and lacked care and strength.

1251
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,760
Sucking the spirit energy of Elrond Hubbard into it, becoming more and more solid.

1252
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,820
Feeding upon the soul of Elrond Hubbard, destroying the life force of Elrond Hubbard,

1253
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,740
so he is no more.

1254
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,380
Now we crush that down into the size of a virus.

1255
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:00,380


1256
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,420
Smaller, smaller, infinitesimally small.

1257
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:14,940
And we launch it. We launch it so that every time Elrond Hubbard is mentioned,

1258
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,280
a penis of the Psychotology dies.

1259
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,840
And we launch it to the world.

1260
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,380
And we launch it to the world.

1261
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,060
And we launch it so that every time Elrond Hubbard is mentioned,

1262
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,060


1263
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,300
The thought virus by the El Queso All Stars.

1264
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,560
More in there. War against the Church of Scientology.

1265
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,200
Just another rival cult for the great Church of the Subgenius.

1266
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:12,080
And friends, you know, as our friend, champion Jack Codini also likes to say, kill them all.

1267
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:19,200
I know that over the years, many of you have seen the pictures and news clips of the concrete and mortar,

1268
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:25,760
the guard posts and machine gun towers, the dog runs and the barbed wire that is American.

1269
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,700
We will, we will rock you.

1270
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,780
Sing it.

1271
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,500
We will, we will rock you.

1272
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,600
Everybody.

1273
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,400
We will, we will rock you.

1274
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,220
We will, we will rock you.

1275
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,260
Hail Kings of Feedback.

1276
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,460
Say it again.

1277
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,760
Slack.

1278
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,520
You Slack the show.

1279
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,820
Slack beyond your wildest dreams.

1280
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,100
Right now it's Slack.

1281
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,460
You have the power to fight.

1282
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,020
Fight Slack.

1283
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,620
Good something for nothing.

1284
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,840
Credit cards are taken.

1285
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,900
Slack.

1286
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,940
Send cash.

1287
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,460
I want more Slack.

1288
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,060
Send your money now.

1289
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,460
Conspiracy denied me again.

1290
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Send your money.

1291
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,840
I will have my Slack.

1292
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,560
Your Slack sale's been adhered.

1293
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,420
Slack.

1294
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,380
Buy more Slack.

1295
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,020
Use Slack.

1296
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,400
Look good.

1297
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,540
Use Slack.

1298
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,840

1339
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,360
For your protection

Go Decks has contributed bits of sound

1348
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,100
and that was John Carpenter from Ghosts of Mars

1349
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,100
Well I noticed no one called tonight to

1350
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,520

1351
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,540

1352
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,160

1353
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,100
wasted concept here tonight

1354
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,560
What will the Aborigines

1355
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,480
of this land

1356
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,980
Ohio, the native Ohioans

1357
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,600
those of you who

1358
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,440
ride the RTA every day

1359
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,500
those of you stuck in

1360
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,400
traffic, those of you who

1361
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,280
can't pull up your pants without the help

1362
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,540
of a trained physician

1363
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,300
what will happen to you?

1364
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,300
A doctor

1365
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,600
E.L. Smits

1366
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,280
of the University of Southern Colorado

1367
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,540
had a few brief words

1368
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,440
and this is what he said

1369
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,460
Apparently the Texans

1370
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,060
say they will inspect

1371
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,280
good slaves of the Ohioans

1372
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,620
during the

1373
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,220
coming war

1374
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,420
Thank you

1378
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,480

00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,860
You're back to the wind

1380
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,360
You're back to the wind

1381
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,160
You're back in your saddle

1382
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,300
You're back in your sack

1383
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,280
You're back in your saddle

1384
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,680
Come here!

1385
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,140
Bon voyage, Waylon brother

1386
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,600
I'm gonna miss you, man

1387
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
A race of Americans

1388
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,200
Just like...

1389
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,420
Just like you and I is

1390
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,940
Red, white, and blue

1391
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,360
Mamas, don't let your children

1392
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
grow up to be lonesome cowboys

1393
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,100
Die now

1394
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,240
And pick up the inside

1395
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,120
Take it from Waylon

1396
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,500
Twinkle, twinkle

1397
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,420
Little star

1398
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,220
How I wonder

1399
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,800

1400
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,900

1401
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,440
And you're gonna want

1402
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,480
Never give up

1403
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:31,740
Whatever this life has taught you

1404
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,040
You'll never give up

1405
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040


1406
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040


1407
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040


1408
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040


1409
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,080
Keep your head up

1410
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1411
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1412
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1413
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1414
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1415
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1416
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1417
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1418
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1419
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1420
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1421
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080


1422
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,080
