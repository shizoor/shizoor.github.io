00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Fuck. Wish it was. Thanks, Robert. This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,340
Robert, on the way over here, I was scanning the radio dials, and I must say that,

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,300
as far as I'm concerned, you had the best hour in Dallas. Thank you very much.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,540
For the next hour, sit quietly, and we will control all that you see and hear.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
This is J.D. Uyerevan.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,940
We got puppet boys!

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,980
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,120
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,620
There is absolutely no other possibility.

You are about to participate in a great adventure.

13
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,980
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

14
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,160
The Subgenius Hour of Sight!

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,340
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,120
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then,

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,440
and they were hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

19
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,980
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,420
Subgenius.

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,080
Hour of Slack, number 51.

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,600
The long-awaited Subgenius Anti-Drug Special.

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Part 1.

24
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Take 1.

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,500
This one's for Dr. X.

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,220
May he rest in peace.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,480
Now, you're saying...

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Now, Reverend Stang, what is this?

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,820
The Subgenius Anti-Drug Special?

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,520
What is it?

31
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,940
The Church of the Subgenius joining with the conspiracy?

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,860
What is it?

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:02:59,980
What is it?

34
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


39
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


40
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980

00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980

00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980

00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,160
The big fad of anti-drug mega-hype and holier-than-thou witch-burning?

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
And I answer, nay, nay.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
This is the anti-mega-hype we're hyping.

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,900
Not that we've ever condoned drug addiction.

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,460
Of course not, friends.

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,580
This is a church.

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,680
The only drug you need is Bob, my friend.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,600
Bob will get you high and keep you there.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,980
No, we're just anti-drug.

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
Anti-certain drugs, just like the conspiracy is.

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,680
They only hate the drugs that they're not on.

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,480
Death to pushers.

65
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,460
That's what Ronald and Nancy, if that really is her name, Reagan, say.

66
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,000
The death to pushers.

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,060
Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,680
And yet, dear friends, they continue to use the United States government

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,860
to support the tobacco industry.

70
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,000
And the alcohol.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,740
The alcohol industry.

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh, oh, but we're only against drugs, they say.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,440
There's nothing wrong with being able to have a little drinky-winky now and then, is there?

74
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,800
And one cigarette never killed anybody.

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,720
Unless it's lit right next to a leaky tank full of church air.

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,680
That's what Ronald Reagan says.

77
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,280
Oh, death to marijuana pushers.

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,480
But subsidize the tobacco industry and the liquor industry.

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, friends, you know, lips that have touched the bottle will never touch mine.

80
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:47,180
Though I do partake occasionally of the holy FROP admixture prescribed by my personal physician, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,860
But like Bob himself said, I FROP that others may live.

82
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,760
And, friends, FROP ain't one of those conspiracy street drugs.

83
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,380
Uh-uh.

84
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
But we'll be talking about it.

85
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,980
We'll be talking about FROP later, maybe even next week.

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,160
I know, I know, y'all want to know what FROP really is and how to get you some.

87
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,920
But, oh, we're just gonna have to listen.

88
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,900
You're gonna have to listen real, real close in stereo headphones tonight, friends,

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,400
if you even want to gain but an inkling.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,400
Drugs have become an escape for a nation of ignored youth.

91
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,380
Many parents too busy to stop, listen, and love.

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:33,880


93
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,640
Yes.

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, yes.

95
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,720
Yes.

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Yes.

97
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,240
Yes.

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,320
Bob said I'm gonna give you drugs.

99
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,140
Bob said I'm gonna give you pills.

100
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,380
Yes.

101
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,220
Yes.

102
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,440
Yes.

103
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


107
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


109
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,180
Yes.

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,080
Yes.

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Yes.

112
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,580
Yes.

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,620
Yes.

114
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,640


115
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,660
Yes.

116
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:27,680
Yes.

117
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,680


118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,680


119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,680


120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,680


121
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,680


122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,680


123
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,700
Yes.

124
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:27,900
Yes.

125
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:27,940
Yes.

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:27,960


127
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,420
Yes.

128
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,380
in her nice soft dress.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,380
Hi, Mr. Valium.

130
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,720
Hi.

131
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,940
Well, today we're going to make sure

132
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,420
that everybody feels okay.

133
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,760
That's a really long picnic they're having.

134
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,560
Yes, they're eating Kool-Aid and pills.

135
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,180
Oh, well.

136
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Miss Valium.

137
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,340
Well, I'm sad today.

138
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,780
Pills for the bad and pills for the good.

139
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,220
Pills for the young and misunderstood.

140
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,640
Yeah, pills.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Pills.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
Talking about pills now.

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,960
Pills.

144
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,160
Well, pills in my hamper.

145
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,860
Pills in my socks.

146
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,820
Pills in my woods.

147
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,740
And pills on the rocks.

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,560
Yeah, pills.

149
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
Pills.

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,140
Talking about pills now.

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,800
Pills.

152
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,500
Pills are the kind of things to do.

153
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Pills are better friends than you.

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,640
Yeah, pills.

155
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,800
Pills.

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,080
Talking about pills now.

157
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,760
Pills.

158
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,900
Pills.

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,320
Pills.

160
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,520
Pills.

161
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,700
Pills.

162
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,180
Yeah, Pills.

163
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


164
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


166
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


167
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


168
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


169
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


170
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


171
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


172
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


173
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


174
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,180


175
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,980
Give me those pills, Bob.

176
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,900
Can we have some pills over here, please?

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,880
Here, have some pills.

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,280
Hmm.

Take some more of these pills.

More pills.

181
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,260
In the morning.

Oh, dear, I thought for thee.

225
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:32,420
In the U.S. today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

Thirty-five percent of all students use drugs at least once a month.

227
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,980
It isn't all the illicit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

228
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,940
We have a panacea in America that is a clear, precisable problem.

229
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,720
The farmer, he got plowed.

The bricklayer got plastered.

231
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,080
The mechanic, he got tamed.

232
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200
And the construction worker got blasted.

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,040
And daddy beat up mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

234

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,260
And everybody's wasted.

236
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,740
And everybody's drinking on the job.

237
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,660
And everybody's drunk.

238
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,400

00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,200
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,740
A whole lot of things I'll never be.

249
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,040
The generation that would change the world is still looking for its place.

250
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,040

So I don't have to see the car keys.

254
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,680
When I walk through the door, I hear the sound of my keys being pushed across the wall.

255
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


256
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,480

Hey, get your hands off me. I don't want to leave.

298

Must be some way out of here.

I'll change the air. That's what I'll do.

305

Land of the pharaohs.

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,600
That sounds great.

312
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,340
Don't worry.

313
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,100
Just look at the illustrated one.

314
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,040

No, it's established.

317
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,700
Are there no prawduding signs that we're direct?

318
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,780
You g slope to be safe.

319
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,780

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,780


321
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,780


322
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,780


323
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,780


324
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:00,780


325
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,640
Mama! Papa!

326
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,500
Watch out! Here's the police!

327
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:17,160
The madness is a journey to hell,

328
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,520
that the brain is crippled and swollen.

329
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,000
In ever-changing dimensions,

330
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,860
the Ruth Khan this poor girl who's trapped in this life

331
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:36,660
때문에 l'onestiment

332
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:52,140
sans un Żrzeg n' whipping.

333
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,500
And surely you can't deny

334
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,680
that you're the real Reese and Reese struggled

335
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:57,840
with this election especially in front of a campaignable American rich,

336
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:57,980
not someone behind this ballot that like a rainstorm of védero!

337
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:57,980


338
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:57,980


339
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,420
and all the longpox.

340
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,820
Oh, darling, I remember when the least little problem

341
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,600
used to put you right to sleep.

342
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,300
Oh, not anymore, Matt.

343
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,280
Today's modern, now a go-go woman

344
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,620
just pops these simple little pills

345
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,520
called Angadream.

346
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,780
Swell demonstration, eh, Sarge?

347
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,300
It's routine.

348
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,100
Maybe.

349
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,640
But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills,

350
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,000
he'd snap my head off.

351
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,660
Here, try one of mine.

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,280
Oh, yeah?

353
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,800
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week,

354
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,660
and he's a change.

355
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,320
And welcome, dear friends,

356
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,440
to the Hour of Slack

357
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,040
on KNON.

358
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
Praise Bob!

359
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,940
Good. Open your mouth, Jeff.

360
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,460
No, I don't like pills.

361
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,640
It really does help take the trouble out of falling asleep.

362
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,640
The haunting reality is

363
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,300
that any one of these addicts,

364
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,260
prostitutes, or runaways

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,020
could be your child.

366
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,080
There was me.

367
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
That is Alex.

368
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,060
And my three droogs.

369
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,600
And their enemy is the God-centered family.

370
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,920
An 18-year-old teenager named Diane,

371
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,580
living here in Hollywood,

372
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,860
took her life.

373
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,880
She was under the influence of LSD.

374
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,700
She had experimented with it

375
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,440
as a result of peer pressure from her friends.

376
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,700
This young lady had everything in the world to live for.

377
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,600
She had just won a Grammy Award,

378
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,800
she was signed for a television series.

379
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,420
Today, drugs and alcohol

380
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,780
have replaced baseball and football

381
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,080
as the national pastimes.

382
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,300
We are producing a country

383
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,780
without a future.

384
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,000
Any punk will tell you there is no future.

385
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,360
They don't think about it.

386
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,360
They wallow in just now operating theater.

387
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,700
They only have the present.

388
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,020
I can't hold my breath

389
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,240
any longer in front of the policeman.

390
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,420
I have no choice but to go with him.

391
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,840
See what he has to say.

392
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,720
I'll minister to him.

393
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,140
I've tasted the dew

394
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,600
on the lips of sweet death herself.

395
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,380
You were right, Paul, when you said

396
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,060
that someday we'd all live in the treetops.

397
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,120
Like apes, like monkeys,

398
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,060
like rodents,

399
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,300
like vermin,

400
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,320
like the squirrel

401
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,220
that found itself electrocuted.

402
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,040
On my electric fence,

403
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,800
the one I use to keep Zandy inside,

404
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,680
and the dogs,

405
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,460
the squirrels can't take the voltage.

406
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,320
They fry, they die convulsing.

407
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,120
They suffocate

408
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,060
because their lungs can't take in another breath.

409
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:06,380
But yet, their brains are aware of the terror.

410
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,060
My little boy walked out one morning

411
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,300
and he said,

412
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,300
Daddy, is the squirrel sleeping?

413
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,680
Is the squirrel sick?

414
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,600
I said, no!

415
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,280
My child, the squirrel's not sleeping.

416
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,340
The squirrel's not sick.

417
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,100
The squirrel is dead.

418
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,900
The squirrel will not come back.

419
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,080
The squirrel can't be fixed.

420
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,480
It turned into a skeleton.

421
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,380
A squirrel skeleton.

422
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,960
My son said,

423
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,560
Father,

424
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,420
I want to be like that squirrel.

425
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,380
I, too, want to be a skeleton.

426
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
You can't arrest me, officer.

427
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,940
I'm not drunk.

428
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,040
I might be half-ass drunk, though.

429
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,740
말층

430
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,780

And I'm having fun

459
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,040
Stopped on a hill

460
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,420
Cause I had to take a pill

461
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,400
But I couldn't quite find my tongue

462
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,900
Have ass drunk

463
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,540
Hell, I can see

464
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,140
Well, they said the light was red

465
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,180
Now a couple of folks

466
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,100
Well, there was 22 mangled

467
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,920
And there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good

468
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,640
He had to sort of walk like this

469
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
For the rest of his life

470
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,020
Well, there was one guy

471
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,000
It was pretty neat

472
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,120
He was hurt pretty good, I guess

473
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,740
They had like this machine that was like hooked up

474
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,960
Where he had this tube running up through his nose, you know

475
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
And that was the only way he could breathe

476
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,460
And well, there was this one dude

477
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,280
It was like a blade had chopped straight down on his toes

478
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,200
And last I heard, he still couldn't walk

479
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
There was one guy

480
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,060
Well, this is what's weird

481
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,920
They found parts of him on the front of the car

482
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,100
And other parts of him on the back of the same car

483
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,740
I mean, it sort of defies

484
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,180
The mind, doesn't it?

485
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,000
How you could find pieces of the same person

486
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,120
On the front and back of the same car

487
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
I mean, I just don't understand

488
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,320
They ought to run some kind of scientific test

489
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,140
I don't even see how that could even happen

490
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,820
And a couple of folks dead

491
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,400
Well, it sure looked green to me

492
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,920
Have ass drunk

493
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,880
Hell, I wish I was

494
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,180
Turned a brand new Trans Am into an old tin can

495
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,220
Trying to outrun the fuzz

496
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,340
Have ass drunk

497
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,160
I'm a victim of lies

498
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,320
Well, there's nothing wrong with me, your honor

499
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,080
I can see, hell, I got you damned

500
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,200
You dug your eyes

501
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,540
Have ass drunk

502
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,280
Oh, woe is me

503
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:41,800
You know the fact that I detain schools

504
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,900
And I try to stand and win

505
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,200
And play a good spoonful of magic

506
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,680
But why would I Л banget

507
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:49,680


508
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:49,680


509
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,280
And I want a rich day

510
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,640
Or maybe you're sick

511
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,960
Maybe a damn deficit

512
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:51,960


513
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,620
But nobody on the World banyak

514
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,980
T diminished

515
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,700
It's not just a fucking machine

516
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,520
You know all my dead 300 bags

517
00:33:59,520 --> 00:33:59,520


518
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,840
But all I can think of

519
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,560
Did not even mean a thing

520
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,960
I could have been gone for more

521
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,900
Held up in an intensive care ward

522
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,740
Lying on the floor

523
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,800
I was gone for all those days

524
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,300
But I was not all alone

525
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,900
I made friends with a lot of people

526
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,220
In the danger zone

527
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,220
See my lonely

528
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,720
In the danger zone

529
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,060
I was gone for all those days

530
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,520
I see it every day

531
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,000
See my lonely

532
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,480
In the danger zone

533
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,000
Since I've gone away

534
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,400
I'll tell them when to bother

535
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,620
And I'll raise the rainbow

536
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,480
I got a good chance

537
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,720
I'll tell them when to bother

538
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,680
The push

539
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,520
Now imagine a world where

540
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,420
Heroin was legal

541
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,700
But possession of coffee

542
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,360
Was punishable by up to

543
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,480
50 years in jail

544
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,580
In other words, friends,

545
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,520
Think of a world where you could run down

546
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,280
To the nearest convenience store

547
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,880
Just about any time of day or night

548
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,880
And purchase any amount of liquid heroin you wanted

549
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,320
A whole bottle of heroin

550
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,020
Would be about three bucks

551
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,000
Or you could go down to a heroin den

552
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,540
And sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies

553
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,100
Until about 2 a.m.

554
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,720
Then you'd get on the expressway

555
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,940
And drive home

556
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,860
Or, for that matter, folks

557
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,520
In the heroin world

558
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,720
You could go down to a heroin den

559
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:30,720


560
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:30,720


561
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:30,720


562
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:30,720


563
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,720
Where, imagine that the authorities

564
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,400
Making heroin so much a part of their business world

565
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,580
That nobody closed a big business deal

566
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,020
Without having a few shots of smack with the client

567
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,400
When there'd be billboards all over the roads

568
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,540
For the coolest brands of heroin

569
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,080
Showing beautiful models

570
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,860
Skin popping next to a waterfall

571
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,420
And on TV, well, not only would there be

572
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,600
All these ads showing your favorite sports heroes

573
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,720
Shooting their friends

574
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,960
And their favorite brand of heroin

575
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
But in any party scene

576
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,920
Any scene of any TV show

577
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,900
Where people were shown relaxing

578
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,180
Or having a good time

579
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,620
Well, they're always taking

580
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,080
Just a few little sniffs of smack

581
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,680
Now, the leaders of a world like that

582
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,660
Would have to be pretty insane, right?

583
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,480
I mean, it'd be obvious

584
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,900
That the leaders themselves

585
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,920
Were not only heroin users

586
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
But stood to gain quite a bit

587
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,720
From the whole population

588
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Aside from a few of them

589
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:30,720


590
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,440
And a few anti-heroin fanatics

591
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,040
Leaning on this substance to relax

592
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,760
But let's take it a step further, friends

593
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,300
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal

594
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,720
Because they said it was addicting

595
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,760
And it led to harder stuff like espresso

596
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,600
But yet untold millions of people

597
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,780
Had been drinking coffee for thousands of years

598
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,780
And no one had ever OD'd

599
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,320
You drink it and it sharpens you up a bit

600
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,940
And then later you crash a bit

601
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,220
But it was, it's so illegal

602
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,740
That the smugglers are getting fantastically rich

603
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,140
Having contraband coffee beans

604
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,860
Flown up from South America

605
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,740
And there'd be this whole subculture of bean heads

606
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,860
People that were into coffee

607
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,600
Partly as a rebellion against the establishment

608
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,560
And the whole reason that coffee led to harder stuff

609
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,220
Like espresso or NyQuil

610
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,320
Was because to buy coffee

611
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,400
You had to go to a coffee dealer's house

612
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,040
A pusher's house

613
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,200
Where you'd encounter people who were not coffee lovers

614
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,200


615
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,200


616
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,940
People who were espresso users

617
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,420
And on top of that

618
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,120
A one ounce bag of coffee beans

619
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,760
Would cost like a hundred bucks

620
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,700
Just for an ordinary Maxwell House grade

621
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,620
And people would be arrested

622
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,940
And spend their whole lives in jail

623
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,640
Maybe even be executed for using coffee

624
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,500
Which is relatively harmless

625
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,880
While this whole planet of junkies

626
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,220
Was going scot-free

627
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,160
And President Reagan would be up

628
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,400
You'd see him in the news

629
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,200
At, you know, partying with world leaders

630
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,480
All of them snorting a bit of smack

631
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,340
And shooting up

632
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,440
Imagine what a horrible, topsy-turvy world

633
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,420
That would be, friends

634
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,960
Where they made a powerful

635
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,200
Central nervous system depressant

636
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,640
Not only legal

637
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,100
But glamorous

638
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,780
While an organically grown

639
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,560
Harmless bean off of a bush

640
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,200
Could wreck your life

641
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,820
Only because of the laws against it

642
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,520
But

643
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,000
But

644
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,200
But that could be

645
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,480
That could never happen here

646
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,460
No, not in this world, friends

647
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:34,880
Nah

648
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,760
Nay, nay

649
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,340
Couldn't happen

650
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,780
No way, baby

651
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,180
We're an enlightened people here

652
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,180
So just forget that little allegory

653
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,640
You know, let's not get depressing about it, friends

654
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,320
Let's

655
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,600
Let's just lean back with a good stiff

656
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,600
Drink

657
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,800
And forget it

658
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,380
And just give it a shot

659
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,600
And praise God

660
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,220
That's the best thing you can do

661
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,560
Doctors smoking

662
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,180
Nurses smoking

663
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,900
Judges smoking

664
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
Even the lawyer too

665
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,680
So you've got to live on like me

666
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,080
Is that a prop?

667
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,860
This is half a prop as if you lost it.

668
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,520
You can smell it. It doesn't smell like marijuana at all.

669
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,300
It's got a very pungent odor.

670
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,100
I don't like this stuff.

671
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,960
It is free.

672
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,020
We have to smoke it. It's one of the rules.

673
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,720
We're talking about a barrel of Havifrom.

674
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,600
We're talking about a void, a limitless void of Havifrom.

675
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,520
We're talking about several alternate realities.

676
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,700
We're talking about your basic...

677
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,440
We're talking about putting it in your pipe and smoking it.

678
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,720
And another thing I want to tell you about tonight,

679
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,160
we've had some calamitous times in Malaysia.

680
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,940
You might have heard about a couple of times

681
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:25,940


682
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,140
about all the rains we had.

683
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,520
Yes, dear friends, it was flooding over here,

684
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,720
but oh, Bob, oh, good old Bob knew

685
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,220
that when it flooded in Malaysia,

686
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,840
you better build your houses on stilts.

687
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,020
So all our houses are built on stilts over here, dear friends.

688
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,660
Ha-ha.

689
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,880
We knew a long time ago that when those floodwaters came,

690
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,920
we better be sitting pretty, sitting high,

691
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,840
so nobody can come by.

692
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,080
And speaking of sitting high,

693
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,200
we need something over here in Malaysia.

694
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,220
Yes, our whole drug cabinet was washed away.

695
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,460
And after a flood, you know, we need some drugs.

696
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,440
We need some drugs that can help the people out here.

697
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,480
So what I want you all to do, dear friends...

698
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,180
Something was missing.

699
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,460
It was Mike Hills.

700
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,500
I wonder if that guy bombed or not.

701
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,020
I guess I better run over there.

702
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm going down this dark river.

703
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:22,960
Doug, Doug.

704
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,120
Yeah.

705
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh, yeah, okay, what?

706
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,680
Down here.

707
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,740
Oh, okay.

708
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,600
Where are we going?

709
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,540
The dark river.

710
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,400
Where are we going?

711
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,960
Tunnel ride.

712
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,860
Don't worry.

713
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,680
Just, like, hand the guy a cure.

714
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,140
That guy took all my pills.

715
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,280
Yeah, well, don't worry about those pills.

716
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,000
You don't need those pills anymore.

717
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,220
Okay, well, I still got my tape recorder and my camera.

718
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,980
You don't need those anymore either.

719
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,760
Give them to me.

720
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,580
Come on.

721
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,500
Come on.

722
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,960
Whoa, look out.

723
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,520
Whoa.

724
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,140
Whoa, Doug.

725
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,060
Charlie's enormous mouth.

726
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,840
Well, it's all right.

727
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,240
The girl's got a very large mouth.

728
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,160
But it's all right.

729
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,140
Her teeth look okay.

730
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,020
She must be brushing them quite a bit.

731
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,340
Of course, her mouth is extra large.

732
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:31,800
And we can only assume as to how she's been using it.

733
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,480
Charlie's enormous mouth.

734
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,200
Well, it's all right.

735
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,660
The girl's got a very large mouth.

736
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,400
But it's all right.

737
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,460
She's got lips all around the hole where she puts her food in.

738
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,020
Oh, yeah.

739
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,480
Oh, yeah.

740
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:52,480


741
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,840
They call it the mouth.

742
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,920
They call it the mouth.

743
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,980
They call it the mouth.

744
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,040
Which is as good a place as any for a tongue to include in.

745
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,340
That's why they call it the mouth.

746
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,520
They call it the mouth.

747
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,660
They call it the mouth.

748
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,780
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

749
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,220
Kind of young, kind of wild.

750
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,540
Charlie's enormous nose.

751
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,060
We're all talking about it.

752
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,060


753
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,540
It's all right.

754
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,740
The girl's got a very large nose.

755
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,540
But it's all right.

756
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,400
She once was okay, but she's been blowing it quite a bit.

757
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,660
Of course, her friends are extra large.

758
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:50,100
And we can only assume as to how she's been using it.

759
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,680
Charlie's enormous nose.

760
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,460
Well, it's all right.

761
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,840
The girl's got a very large nose.

762
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,720
But it's all right.

763
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,480
She's got stuff all around the hole where she puts her food in.

764
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,780
They call it the mouth.

765
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,960
They call it the mouth.

766
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,000
They call it the mouth.

767
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,120
And when it finally rocks away, I guess you'll probably try the drug again.

768
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,040
When you finally get it.

769
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,340
They used to call it the nose.

770
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,440
They call it the nose.

771
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,560
They call it the nose.

772
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,400
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

773
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,260
Kind of young, kind of dead.

774
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,520
Charlie's disgusting brain.

775
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,320
Well, it's all black.

776
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,640
The girl's got a very dead brain.

777
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,440
It won't come back.

778
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,320
She used to convey.

779
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,280
But then she took an extra hit.

780
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,420
Of course, her friends are extra dumb.

781
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:06,240
And they were terribly excited while they watched her do it.

782
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,360
Charlie's disgusting brain.

783
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,140
Well, it's all black.

784
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,480
The girl's got a very dead brain.

785
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,200
It won't come back.

786
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,100
She got dirt all around the hole.

787
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,160
Where they don't dirt box it.

788
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,340
They call it the grave.

789
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,520
They call it the grave.

790
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,580
They call it the grave.

791
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:39,420
Which is as good a place as any for a chump to be posing.

792
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,960
That's why they call it the grave.

793
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,080
They call it the grave.

794
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,220
They call it the grave.

795
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:11,720
And all around at the side of the grave stood Charlie's friends who could not save this stupid girl from the way she behaved.

796
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,260
And all around at the side of the grave stood Charlie's friends who could not save this stupid girl from the way she behaved.

797
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,280
But among the mourners and the frowners,

798
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,800
They cried away.

799
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,040
And in August,

800
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,620
And in August,

801
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,880
In August,

802
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,480
In August,

803
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,040
No, I ain't got enough.

804
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:48,780
No, no,

805
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,960
Also, it doesn't exist.

806
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,540
And they are shooting each other because of a new prize.

807
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,360
Billions of dollars in American money.

808
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,360
The hard-earned or hard-stolen dollars of America's heroin addicts.

809
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,180
Can't you want any of this junk, huh?

810
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,900
Go to it, boys.

811
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,900
But this young girl, 14 years of age, in the eighth grade,

812
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,040
recently took 50 pills to take her life.

813
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,620
She has slit her wrist and she's been into heavy drugs.

814
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,240
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

815
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,980
I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions.

816
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,680
My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

817
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,160
Are you certain you know what reality is?

818
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,620
No matter what I do to change it,

819
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,500
Normal I remain.

820
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,660
Normal can be just as bad as riding in a wheelchair.

821
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:10,100
Today, serious heresy is a deviant state of consciousness.

822
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,400
Not so much deviant opinions

823
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,160
as having a clear view of the world.

824
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,160


825
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:24,020
It's a kind of experience which is different from regular experience.

826
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,280
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

827
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,980
And therefore, if a person has so-called strange experiences

828
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,320
and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people,

829
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,140
he is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

830
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,260
Are you feeling all right?

831
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,400
Because people feel,

832
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,840
distinctly uncomfortable,

833
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,340
when they realize that they're in the presence of someone

834
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,560
who's experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

835
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,700
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

836
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,840
They look like a human being,

837
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,400
but because the state of experience is so different,

838
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,080
you wonder whether they really are.

839
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,080
And in rather the same way,

840
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,300
in a very everyday kind of circumstance,

841
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,300
when you're sitting in a bar drinking,

842
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,460
and you find you have a drunk next to you,

843
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,480
and he turns to you and says,

844
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,160
I say,

845
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,100
And you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man.

846
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,000
Because he's become, in some way,

847
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,760
what we mean by non-human.

848
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,760
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow,

849
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,760
increasingly cloudy skies once again,

850
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,040
with some rain in the forecast.

851
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,500
So I found this little dish, crawled in, and I say I'm happy.

852
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:56,280
Then I pulled up on the cat dois,

853
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:06,800
and I figured this guy that I just called,

854
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,160
Hey, чем essayer look at this kid menu,

855
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:16,160


856
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:16,280
I just bought some部 1BStar and some

857
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,280


858
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,140
You want some cappuccino?

859
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,060
Yeah, hell yeah!

860
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,880
I have an espresso machine in there.

861
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,480
Espresso.

862
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,760
Yeah, what would you do?

863
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:33,840
I feel the need to express myself into a cup and then pour it back into the spot in which I want to pour it into my shoes.

864
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,500
And I will be reborn again.

865
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,240
A man of caffeine.

866
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,380
Y'all get your little whiskey, get your little snort, get your little reefer, get your little uh...

867
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:50,280
You serious? The plain people that's fixing to kill you, pushing the drugs out here for you. How many of y'all know that? Let me see your hands.

868
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,980
Some of y'all got your hands up, got a reefer in your pocket.

869
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:59,180
And we sat in the Corova Milk Bar trying to make up our razzle-docks what to do with the evening.

870
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,200
The Corova Milk Bar sold Milk Plus.

871
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,160
Milk Plus, Velocet, or Synthamesque, or Drencrum, which is what we were drinking.

872
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,360
This would sharpen you up and make you ready for the best.

873
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,220
A little bit of the old ultra-violence.

874
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,260
And they got your hands so messed up, everybody got their high and don't like nobody else's.

875
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,720
Yeah, the whiskey drinkers have always looked down on the wine-o's.

876
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,800
Reefer smokers now got an attitude about whiskey drinkers.

877
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,280
And all at once the cocaine snorters think they're more sophisticated than the reefer smokers.

878
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,920
And the coffee drinkers hate them all.

879
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:53,120
And yet there is more stomach cancer caused in America every day from drinking coffee than lung cancer from smoking cigarette.

880
00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:02,700
And after enough of us been riding it long enough, Harvard University with their old tricky self has finally come out now and said,

881
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:08,720
cancer of the colon is caused more from drinking coffee than anything else.

882
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,960
And to show you how insignificant nothing they got you, ain't nothing you can do about it.

883
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,160
But keep on drinking coffee.

884
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,320
It's my impression...

885
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,120
I'm not talking about manslaughter, I'm not talking about...

886
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,820
Milk plus valisette or sent to masco.

887
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,320
A lot of the evangelical leaders seem to have forgotten that.

888
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,840
Now we understand the drunk, we know what's the matter with him and it'll wear off.

889
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:39,560
But when quite unaccountably a person gives a representation that he's suddenly got the feeling...

890
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,020
that he's living in backwards time...

891
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,300
or that everybody seems to be separated from him by a huge sheet of glass...

892
00:53:52,400 --> 00:54:03,560
or that he's suddenly seeing everything in unbelievably vivid, detailed, moving colors.

893
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,860
You say, well that's not normal.

894
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,160
Therefore there must be something wrong with you.

895
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,940
We like you and should ignore you.

896
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,960
But instead...

897
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,040
It makes...

898
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,220
Oh God, it hurts, my headaches come back.

899
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,160
Ah!

900
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,840
Ah!

901
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,300
Ah!

902
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:27,600
Ah!

903
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,600
If these headaches keep up...

904
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,340
Fuck.

905
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,920
I'll go down in the medicine fish hole.

906
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,640
I'll go in the medicine fish hole if I have to.

907
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,760
That's a big piss.

908
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,500
Oh.

909
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,520
Do you have any aspirin?

910
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,160
Not much.

911
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,040
Getting stoned on sunshine

912
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,220
Getting high on air

913
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,820
Getting to it naturally

914
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,120
Really getting there

915
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,260
Getting such a high on

916
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,340
Loving what I do

917
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,160
I'm so full of happiness

918
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,340
Hooked on something new

919
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,260
Life is such a thought trippy thing

920
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,320
Hello birdies, hello spring

921
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,980
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering

922
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,080
And I mean just what I say

923
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,800
Life is such a groovy thing

924
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,440
Don't pity me

925
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,300
I'm glad to be

926
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,760
A ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling

927
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,980
My pot is filled with flowers

928
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,620
My grass is bright and green

929
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,920
My tea is brewing in my cup

930
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,760
And still I make the scene

931
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,800
So just don't try to change me

932
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,140
I love the world I've found

933
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,500
I've got to fly my own sweet way

934
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,340
Don't you shoot me down

935
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,660
Life is such a trippy thing

936
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,280
Hello birdies, hello spring

937
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,080
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering

938
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,960
Remembering, remembering

939
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,200
And I mean just what I say

940
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,920
Life is such a groovy thing

941
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,520
Don't pity me

942
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
I'm glad to be

943
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,060
A ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling

944
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,900
Don't pity me

945
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,820
I'm glad to be

946
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,260
A ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling

947
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,300
Don't pity me

948
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,140
I'm glad to be

949
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,500
A ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling

950
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,040
Imperfect way to live

951
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,620
I've said it so many times

952
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,260
I've got to fight it

953
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,480
I've gotta walk

954
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:23,480


955
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:23,480


956
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,000
Hit by the word

957
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,580
Begins play

958
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:25,580


959
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:25,580


960
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:25,900
I'm going to fly

961
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:25,980
Be a great friend

962
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,140
I've got to walk

963
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,620
And find my they

964
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,120
You'll jeer when

965
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,780
After my well-loved

966
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:36,800
tribe

967
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,940
We boon

968
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,060
We've been curlin'

969
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,400
or not.

970
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,920
And well, friends, this is the end of your

971
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,800
hour of slack.

972
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,860
Ron Lindsey is here with

973
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,580
the Soul Oldies show.

974
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,040
And for those

975
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,880
of you who want to know what I was

976
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,640
playing tonight,

977
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,840
it was all on tape, so I wasn't cutting in

978
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,660
and telling you. You're just going to have to write

979
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,820
for information from the Church of

980
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,280
the Subgenius. That's right.

981
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,580
You, friend, are going to have to

982
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,640
dare having your

983
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,280
address on our

984
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,440
mailing list.

985
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
You know what sort of government

986
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,480
agencies

987
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,480
get hold of our mailing list,

988
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,220
whether we know it or not? Eh?

989
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,140
I don't either. But anyway,

990
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,200
you need to write to Bob,

991
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,600
friends. Write to Bob at the Church of the

992
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,660
Subgenius, and here comes that P.O.

993
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,600
Box number, friend.

994
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,700
P.O. Box 140

995
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,020
306

996
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,760
Dallas, Texas

997
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,120
75214.

998
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,060
This

999
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,320
is KNON

1000
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,860
90.9, the voice

1001
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,940
of the people and other

1002
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,120
things in Dallas,

1003
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,200
Fort Worth, Texas.

1004
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:48,520
Whew!

1005
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,160
There can be no such thing

1006
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,720
as a safe pleasure drug.

1007
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:05,820
Uh,

1008
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,760
even if it had no harmful

1009
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,400
physical side effects, it still

1010
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,800
would have, uh, it would still be overused

1011
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,920
by some people who cannot get pleasure

1012
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,740
in other ways.

1013
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,540
That's what's so sad.

1014
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,620
Oh, I know smoking cigarettes

1015
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,500
causes cancer, but I can't stop.

1016
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,020
But if them same folks told you smoking

1017
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,920
cigarettes in your automobile would

1018
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,020
corrode your engine, it would be no more

1019
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,280
smoking in the car.

1020
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,860
Now that's concept.

1021
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,100
That's what I said.

1022
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,720
Because they've manipulated us to the extent that these educational institutions ain't nothing but tricks.

1023
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:46,840
Why?

1024
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,640
Well, I didn't tell you this before, but he's an egg salad addict.

1025
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,880
You mean he's hooked on it?

1026
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,980
He's hooked. He's got a chicken on his back.

1027
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,640
Yeah, well, too bad for him.

1028
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,740
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1029
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,840
As far back as educated men have recorded, the world's largest chicken farm is a place where the most delicious food is found.

1030
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:06,840


1031
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:06,840


1032
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:12,220
And, according to the history, sales have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality,

1033
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,240
rents in the fabric of man's awareness.

1034
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,340
And somewhere in the endless search of the curious mind lies the next vision,

1035
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:24,860
the next key to his infinite capacity.

1036
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:35,580
There's reason to believe that incessant stimulation of the reward or pleasure centers of the brain

1037
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:46,120
will lead to a resetting of the pleasure threshold so that ordinary enjoyable things no longer stimulate that area,

1038
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:53,460
or if they do, they aren't effective, and one can't enjoy ordinary life so that all one has left are the chemicals.

1039
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,760
If we keep using drugs the way we are, we're going to go down the chemical dumper.

1040
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,640
Well, you look puzzled, Peter.

1041
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,080
Oh, but then you're still plain Peter Wayne.

1042
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,520
But don't worry.

1043
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,100
You'll all be crystal clear as soon as you've crossed over.

1044
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,380
Consciousness expanding.

1045
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,240
Properly induced CE will give a subject full awareness of capabilities never known before.

1046
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,100
The doses have been somewhat shorter for me the last time or two.

1047
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,260
If you can hear me now,

1048
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,980
you'd better listen to my warning.

1049
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,640
Warning, warning.

1050
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:44,580
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack to see...
