You have offended my family, and you have offended the Shaolin Temple.
Order! Order!
We've reached the verdict.
We have, Your Honor.
The verdict will take it.
The defendant will rise.
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of the crime of first degree...
Hey, look, do you still believe in an old baloney?
Shut up!
I still believe.
Praise Bob, friends, and welcome to Hour of Slack number 1098,
which will certainly be the greatest and most bobbed up show ever
due to the greatest contributors ever.
We have many new artists and songs and sounds never heard before
on this or any other airwave.
But first...

Speaker 3 robe and A,

Max bones,
like this by Just John from just-john.com. Before that, some Nor-El-Pref, but now,
by the miracle of soundboard tapes, let's go into last year's Starwood Festival De-Vival,
where yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, was preaching to the neo-pagans and the topless
hipples of 2006. You won't be able to see the video projections, however.
The Babacato by Mark Mothersbaugh. That's lovely. Turn that up just a second so we can
hear the religiousness of it.
Friends, my name is Reverend Ivan Stang.
And, oh, thank you, thank you. I am not Bob, nor Spock. Now, as some of you may have gathered,
this is all about Bob. That's this, the guy with the pipe. Can I hear a praise Bob?
That's a wonderful praise, Bob. God, I love Starwood. I love preaching to the unsaved.
And I know that most of you are,
and I'm going to say it because I don't have your 30 bucks for subgenius ordainment yet.
You can be ordained in the Church of the Subgenius for only $30. In fact, that fact is how I pay my
mortgage. People love to be ordained until rest. It is as legal an ordainment as any other one on
the planet. Believe it or not, you can, with that little card in your pocket, you can perform
legal marriages. Of course, the money is not...
It's not in the marriages, it's in the divorces. We can't make you a lawyer for $30. Boy, we'd
be selling a lot of those. Now, what we do, they call this a workshop, oddly enough. It
would be more accurately called a slack shop. Because that's what it's all about. Bob and
slack. And if that was all there was in the world, Bob and slack, there would be no job.
There wouldn't be any problem. So unfortunately, there's also the conspiracy. Those are the three
things that I'm going to tell you about tonight. Bob, slack, and the conspiracy. And if you,
at the end of it, feel like you understand any of those three things, you are wrong.
Bob is not about understanding Bob. I guess there are some religious types of people,
of rival cults here and there, who feel...
I think there are some religious types of people who feel that Bob is a good God, who is such a wimp, frankly, that he apparently needs the help of illiterate little old ladies and numbskulls to get his job done. And it always is a he.
Although I guess there's a lot of goddess worshippers here, too, but you run into the same problem. You will not...
You know, most of these gods and personal saviors, they're not...





You kind of get the feeling they're breathing down your neck, you know?
They're watching you. They're all...
They're constantly in the back of your mind. You know that big overlord is going,
Did you pray to me recently?
Because that's important to some of them, you know? They get insecure.
What happens, by the way, if you don't pray?
Is it like Tinkerbell? Do these gods just dry up and die if you don't clap and believe?
If only.
Anyway, friends, Bob isn't like that. Bob is an industrial personal savior.
He is what we call a short-duration personal savior, or a short-durper-sav in the Tibetan.
That means, you know, well, let's look at the way things are made these days.
Planned obsolescence. And that works with personal saviors, too.
Bob is not going to provide you with slack.
The joke will not last forever.
There's such a thing as a joke being told too many times.
When that happens, you can move on to any other god.
Bob himself is not concerned about that.
Once he's got your 30 bucks.
And you can get slack without Bob.
It's just that the $30 ordainment pack expedites the process by about 25 years.
But even then, friends, I don't know if I should...



You know, I mean, if I was a proper religious fanatic, I'd say that the only way you can get slack is through Bob.
And in fact, God damn it, I am a proper religious fanatic, and the only way to get slack is through Bob!
Now, lucky for you, you decide what that slack is.
And that's what it is.

In the meantime, Columbus business owners destroyed GreenleafyPrNews
in Columbus, Ohio.

In December, 2.5% after an even bigger 6.1% in November.
That was a moderate 2% jump by nine-tenths of 1%.
Analysts believe further increases or decreases are 1.7%.
For all of 2006, that's 1.1% for its slowest five years.
On Wall Street, 1245666, this is PR News.

Local police told state media that bogus PR News has sent reporters to investigate as well.

However, Jarek says 300,000 homes and businesses are still without sectarian violence to spill over into PR News in Washington.
So again, it's basically, without going into any detail again here, sister problem.
And so basically, it's basically...

Basically, basically try to use it is basically...
So basically, we basically...
So basically, right here, we are like basically dealing with a whole bunch of sources of information that are genius.
And basically, you just basically...
How can we come up with, which is...
Oops.
It's basically like...
Basically, the bottom line is that using and then design a drug...
Basically, there is a lot of blue stuff in here.
But I've noticed...
What you need to do is basically normalize them by basically...

If you enjoyed this audio program, fuck you.
Fuck, fuck, fuck you.
You, you, you.
Oh, gee, thanks, Bob You.
This audio program is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
If you want to know more about our wonderful church, you can look at subgenius.com.
Uh, and...
This show is like a parasite that lives off other shows, healthier shows, until it sucks
the life out of them.
One such show is Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia from beautiful WCSB Cleveland.
And I believe we have a guest here already.
Reverend Stan, you with us?
Praise Dr. Sinister.
Oh, I thank you.
Thank you.
And praise Bob.
Nice music you're playing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This, of course, is Dead Can Dance, and, um, the song is called Indus, and that's off the
album Spirit Chaser.
That's very somber.
Well, you know, it's, uh, it's been a somber week.
Yes.
You know, it's really funny.
Like last week I did my, uh, you know, last week in honor of, uh, April 20th, I played
a little song as a tribute to the Columbine, uh, thinking what happens, what happens the
next day, the very next day, the Columbine record is topped.
Well, yeah.
Well, that was fun.

I know what I didn't want to talk about, but I, but I was, what I was going to talk about
was the fact that I don't want to talk about it, but I know that we're going to talk about
it.
Well, we can, we can put it off for a while.
Well, you know, as, as Nenslow pointed out, 33 people get killed in car wrecks every 10
minutes.
Yeah.
You know, not even to mention what's been going on in, uh, in Baghdad the same week.
Sure.
There's much more spectac...
There's much more spectacular deaths in Baghdad every day.
And you don't, you don't get every single one of those, uh, spread across the media, but
that's the nature of the beast.
It eats that stuff up and we end up soaking in that bad news.
Uh, it gets out of proportion.
Well, maybe you have some good news for us.
Yes, I do.
Um, I...
I got on my MySpace page...
Oh, you sold out.
Somebody proposed a business deal to me to make a company called Condom Mania.
They want to make, uh, D'oh, Bobhead and Conniehead condoms.
Well...
So there were...
Actually, they didn't mention the Connie condom, but that seems really obvious.
Yeah.
Um, so they're going to have the Connie-dom and the Bobdom condom.
Uh, where our...
I suppose we'll be around for a while.

I suppose we'll be around for a while.


What will they think of next?
I get a lot of these kind of things, though, and they don't always pan out.
Yeah.
It's somebody's big, big idea, and, uh, usually they're hitting up someone else who also owns
a, a head, a smiling head trademark.
Yeah, typically the, the disclaimer would be, I stand to make a profit from this, but
in, in this case it's only like, well, if I'm lucky, I'll make a profit.
Oh, oh, yeah, I guess so.
Uh...
It's, it's a, it's a cut through a world out there, you know?
Every, every, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day,
every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day,
there's always a dollar that you can squeeze out of somebody has already been allocated
to something else, you know?
Well, nonetheless, you can, if you, uh, press the issue and, and use skillful Dobbs-approved
sales techniques, or disapproved ones for that matter, you can squeeze that blood out
of a stone.
It's done all the time.
That's right.
The rules keep changing, so why bother at all?
There's so many people who have no money at all, and yet they keep buying things and buying
things.
There's all countries that do that, actually.
Yeah, that's right.
That right there is the miracle that our Lord has blessed us with in this country.
Truly a land of milk and honey where it is possible to spend more than you make.
Well, and Cleveland is paved with gold in the form of salt,
which was worth gold to people a long time ago.
The idea of that much salt just being used all over the streets.
You know what's really amazing to me?
It is.
What's really amazing to me is the fact that they have big rocks of salt,
and then in the grocery store you find that really fine salt.
And in order to get that fine, somebody literally had to go pound salt.
It's, you know...
It toughens the skin.
Hey, do you know anything about the salt mines of Cleveland?
Do they offer tours?
Because I bet that is a very surreal looking place down.
I do not know offhand if they offer tours or not.
I believe the Cargill Company actually operates that mine.
For listeners not in Cleveland, when people around here say,
hey, I've been down to the salt mines all week,
they might literally mean it because there's a huge salt mine underneath Lake Erie.
That's right.
And I've seen photographs of salt mines, and they look like Salvador Dali's nightmare.
It's amazing that the salt...
The salt has stayed underground.
So I don't know how deep underground is it because, you know,
you think if, you know, you've got this huge lake on top of it,
you think some of that water might trickle down in there,
and next thing you know you've got a salty lake instead of a fresh lake.
But that has not happened.
Well, it's the wonders of planetary geology.
Yeah.
I know people who are into geology, and they get hot and bothered.
They get all aroused over details of tectonics.
Bring me rocks.
Stones.
Yeah.
So I can study them.
Yeah, man.
I actually once knew a guy.
He was...
He had been to school to become a geologist, and he worked as a repo man.
He was the only repo geologist I've ever met.
There's a subgenius geologist, Reverend Prostata Kantata.
Ah, yes.
I remember meeting him at X-Day a couple years ago.
Yeah, he always seems to be able to get really good jobs,
because he knows a practical science,
which apparently such people are becoming few and far between in this day and age.
Well, you know, we don't need science.
We've got the Lord, you know.
Who needs science when you've got your basic instructions before leaving Earth?
You know, that's all you need to know.
As the old Onion headline went,
Creationist Museum Acquires 5,000-Year-Old Tyrannosaurus Rex Skeleton.
Yep.
That's, you know, it's amazing they can even date it to that.
Because after all, you know, we know that these scientific techniques are...
You can't really know anything through science.
I mean, forget for a moment the fact that this message is going out over the air,
you know, through radio waves, which were discovered by scientists.
Yeah, they weren't found by accident, exactly.
Yeah, the applications were invented by scientists.
You know, forget for a moment that the scientific method is what led us to...
to...
all the great, uh, achievements we have today.
You just can't trust science.
I feel like pollution, man.
And the dis- and the death of all species, man.
Yeah, see if those scientists were so smart, they would've seen that coming.
Major funding for this ass-cast is provided by the new TNA and the corporation for the new TNA.
Thank you.
Harry Reid spoke.
I believe myself.
Bag the man, Dad.
On the matter of whether the war is lost, I respectfully agree.
We have troops in harm's way.
Right or wrong?
Wrong.
I don't believe men and women who have volunteered.
The bottom line is, I think at the end of the day, we will have the end of the day, yes or no.
Are we just going through the motions with these words?
We're going through the motions.
I-I think...
But it...
More deaths coming out of, uh, Iraq.
We need to get a good idea.
Uh, the war is lost.
B-b-failed leadership.
Disastrous.
Didn't really do it with a lot of knowledge.
Uh, that's a great Bush administration slogan.
We make our decisions without any knowledge of our decisions.
Hatch his soul.
I don't know anybody.
We lost.
The president's policies in Iraq, lost and continue to lose.
The president is-is the White House.
President Bush.
George Bush.
He's-he's all alone.
Well, I'm thinking about the randomness of it.
You know, there's great forces of evil.
Satan hacked-he's someone who was mad, who was insane, and who knows the trivial reason that caused it, whether there was a virus that affected his brain.
You know, there's great forces of evil.
Satan hacked it through him.
But it's the absurdity of it all.
Some virus infects his brain.
He becomes schizophrenic, whatever he was.
Disturbing. I mean, are we this great, pitiable, helpless giant?
You know, I-I-I just, I-I think that we lack will, we lack imagination, we lack commitment to do something about it.
The-the-the-it's just-it's just unthinkable, unthinkable.
I think people who want to kill, in this country with all these weapons, will find a way to kill and-

Oh, yes, yes.
That's very true.
Really enormous pain.

Which is still pretty good.
