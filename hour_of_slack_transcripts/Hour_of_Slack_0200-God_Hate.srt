1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
What is with the completeness of love?

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,000
I know that you love me like I love you

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,720
And there is no mistrust and no remorse

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,980
Even if it wasn't the first

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,560
I will still be your love

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
Two hundred hours of slack

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,060
Life on the air

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,540
Yes, friends, we're back.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,840
The show that...

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,880
The only radio show in the Southwest

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,360
that probably plays more pieces of music

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,320
by perpetrators of the Tate murders,

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,360
the Tate-LaBianca murders,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
than any other show.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,300
Ah, yes, dear friend.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,300
As my old...

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,760
As old Will here says,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,160
I love you

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,200
like I love you

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,400
And I look forward to...

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,420
A sub-genius power

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,860
That...

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,600
And they said, yea, though it causeth my ears anguish and my brain to hurt between my ears,

24
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,620
nevertheless it is good.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,880
Do me a favor. Me. Kill me. Right here. Kill me first. Do me a favor.

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,420
Because you're driving me crazy.

27
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,840
This is Bob speaking. You say that, you make yourself sure sound dumb.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,660
Loosen some of your halos, sister.

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
Praise the Lord.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Now let's talk about ice sheet.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,480
Yeah, ice sheet.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,440
Let's, no, let's not talk about ice sheet, dear friends.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,960
Yeah, them crazy, crazy, crazy rooskies.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,460
They sing church in a pretty white dress.

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,440
Squeezes a hem, no tie to a breast.

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,260
Sings like an angel, sweats like a thief.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,220
Bit me last night like it over the ear.

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,200
Hey, hey, we're so wild.

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,620
All your farmer's daughters gonna repunt your soul.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,820
Hey, hey, we're so wild.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,900
Dance and make a filthy move.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,700
They'd be taking union with the rest of the clan.

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,500
They bought a pack-toon to her to the Holy Land.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,280
At the shot of a virgin, she was dressed to kill.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,460
With her mad dog, 20, and her book-and-cloth pills.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,520
Hey, hey, we're so wild.

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,820
All your farmer's daughters gonna repunt your soul.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,060
Hey, hey, we're so wild.

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,180
Dance and make a filthy move.

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,700
Dance and make a filthy move.

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,520
Dance and make a filthy move.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,740
Hold your hands, hands, hands and legs job.

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:54,200
Hands, hands, hands and legs job.

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,840
Burn it, burn it, Burn it, Burn it, Burn it.

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,700
We'll be right back.

56
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:56,280
We'll be right back.

57
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:19,540
We'll be right back.

58
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,100
We'll be right back.

59
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,900
Although I'm not a small town boy, I was definitely raised among the tool-using primates of Baptist Fort Worth.

60
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,320
Well, dear friends, we've decided we're just going to come right out tonight and explain this show.

61
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,180
200th anniversary Hour of Slack, by the way.

62
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:19,220
The Hour of Slack is basically predicated on the fact that the root of all evil is not money nor the lust for it, dear friends,

63
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,260
but religion.

64
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,780
That's right.

65
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,740
We hate religion.

66
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
And by religion, we don't mean just piddling little Christianity or Islam.

67
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:36,760
We mean anything that people accept uncritically on faith, except, of course, the church of the subgenius.

68
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,920
Now, your religion might be rock and roll or sports or drugs or fancy book authors

69
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,820
or might even just be yourself if you're that conceited.

70
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,140
I can understand.

71
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,620
I understand that.

72
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,820
I used not to mind Jesus, myself, actually, just his fan club.

73
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,860
But lately, you know, even Jesus has kind of bugged me.

74
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,460
Now, if the historical record is accurate, which I'm almost certain it isn't,

75
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,800
you know, if you look close enough, even Jesus can look bad.

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,440
If anybody can, my daughter sat on my lap this morning and said,

77
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,160
Daddy, you've got dead skin all over your face.

78
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,980
And I said, well, quit looking so close.

79
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,400
But, you know, think about it.

80
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,480
The miracles in the New Testament now, you know, for instance,

81
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,160
Jesus exercised the demons out of this loony in Gabardine,

82
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:39,380
and he put these devils into 2,000 swine, pigs, and they all ran off the cliff and drowned.

83
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,900
Now, friends, back in those days, 2,000 pigs could feed a lot of people.

84
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,160
They could feed a lot of people today.

85
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,880
I mean, it's kind of a waste of miracles, really.

86
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,980
And turning water into wine.

87
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,100
Now, that happened at something that was already a drunken party,

88
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,100
and people's only complaint was that they'd run out of wine.

89
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,460
You know, couldn't he have, you know, invented a cure for drug addiction?

90
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
And curing one or two lepers.

91
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,800
I mean, how come not more?

92
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Why not all the lepers?

93
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,800
Why couldn't he?

94
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,820
He just pulled a smallpox vaccine out of his magic bag.

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,680
You know, every religious leader, from Buddha to Joseph Smith of the Mormons,

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
can cure a leper or two.

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,320
It's a big deal.

98
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,540
Edgar Cayce performed more miracles than Jesus and is better documented,

99
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,100
and he was just a hick American.

100
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,920
Now, I understand the religious impulse.

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,780
That's human nature, dear friends.

102
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,680
We need meaning in our lives.

103
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,360
And religion is the easiest way to get it.

104
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,520
It provides a fake veneer of justice and order where there isn't any.

105
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,380
You know, what's the difference between religion and drugs?

106
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,500
Either way, you're getting sedated from an outside source.

107
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
And many people combine both.

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,120
One heavy acid trip can do more to turn a person on to God in their heart of hearts

109
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,080
than years of faithful church going,

110
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,900
and what does that tell you?

111
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
It's the reason the subgenius...

112
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,840
...of this church makes such a good religion or drug

113
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,060
is because it's so malleable.

114
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,320
It's a fluid belief system.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
You can drink it.

116
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,180
You can smoke it.

117
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,160
You can eat it.

118
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,580
And you can even excrete it, dear friends.

119
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,220
But don't do that while we're on the air.

120
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,920
It adapts to any political climate

121
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,940
and still provides explanations for a screwed up world that sound good.

122
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,080
And it's honest because even Dobbs admits that that's all it is.

123
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,880
It just sounds good.

124
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,080
Although it's beneficial in a business sense, like the masons.

125
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,320
It's a good way to meet people of similar dissimilarity.

126
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,280
And many subgenii have made money off of each other

127
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,560
in productive trade relationships of all kinds.

128
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,600
Of course, the real religion, dear friends, is sex and guns, but mainly sex.

129
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,300
That's the only religion you were really born with.

130
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,200
And if you're healthy, just to squirt should provide more than enough meaning in your life

131
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,700
even if you do it all by yourself.

132
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,960
And believe it or not, the church has not been particularly helpful in this respect.

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,680
And it's not really a good place to meet girls.

134
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,080
Sure, it's worked that way in some cases, but those are mostly limited to subgenius radio personnel.

135
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,180
I believe that that's because the church tends to attract loners and eccentrics.

136
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,500
A few total idiots and mad crazies.

137
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,840
But really, the last thing a lonely loner needs

138
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,160
is another eccentric loner.

139
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,200
So, a bob and the church do not provide that most crucial element of your life

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,220
because you can't copulate with the church.

141
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,680
But it nevertheless provides at least a good jumping off point

142
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,700
for the second most necessary thing, which is fake meaning for life.

143
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,280
It reassures you that your version of meaning is as valid as the next guy's

144
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,500
and that it's perfectly okay if it's yours alone.

145
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,880
It reassures you that you aren't the only one who suspects

146
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,000
your grandma's crazy when she says all unbaptized babies will fry in hell for eternity

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,040
just because they didn't have written contracts with God Jr.

148
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,940
It's a reassurance that just reminds you all the time that that's all it is.

149
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,760
A reassurance.

150
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,920
The real bottom level assurance and beliefs that you started with are still yours.

151
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,760
You can keep them.

152
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,320
We merely provide expert help in the window dressing of these things.

153
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,780
For a price, of course.

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,860
But, you know this church.

155
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,220
The church is cheaper than most of your store-bought religions.

156
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,580
You get more for your dollar.

157
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,580
It's less habit forming and it's really easy to kick.

158
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,000
Dobbs, believe it or not.

159
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,560
Honest.

160
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
You don't believe me?

161
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,900
Because, see, Bob doesn't want to be the monkey on your back, dear friends.

162
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,260
He's got better things to do.

163
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,200
Unlike certain versions of Jesus.

164
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,940
Sure, you want supernatural help.

165
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,140
Everybody wants something for nothing and it's pretty tempting to believe you're getting it.

166
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,160
But our experiment has proved, I think, that you can get it without even believing in it.

167
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,300
It's all faith healing and placebos and Jesus is a placebo and so is Bob.

168
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,520
And that doesn't demean either one of them.

169
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,560
Although it does elevate the useless sugar pill to deity status.

170
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,760
And it's too bad.

171
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
That's the way it is.

172
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,140
And it doesn't leave you in a lonely abyss of disbelief.

173
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,800
In fact, it puts you in some damn good company.

174
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,200
You become a peer of Jesus, Bob, and the placebo pill, too.

175
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,080
You're as good or as bad as you think you are.

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,020
And I hope you think you're so good you're bad.

177
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,040
And so you therefore act accordingly and not mess up everybody else's day.

178
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,880
Thank y'all.

179
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,780
So...

180
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,700
That's it.

181
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,940
We just explained it all.

182
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,700
Now we don't have to do anything else for the rest of the hour.

183
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,900
Oh, you do, though.

184
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,440
You can call for information in Dallas, Texas.

185
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,280

188
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,160
That's right.

189
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,320
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

190
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,740
Speak to Will O'Dobbs.

191
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,580
One of Bob's chosen fishers of wallets.

192
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,680
And, uh...

193
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,240
Yeah.

194
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,520
There he is on the phone again.

195
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,220
Call in, he says.

196
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,380
This is Gil Prosciutto for the Money Mall.

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,440
At the Money Mall, we help you with the only buy-to system left in the civilized world.

198
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,340

199
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,540
Buy money, sell money.

200
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,880
Money to lend, to save, to store in a cool place.

201
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,400
Money for all occasions.

202
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,000
Money to lease, loan, dig up, burn, fritter away, hoard, extort, beg, borrow, invest, loan

203
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,280
shock.

204
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,140
You name it, we'll arrange it.

205
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,260

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,280
numbers, and the dead are missing.

211
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,420
Yes, money to buy, sell, or burn, all in an attractive package available under an unlisted

212
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,120
phone number.

213
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,720
Why wait?

214
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,460
Call the nearest office at the Money Mall.

215
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,900
False dependents, phony exemptions, notary publics, and eyewitnesses to transactions.

216
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,780
Get them all before they're hot.

217
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,160
Call us at the Money Mall.

218
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,220
Subsidiary of Great White Loan Company, Macon, New Jersey.

219
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
What does Bob do?

220
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,460
Does Bob yield?

221
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,740
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

222
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,340
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

223
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,340


224
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,740
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

225
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,880
That must be all right.

227
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:38,960


228
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,060
That must be all right.

229
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,880
Well, you know, things were different in my day.

230
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,060
I mean, these kids these days, they walk around like they were, like they were zombies.

231
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,880
I mean, that's what really makes me mad.

232
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,420
Back when I was a zombie, things were a little bit different.

233
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,920
You know, when we rose from the dead, it was at 6 a.m., not noon.

234
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,300
And we ate the flesh of a young woman's corpse, we did it with respect.

235
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,760
Respect for the woman and respect for the corpse.

236
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,240
And kids these days are walking around with just computerized this, that, video games.

237
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,320
I remember back in my day, I didn't even know what video games were.

238
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,680
In my day, just to iron clothes, we just had to heat our hands up over a stove and then just rub your hot hand over the clothes.

239
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,120
Well, it's all these body eatings that made people spoiled.

240
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:28,900
Yeah, I remember back in my day, just to even walk to school in the morning, I had to walk across the surface of the sun while swallowing fish hooks.

241
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,540
That was on a cold day, too.

242
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, in a snowstorm.

243
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
You know, the trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken to pick.

244
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,460
Like this fowl I plucked the other day.

245
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,340
Look how plump and funny.

246
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,900
I had to put it out of its misery, but it looked so funny in its little bag.

247
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,780
You can trick and kick that chicken, but you've got the right chicken to pick.

248
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,660
Yeah.

249
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,080
Well, we'll let you go back to sleep.

250
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,340
This has been educational.

251
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,800
And we'll send you a copy, a simul-fax copy of your words.

252
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,700
Write for another copy of our experiment.

253
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,320
But you're hearing right now, right?

254
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,720
You get to hear how intelligent.

255
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,680
You're hearing for the very first time the copy of yourself right now.

256
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,120
You're not going to stand up and hear my tape played.

257
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
You're going to hear your tape played.

258
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,860
And it won't be in a secretary around until you raise a part of it.

259
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,720
You might need to just take off and run.

260
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,280
Bob's running with the devil.

261
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,980
So you're going to run way to the other one.

262
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,360
One way or the other.

263
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,020
What else do you do?

264
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,420
Come on, kids.

265
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:26,920
Honey.

266
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,300
Well, here we are.

267
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,940
The park.

268
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,840
Come on, everybody.

269
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,040
Welcome to Synthetic National Park 116B.

270
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm Jack, your animatronic ranger and guide.

271
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,100
Please step on conveyor and press A for nature excursion.

272
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,400
Okay.

273
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,420
Kindly direct your attention to the astroturf and fabric forest.

274
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,480
You will notice the mechanized bears are not threatened by us

275
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,940
and will not respond in a hostile manner, unlike real bears of the past.

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,620
And over on the right are 3D computer-generated water birds.

277
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,240
Hey, that's not real water in those rapids, is it?

278
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,140
Of course not.

279
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,180
It's basically recycled liquid waste

280
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,640
and salvaged oil spills from tanker accidents dyed blue and white

281
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,940
and mechanically propelled by small nuclear rotors for a historically correct effect.

282
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,960
We're proud to say it's almost aesthetically perfect as well.

283
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,140
What about the clouds and the blue sky?

284
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Computer-generated.

285
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,040
What about the warm temperatures?

286
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,180
Greenhouse effect.

287
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,260
Not bad for New York in February, huh?

288
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,120
Yes, thanks to the efforts of one-time president George Bush over a hundred years ago,

289
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,100
real parks were cleared away and controlled, easy-to-maintain environments like this one were created.

290
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,160
Which park was this?

291
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,780
It was called Central Park, I believe, but I'm only a ranger, not a historian.

292
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,260
Please, follow me, folks. There's much more of the park to see.

293
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,520
The Central Park

294
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
The Central Park

295
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
The Central Park

296
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,160
The Central Park

297
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,940
The Central Park

298
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,660
Having trouble getting the children to eat their food, Mom?

299
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
Kids complaining that they don't like the taste of fish?

300
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,140
Try Mrs. Flaber's deflavored fish, the fish that doesn't taste like anything.

301
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,060
That caviar was great, Mom.

302
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,140
Pass the end, George.

303
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,480
Chauviste.

304
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Thanks for dinner, dear. It was tasteless.

305
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:12,820
They didn't taste a thing. And you will, too, when you serve Mrs. Flaber's deflavored fish, the fish that needs no flavoring.

306
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,020
Marge, that tasted like nothing I've ever had.

307
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,080
Never taste that fishy taste of fish again with Mrs. Flaber's deflavored food.

308
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,460
Waiter, I'd like to try some of that delicious fish.

309
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,660
But you just ate your fish, ma'am.

310
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,240
Oh.

311
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,560
What a catch. Whole fish without the flavor.

312
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,360
Try the same fish the fast food restaurants use.

313
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,420
Mrs. Flaber's freeze-dried deflavored fish.

314
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,100
In sticks, cakes, slabs, or bakes.

315
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,320
Mrs. Flaber's. That man of yours will say...

316
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,460
What was that, honey?

317
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,060
Yeah, that's a good question, dear friends.

318
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,920
Thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy up in Manhattan.

319
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,040
Uh...

320
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,540
At K-1.

321
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,180
Rocks.

322
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,840
The biggest station in New York.

323
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,720
He gets better equipment than I do.

324
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,120
It makes him think up funny jokes.

325
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,340
But those ads were all real, and those were just things he happened to catch off the air.

326
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,740
They just happened to have his voice. Thank y'all.

327
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:29,100
Oh, and now, the man you've all been waiting for, I'm sure, after his many appearances here on the show, Papa Joe Mama. Thank y'all.

328
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,620
Hello, friends.

329
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,360
And welcome.

330
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,800
Hello, friends.

331
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:33,800


332
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,500
Tonight's sermon is entitled, Free Thought.

333
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,020
You get what you pay for.

334
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,960
Now, the Church of the Subgenius has always encouraged free thought, friends.

335
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,960
Don't get me wrong. We've always been behind free thought. You know that. I know that. Everyone knows that.

336
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,360
It's only when you want to know what you think...

337
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,380
What you think.

338
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,340
...that we charge a donation.

339
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,800
And that's also why the Church says, anything worth knowing is worth paying for.

340
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:23,180
Now, you have all these so-called normals, these average Joe-blows, the mediocre majority, the folks who have to go to school to learn how to learn.

341
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,500
Oh, yes, they think they know how to think. Because why?

342
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,180
Because why?

343
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,140
Because they got a piece of paper.

344
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,300
A piece of paper, friends, that says they know how to think.

345
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,680
A diploma, friends.

346
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,280
Created, maintained, signed, sealed, and delivered by who?

347
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,640
The conspiracy!

348
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,320
Oh, sure, they pay good money for that piece of paper, too. Let me tell you.

349
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,000
Ooh, boy!

350
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,840
You pay a whole lot of money for it.

351
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,300
More than we would ever dream of stealing from you.

352
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,440
Investing for you.

353
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,160
But does a conspiracy teach you?

354
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200
What you think, friends?

355
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,460
Hell no!

356
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,620
The conspiracy teaches you what they think!

357
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:15,660
Why, they're so scared that someone out there might in fact trip upon the truth and think a real independent thought for themselves.

358
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,160
A thought-funk without the guidance of the conspiracy.

359
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:28,760
A non-conspiracy concept that they force you and everyone else to go to their conspiracy training schools.

360
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,600
For the most formative and most imaginative of their years.

361
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,140
And they won't let you out, friends.

362
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,840
Not until you conform to their normality!

363
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,480
Or one of their carefully selected alternative normalities.

364
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,280
Oh yes, you know what I'm talking about.

365
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,020
I'm talking about those hippies, those punks, those skinheads, who wouldn't be called dead!

366
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,140
Think of anything!

367
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,640
But the hippest!

368
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,280
Punkest!

369
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,580
Skinniest thoughts!

370
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,160
Oh sure, friends.

371
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,540
They think they're thinking.

372
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,500
They think they're rebelling.

373
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,760
But they've only joined another branch of the conspiracy corps.

374
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,140
Oh, they're out of the army, alright.

375
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,820
And they're into one of the other arms of the conspiracy octopus.

376
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,680
Oh, but I disobey all the laws and everything that they tell me to do, friends.

377
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,520
That's just reverse psychology they're using on you.

378
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
The conspiracy is a master of reverse psychology.

379
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,000
They want you to disobey them.

380
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,120
Just say no means just say yes.

381
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,880
Why do you think they call it dope?

382
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,700
They want you to pacify your brain with drugs.

383
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,780
They want you to transmit AIDS via every natural orifice.

384
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,040
And every unnatural one too, friends.

385
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,880
It gives them something to waste your time with to avoid getting slack.

386
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,440
While simultaneously providing junk food for thought.

387
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,440
To fuel their media hype.

388
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,320
Something for them to market.

389
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,900
And then take from the market.

390
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
And then black market.

391
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,000
And then ban.

392
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,060
And then regulate.

393
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,400
And all the while, you think it's just fabric stamps.

394
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,960
Supply and demand.

395
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,300
Who are you, Ford?

396
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,840
They do the supply and they do the demand too.

397
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,280
And you think you're so clever because you cheated on last year's income tax.

398
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,960
Oh, friends.

399
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,620
So much for your free thought.

400
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,520
It was worth precisely what you paid.

401
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,280
Nothing.

402
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,440
Nothing at all.

403
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,020
And I bet you still don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

404
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Oh, no.

405
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,220
I pity you.

406
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,080
Wherever you may be.

407
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,280
Oh, how I pity you.

408
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,640
And Bob pities you even more, friends.

409
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,980
But let us not here at the Church of the Subgenius get too smug.

410
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,440
Too self-righteous.

411
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,640
Too high and mighty.

412
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:02,100
Because, friends, we all know there's plenty of white pseudo-subgenies out there who just

413
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,980
pretend to think for themselves.

414
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,300
Why do they come to the church, friends?

415
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,280
Because they think it's cool.

416
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,860
They can't understand what we're talking about, friends.

417
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,460
It sounds like a big joke to them.

418
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,320
A riddle.

419
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,480
Something to laugh about.

420
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,020
Well, ha, ha, ha.

421
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,340
That's just fine and dandy.

422
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,700
We'll take your money, friends.

423
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,580
But we ain't touching your soul.

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,220
Hell, no.

425
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,180
And then again, it's not like you give a lot of money anyway.

426
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,420
You're afraid to know what you think.

427
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,120
You're scared.

428
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,140
You're frightened.

429
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,260
There may not be anything.

430
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,900
Well, friends, there's only one way to find out.

431
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,580
And that's to put your money where your mind is.

432
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,840
And if you don't get a quick, prompt response in six to eight weeks, well, friends, you

433
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,980
can just assume the worst.

434
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Tell them that address and praise Bob.

435
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,440
Amen.

436
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,780
Oh, yes, dear friends.

437
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,200
And you can indeed get that free information from Bob at the Church of the Subgenius.

438
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,580
You can get that free information at, got that pencil ready?

439
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,700
P.O.

440
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:06,780
Box 140306 here in mighty Dallas, Texas 75214.

441
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,280
Once again, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

442
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,040
Give thanks to Bob, our eternal hope.

443
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,180
And praise me to earth and heaven.

444
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,180

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,160


455
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:09,640
J.R. Bob Dobbs never fails. He's the living slack master of mystic sales. All you conspiracy dupes, just you wait till July the 5th, 1998.

456
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:28,980
J.R. Bob Dobbs, 1998. Invaders will come from Planet X, bringing gifts of money, time control and great sex. A new age will dawn and we'll never look back. We'll be busy enjoying our slacks.

457
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:38,660
J.R. Bob here I'm Lee, we beseech thee, help us be free from normalcy.

458
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,420
J.R.

459
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,720
J.R. We're done devoted and dumped on back. Please give us an hour of slack.

460
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:56,280
J.R. He's the bridge between heaven and earth and hell. He's the patron saint of sales. Yeah, he's doing well.

461
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:04,320
J.R. Lead your cretins and normals and hymns beware. The slack master sells everywhere.

462
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,380
J.R. Give thanks to Bob.

463
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,820
J.R. Give thanks to Bob.

464
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,180
J.R. Our eternal love.

465
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,240
J.R. Praise be to Owen.

466
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,640
J.R. And praise be to Owen.

467
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,780
J.R. You take us on.

468
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,300
J.R. We're fickle and free and we don't make no fuss.

469
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,720
J.R. At the church of the subgenius.

470
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,840
J.R. Everybody now.

471
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,640
J.R. Give thanks to Bob, our eternal hope.

472
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,720
J.R. And praise be to Owen.

473
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,700
J.R. You take us on.

474
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,480
J.R. We're fickle and free and we don't make no fuss.

475
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,620
J.R. At the church of the subgenius.

476
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,220
of genius.

477
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,480
Give thanks

478
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,140
to Lord our eternal

479
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,600
hope, and praise

480
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,240
me to owe in you

481
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,720
Jersey's coat.

482
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,020
We're single and free,

483
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,540
and we don't make no fuss.

484
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,200
Oh,

485
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,840
yes, dear friends.

486
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,520
Lovely, lovely

487
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,580
tune there. That was

488
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,840
from Tony, Reverend Tony

489
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,620
Brower,

490
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,700
a listener in

491
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,640
New Jersey, and

492
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,880
he's referring there in the song

493
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,200
to

494
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,700
Irwin, New Jersey's

495
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,760
Pope. That's Reverend Iron, who

496
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,820
was here on the show a few months back.

497
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,720
Hi there,

498
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,800
Iron. Kids say hi.

499
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,960
Uh, yes.

500
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,940
It is an hour

501
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,860
of slack, isn't it?

502
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,760
Well, no,

503
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,440
it's only a half hour at this point,

504
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
and it must be carefully contained

505
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,460
or it will reach

506
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,640
fusion point, and you'll all

507
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,140
be sorry, won't you?

508
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,900
Embarrass you to death in a few moments.

509
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,760
You need to run? That means you need

510
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,420
to premeditate your pressure points.

511
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,960
Brother Bob, the devil's after me all the time.

512
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,160
I said, wait, really?

513
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,640
Because the devil doesn't ever bother me much.

514
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,800
He usually puts a demon or two on me, and they can take care of me.

515
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,800
If the phone rings and there's somebody you don't

516
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,920
want to talk to, run from the phone!

517
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,620
Push me, push, push.

518
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,080
The octo-emet

519
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,160
nearly invaded the sub.

520
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,060
We're going to continue until we...

521
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,320
We'll fire seven nuclear missiles

522
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,140
into the fiery froth, and perhaps that'll

523
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,360
put out the fire somehow, though don't ask me why.

524
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,340
Thank you, thank you very much.

525
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,020
We're determined to go ahead with this

526
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,200
course of action. Right or wrong,

527
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,380
my country, never shall I say thee nay.

528
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,660
I'm sharpening up my knife here.

529
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,300
We're sharpening up our tools, getting ready to

530
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,440
invade Ethiopia

531
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,680
with Mussolini and his boys.

532
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,820
Oh, uh, take a look at that over there.

533
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,380
That one seems to be well-expressed,

534
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,920
but it's wasting itself.

535
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,100
Oh, that's what I was looking for.

536
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,280
The moon unaddressed with a new sun.

537
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,900
Snow gave the lustre of mid-may

538
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,820
to objects below,

539
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,260
from what can be wondered when I should appear,

540
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
but a basset hound humping a cast-iron

541
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,660
lawn deer. Away to the window

542
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,640
I flew in a flash, tore open

543
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,420
the shutters and threw up the sash.

544
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,000
Gold, gold!

545
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,840
There's gold in them there mills.

546
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,360
I'm sorry,

547
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,300
I didn't know it would be that painful.

548
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,360
No.

549
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,340
How many times have I really blew it?

550
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,040
How many times have you wished you could do something?

551
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,080
Thank you, thank you.

552
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,200
Well, now you can.

553
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,860
If you listen to Subgenius Radio,

554
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,680
you'll soon know how to confound your enemies

555
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
and even puzzle and bother your friends.

556
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,420
It's easy.

557
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,580
Just do as the doctors of the air do.

558
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,060
Listen to their inflections.

559
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,260
Copy their every word.

560
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,460
Soon you'll know that there's a show ongoing everywhere,

561
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,660
around you now, even as you think, sleep,

562
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,220
defecate or go about your family further business.

563
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,620
So remember, there's a show where you look to find it.

564
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,440
This is Subgenius Radio.

565
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,520
I'm your host, Mr. Chip,

566
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,340
and I'm brought to you by the doctors of the air.

567
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,380
I have a .

568
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,620
Okay.

569
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,360
More God hate here.

570
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,620
And watch.

571
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,980
Watch lightning not strike us dead.

572
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,560
There was this very powerful man.

573
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,660
In fact, he was more than a powerful man.

574
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
He was more like a force, of course, of course.

575
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,900
He was the one who threw the switch.

576
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,060
The switch was wired to the sun's rays.

577
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,180
Then it went right out,

578
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,060
it made the earth.

579
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,140
It did it all in seven days.

580
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,420
I did not make this story up.

581
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,480
It has been going around for years.

582
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,280
It first came out of this old book with a capital BCC.

583
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,740
They say there's wisdom in that book.

584
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,060
More than you'll find in a bottle of scotch.

585
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,980
And if you buy what's in that book,

586
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,380
perhaps you'd like to buy this watch.

587
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,680
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

588
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,860
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

589
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,480
Are you love?

590
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,680
Are you lighter?

591
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,140
Are you just a man?

592
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

593
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,600
When I was but a little lad, I stood before the throne of our Lord.

594
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,620
A wide-eyed open bundle of youth, but not quite on the search for truth.

595
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
I saw the water turn to wine.

596
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,940
I saw the church's coffers grow.

597
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,980
I saw more miracles in there than at the circus magic show.

598
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,220
There was this kindly man of the clock.

599
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,840
This man of the clock, he was a good man.

600
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


601
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


602
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


603
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


604
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


605
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


606
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


607
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


608
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


609
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


610
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,320
He took me by the hand.

611
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,360
This man said I should stand erect and wait for God and His command.

612
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,420
This man, he taught me wrong from right.

613
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,240
To love the sinner and hate the sin.

614
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,600
Only word from God I heard was not to be alone with this man.

615
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,660
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

616
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,860
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

617
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,520
Are you love?

618
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,700
Are you lighter?

619
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
Are you just a man?

620
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,820
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

621
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,820


622
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,820


623
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,820


624
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,820


625
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,820


626
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,820


627
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,660
I've got my crystals and I've got my chance.

628
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,800
The girls think I'm cool in my tai chi pants.

629
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,120
All I really want to know is what I have to buy.

630
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,360
So when I kick, I can shake his hand and look him in the eye.

631
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,600
There are so many Gods right now it just could drive a man insane.

632
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,800
And all these people say things they know not to say.

633
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:07,800


634
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:07,800


635
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,720
running around and slit your throat in his good name.

636
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,920
They all got holy beads and books

637
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,860
that make their God the one to know,

638
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,700
but I ain't never met no one

639
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,520
who's been up there to see his show.

640
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,360
So don't be coming round to me

641
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,620
with all your holy cosmic sloth,

642
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,580
and don't be showing off your God

643
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,840
like he's the latest spandex top.

644
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,740
All Christian soldiers go to war,

645
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,920
crusading for the Prince of Peace.

646
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,060
The only preacher you can trust

647
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,940
will give the most at absolute ease.

648
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,560
Oh God, oh God,

649
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,620
you give me such a pain

650
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,240
when I think of all the things we do

651
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,820
and don't do in your name.

652
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,600
Are you love? Are you liar?

653
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,020
Are you just a man?

654
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,440
I just hope I'm on your side

655
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
when the shit all hits the fan.

656
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,100
Nonsense. Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.

657
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,420
I don't feel very nice.

658
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,500
I feel as if I'm having a bad dream.

659
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,400
He looks perfectly pitiful.

660
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,320
I think it's just awful.

661
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,660
Awful, awful.

662
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,660
I was wrong.

663
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,860
We were struck.

664
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,200
We were struck for playing that awful,

665
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,280
all this God hate stuff.

666
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,840
Actually, that was Reverend Joe Paulino.

667
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,760
So he's the one who's going to hell.

668
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
Not me.

669
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,020
No, no, because we're going to quit hating

670
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,660
religion for a minute,

671
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,180
and we'll go back to hating politics.

672
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,500
Yeah, that's okay.

673
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,540
Let's hate left wing and right wing,

674
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,320
all radicals and reactionaries

675
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,380
and middle of the rotors most of all

676
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,620
from our,

677
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,320
lofty perch high above.

678
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,500
Ah, yes.

679
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,800
Thank you, dear friends.

680
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,180
Now from Metro Meaningless Mayor,

681
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,220
the last heterosexual.

682
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,340
His desire was unquenchable for the other sex.

683
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,060
His search was unending for a straight bar.

684
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,240
He was not into leather.

685
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,760
The last heterosexual.

686
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,760
You want to open your bags?

687
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,460
There was nothing in there but a vase

688
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,520
and some clutch cigarettes.

689
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,560
Oh, yeah?

690
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,680
What do you call this?

691
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,480
Blue Boy?

692
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,160
Oh, that penthouse magazine.

693
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,740
That belongs to my sister.

694
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,160
Uh-huh.

695
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,700
Yeah, yeah.

696
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,440
Sure, sure.

697
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,440
Take him away.

698
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,200
Obviously the victim of a mental disorder.

699
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,000
I wouldn't read that.

700
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,880
Friggin' pervert.

701
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,780
The last heterosexual.

702
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,760
His friends pressured him.

703
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,840
Come on, Dave.

704
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,180
The same old nitrate is bought.

705
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,140
His parents shunned him.

706
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,580
He acted like any other normal boy.

707
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,720
He played with dolls.

708
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,260
He decorated our home.

709
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,180
He wanted to work in the State Department.

710
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,080
But in the end, he was alone.

711
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,420
The last heterosexual.

712
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,280
Okay, okay.

713
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,620
So I'm not gay, but I'm happy.

714
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,980
What a person does in his private life

715
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,540
is not his own business,

716
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,900
as you'll see in

717
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,080
The Last Heterosexual.

718
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,940
Rated CA.

719
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,580
Consenting adults only.

720
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,460
Time now for the George Bush workout

721
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,080
with your host, George Bush.

722
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,380
Okay, America.

723
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's get ready to go through the motions

724
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,620
like I do every day.

725
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,160
Going through the motions.

726
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,500
Ready?

727
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,060
Here we go.

728
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,700
Pick up that pen.

729
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,060
Come on, pick it up.

730
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,560
Pick it up.

731
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,400
Now sign a veto for new welfare increases.

732
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,500
One, two.

733
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,940
Doesn't that feel good?

734
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,340
Hey, what's this?

735
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,000
A bill to make experimental drugs available to AIDS patients?

736
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,320
Veto, veto.

737
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,360
Shoot it down.

738
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,160
Shoot it down.

739
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,020
Okay.

740
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,660
Higher minimum wage?

741
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,620
Yeah, sure.

742
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,820
Ha, ha, ha.

743
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,080
No, you don't.

744
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,800
No, you don't.

745
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,720
Greenhouse effect.

746
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,640
Never heard of it.

747
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,460
Never heard of it.

748
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
One, two.

749
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,840
And stretch the truth.

750
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,200
Stretch, stretch, stretch the truth.

751
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,280
Feels good, doesn't it?

752
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,640
Now, one and two.

753
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,900
Ollie North, a pardon?

754
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,100
Maybe, maybe.

755
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,140
Think about it.

756
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,920
Think about it.

757
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,040
Not important right now.

758
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,380
EPA, not responsible for the Exxon spill.

759
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,240
One, two.

760
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
One and two.

761
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,160
And drug problems.

762
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,820
Import, export.

763
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,260
Condone, condemn.

764
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,880
Condone, condemn.

765
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,140
Now, Iran-Contra.

766
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Hey, let it lay.

767
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,460
Let it lay.

768
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
Okay, read my lips.

769
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,820
Let's put the past behind us.

770
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,540
Come on.

771
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,060
Put it, put it, put it behind you.

772
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,820
All the way behind you.

773
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,520
One, two.

774
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,600
One, two.

775
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,540
Now, this is the tough part of the workout, keeping the NRA happy.

776
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,440
Ban all imported semi-automatic and automatic weapons except the ones made in the USA.

777
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,420
Those are different from the bad foreign guns.

778
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,560
Feel the burn.

779
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,320
Feel the burn.

780
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,540
No pain, no gain.

781
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,220
Now, let's all take back the streets.

782
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,200
Come on, take them.

783
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,040
Take them.

784
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,800
Take them.

785
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,820
One, two.

786
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,600
Fight crime.

787
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,980
Thousand points of light.

788
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,220
Stay on course.

789
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,600
Quid pro quo.

790
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,200
Here we go.

791
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,680
Vo-de-o-do.

792
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,360
Isn't this fun, going through the motions?

793
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,920
This is the greatest, and you'll feel better every time you do this program.

794
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,380
I'm telling you right now.

795
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,980
You can be sure of that.

796
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,180
One, two.

797
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,620
One, two, three.

798
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,540
Don't miss tuning in to the George Bush workout tomorrow when George will concentrate

799
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,800
on development of the private sector.

800
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,800
And thank you for watching.

801
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


802
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


803
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


804
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


805
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


806
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


807
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


808
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


809
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


810
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


811
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


812
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


813
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:02,800


814
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm the Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

815
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,500
And that's it for the Bleepo Abernathy production demo, dear friends.

816
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,960
I've now played all of it on the Hour of Slack.

817
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,140
But what you haven't heard is the...

818
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,640
I have a hint, excuse me, as to the meaning of this.

819
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,200
Oh, good.

820
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,460
If you look in the National Dream Book...

821
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,300
You're hearing a preacher preach.

822
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,180
I hope you're listening.

823
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,840
I hope you're listening.

824
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,740
Ooh.

825
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,400
Ooh.

826
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,480
Ooh.

827
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:31,920
Ooh.

828
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,020
Ooh.

829
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,340
Man, those first few months I wore out three pair of breeches.

830
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,700
I learned to talk to God.

831
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,660
See, because for a person to get saved and just quit smoking, drinking, cussing, chewing,

832
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,700
and acting like they're drying up and dying, they become born to death.

833
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,000
How are we doing, gentlemen?

834
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,980
This is a good enough time for a general business meeting, I think.

835
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,320
Doctor Fireside's business meeting.

836
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,280
Now, Pete, you're in charge of our investments.

837
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,180
How are we doing there?

838
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,660
Our investitures, actually.

839
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:01,900
I'm in charge of our investments.

840
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,000
I've sold church property in Belgium, Great Britain, Wales, and southern France,

841
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,000
where the media, you know, is at least a week slow,

842
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,260
so they don't have any reports of the scandal.

843
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,520
Now, we charge extra, don't we, when they become a priest?

844
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,620
I hope we're still continuing that fine service.

845
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,860
We charge extra until a priest, by the way, because of the modern rules now,

846
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,780
is a man who has been pressed by us.

847
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,980
Yeah, well, they wear those pressed suits.

848
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,500
That's why most of them are...

849
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:26,600
Priest suits.

850
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,460
Priest suits are known as priests.

851
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,180
Most of them are newsmen.

852
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,760
Right, most of them are new, new newsmen.

853
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,520
New, news, gospel.

854
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,360
Gospel, yeah.

855
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,300
After all.

856
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,680
Right.

857
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,580
We shave their camera, right?

858
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,060
We take out all the really, you know, advanced f-stops

859
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,340
until they're really, you know, ready to open their eye up to God.

860
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,560
We keep them in until...

861
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, so that's the investiture so far for the fire sign.

862
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,640
Also, the Help the Who Fund is going on pretty well.

863
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,040
What did you say?

864
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,860
The Help the Who?

865
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,640
The Help the Who Fund.

866
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,400
We're trying to raise $30,000 to help pay for the Who's new limousine.

867
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,780
Yeah.

868
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,280
To take a little burden off the economy.

869
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,240
And I must...

870
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,740
I want to just notice to you, make clear here,

871
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,040
I went through the old...

872
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,240
old files of the Help the Who...

873
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,080
the Help the Who campaign.

874
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,020
Well, we've been helping him...

875
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,740
We've been helping him ever since we found out who he was.

876
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,340
Yeah, right.

877
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,020
65, 66 actually, November.

878
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,560
It's interesting to note that the same limousine in 66

879
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,360
only cost us $17,336.

880
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,980
And it's been going up to $18,000, $19,000 in 67,

881
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,380
$21,000 in 1968.

882
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
Remember, we almost didn't make it.

883
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,340
Right.

884
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,020
And last year it cost us, well,

885
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,440
well, it cost us $27,665.

886
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,440
So this year,

887
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,400
we know it's going to cost $30,000

888
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,280
and we're pushing for it.

889
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,460
We hope we can get all that money.

890
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,280
So please, you know...

891
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,920
Mr. Punter?

892
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,940
If I knock on your door,

893
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,040
don't slam the old screen in my face.

894
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,040
We're going to have that telethon, aren't we?

895
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,740
Yeah, we're going to have the telethon.

896
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,580
Oh, somebody just come in with a contribution.

897
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,900
No, somebody just left

898
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,520
hearing that you were going to do the...

899
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,680
The Who fund is always...

900
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,360
It's not a drag.

901
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,220
It's just kind of heavy.

902
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,780
It's super dramatic after the show

903
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,920
when they put the lights on it

904
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,980
with the lead over the windows

905
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,220
and you come around with that basket.

906
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,760
We're going to have a drawing in Butte, Montana.

907
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,020
What are you going to be drawing, do you think?

908
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,780
Uh, lots.

909
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,360
Lots.

910
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,260
Not rain or crowds.

911
00:40:59,520 --> 00:40:59,960
No.

912
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,760
Lies.

913
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,700
Cows are easy.

914
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,560
Cars are easy.

915
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,280
I can draw some of the late 50s cars.

916
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,260
Yeah, yeah.

917
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,260
Well, anyway, we've taken care of

918
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,960
religion and public service

919
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,980
and Dave Osmond,

920
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,820
who's in charge of art

921
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,200
for the Fireside Theater,

922
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,140
his report is next.

923
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,000
In the meantime,

924
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,180
all the amazing things

925
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,940
that have been going on

926
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,980
while the Chinese burn

927
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,960
rented bathing suits

928
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,120
to kill AIDS, yes?

929
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,620
Inspirational.

930
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,680
While tiny dinosaurs

931
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,760
were excavated

932
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,000
by...

933
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,460
Also Chinese.

934
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Thousands of little...

935
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,260
Here's the guy

936
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,020
pulling one out of the...

937
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,820
Hey, get away from him.

938
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,640
He doesn't really smell.

939
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,280
He works out here

940
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,220
and he never really...

941
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,240
These foul-smelling fossils

942
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,860
indicate what life was like

943
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,360
during mid-Cretaceous times

944
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
75 million years ago.

945
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,600
It may be a painful process,

946
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,000
but one necessary

947
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,080
to good living,

948
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,480
healthy toilet habits,

949
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,860
and the understanding

950
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,240
of the advancement of science.

951
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,860
With only 15 minutes remaining

952
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,040
in the subgenius convention,

953
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,520
I think we have a caller

954
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,700
now down on the...

955
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,480
So we'll go to Charles B. Howard

956
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,800
and take that call now.

957
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,920
chapter 20 eccentric sexual theories the field of sexual pseudoscience is understandably vast

958
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,820
and grotesque hardly an aspect of sex has escaped the theorizing of eccentric biologists

959
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,960
the problem how the sexes came into being did gene splicing have to do with this early session

960
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:49,500
a kind of modern occult vision spliced gene simmons on the gene hollow and dr jeans got this

961
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,800
gene what a gene pool we drew from and in this warm and turgid gene pool

962
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,380
there goes a little color dropping into the color

963
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,360
tube he tried to warn him but he didn't get the gist or allegorical language

964
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:14,700
you see on the microscopic level contraction starts and uh well it's not pretty science

965
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,920
in fact terrible the excretion contract our vacuole the

966
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,480
diastolic

967
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:34,520
a rare public appearance at on sunday that's right i'll be signing my book what you can do about

968
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,520
skeletons in the closet at justin herman plaza dust in time for the nuclear holocaust which

969
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,140
will be descending on us all what was that noise mike that sound you just heard could

970
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,480
well be the result of a nuclear explosion somewhere down here at the bottom of the ocean

971
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,940
a lot of

972
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,620
Lenovo is argumenting

973
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:52,620


974
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:58,260
educate plans and

975
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:17,660
that him

976
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,360
we may have planted seeds in the dead soil of a lost world.

977
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,260
A world that may have to go on, if it goes on, without us.

978
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Well, we don't just sit here with our heads in our hands, do we?

979
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,960
I mean, can't they be stopped some way?

980
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,320
Any suggestions, Bob?

981
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,940
Wake up.

982
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,520
Wake up.

983
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,280
Wake up.

984
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,600
What does that mean to you?

985
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,100
To kill everyone we've got to stop now.

986
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,320
Easy, Doug, easy.

987
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,860
The latest disclosure in a report from National Civil Defense Headquarters in Washington.

988
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,520
It has been established that persons who have recently died

989
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,780
have been returning to life and committing acts of murder.

990
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,440
A widespread investigation of reports from funeral homes, morgues, and hospitals

991
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,680
has concluded that the unburied dead are coming back to life.

992
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,640
I'm sorry, dear friends.

993
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,360
That was not supposed to be.

994
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,060
Broadcast.

995
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,840
Do not worry.

996
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,020
Stay in your homes.

997
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,340
The living dead are not roaming the streets.

998
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,520
This is not the evening of the rapture.

999
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,000
If a car in front of you is, however, unmanned in some way,

1000
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,480
and you see the creature, get out.

1001
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,060
Kill the brain, and the creature will die.

1002
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,860
But there is no emergency.

1003
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,840
I promise.

1004
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,020
Uh, see?

1005
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,360
See, it's soothing.

1006
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,940
It's nice.

1007
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:58,500
Actually, I had to cut that tape off so that I can play an inside subgenius joke song.

1008
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,480
But before I get to that, though,

1009
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,320
I hope our new friends on the peroxide front are listening, the H202 front.

1010
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,060
But if you are, how do you know I'm not CIA?

1011
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,120
I just might be better at it than Stillings.

1012
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,040
Heh heh heh heh.

1013
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,960
Nah.

1014
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,720
No, no, no.

1015
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,920
We're just kidding.

1016
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,880
It's all just a little joke.

1017
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,160
That's all.

1018
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:34,620
And, uh, you can find out just how funny it really is by writing for free information.

1019
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,760
We're going to give that sacred post office box number one more time.

1020
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,580
Just drop a postcard, Bob.

1021
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,360
Your friend, Bob.

1022
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,340
At...

1023
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,280
Post Office Box 140306.

1024
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,700
In Dallas, Texas.

1025
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,760
75214.

1026
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,760
That's Box 140306.

1027
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,620
Dallas, Texas.

1028
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,420
75214.

1029
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,680
And you can meet Bob.

1030
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,300
You can get a Bob in your pants or purse or whatever.

1031
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,000
You know?

1032
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,560
Whatever.

1033
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,060
Whatever you're after.

1034
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,960
But before it gets cut off, because the swinging love corpses always end up getting cut off.

1035
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:30,920
Speaking of the living dead, this, what I'm about to play, is a tune by our dear friends

1036
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:39,820
of the church, the swinging love corpses, who are from St. Louis, Missouri, manned by

1037
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,500
Dr. Philo Drummond, Captain Sphinx Drummond.

1038
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:56,400
And their cousin, Ray Hay, stepbrother-in-law's mojo and Skippy and so on, and Leif Cowabunga.

1039
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:03,140
This particular song, this is a live recording in a club, and they're singing about the subgenius

1040
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,300
get-togethers known as Doc Stock.

1041
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:12,140
Doc Stock is not like our big revival shows or devivals.

1042
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,480
Uh, St. Louis.

1043
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,100
The Nakedian Church calls them.

1044
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,820
Uh, and many others.

1045
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,360
The, the, uh, the Doc Stocks are by invitation only.

1046
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:28,260
They're probably a little more like the Merry Pranksters, uh, um, Scholastic Aptitude Tests

1047
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,420
in the olden days.

1048
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,380
Just a lot of fun.

1049
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,920
They don't happen around here, and you'll never find out where and why they do happen.

1050
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,920
But you remember that song, Down in Monterey?

1051
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,420
This, I think, was...

1052
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,980
inspired by that song and, um, the Doc Stock experience.

1053
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:55,140
By the way, lest I forget, what you were listening to earlier was a combination of the KPFA subgenius

1054
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:01,300
show in Berkeley with, uh, puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell and Bob Nelson there, uh, engineering

1055
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:08,000
and muttering, mixed with the Fireside Theater's ancient show from the 60s, from the late 60s,

1056
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,240
tapes of the original show.

1057
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,100
And it's amazing, you know, listening to that, how much of it, uh,

1058
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,680
might as well have been done yesterday.

1059
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,080
However, there were sections that, that, that I can't, couldn't play.

1060
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,760
They could play in 1968, but I cannot play them in the 80s.

1061
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:33,680
Because they, um, uh, because people would, uh, accuse us of, um, being, uh, trying to be funny about race.

1062
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,160
So you can't do that anymore.

1063
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,640
I can't.

1064
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,020
Somebody else can.

1065
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,380
And I'm sure does.

1066
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,040
Anyway, friends, praise Bob.

1067
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,300
This is the swing in love courses.

1068
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,580
Thank you very much.

1069
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,360
I appreciate it.

1070
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:52,660
Yes.

1071
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,620
Yes.

1072
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,480
Yes.

1073
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:08,480


1074
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:08,480


1075
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:08,480


1076
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,860
From across the nation they came and they saw

1077
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,080
A new world begin in northern Arkansas

1078
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,740
They drove the storm and pales of light

1079
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,920
To their new awakening and dark, dark inside

1080
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,580
They shared peace and love and through the times

1081
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,980
The eternity was there and they were feeling fine

1082
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,280
The zombies were there but they were few

1083
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,780
There were mostly cool guys like me and you

1084
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:05,040
And we got high, oh high on the dark mountain

1085
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,400
Yeah we got high

1086
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,900
Oh high on the dark mountain

1087
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,580
Oh high on the dark mountain

1088
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,440
People were happy, they were all having fun

1089
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,100
While doctors survived was farming skulls in the sun

1090
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,360
The corpses were swinging, they loved it about

1091
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,300
Average corpses floated up foot off the ground

1092
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,900
The band of dead and nine was speaking his name

1093
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,540
While half-doctors on a clamshell was claiming their fame

1094
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:49,660
Fart dog explosion and combo gang farts

1095
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,000
Finished their sets just in time for lunch

1096
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,060
So we got high, oh high on the dark mountain

1097
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,680
Oh high on the dark mountain

1098
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,320
Yeah we got high, oh high on the dark mountain

1099
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:15,800
Yeah we got high, oh high on the dark mountain

1100
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:26,980
Yeah we got high, oh high on the dark mountain

1101
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:38,260
Yeah, t- Premiere track

1102
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,880
Yeah it's a very cold farmer man

1103
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,960
We ate lots of mushrooms

1104
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,200
We commuted with nature

1105
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,460
Now were we to know

1106
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,880
We'd have to move our s**t later

1107
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,300
500 colors flashed into my brain

1108
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,560
My cell division occurred

1109
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,700
In three or four planes

1110
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,480
My brain was blasted

1111
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,100
And my head feelin' thick

1112
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,580
My eyeballs protruded

1113
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,480
But I didn't get sick

1114
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,700
I kept pinchin', fuzzin'

1115
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,260
Can't see a dot

1116
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,600
And we found that the paint

1117
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,960
Had gotten all the best spots

1118
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,380
So we got high

1119
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,320
So high

1120
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,020
I touched a mountain

1121
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,440
Yeah we got high

1122
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,420
So high

1123
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,280
On Godstock Mountain

1124
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,380
Yeah we got so high

1125
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,660
We climbed way up on top of Godstock Mountain

1126
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,140
On the way up there

1127
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,420
We shot, smoked, drank everything inside

1128
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,800
When we got up to the top

1129
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,960
I realized I was too high

1130
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,620
Oh my God

1131
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,880
I may not be able to ever come down

1132
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,020
On Godstock Mountain

1133
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,680
Oh s**t

1134
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,180
I don't think I'll get this high next year

1135
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,100
Oh

1136
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,040
Oh we got high

1137
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,020
We got so high

1138
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,240
But then finally we came back down

1139
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,140
A little ways off of Godstock Mountain

1140
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,800
I got too high

1141
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,780
How many of you had acid tonight?

1142
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,560
How many of you had taken acid tonight?

1143
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:37,680
I got too high

1144
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,580
How many people out there trippin'?

1145
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,160
I'd say about 12 people out there

1146
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,480
Alright

1147
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,240
I count 13

1148
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,040
We got high

1149
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,060
High

1150
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,160
Oh high

1151
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,380
On Godstock Mountain

1152
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,460
Now if that isn't an anti-drug song

1153
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,260
I don't know what is

1154
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,320
Because you certainly can't be left with the impression

1155
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,440
That drugs make you sing well

1156
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,660
I just wanted to throw that little joke out there

1157
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:07,660


1158
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,660
Disclaimer in friends

1159
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,860
These boys are singing about being high on Bob

1160
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,480
And that's all you need

1161
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,040
Bob's the only real drug

1162
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,140
He's the only one you can't come down from

1163
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,940
It's a heavenly

1164
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,380
Lovely thing

1165
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,440
A confusing thing

1166
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,920
But

1167
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,440
You know what good are brains

1168
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,000
In the late 80's anyway

1169
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,480
Pope Meyer has so often said

1170
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,400
Well dear friends

1171
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,200
I guess

1172
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,640
I guess we'll just say

1173
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,620
We'll just sit here and keep playing tapes

1174
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,440
Until somebody comes in to do another show

1175
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,580
And we started a couple minutes late

1176
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,420
So if anybody else is welcome to

1177
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,980
This tape will run for another 15 or 20 minutes

1178
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,380
This has been your host

1179
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,780
Reverend Ivan Stang

1180
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,900
By the way

1181
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,280
Ivan Stang when you flip the letters around

1182
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,140
Says Nat's Navy

1183
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,980
Navy of Nats

1184
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,260
Little bugs

1185
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,720
Gnats you know

1186
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,140
Hello I'm sorry

1187
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,020
The body should be disposed of at once

1188
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,460
Preferably by cremation

1189
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,800
Well how long after death then

1190
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,480
Does the body become reactivated

1191
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,840
It's only a matter of minutes

1192
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,400
Minutes well that doesn't give people time to make any arrangements

1193
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:20,920
No you're right

1194
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,300
It doesn't give them time to make funeral arrangements

1195
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,700
Watch your country

1196
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,580
Eat of my flesh

1197
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,200
Drink of my blood

1198
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,580
Drink of my blood

1199
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,480
Baby, oh baby

1200
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,480
Touch me baby

1201
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,520
Deeper baby

1202
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,380
Oh yeah

1203
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,780
Ain't you ever had sex with someone

1204
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,040
That you don't even know, yeah

1205
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,000
You think that's funny?

1206
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,900
I don't

1207
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,800
You think I'm a prude?

1208
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,980
Call me

1209
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,140
Kennison doesn't stop there

1210
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,500
He deliberately mocks Christ

1211
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,620
He even takes on the crucifixion

1212
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,460
He's on the cross

1213
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,620
30, 40 Christians standing around going

1214
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,800
It's a shame that he has to die

1215
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,900
And Jesus is going

1216
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,120
Well maybe I wouldn't have to

1217
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,940
Let me get a ladder and a pair of pliers

1218
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,240
In case you couldn't understand what he said

1219
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,860
He said

1220
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm a prude

1221
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:36,960


1222
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,320
Well Christians were weeping at the cross

1223
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,840
He said Jesus is up there saying

1224
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,320
Would somebody get a ladder and a pair of pliers

1225
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,340
Can't they be stopped?

1226
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,220
Some way?

1227
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,600
Any suggestions, Bob?

1228
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,540
Time may have come for all of us to hold our tents

1229
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,280
We, as opposed to they

1230
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,960
May have to give up this little piece of real estate

1231
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,920
We call the world

1232
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,320
It may only be a matter of days

1233
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
And meanwhile

1234
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:00,900
Meanwhile

1235
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,620
We prepare to get out just as fast as we can

1236
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,640
Not only from this place here

1237
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,880
But from the entire planet

1238
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,940
While we still have the chance

1239
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,760
While we still have the chance, dear friends

1240
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,040
I will say this is K-N-O-N

1241
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,700
89.3 FM

1242
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,480
In Dallas, Texas

1243
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,180
And you're still listening to the subgenius radio ministry

1244
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,700
Hour of Slack

1245
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
How about that?

1246
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,600
Hey, you got more than an hour of Slack this time?

1247
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,140
So I find now as some eight years ago

1248
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,600
I was doing things for the first time

1249
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,640
I am doing them now for the final time

1250
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,000
As president, I will not again have the privilege of greeting you

1251
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,500
I again assure you it has been a very great privilege

1252
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,740
To have these contacts with a body

1253
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,960
In which I find so many of my intimate friends

1254
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,980
And alongside others at least

1255
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,620
That I respect and admire

1256
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,100
Even if I do not have the privilege

1257
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,020
Of their personal acquaintanceship

1258
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,240
And friendship

1259
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,820
So thank you again and good luck

1260
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,500
And keep going, that's all I can say

1261
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,080
In which direction would you suggest, President?

1262
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,480
Yeah, we'll just keep going

1263
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,100
Up, up, up, up, up

1264
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,660
Up we go

1265
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,780
Well, they're up

1266
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,800
Yep, they're up

1267
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,300
There they go, they're heading down the field

1268
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,840
Look at that, look at them run, look at them run

1269
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,460
There it is, there's the State of the Union

1270
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,260
He's on ahead there, he's doing very, very well

1271
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,500
The Constitution now is making a little in the rear

1272
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,320
It's about three bills behind

1273
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,620
Here comes the President of the United States

1274
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,220
Here comes the Bill of Rights

1275
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,360
Coming up on the outside

1276
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,180
Pretty good, pretty good

1277
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,580
They're coming around the wide turn now

1278
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,180
There's the hoop

1279
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,220
I believe there's a penalty on the field

1280
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,640
Freedom of the press has been sent back three yards

1281
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,520
Yes, the hoop is coming around

1282
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,820
He's coming around

1283
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,900
He's coming around again

1284
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,680
Yes, he is coming around again, isn't he?

1285
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,960
Here he comes again

1286
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,820
Well, that's wonderful, that's wonderful

1287
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:04,020
That's post time down here at the United Snakes of Armenia

1288
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,200
Post time

1289
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,620
Just before the end of the year

1290
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,240
Just before it happens

1291
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,480
You know, the big bomb scare is over now, guys

1292
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,660
The big bomb scare of 69

1293
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,980
Yeah, it's all over

1294
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,600
The guy with the trembling finger pushing the red button

1295
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,820
And the whole world going up in monosodium glutamate

1296
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,480
That's all over

1297
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,620
The big bomb scare is over

1298
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,500
There's a new one, though

1299
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,200
Oh, there's a new one

1300
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,780
Yeah, the big guy, the big guy

1301
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,080
What do you call that?

1302
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:26,560
The big, uh

1303
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,480
Sonic scare

1304
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,180
No, no, the big guy, you know

1305
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,240
Ecology, ecology

1306
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,580
The big ecology scare

1307
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,580
That's the now scare

1308
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,520
Yeah, that's the now scare

1309
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,520
Well, it's such a now happening word

1310
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,140
It surely is

1311
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,540
Pollution is such a happening thing

1312
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,000
If we could only find a way of really

1313
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,840
Well, we found a way of getting

1314
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,460
I got a good idea for a TV series about pollution

1315
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,700
Curb front polluters?

1316
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,560
No, the young, the young polluters

1317
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,920
That's a good title

1318
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,260
Well, that's good

1319
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,500
We can work together on it

1320
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,400
We can take 50-50

1321
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,580
And I'll take 20 off the middle

1322
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,120
I'll take 50 out of the bottom

1323
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:53,820
You will

1324
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,940
Off the secretary

1325
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,820
The young polluters

1326
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,860
That's a wonderful idea

1327
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,200
Yeah

1328
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,400
Right

1329
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,620
Should I come in and tell you about it?

1330
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,660
Sure, come on in

1331
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,480
Open the door

1332
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,380
All right, sure

1333
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,500
Okay, we only use that door a couple of times per show, you know

1334
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,300
And I like to get it on

1335
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:07,880
That's right

1336
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,400
Now, the young polluters is going to be about this vacuum cleaner salesman, you see

1337
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:11,840
Yeah

1338
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,820
Played here by young Adam Thigh

1339
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,640
Oh, yes, yes

1340
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,840
Formerly known as Philip Hunter

1341
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,940
But he changed his name because Thigh is more of an in now happening word, you know

1342
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,460
THs are very big now, you know, ever since everybody's gums have swallowed up

1343
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,380
And they're plucked like that

1344
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,880
Well, so many of the now happening people

1345
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,620
Like pollution

1346
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,880
Use THs, yes

1347
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,300
Lisp

1348
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,960
Many now happening people, Lisp

1349
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,260
Right, they're from Lisp, but go ahead

1350
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:32,880
Yes, indeed

1351
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,120
What was I saying?

1352
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,160
I don't know

1353
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,600
Oh, that's it

1354
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,320
TV series, okay

1355
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,180
It's about this young vacuum cleaner salesman who goes around

1356
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,360
He could be a big time vacuum cleaner salesman

1357
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,580
But he prefers to be out on the street

1358
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,300
Vacuuming the street

1359
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,300
They have to defend him because his electric cord, you see

1360
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,660
Right

1361
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,200
Keeps getting, like tripping people's dogs

1362
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,120
Or getting wrapped around people's hedges, you see

1363
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,140
Or electrocuting people

1364
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:02,380
In one episode, we have him electrocuting a young hippie girl

1365
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,120
Who's stoned on LSD

1366
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,580
Yes, and who's contemplating a mass murder

1367
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,620
No, no

1368
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:07,980
Yes, right

1369
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,780
That's very now

1370
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,880
It's a love story

1371
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,160
It's a very now love story

1372
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,440
That's not what they have in your neighborhood

1373
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,200
It does not in mine

1374
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,460
Oh, yeah, I live on Now Street

1375
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,580
Oh, you do in Mod-a-Go-Go Heights, right?

1376
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,660
Sure, Mod Heights, yeah

1377
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:17,880
Right

1378
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,260
Right

1379
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,120
Later on, we hope to combine it with a medical series

1380
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,840
Yeah, called

1381
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,540
With a big breakthrough

1382
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:26,920
Because he is, what he's going to do is he's going to sell the vacuum cleaner method for

1383
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,040
these new abortions to help the birth control situation

1384
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,640
He calls it the Hoover method

1385
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,520
And that's going to lead us into an area that's never been touched

1386
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,440
Heaved by the who

1387
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,200
On TV before

1388
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,160
That reminds me, I've got a serious perspective
