1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,500
We'll be tuning in again next Sunday at 10 o'clock.

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,180
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,660
No trouble.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,000
Get set, get going.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,480
Amen.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,080
Recording.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,240
Everything's going fine.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,020
No trouble.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,440
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,160
Bob?

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,180
Bob?

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,260
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,600
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,840
What about slack?

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
That's your key phrase.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,860
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,920
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,000
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,360
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,880
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,080
Welcome.

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,740
Welcome.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,980
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,940
Before the sermon, a message concerning stops,

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,080
living avatar of slack, and saint of silence on planet Earth.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,960
Are we controlled by secret forces?

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,800
Amen.

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,220
Amen.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:54,820
Amen.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,220
Amen.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,420
Amen.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,060
Amen.

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,060


35
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,060


36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,060


37
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,060


38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,240
Almighty and everlasting bomb who came down among us to make heaven under earth,

39
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,140
lighten our darkness.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh, instrument of God, grant us thy peace.

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,540
Almighty bomb who destroyed all rebels and created angels.

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,300
Behold his glory.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,980
Behold the truth that abides in us.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,340
Reveal that truth unto that maker.

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,100
I reveal my inner self unto my God.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
Unto my God.

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
Unto my God.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:07,440
Dear friends, we have returned once again to the subgenius hour of slack radio ministry.

49
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:15,920
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with Pastor Buck Naked, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, Buddy West,

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:25,420
and a number of guest stars here to accept your pledges as our amazing volunteer test drive begins.

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,120
Because...

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,620
Ahem.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,300
You can tell just what you need around these parts here in Texas,

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,800
far out away from those Sodom and Gomorrahs of New York and L.A., the pink coasts.

55
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,680
We need to protect that which is native to our land, friends,

56
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,380
such as K&ON, the non-station that's not like those others,

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,980
and it's the only one where you're...

58
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,820
You're gonna get the pure message of slack and the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs at all on the air in Dallas, Texas.

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
Right, doctors?

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,940
Yeah.

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,780
Oh, is there anyone else here on the show?

62
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,540
Yeah, yeah, I know.

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,140
Sing live.

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,020
Here.

65
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,920
Which, uh, which microphone are you on, Buck?

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,040
This one right here at the true number.

67
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,680
Okay.

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,300
Well, since it's all mononucleosis, I can't tell which ear it's going in.

69
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,480
But, friends, that's right.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,480
All right.

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,140
The drive begins at midnight tonight, and, uh, we'll start talking about money.

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,600
You know, we love to talk about money because this is a church, a subgenius church.

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,860
Listen to that lovely harp music there.

74
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,400
Uh, Buck, that's beautiful.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,640
That's Buck on his auto harp, joined by Reverend Glenn Carlson of the Super Electric.

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,620
Oh, look out!

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,760
Yeah.

78
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,660
That was those...

79
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,180
Those sounds you hear are some of the bills that come into this station.

80
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,820
Okay.

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,100
These guys aren't on the air for free.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,180
They don't play ads.

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,740
And, uh, they play...

84
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,880
Well, you know, when you turn this station on, you don't know what you're gonna hear,

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
whether it's gonna be a...

86
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,800
Nope, it's gone.

87
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,000
Folks, hello, doctors?

88
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,420
Is there anyone else here?

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,600
Is this station completely empty?

90
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,340
No, you've got the microphone.

91
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,120
All right.

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,660
Folks, I'm just gonna have to shake into this endless box of cassettes.

93
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,340
Oh, yeah, everybody.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,900
I've gotta do everything myself around here.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,400
This is ridiculous.

96
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,860
I don't even know how to turn these machines off.

97
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,460
Look at this.

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,060
Help me.

99
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,740
Help me.

100
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,100
Help me.

101
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,580
I'll do it.

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Folks, this could be some sort of a conspiracy.

103
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,020
Stop.

104
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,140
That's it.

105
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,380
Thank you, dear friends, for...

106
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,080
contributing your prayers towards the breaking of that cassette recorder.

107
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,440
And you see, it's things like this that...

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,840
that prove that, uh, that this station needs money

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
because people like us come in here and...

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,140
we can't get the machines to stop running and we just...

111
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,900
we start hitting...

112
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,640
Red Room Stang, I'd like to break in here for just a second and, uh...

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,020
Please.

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,780
During the next show, the show after Hour of Slack,

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,720
um...

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
we're, uh...

117
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,360
he's gonna play a tape and it's gonna tell exactly why...

118
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,080
K-N-O-N is under siege.

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,620
And, uh, the station has been, uh...

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,700
socked with some, uh...

121
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,600
some, uh, unusual problems that we're gonna...

122
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
let you know about, uh, from without.

123
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,300
This is the serious message.

124
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,780
Yes, this...

125
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,700
this is the, uh, message of...

126
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:39,720
I love it.

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,160
Right.

128
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,920
This is the actual, uh, pressure that, uh...

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,440
some forces within society are putting on K-N-O-N.

130
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,280
I don't know exactly how specific they can let you know what's going on.

131
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,200
The conspiracy, Buck, is never a very specific entity.

132
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,060
Right.

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,700
You know...

134
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,060
I'd like to remind our listeners that it's all one conspiracy.

135
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,040
That, uh, Coke and Pepsi are on the same side.

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,700
They want to take away your Slack.

137
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,220
They want to take away our station.

138
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,040
That's incredible.

139
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,020
They just want it all.

140
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
That's what I've been hearing.

141
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,100
There's apparently something very mysterious in here.

142
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,600
They've got two...

143
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,560
they've got two stations right by here now

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,020
and they want to make it three and...

145
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
I mean, what the heck?

146
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,960
They want it all.

147
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,340
They want...

148
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,720
it all, friends.

149
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,700
I think they're trying to shut us up more than they're trying to.

150
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,100
Abnormal!

151
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,140
Abnormal.

152
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,260
Abnormal.

153
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,240
Probably better than morons.

154
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,300
That's what they want.

155
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,720
Yes!

156
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Your time shall triumph!

157
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,220
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

158
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,080
But only if...

159
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,320
you send your checks

160
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,660
and your lovely...

161
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,720
Well, what is the deal with the, uh...

162
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,820
the situation?

163
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,720
With the amazing...

164
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,460
Dig through the Bibles in here and the pamphlets.

165
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,800
Right, you send five dollars to KNON, you get their newsletter.

166
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,000
And, if you mention this show,

167
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
you get a free subgenius pamphlet.

168
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,900
Number two.

169
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,860
That's right.

170
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,020
The new one.

171
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,180
And, uh...

172
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,140
For twenty dollars, you get the bumper sticker and the newsletter.

173
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,580
Friends, this is an amazing bumper sticker that will bring you a great deal of trouble

174
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,540
from the conspiracy as soon as they see you.

175
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,600
So you know it's a romantic, sort of amazing thing to do.

176
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,980
The only thing that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

177
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,240
But only, only if you do.

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,640
Buck?

179
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,540
Yeah.

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,880
What do they do?

181
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,920
They do...

182
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,460
I mean...

183
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,540
Okay, twenty dollars, bumper sticker mailed to you.

184
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,940
Plus the pamphlet, right?

185
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,040
Subgenius pamphlet number two?

186
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,380
That's right.

187
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,740
All right, Doug, this is brand new, though.

188
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,440
This is not what you've already got.

189
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
This is something you haven't seen yet.

190
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,240
Thirty dollars, you get the bumper sticker, the pamphlet, and the t-shirt.

191
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,000
For forty dollars, the bumper sticker and the t-shirt will be mailed.

192
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,760
Or whatever.

193
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,020
Otherwise, I guess it's gonna walk over to your house or something.

194
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,780
Anyway, real important, mention Hour of Slack so we know which show you're listening to.

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,340
I don't know if that'll be...

196
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,520
Actually, we don't care.

197
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
We'll smell your money.

198
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,920
We're with you.

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
As long as it smells like it's for Bob.

200
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,720
The material may not be reproduced.

201
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,200
Two zero five.

202
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
Over twenty one years.

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,920
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.

204
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,880
You can't buy a miracle, but you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm like a bunch of...

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm like a bunch of...

207
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


208
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


209
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


210
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


211
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


212
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


213
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


214
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,960


215
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,400
That's what all I care about.

216
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,440
And you know, the only thing that can stop you is the miracle.

217
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Keep your hands on the radio right now.

218
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,040
Right.

219
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,720
Really, now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks, or do you have...

220
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,960
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is antichrist, but I'm telling you that preparations

221
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:48,600
are being made, and that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand, and

222
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,860
that if you plan to get saved, you had better do it now.

223
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,940
There will be a miracle within.

224
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


225
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


226
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


227
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


228
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


229
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


230
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


231
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


232
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


233
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,980
a day not in the too far

234
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,020
distant future in which

235
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,060
Antichrist will be revealed

236
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,880
and the mark of the

237
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,180
beast will be introduced

238
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,000
and people will have a number

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
in their hands and in their

240
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,000
foreheads.

241
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,260
Our demand for energy will be met

242
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,560
from our own production and our own

243
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,060
conservation.

244
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,740
Also in your

245
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,640
literature, I noticed connections

246
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,520
with aliens.

247
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,280
And the

248
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,620
god of wrath who visits

249
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,400
us every once in a while and talks to

250
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,040
we gotta drop this name in here, Bob Dobbs.

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
The high muckety muck.

252
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,960
Never behold, he cometh with clouds

253
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,440
and every eye shall see him.

254
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,520
Space vessel, identity unknown.

255
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,360
I could show you a flying saucer

256
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,560
and you'd swear it was something that I got

257
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,620
from Eric. You'd show me a real flying

258
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,460
saucer and you'd say I got it from Eric.

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
I give you a thousand

260
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,580
dollars to your religion if you can produce one

261
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
flying saucer. At least, Joe,

262
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,260
that is my opinion of what I think.

263
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,500
And I've seen a lot of

264
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,580
saucer people, and, uh,

265
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,440
but I can't talk about it, you know, because

266
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,760
back in the zoo.

267
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,460
So we just gotta

268
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,000
wait, you know, until 1985

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,460
and then, oh yeah, freeze those

270
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,220
cats in the street.

271
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,220
The crew of the UFO is an especially

272
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,500
designed robot humanoid.

273
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,480
Disintegrated, Captain.

274
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,560
Human. Come on.

275
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
Woof!

276
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Woof!

277
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,780
Are we not men?

278
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,020
Zob!

279
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,060
Wobbly, wobbly.

280
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,360
Ha, ha, ha.

281
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,640
Ha, ha, ha.

282
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,420
Everyone makes a mistake.

283
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,140
Let it go, Bob.

284
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,780
Whoa, boy.

285
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,180
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.

286
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,900
Food is galloping.

287
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,760
Maria, you're...

288
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,320
What?

289
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,840
What's the use of pretending?

290
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,180
I can't stand this anymore.

291
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,560
Doctor, please.

292
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,860
Please, doctor.

293
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,980
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

294
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,300
Yeah, that's right, Ed.

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Short visit.

296
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,400
Poor guy.

297
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,560
Pretty bad, huh?

298
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,860
Well, the guy's really a mess.

299
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,380
The beatin' it walked up to the epileptic and said,

300
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,320
Oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

301
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,160
I hope you like that, Nod.

302
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,560
I hope you like that.

303
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,660
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment,

304
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,920
and they go along with it all just great.

305
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,940
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really.

306
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,320
It's just the way it happens.

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,160
You like it?

308
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,700
Make me take off my clothes and make me go out normal.

309
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,300
I have to go outside and change before I come here.

310
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,020
Do you love your parents?

311
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,060
Yeah, I love them, but they're...

312
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,260
In culture schools across the land,

313
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,880
mere infants are taught all about contraceptive techniques

314
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,260
and are provided with a plastic phallus in the classroom.

315
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,280
Well, I don't worship, Reefer.

316
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,340
To me, it's just another thing to do.

317
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,580
Hey, Jones, we just got in this African sensimedia hash.

318
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,100
Thought maybe you'd like to smoke some.

319
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,640
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

320
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:32,920
Haven't you ever done it yet?

321
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,180
Come on, now get up and break and smoke some, please.

322
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
I would gladly smoke some!

323
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,400


324
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,400


325
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,400


326
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,000
Orny?

327
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:47,920
Ahem.

328
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:47,920


329
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:47,920


330
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,260
I'm not done talking to you.

331
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,740
Wait.

332
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,160
The triple keyboard operates an echo chip.

333
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,220
Resonating balls made of foam.

334
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,060
And something that rather resembles a mercury xylophone.

335
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm getting tired.

336
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,540
I don't know if I can keep up.

337
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,780
But I believe I actually enjoyed it.

338
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,780
To the last mutant, mutant, mutant.

339
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,080
That's me!

340
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,100
Civilized men were so frightened by talking apes.

341
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,640
Let it get away, doctor.

342
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,700
But how does one control a 400-pound gorilla?

343
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,780
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.

344
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,080
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.

345
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,360
That thing's got the balls.

346
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,840
Oh, as long as my middle finger.

347
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,900
Oh, no!

348
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
You think the unthinkable.

349
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,180
This radiation is beautiful.

350
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,060
Yes, that is beautiful.

351
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,900
Please, please, please, cover your faces.

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,620
That's the doomsday bomb.

353
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,260
Do you know what that means?

354
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,760
Do you know what that means?

355
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,540
Do you understand?

356
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,280
Do you understand?

357
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,740
Illusions, illusions.

358
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm still the admiral who pretended aboriginally he was a respectable stemming.

359
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,060
Great.

360
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,940
He was an outlaw.

361
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,100
Our Slack radio ministry.

362
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Here are the numbers to call.

363
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,200
The old classic number, 823-7490.

364
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,540
Or you can try 823-8801.

365
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,240
823-8883.

366
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,780
If all numbers are busy, well, heck, we won't give that one out yet.

367
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:46,360
So 823-7490 or 823-8801 or 823-8883.

368
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,260
Light up the phone bags for us.

369
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,060
Our Slack.

370
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
We need.

371
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Yes.

372
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,400
We need gifts for the pledge drive.

373
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,300
And we do have volunteers to take your calls.

374
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:54,740
That's right.

375
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
And not all of this money goes to the Church of the Subgenius.

376
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,400
In fact, none of it does.

377
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:07,580
This is all strictly to keep the station on the air so that you can hear all those other shows that I'm sure some people would rather hear.

378
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,660
Because this is, at times, a dangerous show to listen to if you're trying to understand exactly what's going on.

379
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,240
You have to listen very closely.

380
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,100
That's the tricky part.

381
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,580
You have to listen very closely.

382
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,720
Not for Joe.

383
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:26,440
Heavens are Quakers, a second said, when Bohemian lips, a third said, when he know, when hold hard a jiffy, when he is agnostic and determined to.

384
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,300
The next one said, when the angel of death kicks the bucket of life.

385
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,080
Still another said, when the wine's at wit's end.

386
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,080
And still another, when lovely woman stoops to conk him.

387
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,020
One of the littliest said, me, me said, when papa, papa at the harbour.

388
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,400
One of the wittiest said, when he yate hee, I blew cooken, and he's mere, he's self so sooken.

389
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,540
Still one said.

390
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,480
When you are old, I'm grey, fall full with sleep.

391
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,720
And still another, when we dead a walkner.

392
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,420
And another, when he's just only after having been semi-sized.

393
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,140
Another, when, yea, he hath no bananas.

394
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,620
And one, when those pigs, they begin now that they will, flies up into the luft.

395
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,500
All were wrong.

396
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
So Shem himself, the dictator, took the cake.

397
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,120
The correct solution being.

398
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,660
I'll give it up.

399
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,820
When he is a.

400
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,440
Yours to the rending of the rocks.

401
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,100
Sham.

402
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,220
Shem was a sham.

403
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,920
And a low sham.

404
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,900
And his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs.

405
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,600
So low was he that he preferred Gibson's tea time salmon, tinned as inexpensive as pleasing,

406
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,160
to the plumpest roe heavy lax, or the friskiest par of smoked trout that ever was gaffed between Leaslip and Island Bridge.

407
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:46,860
And many was the time, he repeated in his bottle-ism, that no jungle grown pineapple ever smacked like the whoppies he shook out of Ananias's can.

408
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
And the

409
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,660
great things that just goes on and on and on and on and on.

410
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,860
That's, um, that's from Finnegan's Wake.

411
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,680
And it's, uh, it's a big book.

412
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,720
Great big thick book.

413
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,960
People read it.

414
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,580
They get lost inside of it.

415
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:15,600
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show that reach out and lock onto your mind.

416
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,840
Ha ha ha ha.

417
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,080
Ha ha ha ha.

418
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,840
Ha ha ha ha.

419
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,400
It's funny, isn't it?

420
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,400
Ha ha ha ha.

421
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,120
This is, uh, Reverend D.K. Jones, uh, in New Jersey.

422
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,180
Great, great subgenius.

423
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,540
A song called Midnight Rambler.

424
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
I don't mean just black knights.

425
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,560
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

426
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm Midnight Rambler.

427
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,380
Yes.

428
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,580
All Midnight Rambler's faces are not black.

429
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,580
Yes.

430
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,880
What they're on is as black as midnight.

431
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,460
Yes.

432
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,980
I'm talking to you.

433
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,520
Hold up, men.

434
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,140
Yes.

435
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,980
And women.

436
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,080
Yes.

437
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:15,960
And women.

438
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,800
Yes.

439
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,080
Yes.

440
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


441
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


442
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


443
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


444
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


445
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


446
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


447
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


448
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,740
You bank robbers.

449
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,580
Yes.

450
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
You sing, too.

451
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,200
Yes.

452
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,740
And you bank robbers.

453
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,140
Right.

454
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,300
And kidnaps.

455
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,020
Yes.

456
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,520
You old, flooded men.

457
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,200
All right.

458
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,640
I'm talking to you.

459
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,700
And we've got some people in the church.

460
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,340
Yes.

461
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,300
See, now it's just as late as a midnight ramp.

462
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,680
Yes.

463
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,080
All right.

464
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,060
I don't know what I'm doing.

465
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,060


466
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,060


467
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,060


468
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,060


469
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,060


470
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,060


471
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,220
Well, listen.

472
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


473
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


474
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


475
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


476
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


477
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


478
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


479
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,220


480
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,760
A couple of times, brother.

481
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,960
He got in last night.

482
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,660
Yes, brother.

483
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,260
He had him, you know, last night.

484
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,860
Uh-huh.

485
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,400
Yes.

486
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,840
He had him.

487
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,000
But you haven't told why they had him.

488
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh, Mr. Bell, why did they have him out?

489
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Well, he was in jail.

490
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,240
Uh-huh.

491
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
He was in jail.

492
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes.

493
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,400
Yeah, in jail.

494
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,040
Yes.

495
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


496
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


497
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


498
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


499
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,040


500
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,200
And now, Mr. Jordan, where's your husband?

501
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,320
Where's your husband?

502
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,100
My husband didn't get home last night.

503
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,120
He told me not to tell you.

504
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,140
Oh, well, he don't have to tell me.

505
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm not holding court.

506
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,880
No, I'm just talking to you.

507
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,240
He's got to tell Jack.

508
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,640
And you're out to tell him what to do.

509
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
Tell him what to do.

510
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,480
Tell him what to do.

511
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,260
Tell him what to do.

512
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,680
Tell him what to do.

513
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,500
Tell him what to do.

514
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,140
All right.

515
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,720
And in the clearing, if you don't mind, he'll get six long.

516
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,200
Eight.

517
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,720
Ah, ten.

518
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm talking to you midnight.

519
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,820
Ram.

520
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah.

521
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,280
Stay with me at night.

522
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:11,660
Yeah.

523
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
Just to rob and steal.

524
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,020
All right.

525
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,520
Some of you are so roguish.

526
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,280
Come on, come on.

527
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,820
Well, you will.

528
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,640
You will.

529
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,420
Come yourself.

530
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,180
Go ahead.

531
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,500
Inca.

532
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,120
Inca.

533
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:21,860
Inca.

534
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,300
Inca.

535
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,640
Inca.

536
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,420
Selfie.

537
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,180
Selfie.

538
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,840
Selfie.

539
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,500
Uh-huh.

540
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,240
Come on, man.

541
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,640
Oh, I want to fly.

542
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,740
You got to fly.

543
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,500
You got to fly.

544
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,960
You got to fly.

545
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,120
You got to fly.

546
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,500
Uh-huh.

547
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,500
Oh, yeah.

548
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,140
Out with somebody else.

549
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,400
But he's got an answer for himself.

550
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,500
Uh-huh.

551
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,760
Oh, yeah.

552
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Well, you know, he's got a good answer for himself.

553
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,440
Yeah.

554
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:54,960
He's got a good answer for himself.

555
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:54,960


556
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,200
Well, I'm here.

557
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,500

594
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,880
the black paper between a mirror breaks my heart

595
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,320
the moon frayed through dark velvet lightly apart

596
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,220
still softly through sunshine still softly through snow

597
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,980
the wild goose flies from winter breaks my heart that i can't go

598
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,500
energy flies from winter breaks my heart that i can't go

599
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,500


600
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,740
through a field and the sun softly melts the nothing for you

601
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,960
still softly through sunshine still softly through snow

602
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,020
the black paper between a mirror breaks my heart that i can't go

603
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,240
to smile that feathers don't grow their spine

604
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,240
they live 200 years of love

605
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,880
They won.

606
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,560
There's my heart to see the cross was turned.

607
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,340
There's my heart to see the highway cross the hill.

608
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,900
Man lived a million years and still he kills.

609
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,820
The black paper between a mirror

610
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,500
breaks my heart to see the cross was turned.

611
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,340
But I can't go.

612
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,220
Steal softly through sunshine.

613
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,460
Steal softly through snow.

614
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,220
Everyone, rise for the anthem.

615
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,360
Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington, Mesquite,

616
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,040
Lancaster, Bland Prairie.

617
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,840
And speaking of Grand Prairie,

618
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,060
Ah, yes, thank you, Michael Wallace.

619
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,820
For making the first pledge of the K-N-O-N,

620
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,300
some genius pledge drive.

621
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,860
Well, you've got to call 823-7490

622
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,800
and help us continue to keep our slack

623
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,620
and K-N-O-N in general on the air.

624
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,460
823-7490.

625
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,960
Ah, yes, dear friends.

626
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,140
Once again, reach down deep and call us up.

627
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,560
Offer your credit card number

628
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
or set up this amazing bank draft system

629
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,880
where they can pull money out of your checking account

630
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,980
every month without you ever having to think about it

631
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,460
or maybe ever even knowing about it

632
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,720
if you're drunk enough when you pledge in

633
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,840
and you forget that you ever even did it.

634
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,680
823-8801 is our second phone number.

635
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,640
823-8801.

636
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,100
We may have a second pledge right now.

637
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,300
Call and pledge now.

638
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,900
823-8801.

639
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,060
If this is how he wants to go out,

640
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,700
I don't have a way to say it

641
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,200
except that I just went out of bullshit.

642
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,680
Yeah.

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,960
Well, I told you

654
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,200
And I told those who got through

655
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,400
But I'm not your big nigga

656
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,960
Not your big nigga

657
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,420
I like a bunch of

658
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,780
And I might like a good birthday

659
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,080
But I'm not your big nigga

660
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,760
Not your

661
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,060
When you go on a picnic

662
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,520
Don't forget to eat

663
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,380
And I'll be right back

664
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,860
I'd love to go on a picnic

665
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,000
But I'm not a

666
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,540
No, I'm not a

667
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,900
I'm not a

668
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:24,760
But there was a giant female subgenius here

669
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,680
to hold the show for us

670
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,460
and to squeeze out the

671
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,020
squeeze out the

672
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,820
Caller, you're

673
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,800
You give off a good phone

674
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,680
Hi kids, welcome to Subgenius USA

675
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,380
We don't care if you're single, double, triple

676
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,100
Dial me again

677
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,360
Twin tuple, sex tuple, septuple, hop tuple

678
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,500
Moon tuple, vesituple, or

679
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Vesituple

680
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,360
Now we can't have this kind of

681
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,160
This is a special message

682
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,220
If you can't say those kind of things on the radio

683
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,600
That's right

684
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,040
Don't waste any time

685
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,480
We don't know what radio is

686
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,700
We know we're sexist pigs

687
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,860
We know we're all screwed up

688
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,680
And messed up and everything

689
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,280
We'd be a lot better off

690
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,500
If you were here to tell us what to do

691
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,460
But you can't use those words on the radio

692
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,440
You don't want to use those words on the radio

693
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,140
You can call us up and tell us what to do

694
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,200
If you're stupid or anything

695
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,140
Listen to the music

696
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,600
Smell it

697
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,120
You hate our parents

698
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,380
You'd like to see us gas

699
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,080
And if you're lebanese

700
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,400
You'd like to see us gas

701
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,320
No oozing allowed

702
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,680
No

703
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,540
Until someone comes down here

704
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
And does it for themselves

705
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,780
What a silly show

706
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,020
Yes, if you think you've got a better show

707
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,400
You'd bring it to the air right now

708
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,820
Throw in the night worm of the doctor

709
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,160
You'd come right down here to

710
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,000
Throw in the night worm of the doctor

711
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,800
I was going to say KGO

712
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,160
But we're not allowed to use those colors

713
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,400
Or KPFA

714
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,540
Or any of those

715
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,680
FAT

716
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,700
No, we can't talk about those old stations

717
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,240
KPOI

718
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,700
KOL

719
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,320
I don't know

720
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,580
Just write a letter to the station

721
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,340
And completely say

722
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,200
Dr. Hal said the bad words

723
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah

724
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,360
All I do is write a letter

725
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,680
And say anything

726
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,700
And some of those other guys helped

727
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,340
And whoever they are

728
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,940
What are you talking about?

729
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,640
They should be thrown off the radio

730
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,120
Because they play stuff like this all the time

731
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,780
Hey, I'm clean

732
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,960
I'm innocent

733
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,020
They're trained operators

734
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,100
I demand a fair trial

735
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,360
That's right

736
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,580
They play those old records

737
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,600
They play old records

738
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,960
And then make trial by tape

739
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,560
All over themselves

740
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,300
Repent

741
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,100
Well, I told you and I don't know you

742
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,240
It got through

743
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,260
But I'm not your pink ape

744
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,500
What?

745
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,400
Not your pink ape

746
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,260
I live in a luncheon

747
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,580
Where the night is my life

748
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,380
I get to work

749
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,020
I get to work

750
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,280
I get to work

751
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,360
I get to work

752
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


753
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


754
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


755
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


756
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


757
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


758
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,360


759
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,540
I get to work

760
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:08,540


761
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,880
That's not your pink ape

762
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,460
When you go on a picnic

763
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,100
Don't forget the ape

764
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,900
Don't forget the ape

765
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,600
I love to go on a picnic

766
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,840
I love to go on a picnic

767
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,660
I don't want to go on a picnic

768
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,160
I am not an ape

769
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,220
I am not an ape

770
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,800
No, I am not an ape

771
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,480
No, I am not an ape

772
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,040
Not me

773
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,160
I should have said not I

774
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,680
I told you that I never

775
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,640
I never could not

776
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,500
Could not

777
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,820
Not eaten

778
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,800
Gone

779
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
Your pink ape

780
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:48,900
Well, gone

781
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,640
Your pink ape

782
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,720
Well, that makes a lot of sense

783
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,840
Pinky, pink

784
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha

785
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha

786
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha

787
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,300
Ha, ha, ha, ha

788
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha

789
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha

790
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha

791
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha

792
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha

793
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha

794
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha

795
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,320
Oh, yes, dear friends

796
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,040
That was, uh

797
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,780
That's a

798
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,860
That band

799
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,440
The guy that does that

800
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,100
Puts out a magazine

801
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,180
That is quotes from senile people

802
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,480
He works in an old folks home

803
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,980
And he records their wisdom

804
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,400
And puts out a magazine

805
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,440
And puts out a magazine

806
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,300
of it. He also has this band called

807
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,400
the Duplex Players, which

808
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,420
we just played. Picnic

809
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,380
Ape. He records these guys and then

810
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,880
uses them

811
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,120
as lyrics to these beautiful songs.

812
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,360
You see, they don't let anything go to

813
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,540
waste in America today.

814
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
Ah, yes.

815
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,260
Folks, call in with that pledge.

816
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,700
823-7490.

817
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,460
You've got to do it.

818
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
You've got to do it.

819
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,340
Otherwise, you'll never

820
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,260
hear this.

821
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,980
Ah, yes.

822
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,140
That's very interesting.

823
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,860
That's not interesting at all.

824
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,680
Ah, yes.

825
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,240
That's very, very interesting.

826
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,580
That's not interesting at all.

827
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,520
Ah, yes.

828
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,580
No, no, no.

829
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,420
Ah, yes.

830
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,400
That's very interesting.

831
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,440
Ah, yes.

832
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,720
Very, very interesting.

833
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,920
That's very, very interesting.

834
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,780
Very, very interesting.

835
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,040
Very, very interesting.

836
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,100
Very, very interesting.

837
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,960
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules.

838
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,420
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules.

839
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:19,000
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules.

840
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,820
That's very, very interesting.

841
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,620
Still there are mice.

842
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,320
Still there are mice.

843
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,100
Still there are mice.

844
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,640
Look what's coming out of that hole in the ground.

845
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
A little bullfrog.

846
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,180
That's very, very interesting.

847
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,840
Do anything musical.

848
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
Okay, let's run that testing.

849
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,000
Very interesting, folks.

850
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Very interesting.

851
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,120
Okay, friends, now the board's just not lighting up.

852
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,880
Now we need to give these numbers out again, and let's have those pledges.

853
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,460
823-7490, friends.

854
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,540
823-8801 and 823-888.

855
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,400
823-888.

856
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,260
Remember, you're not just pledging it for Bob.

857
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,940
You're pledging it for the station that keeps Bob on the air.

858
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,860
So let's have that board light up.

859
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,940
Let's have them pledges.

860
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,060
Those $1 pledges.

861
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,560
Those $50 pledges.

862
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Those $100 pledges.

863
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,860
Those $10,000 pledges.

864
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,420
Folks, we only need a few of them.

865
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,980
We only need 10 pounds of $100 bills to keep this station going, friends.

866
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,020
We only need six $10,000 pledges.

867
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,960
But I'll tell you what.

868
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,320
It is getting very serious, and it involves legal situations.

869
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,280
And we're not just asking you to give money for Bob.

870
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,580
In fact, this is one of the few times when we're asking you to give Bob's money to somebody else.

871
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,860
That's right, friends.

872
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,020
And that's usually against our religion.

873
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,720
That's how serious the situation is.

874
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,540
And this, well, you know what happens when this station goes off.

875
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,580
If this station were to go off the air, and these are not hollow threats.

876
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,340
And here's Buck Naked with a special offer, friends.

877
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,620
A hot offer for you people to pledge your money.

878
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,400
Okay.

879
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,880
Tell you what.

880
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,400
What?

881
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,740
Do it now.

882
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,740
I want a $20 pledge, and you get a free button.

883
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,460
JR Bob Dobbs.

884
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,680
Yay!

885
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,100
And I want you to call this special number.

886
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,120
823-8883.

887
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,100
823-8883.

888
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,500
Call it in within the next five minutes, and you get that free button with your $20 pledge.

889
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,680
And all the other stuff you get.

890
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,440
What else do they get?

891
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,900
They get a newsletter, the KNON newsletter, which is actually not a...

892
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,840
Not the drab little rag that you would think.

893
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,560
It's insane.

894
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,440
I've seen it.

895
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,320
It's amazing.

896
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,820
It's entertaining.

897
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,420
Yes.

898
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,640
It's actually something you can keep.

899
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:40,840
And it's yours.

900
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,580
It's yours forever.

901
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,720
Forever.

902
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:43,920
Forever.

903
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,140
They get pamphlet number two, right?

904
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:45,640
Right.

905
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,700
They get subgenius pamphlet number two.

906
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,000
We've got to bring down a whole bunch of the brand new ones.

907
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,160
That's why Buck Naked's special handcrafted church buttons, friends, for the first $20

908
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,280
pledge.

909
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,960
Face of Bob at 823-8883.

910
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,320
That's special offer pledge.

911
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,380
Call it in now.

912
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,400
Light that signal.

913
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,580
Free back rides every day.

914
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,320
Howdy, friends.

915
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,920
I'm Lord Jim Cravington for Medieval Motors, your friendly truck stop and transportation

916
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,200
in the diet of worms.

917
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,100
Friends, whether you're in the body or out to lunch, we've got the Gryphon, the Minotaur,

918
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,380
or the sporty little camel leopard to suit your imaginary travel needs.

919
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,380
And gosh, what can I say about these little guys?

920
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,260
Yes, it's your all new cardboard Vampirettes, the economy transport that's got them all

921
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,640
guessing on the other side.

922
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,360
Well, we've got continents and peninsulas of New England, and we've got the

923
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,360


924
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,360


925
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,060
best of

926
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,360
seen yeah.

927
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,320
So get your ass in gear and your oxen in here so as we can trade indulgences and get you on your back

928
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,160
Now we're just a painful mile off the freeway of lost hope at the intersection of down and out avenues in the citadel of the angel

929
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,200
How you doing?

930
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,260
A lot of the good old boys are here tonight. We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission

931
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,620
Don't forget if all you can do is sit at home then try to keep yourselves awake

932
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,820
And dial the phone

933
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,020
Call in for pledges. Yes, we have a lot of our special

934
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,420
beauties

935
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,020
Answering the phones this evening and

936
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,040
Best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen

937
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,580
As quickly as you can with a contribution to the television mission. Don't forget to call in a pledge

938
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,800
Talk about Jesus. Well, you never know who's gonna be here this evening

939
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,660
Yes, well, it's one. I know you are son

940
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,600
I know it's one of the one of the real positive qualities of the television mission is we just never know

941
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,000
Who's going to drop by?

942
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,040
I mean, it's a lot of folks have been the band is here

943
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,760
The man is getting set up the band is ready. The band is ready

944
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,020
And I'm here to tell you that it's time ladies and gentlemen

945
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:48,460
I want you to hold down your applause as long as you can because it's time you heard from red green back in the blue boys

946
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,140
Don't forget to call the numbers on your screen

947
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,380
The number is not on your screen

948
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:12,080
The number is on your speaker and that number to call is eight two three seven four nine

949
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:21,540
Oh, and if you don't call something very very terrible could happen not only to to you and to the airwaves of Dallas

950
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,280
But through all the life force which covers this great green globe

951
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,900
This station were to have any worse problems than it already does

952
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,500
It could be pretty bad friends. It could be as bad as what happened tonight

953
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:58,040
Thank you to Danny Ferguson of Arlington for your pledge to the subgenius radio radio ministry hour of

954
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,280
slack kno n 90.9

955
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,260
Listen

956
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,400
I

957
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:16,620
Oh

958
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,620
In the last powerful days of another way of life,

959
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,020
when everything happened in cars,

960
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,740
when sullen, desperate men would do anything for a tank full,

961
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,680
in the troubled years of the Hundred Year Gas War

962
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,300
and the terrible food insurrection,

963
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,160
when armies mixed mustard and gas and relished war,

964
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,780
in those frightened times,

965
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,040
private citizens often had to do the terrifying work of real police,

966
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,660
apprehending criminals and solving tricky moral problems.

967
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,600
They had private eyes, but public fists,

968
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,260
full tanks, but clean consciences,

969
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,960
and tonight's story is only typical.

970
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,580
Car Hook.

971
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,000
Starring Dirk Yost.

972
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,700
Ogre as Dick Private.

973
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,240
Private Dick.

974
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,540
Tonight's chilling story.

975
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,980
Roller Maidens from Outer Space.

976
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,280
Saturday morning.

977
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,160
I'd just locked myself out of the office for a cool weekend

978
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,020
and promised to be gin-soaked and hand-rubbed.

979
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,960
At least, that's what I figured she'd meant when she said,

980
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,500
let's get drunk and refinish my furniture.

981
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,640
Anyway, it was the way she said it, you know.

982
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,340
Real husky, like a lead dog in a snow job.

983
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,880
And I wasn't about to be left out in the cold.

984
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,520
Damn nation.

985
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,600
Ah, well.

986
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,820
I figured it wouldn't hurt just to answer it.

987
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,080
A private Seamus is always hungry.

988
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,720
I hadn't been exactly flush,

989
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,840
and this might just be the ace in the closet

990
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,460
that put some pizza in the pantry.

991
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,520
Go ahead, something said to me.

992
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,920
Answer it, she'll wait.

993
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,040
So I did.

994
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,700
Only to wind up holding the anchovies

995
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,280
in more ways than one.

996
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,640
Dick Private, private detective.

997
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,660
Uh, Mr. Private.

998
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,740
That's right, pal.

999
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,380
My name is Regular Boynton.

1000
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,000
My wife, uh, Ethel and I have been opposites.

1001
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,620
I've been at you for many years on, uh, another network.

1002
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,540
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,920
The Ethel and Regular Show, I've heard of you.

1004
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:38,780
What's the matter?

1005
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,040
Swallow your car keys?

1006
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,400
Uh, no.

1007
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,780
Lock yourself out of the house?

1008
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,020
No.

1009
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,900
Want to know how to make an attractive bookend

1010
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,200
out of a shoebox and a brick?

1011
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,580
No, uh, nothing that exciting,

1012
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,520
but, uh, look, look, look, you've got to get over here.

1013
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:50,800
Well.

1014
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,640
Right away.

1015
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,380
Uh.

1016
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,300
You're just a couple of channels away.

1017
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,640
Uh, you can make it.

1018
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,180
Nobody ever made it before.

1019
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,040
No, come on.

1020
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,820
It's really weird over here.

1021
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,880
Well, it ain't no Swiss picnic over here, pal.

1022
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


1023
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,400
You don't under, uh, under, uh, understand.

1024
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,800
It's, it's terrifying.

1025
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,180
Uh, nothing is normal.

1026
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,580
Wow.

1027
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:12,060
We all seem to be, uh, uh, dreaming the same dreams.

1028
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,200
Wow, that's terrific.

1029
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,440
And there's all these strange balls of light in our neighborhood.

1030
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,200
Hold it.

1031
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,120
Glad to.

1032
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,520
Now hold it up to the light.

1033
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,040
Oh, okay.

1034
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,200
You was right.

1035
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,360
This was serious.

1036
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,480
This is serious.

1037
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,760
This is extremely serious.

1038
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,900
I've never seen so much light on these boards lighting up.

1039
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,000
God, these amiable sims.

1040
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,480
Don't act.

1041
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,120
It's not the right kind of light.

1042
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,380
We want that green light.

1043
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,520
We want that light from that money coming in.

1044
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,300
That's what we want.

1045
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,920
Uh, yes, we want to, we want to friends.

1046
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:47,940
You don't know the purity of the, of a 10,000 pound stack of dollar bills or the

1047
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,280
right savage horror of not having this station on the air.

1048
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,720
So let's try again.

1049
00:46:53,860 --> 00:47:00,140
The numbers are 8, 2, 3, 7, 4, 9 0 8 2 3 8 8 0 1 and 8 2 3 8 8 8 3.

1050
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,800
And folks.

1051
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:09,400
You get the newsletter, the KNON newsletter, the bumper stickers, the free subgenius pamphlet

1052
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:09,940
number two.

1053
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:10,840
That's right.

1054
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,840
Now you subgenius members out there that are wondering where's my pamphlet number two.

1055
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,180
You'll get yours in the mail anyway, but Oh, ye unsaved out there.

1056
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:26,420
Ye unsaved folks that could be, if you could, but if you could, but pay for this radio station

1057
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,820
that you're listening to and enjoying right now.

1058
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,180
That's right.

1059
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,760
You pay for all the rest of them.

1060
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,360
By putting up with the commercials.

1061
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,000
That's right.

1062
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,760
You put up, you pay for all the rest of them by hearing the same thing over and over and

1063
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,340
over again.

1064
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,180
Things much worse than pledge drives.

1065
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:41,800
Yes.

1066
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,620
Yes.

1067
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,840
There are worse things than pledge drives.

1068
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,420
Friends.

1069
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,740
We'd like to thank Sherry Williamson Fort Worth for calling her pledge into the hour

1070
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,160
of slack.

1071
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,440
Thank you, Sherry.

1072
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,780

And 8 2 3 8 8 8 3.

1076
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,360
Just put your finger on the little button and push it.

well you could see you could see people in it yeah he said he had supervision out of that thing

1102
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,260
the aliens of ufo are energy manipulators

1103
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,620
i thought there's you know there is a lot of talk about flying saucers

1104
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:26,520
and i want you to meet a man this evening that's actually seen you some 300 flying saucers and your name is

1105
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,580
the man

1106
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,720
it's not focusing on the pandemic it's on planet earth

1107
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:30,720


1108
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:44,580
so the club might be on the field man cannot participate in long space expeditions nasa has scientifically verified and

1109
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:54,500
kept very quiet the fact that the unstoppable cosmic rays to which every astronaut has been exposed destroys brain cells at the rate of

1110
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
one percent every man has disappeared from the planet her Hindu survive and be a puny parts of the brain and every single voice hat that way so we find common truth and very much

1111
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,480
iso

1112
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,620
every four months.

1113
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,880
Since the neurons of the adult human brain do not...

1114
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,040
A space expedition represents...

1115
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,940
...and here's Master Buck naked with a couple of new ones.

1116
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,660
Mark Shopey. Thanks a lot, guy.

1117
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,020
And Sherry Williams. Williamson. Yes, of Fort Worth.

1118
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,340
A big help. Okay.

1119
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,820
You people who want to talk about slack, friends...

1120
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,320
...there's not going to be any slack tonight until you send that money in.

1121
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,940
You'll get that slack the minute you write the check.

1122
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,440
You'll feel it flowing up through your ballpoint pen into your fingertips.

1123
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,720
This whole show is to give you a beatific vision of slack, friends...

1124
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,640
...and I think that, you know, you're going to have to realize...

1125
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,480
...that the luck plane to slant our way is going to have to have a little...

1126
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,080
A little weight on one end of the slack plane, friends.

1127
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,320
A little pile of...

1128
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,220
...$10 and $20 bills stacked up here and there can shift that plane.

1129
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,260
Yes, indeed.

1130
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,360
Hey, Doc, you ain't got nothing coming over your TV.

1131
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,200
Hey, hey, hey.

1132
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,480
Because I love you.

1133
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,780
Forever.

1134
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,000
And I love you.

1135
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,020
You.

1136
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,420
The past will change.

1137
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,240
You.

1138
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,080
The revolution.

1139
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:23,880
You.

1140
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,660
A believer.

1141
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,360
The revolution.

1142
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,300
You.

1143
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,420
Me.

1144
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,560
Me.

1146
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:31,980
Me.

1147
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,120
The prophet.

1148
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:33,680
Me.

1149
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:34,960
Hans.

1150
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,660
My name is Hans.

1151
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,340
I am the prophet.

1152
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,680
He is my lover.

1153
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,200
He is the one and the chosen one.

1154
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,280
He is my lover.

1155
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,480
The one and the chosen one.

1156
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,940
He is my chosen one.

1157
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:58,060
Now the other and the excluded one.

1158
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:07,280
He is myarios

Hans, you are my lover.

My daughter's there.

1166

Something wrong with you.

Something wrong with you.

1168
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,720
You.

1169

Listen to your mama.

1177
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,420
Listen to your mama.

1178
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,440
Sweet dreams.

1179
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,440
The red duck is back!

1180
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,060
The red duck is back!

1181
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,980
Something new is limited.

1182
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,620
Something limited.

1183
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,120
In the minds of the Russians, many Russians.

1184
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:00,520
The red duck is back!

1185
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,700
The red duck is back!

1186
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,880
Forget him. Forget him.

1187
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,820
But the real man, to the bed rest.

1188
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,300
The bed rest.

1189
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,880
Gone he was, he out.

1190
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,100
Gone he was, he out.

1191
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,280
Gone he was, he out.

00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,040
The red duck is back!

00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,440
The red duck is back!

1195
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,700
Down here.

1196
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,300
Down there.

1197
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,960
Down there.

1198
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,200
I can't keep talking to anything.

1199
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,280
I want to, but I don't.

1200
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,460
I don't know.

1201
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,040
The wind blows.

1202
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,980
The wind blows.

1203
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,660
Does everybody know that?

1204
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,520
Does everybody know that?

1205
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,680
Does everybody know that?

1206
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,660
Does everybody know that?

1207
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,520
Does everybody know that?

1208
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,760
The waves and the bybeds, the sht, they say.

1209
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,100
We were speaking in tongues.

1210
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,260
Tongues.

1211
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,860
Tongues.

1212
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:21,560
Tongues.

1213
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,960
Tongues.

1214
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:25,820
Tongues.

1215
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,600
Tongues.

1216
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,640
Tongues.

1217
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,020
Tongues.

1218
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,720
Tongues.

1219
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,920
Tongues.

1220
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,100
Tongues.

1221
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,580
That's a revolution going on.

1222
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,540
Yes, friends.

1223
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
Bob does love you, he'll love you more

1224
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,780
if you'll join that pledge drive right now.

1225
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,480
Dr. Stank, would you please give out the numbers?

1226
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,060
Yes friends, that's

1227
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,800
823-7490.

1228
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,320
And get your pencil, because there's another one.

1229
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,540
8-2-3-8-8-0-1.

1230
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,660
That's right.

1231
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,000
If you want to hear any more bizarre, demonic-sounding music from the airwaves

1232
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,220
or the inspirational, beautiful, classical songs of Bob White,

1233
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,940
you have to call 8-2-3-8-8-0-1.

1234
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,640
8-2-3-8-8-8-3, doctor.

1235
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,640
Or doctor.

1236
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:36,820
Doctor.

1237
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,060
8-2-1-8-5-7-9.

1238
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,540
But especially 8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

1239
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,680
Call in and deposit that earthly check.

1240
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,560
That offering.

1241
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,500
That pledge.

1242
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,440
All you have to do is promise it right now.

1243
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,260
It's a non-pledge.

1244
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,060
You can't lose.

1245
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,720
You're pledging it to K-N-O-N.

1246
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,100
It's a non-pledge.

1247
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,820
Ah, yes, friends.

1248
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,660
And it's so sad, because our time is already running out.

1249
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,780
When we hear that music at the end of these shows.

1250
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,840
Doctor, we've got a $40 pledge we have to give credit for.

1251
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,400
Oh, yes.

1252
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,220
Ah, yes.

1253
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,900
As Wendell Scott of Dallas, thank you so much.

1254
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,000
And may slack flow through your body.

1255
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,320
May slack drip down your spine and out every side of your pants.

1256
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,440
Oh, friends.

1257
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,080
Oh, friends.

1258
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,480
We have to leave you for the next religion, and so.

1259
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,740
And so, as we sign off, once again, friends, send that money to K-N-O-N

1260
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,140
and to the Church of the Subgenius for the Home for Slackless Children,

1261
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,500
because that money keeps those we hate starving to death.

1262
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,140
And get your pencils.

1263
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,220
Get your pencils ready, because we'll be reading our address for information here

1264
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,900
coming up at the end of the broadcast.

1265
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,220
Oh, yes, this has been Reverend Ivan Stang with G. Gordon Gordon,

1266
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,960
Pastor Buck Naked, Buddy West, and the folks who will be taking over the show next week,

1267
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,900
Batman himself.

1268
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,360
Ah, yes.

1269
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,540
To play the amazing tapes.

1270
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,880
Oh, friends.

1271
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,320
And that's the Church of the Subgenius P.O. Box 1403.

1272
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,200
Oh, yes.

1273
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,280
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1274
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,940
Yeah, or call 823-7490.

1275
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,840
823-8801.

1276
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,920
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1277
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:29,240
It's so beautiful to see that phone line light up.

1278
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,680
Ah, there it is.

1279
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,220
Yes, more $40 pledges.

1280
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,040
More paper slack.

1281
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:34,760
Ah, yes.

1282
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,300
Paper slack.

1283
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:35,500
Paper slack.

1284
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:35,500


1285
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:35,500


1286
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:35,500


1287
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,200
We all need some paper slack.

1288
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:36,720
Paper slack, friends.

1289
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:42,800
Slack in the face of the hideous conspiracy that tries to shut down anything that tries

1290
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,740
to talk about the things that they don't want anyone to talk about.

1291
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,720
Oh, stop them.

1292
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,900
That's what they try to do.

1293
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,600
Ah, thank you, dear friends.

1294
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,320
Thank you, dear friends.

1295
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,920
Drinking Budweiser.

1296
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,780
Watching Bob on TV.

1297
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,860
Oh, swallowing red man.

1298
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,160
The day my coon dog died.

1299
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,980
Reading the pamphlet.

1300
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,080
Over and over again.

1301
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,420
Eyes drinking Budweiser.

1302
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,900
Oh, birdie.

1303
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:33,900


1304
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,200
Bob was on TV.

1305
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:44,600
The day that Uncle could kick by a mule.

1306
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,220
I was with Cousin Junior.

1307
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,760
The DNA backfired.

1308
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,040
I was drunk.

1309
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,400
I was lonely.

1310
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,400
I was plastered.

1311
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:03,880
I was plastered.

1312
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,840
I was drinking Budweiser.

1313
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,500
And Bob was on TV.

1314
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,280
Drinking Budweiser.

1315
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,880
Watching Bob on TV.

1316
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,140
Swallowing red man.

1317
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,420
The day my coon dog died.

1318
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,880
Reading the pamphlet.

1319
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:33,880


1320
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:33,880


1321
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:33,880


1322
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,200
the pamphlet

1323
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,220
over and over

1324
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,260
again

1325
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,280
I was

1326
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,400
drinking Budweiser

1327
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,020
and Bob was on TV

1328
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,820
I was drinking

1329
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,380
Budweiser

1330
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,980
and Bob was on TV

1331
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,120
Do the light

1332
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:43,140
Do the light
