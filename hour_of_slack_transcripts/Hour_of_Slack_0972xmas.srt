1
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,240
but now at the beginning of the 1980s I want to make another personal prediction

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:32,960
the 1980s will be the most catastrophic decade in the history of man and yet no one who will

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,880
accept what God has to say has to be afraid as a matter of fact you can be so excited that every

4
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:51,360
day can be a day where you are not only optimistic but saying this might be the day this may be it

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,780
you

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,760
and in the meanwhile Bob has promised that as we claim his promises he will sustain us even in the

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:12,680
darkest hours of history and give us a way out time for show live show for you now this is Doug

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,260
Smith radio operator I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure welcome

9
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,980
subgenius radio

10
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,460
you

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,780
sponsored by the church

12
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:45,800
enchanted and raptured and bombed the past year resembles nothing so much as the the bad alternate

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,080
timeline that the hero of a cheap science fiction book or has to go back and fix

14
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,560
you

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,720
you

16
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,660
are that time traveler

17
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,020
yes

18
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,460
only your memory can be restored to you

19
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,660
you are the humble time traveler

20
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,240
I know what you mean though

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,620
it does

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,120
yeah that would explain a lot

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,480
it would explain the wooden headed people

24
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,180
coming up to us while we're taking our

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,420
sulfur baths

26
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,380
it would certainly explain all the money that's now going to be

27
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,160
flowing into

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,540
arms and legs

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,380
and think of how fully well laundered that money it is

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,980
it must be very

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,220
squeaky clean by now

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,000
just think about george the bushy haired one himself and counting that money back in some room

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,200
he's got to replace those behind the oval orifice

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,300
that's not what this is all about

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,560
no

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,520
it's all about uh revenge that's it

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,780
taking over mars

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,720
and uh yes eventually to take over to take back mars

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,020
yeah

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,180
take over mars to take mars back our rightful home

41
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,840
that we the true martians were expelled from mars and we're going to have to do something else

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:51,960
we the true martians were expelled from mars we're going to have to do something else

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,380
we're going to have to do something else

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,900
so that they the oil sheiks and the the oil billionaires and all the oily characters would have some

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,160
so we're living in the martian time slip

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,400
oh i can grok to that

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
in this time continuum

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
i can grok to that my water brother but by the same token

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,660
we were enslaved

50
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,080
we've got to go back in time and kill bob's mom

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,640
the psychic

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,320
after bob was born

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,940
enslaved thousands and millions and bazillions of years ago

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,680
does this mean that there's a

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,640
does this mean that there's a a big thing with all the money we want here at the front of our house and we can pick it up and and just

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,860
a big thing with all the money we want here at the front of our house and we can pick it up and and just

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,920
it doesn't mean anything like that it just means that we were kidnapped from our home world and we're stuck here with you twerps

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,320
yeah you guys you just you guys

202
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,940
Be.

203
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,820
Anarchy.

204
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,140
Be.

205
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,140


206
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,640
Be.

207
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,180


208
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,180


209
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,180


210
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,180


211
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,340
Am.

212
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,160
Be.

213
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,220
J.

214
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,500
R.

215
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,120
Dear friends.

216
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,040
I am.

217
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,340
Be.

218
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,780
J.

219
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,120
R.

220
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,500
Our friend in England.

221
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Did that.

222
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Posted to.

223
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,180
Alt.

224
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,280
Binaries.

225
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,040
Slack.

226
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,340
Which is.

227
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,120
Where.

228
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,040
We.

229
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,520
all of our weird new audio discoveries or creations into the mix

230
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,020
and then suck them right off for each other's

231
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,700
and for use here on the Hour of Slack.

232
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,480
Now, that song Anarchy in the UK,

233
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,360
the computerized cover version,

234
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,360
was by someone named Jima, or J-I-M-A.

235
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,180
But what's interesting is where it came from.

236
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,160
It's a website called dictionaryoke.org.

237
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,620
Online dictionaries that sing the hits of yesterday.

238
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,900
You can basically program in songs, pick songs,

239
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,620
and if it can find the tune, I guess you feed it the lyrics or something.

240
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,180
Yes, that's www.dictionaryoke.org.

241
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,960
Some of the other weird little sounds and burblings

242
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,120
that pop up here and there on the show

243
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,020
came from Johnny Wishbone and I am BJR

244
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,540
and Fernando Nenny.

245
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,620
And from Artemia Salina,

246
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,100
all the regulars,

247
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,440
and Dr. New Monet,

248
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,660
the regulars, so to speak, on all that binary slack.

249
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,500
And now, I guess, Hour of Slack.

250
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,900
And of course, friends, we always hear lots of ESO Swamp Radio

251
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,720
from WCSB Cleveland,

252
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,940
which is on every Thursday night

253
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,520
and anybody can call in.

254
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,880
It's like about midnight Eastern time.

255
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,840
Time.

256
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,980
Time.

257
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,140
At WCSB Cleveland, WCSB.org.

258
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,040
Friends, that's Professor Chaz Smith as the host

259
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,540
and our caller there that time was Reverend Turin.

260
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,200
And, of course, Lone Cow Dave.

261
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,840
Lone Cow Dave is always there, even at Christmas.

262
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,000
And see, where I am right now, friends,

263
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,660
it is still Xmas, or about to be, something like that.

264
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
See, I never know exactly when each station

265
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,340
is going to play any given particular hour.

266
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,460
I'm not sure what the time is,

267
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,400
but I'm not sure what the time is.

268
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,400


269
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,400


270
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,400


271
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,400


272
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,700
I assume that they play roughly two weeks after I do them.

273
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,860
And so, this show may be playing after Christmas

274
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,180
or Christmas Day,

275
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,700
or sometime around these holidays and so forth.

276
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,700
But, and that's why it's not all Christmas stuff.

277
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,200
But, we have yet, nonetheless,

278
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,880
more to come from the great obtuse

279
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,440
from the Gabofam.

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Math.

281
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,380
Math.

282
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:51,820
Bush.

283
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,840
Even weasel teats.

284
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,440
And Brother Clay, friends.

285
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,980
A lot of old and new Xmas hour of slack.

286
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,540
Old hours of slack.

287
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,900
And old me, young.

288
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,940
So separate.

289
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,820
So separate.

290
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,640
So separate.

291
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,320
You from Tulka.

292
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Now you're in my evil clutches, Bob.

293
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,440
I'll use this MTV's on my list to turn you normal.

294
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,680
Shut up, pink boy.

295
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
No way.

296
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,220
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

297
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,260
Taste a little of my rocket pipe.

298
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,260
Alien tool.

299
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,740
I'll be back.

300
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:24,740


301
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:24,740


302
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,380
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe,

303
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,900
head launcher,

304
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,380
Jane or device,

305
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,760
oligarch,

306
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,000
a tisma,

307
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,540
fighting Jesus,

308
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,660
and other action figures sold separately.

309
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,340
Some assembly required.

310
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,300
Batteries not included.

311
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,480
This toy falls apart in three days.

312
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
T-Bob.

313
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,140
And wrestling.

314
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,160
The bastards of the universe.

315
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,480
Too much is always better than not enough.

316
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,580
From Bob Dobbs.

317
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,800
And I can't do it so separately.

318
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,740
Gorgeous.

319
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,680
He can blow from head to toe.

320
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,400
He can blow from head to toe.

321
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,400
He can do it so separately.

322
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,900
T-Bob and the bastards of the universe

323
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,380
will be back after this message.

324
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,140
Fixated On.

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
How's that sound?

326
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:12,980
It's so beautiful.

327
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:12,980


328
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:12,980


329
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:12,980


330
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,180
It's so perfect.

331
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,260


332
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,420


333
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,480
Question time.

334
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,480


335
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,540
Well sure.

336
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,540


337
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,980
He who are limited

338
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:13,980


339
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:13,980


340
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:13,980


341
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,140
all in love

342
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,140


343
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,060


344
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,100
Look,

345
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,620


346
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,780
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

347
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,940
He wanted an electric train.

348
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,060
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.

349
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,280
He could picture the whole thing, and he would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.

350
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,280
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

351
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,100
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.

352
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,180
And the station and the gateman.

353
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,040
The water tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

354
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,040
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

355
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,140
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

356
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,000
I didn't do it.

357
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,740
Can I still have my dog?

358
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,060
No!

359
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,420
Boys and girls, everyone wants a Slinky.

360
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,760
You ought to get a Slinky.

361
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,420
Get your Slinky now.

362
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
You know what else let me down?

363
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,480
You're sloppy.

364
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,620
They had those big mugs.

365
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,360
It was a big magnet thing.

366
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,080
You're stinky.

367
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,380
And then they showed on TV somebody pulling a Volkswagen with the magnet that looked red.

368
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:28,980
I used to pull my Slinky, too.

369
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,720
It was red, and it looked like a Mighty Man thing.

370
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, wow.

371
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Oh, you're a big red Slinky.

372
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,060
It was a big magnet.

373
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,140
There was another good one, too.

374
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,180
You had a big red magnetic Slinky?

375
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,520
It was a finger that would shoot.

376
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,740
It was like, you know, there was a lot of spy toys around.

377
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,440
Yes, exactly.

378
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,160
And it was a finger.

379
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,000
I can almost remember the song.

380
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,460
Double Agent Man.

381
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:50,820
Double Agent Man.

382
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,600
Double Agent Man.

383
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,880
I don't think I ever get along with five.

384
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,340
Secret agency woman.

385
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
The fingers you could get.

386
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,860
All different kinds of fingers.

387
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,600
Some of them would shoot little darts, poison darts.

388
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,220
Some of them would...

389
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,520
So there were the mind control.

390
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,980
Remember the little mind control devices?

391
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,620
Some of them launched little tiny nuclear-headed...

392
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,500
Nuclear-headed boys and girls.

393
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,980
See, this is the main problem.

394
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,200
Sam brainwashing.

395
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,820
Sexual devices or something like that.

396
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,400
Those were the best for me and my mom and Lisa and dad.

397
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,900
I sometimes, when I come home, I was sober enough to walk.

398
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,140
What was that called?

399
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,880
Marital AIDS.

400
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,420
Boy, that wasn't too obvious.

401
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,640
What, marital AIDS?

402
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,280
I had a...

403
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,300
No, you don't want to talk about it.

404
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,020
A secret Sam brainwasher kit where one kid would play the red Chinese interrogator.

405
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,940
Yeah, those were great.

406
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,040
And the other guy would play the American prisoner in the Korean War.

407
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,240
Did you ever play double Manchurian on that?

408
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,940
I'm glad to see battleship is still out.

409
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,780
Actually, I ended up attacking a school teacher.

410
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,460
You did?

411
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,220
Like three weeks after playing that.

412
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,840
The light went off.

413
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,640
Because this other kid deprogrammed me to.

414
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
It was called Six Finger.

415
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,260
That is a beautiful story for Thanksgiving.

416
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,640
No, you're wasting my time!

417
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,000
The戦隊 むしろ蜱虎を Smile the Korean War

418
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,980
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap is just bull.

419
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
Santa Claus is real..

420
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,060
imposs Bandicoot or what?!

421
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,060
The Child.

422
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,540
Who's the head man?

423
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,940
Santa Claus.

424
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,900
Santa Claus.

425
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,660
He was a huge beastly

426
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,460
bulging man.

427
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,360
You're so real.

428
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,420
How come we didn't get Squat last year?

429
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,800
But if you'll notice from time to time

430
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,900
he's basing it on this most joyous birth

431
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,880
of our baby dog.

432
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,840
What you're wearing.

433
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,520
The things that you're wearing.

434
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,720
Never mind what I'm wearing.

435
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,360
Come on, get out of here.

436
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,840
Those are some nice panties.

437
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,480
Hey, stop. Get your hand out.

438
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:27,860
Hey.

439
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,100
Come on, put your hand.

440
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,400
Well, I had no idea.

441
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,440
No, it's no big deal.

442
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,580
I don't, you know.

443
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,260
You're all right, man.

444
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,820
I understand Ed Wood was into that.

445
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Ed Wood took the beach at Normandy

446
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,320
in his frilly pink panties.

447
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,980
And his...

448
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,400
And his entrenching tool.

449
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,360
And that's the important...

450
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
I want everybody from Sea Company!

451
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,660
For Christmas!

452
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,260
Over here!

453
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,400
The baby Jesus!

454
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah, keep it up!

455
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,600
And bow!

456
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,260
Let's take a...

457
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,260
Christmas Day, June 1944.

458
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,640
We kick some Nazi butt.

459
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,700
The Babylonian hussars entrenched deeply on the beach,

460
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,920
dressed in their crab suits

461
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,480
and their funny long underwear.

462
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,260
The cause of consternation isn't having anything to do

463
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,600
with their spiritual cults.

464
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,200
It has more particularly to do

465
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,360
with their religious doctrine.

466
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,620
And the Christmas Nazi devil

467
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,540
fought the Christmas army men.

468
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,780
They stood together.

469
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,660
And God won!

470
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,600
Hand in hand.

471
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,880
Until God lost.

472
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,500
And the devil lost.

473
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
And the devil cried his devilish tears.

474
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
They were salty.

475
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,600
They were finickery.

476
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,120
They were very bitter tears.

477
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
And as we collected them like tiny raindrops in a toxic pool,

478
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,640
we sat together and shaved.

479
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,100
And thanked our monkey we were born again in incandescent light.

480
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,620
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan.

481
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,500
On July 4th.

482
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,700
And now you can have it all.

483
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,340
Three thousand years ago.

484
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,420
One hundred percent vinyl chloride CID.

485
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,200
And celebrated.

486
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,400
The birth of our baby Satan

487
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,700
as told by various authors and eclectic scholars

488
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,440
from around the globular unit.

489
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,140
Including that announcer.

490
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,740
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement

491
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,040
but an announcement of the blessed anointing

492
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,120
and birthday of our Lord Jesus Christ.

493
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,660
For...

494
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,320
For...

495
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,320
One bright Christmas morning...

496
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,680
...was born in

497
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,540
the cradle of tighter-knit Б VERY

498
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,540


499
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:28,760
The Rave

500
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,020
Jesus

501
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,700
The Rave Jesus

502
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,580
I know the Rave Jesus.

503
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,520
I've harkened to him since the Sherpa- nicеты

504
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,380
the Rave Jesus

505
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:50,300
I partook the rave Jesus

506
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,980
Oh,

507
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,480
Oh, I did that, my friends.

508
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,580
Well, rather, I pushed that button, I guess you could say.

509
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,060
And this music in the background is actually the Bishop from New York.

510
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,800
We've heard other burblings and sounds from Johnny Wishbone and, of course, ESO Swamp Radio.

511
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,280
And before that, Obtuse did all that Santa crap.

512
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,580
And slinky crap.

513
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,640
And the beautifully mixed holiday buying crap.

514
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,060
And you can get his free album on buying, but it's free!

515
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:05,680
Check their website, obtuse.iuma.com.

516
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,440
Yeah, and email them from there or something.

517
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,420
It's obtuse.iuma.com.

518
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,500
Great stuff.

519
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:27,820
But now, friends, now, a premiere, a world premiere, truly, of the latest, greatest new hit from Gary Grogfran of the band that dare not speak its name.

520
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,260
And he still dare not.

521
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,980
Putty Butt.

522
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,920
My baby just sits right there.

523
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,340
Dressed up in her underwear.

524
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,380
Jerry Springer is on the air.

525
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,880
She's a putty butt.

526
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,180
Putty Butt.

527
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,780
My baby ain't got much fat.

528
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,440
Her brain's not where she's at.

529
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,120
Not moved from where she sat.

530
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,820
She's a putty butt.

531
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,280
Putty Butt.

532
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,840
Putty Butt.

533
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
I'm sitting like Barry White.

534
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,040
Trying to get her to move at night.

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,060
Yes, I'm right.

536
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,880
She's a putty butt.

537
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,500
Putty Butt.

538
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,000
My baby ain't going nowhere.

539
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,820
Once a week, she moves from there.

540
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,620
So I can pat you under a chair.

541
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,100
She's a putty butt.

542
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,740
She's a putty butt.

543
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,720
Putty butt.

544
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,300
Putty butt.

545
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,760
Margarita.

546
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,820
Poop.

547
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:13,900


548
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,860
Poop.

549
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Poop.

550
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,480


551
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,480


552
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,480


553
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,460
Wow, Stimpy.

554
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,260
We sure walked a long way.

555
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,660
I'm pooped.

556
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,400
Look, Ren.

557
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,300
It's St. Wizzleteet's house.

558
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,200
This must be the West Pole.

559
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,260
Hey, why don't we sing for him?

560
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,840
Yeah, then we can get our socks filled with sausages.

561
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,600
Well, hello, Mrs. Wizzleteet's.

562
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,600
Is Stinky home?

563
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Stinky!

564
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,220
Stinky!

565
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,720
Stinky!

566
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Stinky!

567
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


568
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


569
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


570
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


571
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


572
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


573
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


574
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


575
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


576
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


577
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


578
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,240


579
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,420
little street urchins to see you.

580
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,400
Huh? Urchins? What are urchins?

581
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,600
Some kind of newfangled dog?

582
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,340
Is that what you are? Some kind of dog?

583
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,540
Well then, you better bark like a dog.

584
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,540
If you're gonna act like a dog,

585
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,580
then you better crawl like a dog.

586
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,820
Honey, go get me my dog

587
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,600
walloping two by four from the shed.

588
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,740
No, no, no. We're here to send you a yaksmas carol.

589
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,200
Mr. Deets, sir.

590
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,780
Singing? Well, that's different.

591
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,200
Honey, go get me my dog

592
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,020
walloping guitar.

593
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,340
But let me sing you a song.

594
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,220
A little song I wrote to go something like this.

595
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,040
Oh, the big wooden chicken lived in the bush,

596
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,720
a big fat bush full of worms.

597
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,360
Hey, Will, I think it's time to get out of here.

598
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,700
They ate the chicken, and they all died the next day.

599
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,460
It is, it is turn over.

600
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,660
The time of the year

601
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,280
when all things sell, the end of the year, sale.

602
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,120
Oh, yes.

603
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,860
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

604
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,000
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused

605
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,700
about what Christmas is all about.

606
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,060
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus

607
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,060
or his death when they nailed him?

608
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,400
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

609
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,720
But the present subgenie try to make sure that

610
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,180
we have our inventories cleared by now

611
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,040
and sell everything to the pigs.

612
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,240
Oh, yes.

613
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,960
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

614
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,340
And it was something else in between there.

615
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,980
But before it was, after it was a pagan holiday

616
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,700
and before it was a shopping season,

617
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,140
it was something else.

618
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,920
But I think they started a war over it.

619
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,020
If you haven't heard of me,

621
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,480
I wouldn't be surprised.

622
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I bet you know my relatives.

623
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,260
Their names will never die.

624
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,020
My mother is a saint.

625
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,800
And my brother is a god.

626
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,860
But all I am is Jesus Brother Bob.

627
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,840
Jesus Brother Bob, Jesus Brother Bob.

628
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,940
A nobody relative of the Son of God.

629
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,940
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

630
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,180
I'd be born in the first place.

631
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,240
Brother of God Junior.

632
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,420
I have to pay the ferry to cross the Galilee.

633
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,280
But not my brother.

634
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,500
No, not him.

635
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,880
He walks across for free.

636
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,480
I finally get to work about a quarter after nine.

637
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,160
Already he's turning water into wine.

638
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,960
Jesus Brother Bob, Jesus Brother Bob.

639
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,020
A nobody relative of the Son of God.

640
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,880
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

641
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,200
I'd be born in the Brother of God Junior.

642
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,740
One day when I was home,

643
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,780
I heard a mighty roar.

644
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,920
There were a thousand people right outside the door.

645
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Help us Jesus, help us.

646
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,960
Came the cheering from the mob.

647
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,840
But then they got a look at me.

648
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,240
A nuts it's only Bob.

649
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Jesus Brother Bob, Jesus Brother Bob.

650
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,300
A nobody relative of the Son of God.

651
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,320
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

652
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,660
I'd be born in the Brother of God Junior.

653
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,040
He, he died upon the cross.

654
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,220
I thought that I was free.

655
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,700
Finally people would get to know me for me.

656
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,480
Hi Bob.

657
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,280
Hey Judas.

658
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,560
Hey.

659
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,280
This was my big chance to finally get ahead.

660
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,440
The next thing you know he's rising from the dead.

661
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,340
Jesus Brother Bob, Jesus Brother Bob.

662
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,420
A nobody relative of the Son of God.

663
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,420
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

664
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,460
I'd be born in the Brother of God Junior.

665
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:36,720
Everybody.

666
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,760
Jesus Brother Bob, Jesus Brother Bob.

667
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,740
A nobody relative of the Son of God.

668
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,840
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

669
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,220
I'd be born in the Brother of God Junior.

670
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,400
I'd be born just a little sooner.

671
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
If only I'd been born just a little sooner.

672
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,520


673
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,780
I'd be born just a little sooner.

674
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,500
Now you're blaming Jesus, you're blaming our Lord.

675
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,160
I sort of understand because I understood the way any old fool would understand.

676
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,200
There was no Jesus.

677
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,200


678
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,520
Jesus, no flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

679
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,700
It's not that you don't want to.

680
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,080
It's that they won't let you.

681
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,240
No, they're ashamed.

682
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,980
Just a cry in the wilderness.

683
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,860
They're ashamed.

684
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,380
In the hot pursuit of wolves everywhere in the background.

685
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,860
I'm ashamed of them.

686
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,200
It's cold.

687
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm leaving that city life behind.

688
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,200
I can't get my finger off the paper.

689
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,720
I can't get my needle back.

690
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,900
I'm going out.

691
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,380
I am dead.

692
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,540
Come on, cowboy.

693
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,840
No, man.

694
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,020
I was trying to hear you against your tree, and it started whispering to me, man.

695
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,500
No, you've been drinking.

696
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,640
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

697
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,100
There's the face of Virgin Mary.

698
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
I swear to God, look at it.

699
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,260
Isn't it?

700
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,540
What?

701
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,180
It's her Christmas witch coming.

702
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,720
It is true.

703
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,320
A Christmas witch?

704
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,280
I'll be whole.

705
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,180
Oh, my God.

706
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,220
Yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more.

707
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,560
Her breasts are so cold.

708
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,720
I know she must be a true witch.

709
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,120
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's talking about.

710
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,820
She's for real.

711
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,260
She's wearing Christmas ornaments.

712
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,440
It looks like a radar device.

713
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:24,960
What?

714
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,140
Yo.

715
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,200
Yo?

716
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,660
It's her.

717
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,500
What up?

718
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,380
Nothing.

719
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,380
What's up?

720
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,180
What a deep voice.

721
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,860
First Christmas witch.

722
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,840
I swear she had a much higher voice before when she called.

723
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,920
But are you the 29-year-old girl I've dreamed of for the last 25 minutes?

724
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,520
Yo.

725
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Are you the 29-year-old woman I've dreamed of for the last 25 minutes?

726
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,020
No, but, um...

727
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,540
Can you?

728
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,500
I...

729
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:56,500


730
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,040
Yes.

731
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,280
I figure that, um, on the occasional guess that, quite frankly, that the people want

732
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,840
to listen to.

733
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,700
That I could quite entertain them.

734
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,700
You?

735
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,860
You could entertain them?

736
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,540
Oh, sure.

737
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,440
Quite frankly.

738
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,360
What do you mean by quite frankly?

739
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,480
And here's Frank!

740
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,840
I'm a sexy black male.

741
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,700
I'm a sexy black male.

742
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:17,700


743
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,280
That's right.

744
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,060
We've got Frank here.

745
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,160
He's a sexy black male.

746
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,940
He says he works in the computer industry.

747
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,840
He's 35 years old.

748
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,240
Oh, no.

749
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,400
He runs skiing, fishing, and...

750
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,200
That's a complete lie.

751
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:26,920
Pardon?

752
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,300
But what's behind door number three?

753
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,560
I know.

754
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:30,840
I know.

755
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,220
That's right.

756
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,340
It's the monster woman of your dreams.

757
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,560
No, you're not gonna be the...

758
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,400
Behind door number three!

759
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,980
King, king, king.

760
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,700

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,120

871
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,020
We already did that

872
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,660
Well, anyway

873
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,900
We still are pushing our way in

874
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,820
And the changes

875
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,800
Are not always up to us

876
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,000
But sometimes they are, friends

877
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And we need to think of

878
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,260
What we're gonna do next

879
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,800
Well, actually

880
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,040
We don't have to worry about it

881
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,100

882
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,500

But if not

890
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,000
We sort of need to make plans

891
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,760
And I don't

892
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,220
I don't know, my friends

893
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,140
Exactly what we need to do

894
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,760
Maybe

895
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,160

00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,700

904
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,980

905
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,580

931
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,480
Let the cat go, the man looking.

932
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,200
Get out of the way.

933
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,380
He said, man, don't bug me.

934
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,200
Get off my back.

935
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,740
I'm trying to dig what the cat's saying.

936
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,780
Jack said, ooh, they're pushing the Naz

937
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,400
because they want to dig his lick, you see.

938
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,360
Dig his miracle lick.

939
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,280
So the Naz say,

940
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,980
wait a minute, babies.

941
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,620
Tell you what I'm going to do.

942
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,720
I ain't going to take too far.

943
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,140
Six, eight of you cats.

944
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,860
That's what I'm going to take.

945
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,420
Twelve of you studs

946
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,880
and straighten you all at the same time.

947
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,480
You cats look like you're pretty boys.

948
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,020
You buddy with me.

949
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,860
So the Naz and his buddies

950
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,140
was goofing off down the boulevard one day

951
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,560
and they run into a little cat

952
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,340
with a bent frame.

953
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,180
So the Naz look at this little cat

954
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,560
with a bent frame and he say,

955
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,120
hey,

956
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,460
what's the matter with you, baby?

957
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,080
And the little cat with the bent frame,

958
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,120
he say, well, my frame is bent, Naz.

959
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,280
It's been bent from the front.

960
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,300
So the Naz look at the little cat

961
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,400
with the bent frame

962
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,800
and he put the golden eyes of love

963
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,980
on this little kitty

964
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,520
and he look right down

965
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,340
into the windows of his soul

966
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,800
and he say to the little cat,

967
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,320
he say,

968
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,800
straighten.

969
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,740
Boom, boom.

970
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,200
Cat went up straight in the now

971
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,560
and everybody jumping up and down say,

972
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,140
look what the Naz put on that boy.

973
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,080
You dug him before,

974
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,260
dig him now.

975
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,460
Yes, I can feel it.

976
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,960
Now you see the Naz are coming on so strong

977
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,980
and so fine and so great.

978
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,600
Talking about when's he going to appear next.

979
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,540
What did he do there?

980
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,300
He put it down once for the cat.

981
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,940
The cat dug it, didn't dig it.

982
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,400
Put it down twice, dug it, didn't dig it.

983
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,820
Put it down the third time, the cat dug it.

984
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,660
Wham!

985
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,100
Walked away.

986
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,540
Walked away with his eyes bugging out here

987
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,840
and they're bumping in there, everybody.

988
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,120
Naz coming on so fine and so strong.

989
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,600
They're pulling on his coattail.

990
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,940
They want him to sign the autograph.

991
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,900
They want him to do this gig here.

992
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,680
They want him to do that gig there.

993
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,200
They want him to make it the radio,

994
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,020
the video and all that jazz.

995
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,160
He can't make all that jazz.

996
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,100
Like a splendid cat's a cop

997
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,380
and the kitty's got his own lake.

998
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,400
But when he know he should show

999
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,520
to blow and cannot go

1000
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,440
because he got some strain on him,

1001
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,000
he sends a couple,

1002
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,700
a couple of these cats that he's straightening.

1003
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,680
So came a little old 50 cent gig one day

1004
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,260
and the Naz couldn't make it

1005
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,940
so he put it on two of these cats.

1006
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,160
He said, boss, go straighten that little riff over there.

1007
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,980
Boss said, take it off your mind, Naz.

1008
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:24,820
We got it covered.

1009
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,300
So on the way over, the boss run into a little old

1010
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,760
20 cent pool of water

1011
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,320
and he gets right in the middle of the boat

1012
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,540
and all of a sudden,

1013
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,260
land of a thunderstorm.

1014
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,820
Lightning flashing and thunder roars.

1015
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,280
And the boat goes up and down

1016
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,360
and the poor cat's thinking of a minute

1017
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,240
going to be the last.

1018
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,720
And one cat look up and...

1019
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,500
Here come the Naz.

1020
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,880
Cool as anyone you ever see.

1021
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,800
Right across the water, walking.

1022
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,060
And the Naz is a little boy on board.

1023
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,080
I think his name is Jude on board the boat.

1024
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,520
He said, hey, Naz, can I make it out there?

1025
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,020
Would you?

1026
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,640
Naz said, make it, Jude.

1027
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,680
And old Jude went stomping off that boat,

1028
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,180
took about four steps, dropped his whole cart.

1029
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,500
And the Naz had to stash him back on board again.

1030
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,280
So the Naz look at these kiddies and he say,

1031
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,760
what's the matter with you babies now?

1032
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,160
He said, what's going on here, boys?

1033
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,120
He said, what's taking place?

1034
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,200
He said, what's all this fuss about here?

1035
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:34,840
What's going on?

1036
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,640
He said, man, he said, what's going on?

1037
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,200
He said, can't you see the storm storming

1038
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,340
and the lightning flashing and the thunder roars?

1039
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:48,700
And the Naz say, I told you to stay cool, didn't I, babies?

1040
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,060
Now the fame of the Naz is jumping.

1041
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,620
The grapevine is shooting out sparks 40 feet long.

1042
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,200
And they're talking about what he said

1043
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,740
and how he stood up to all these big bad cats

1044
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,660
and dug all that bad jazz and put them all down.

1045
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,060
And what he said he gonna do and where he's gonna be

1046
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,460
and how he's gonna be it till the grapevine is jumping so bad.

1047
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,020
Now 16,000 of these studs and kiddies

1048
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,900
in the Naz's little hometown where the cat lived,

1049
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,020
looking to get straight.

1050
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,440
Well, the Naz know he can't straighten them all.

1051
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,960
There's too small a place to want to hang everybody up.

1052
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,600
Nobody can make it.

1053
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,800
So the Naz look out at these 16,000 studs and kiddies

1054
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,840
and they say to them.

1055
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,600
Come on, babies.

1056
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,620
Just get on out down the road.

1057
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,300
And there went the Naz, swinging away

1058
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,800
ahead of all these studs and kiddies and 16,000,

1059
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,160
stomping up a big, oh, big swinging beat behind them.

1060
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,980
And their great necklace of love is supercharging

1061
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,840
and charging to them.

1062
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,400
And oh, it's brothers and brothers and sister to sister.

1063
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,840
And the Naz is stomping on a sweet swinging beat,

1064
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,080
going down the road.

1065
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,060
And Naz talking about, how pretty are the flowers?

1066
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,820
How pretty are the hours?

1067
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,300
How pretty me?

1068
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,300
How pretty you?

1069
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,080
How pretty he?

1070
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,800
How pretty she?

1071
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,360
Naz had them pretty eyes.

1072
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,740
He wanted everybody to see through his eyes

1073
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,100
so they could see how pretty it was.

1074
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,120
And to have such a wailing gorgeous morning up time,

1075
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,880
that before you know it, it was scarfing time.

1076
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,280
And these tall cats is 42 mile out of town.

1077
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,360
Ain't nobody got the first biscuit.

1078
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,700
Well, the Naz look at these cats.

1079
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,020
And they say they kicking the sand out there.

1080
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:50,920
The Naz say, you hungry, ain't you babies?

1081
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,240
Say, yeah, Naz.

1082
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,780
We digging you so hard what you putting down that we

1083
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,780
didn't prepare, Naz.

1084
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,320
We goofed.

1085
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,580
Yes, that's what you call it.

1086
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,800
So the Naz say, well, uh.

1087
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,520
We gots to take it easier.

1088
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,540
We wouldn't want to go ahead and order up something

1089
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,300
you might not like, would we?

1090
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,860
And they say, no, Naz.

1091
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,860
You put it down, and we'll pick it up.

1092
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,220
So the Naz step back a few paces, and he say,

1093
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:36,120
oh, great swinging flowers of the fields.

1094
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:37,840
And they said, oh.

1095
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,580
Great nonstop signal of sound and beauty.

1096
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,060
And the Naz say, stamp upon the terror.

1097
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,400
And they hit it.

1098
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,980
And the Naz say, straighten your miracle of the body.

1099
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,460
The body went up.

1100
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,300
And he says, straighten your arms.

1101
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,420
The arms went up.

1102
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,520
And he said, higher.

1103
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,860
And the arms went higher.

1104
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,900
And the Naz say, dig in further.

1105
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,620
And they dug it.

1106
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,200
And when they did, wham, the thunder went to.

1107
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,200
And they look in the left hand.

1108
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,120
It's a great big, sweet, stuffed, smoked fish.

1109
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,660
And in the other, a big, thick loaf

1110
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,200
of that gone crazy honey tasting nonstop sweet swinging

1111
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,720
southern bread.

1112
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,340
Oh.

1113
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,680
Why, these polecats flipped.

1114
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,540
Naz never did nothing simple.

1115
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,520
When he laid it, he laid it.

1116
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,320
Say, when the saints.

1117
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,260
When the saints.

1118
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,620
Marching in.

1119
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,620
Go marching in.

1120
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,260
When the saints go marching in.

1121
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,180
Hallelujah.

1122
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,000
I want to be in that number.

1123
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,700
The saints go marching in.

1124
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,100
Say, when the saints.

1125
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,020
When the saints.

1126
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:07,820
March in.

1127
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,200
Go marching in.

1128
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,400
Go marching in.

1129
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,400
When the saints go marching in.

1130
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,940
Hallelujah.

1131
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,020
All wants to be in that number.

1132
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,640
The saints go marching.

1133
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,660
Rubber, dig, dig, dig, rub in.

1134
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,620
Oh, holy night.

1135
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,440
The stars are brightly shining.

1136
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,420
It is the night of our kiss.

1137
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,460
Take your first.

1138
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,640
Long laid, long laid, the world's different

1139
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,660
hall of the father queen in the stone mountains west.

1140
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,400
Ar Nerd gloss.

1141
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,940
Our Nast's going wild.

1142
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,900
Spring sand is ready to pop.

1143
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:57,980
Fall.

1144
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,180
Fall on your knees.

1145
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,540
Oh, hear the angels voices.

1146
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:06,940
Oh no.

1147
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,820
Oh Mary.

1148
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:07,820


1149
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:07,820


1150
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:13,580
Oh night, oh night, when Christ was born.

1151
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:21,760
Oh night, oh night, divine.

1152
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,740
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1153
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,780
Lord Buckley, the great, the old New Orleans beatnik.

1154
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:39,000
Lord Buckley with that amazing rant on the Naz and the fishes and loaves.

1155
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:49,060
And friends, that bobbled up Jingle Bells that we heard much earlier was from our own Reverend Yukon Jack.

1156
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:54,200
Praise Yukon Jack and praise WICA, which plays this show.

1157
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,340
And praise all the stations that plays this horrible show.

1158
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,900
And we love you.

1159
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,220
And I mean, seriously, it is.

1160
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:15,120
We appreciate every listener out there, no matter how much they might hate this show.

1161
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:22,680
And we actually love the holidays, too, because there's despite all the all that Santa crap, there's still a lot of slack.

1162
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:32,100
And may all your Christmases, all your Christmases, all your Christmases, all your Christmases.

1163
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:39,960
All your Christmases be white.

1164
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,900
Thank you.

1165
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,940
Thank you.

1166
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,720
Thank you.

1167
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,560
Thank you.

1168
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:00,760
I love you.

1169
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,720


1170
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,720


1171
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,720


1172
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,720


1173
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,720


1174
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,720


1175
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,760
I love you.

1176
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:06,940

1183
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,360
It's all Christmassy right now.

1184
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:49,260
There's a bright green bob in the window and Christmassy lights.

1185
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,680
Is there a DJA? Is DJA out there?

1186
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,360
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

1187
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,540
No, that's something just left for DJA.

1188
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,220
It's all Christmassy.

1189
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,580
It's all Christmassy.

1190
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:05,000
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present.

1191
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,520
Under the tree.

1192
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,500
Well, leave the door open.

1193
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,200
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1194
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,140
And those sugar plums.

1195
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,420
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's, isn't it?

1196
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,140
Yeah.

1197
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,560
Of Santa, I mean.

1198
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,040
Otherwise, gosh.

1199
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,060
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1200
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,780
Our beloved Santa.

1201
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,600
I have wanted to...

1202
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,100
Put your bag down for a minute.

1203
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,780
It's so nice.

1204
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,080
I was always so ready to learn.

1205
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:29,840
It's great.

1206
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,640
What?

1207
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,140
For so long.

1208
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,920
Christmassy Mary Xmas!

1209
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:41,900
The preceding brought to you by your station in observance of the 450th anniversary of the Reformation.

1210
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:43,480
Get.

1211
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,540
Tiff.

1212
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,560
Destroy.

1213
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,080
Lone cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?
