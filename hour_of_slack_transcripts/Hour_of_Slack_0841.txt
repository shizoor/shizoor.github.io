It's chaotic.
It's chaotic.
And it's X day coming up.
But we've had a screw up on our catalog, our online catalog that I need to tell you about.
Because if you ordered anything between May 20th and May 30th, you still have your money.
And I didn't get your order for Knife and Ivans, this section of the Subgenius website.
If you ordered membership or books or ministership.
T-shirts, you're cool.
That's no problem.
But if you ordered the CDs or the videos, those go to me.
And if you sent me a letter begging me to give you reasons to not kill yourself.
Man, I'm sorry.
You're going to have to send it again if it's not too late.
But you'd be a dumbass to be a subgenius and kill yourself before X day.
No, my friends.
You'd be a dumbass not to if you're a human.
Because X day.
5,000.
Annihilating.
Hell.
Hell.
Hell.
All right.
It's X day, friends.
X day is coming quick.
You better get that information from the Church of the Subgenius.
If you want to survive X day.
Or if you just want to go to the big party in Brushwood, New York.
Or hell, have your own party, friends.
We don't care.
The X's are going to pick you up no matter where you are.
If you're a news band subgenius member.
So, friends, check that catalog.
The subgenius website.
www.subgenius.com
Or write to the sacred P.O. box number at the end of this broadcast.
And friends, now we're going to go back into the X day's past.
Which then tell us about X day's future.
Because the previous X days, I guess, were all X day drills.
What we will experience from now on had better be the real thing.
Friends, or else, or else, well, I guess Bob just slacked off.
And maybe that's what happened to Knife and Knife.

And Ivan's email.
And friends, if you ordered a membership, a book, or a t-shirt, or a Bob mug.
Everything is cool.
Those go through Cafe Press.
But I stank.
So, the video and audios.
Because I'll be damned, friends.
I'll be damned if a pink in a suit gets one dime for subgenius talent at work.
Even if my bank account suffers too.
And is damned.
Because, my friend, I am that ornery.
I'm that ornery.
Because I'm keeping up the F-I-B.
The faith in Bob.
Praise Bob.
Help me, somebody.

On July 5th, 1998, 7 AM, when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scripture is called, the













Advent of the Angelic Host.
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.
Only his predictions are just a little different.
July 5th, 1998, at 7 AM, to be exact, the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them, will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
And believe it or not, plenty of people, four or five, will be there.
Four thousand of them so far, and more every day, have already joined up.
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.
Your standard religious rip-off, right?
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.
Remember now.
It's no surprise, if I should be found dead someday, I'll think that you were in the way.
Oh, gimme Bob.
Confusing that face.
With my own.
Can't remember my place.
Bob's role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold on that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.
When the men from Planet X arrive.
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous.
It may sound ridiculous to many of the believers out there.
It may sound impossible.
All nuts, all those people.
Maybe, yeah, maybe.
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbant.
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.
Evil stalks them.
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.
Do they come down in flying saucers?
Flying saucers are bearing on us.
We don't know what to do.
We're here all alone.
The planets are fading.
The blood is running.
The lights were fading.
And they stalked us one by one.
Hooray.
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.
Jerry Reith and Dr. Morabund there.
Some, uh, Pope David and Meyer.
And before that, Dr. Howell.
And puzzling evidence from old media barrage types, friends.
And now, twisted by pater nostril, Dr. Katahdin Legume.
The earth was bleeding thick black blood.
And it smelled like blood.
And it looked like blood.
Oh, yeah.
And every day, every day I'd wait for my daddy to come home from work.
And he'd come into the house.
And he'd be all covered in that thick black blood.
He'd have that blood in his hair.
He'd have that blood in his clothes.
He'd have that blood caked around his nails.
He was covered in that blood.
And I'd look up at my daddy all covered with that blood.
And I'd say,
Daddy, someday I want to be just like you.
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a father.
And a fully grown adult.
Lack of involvement with the father or over involvement with the mother can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual peace.
And in homosexual leanings, narcissism, transsexuality,
Curls from the waist up and from the waist down,
Attempts to be your own love object.
Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once.
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man.
But this tends to get overlooked by our mother fixated overweight sexist media.
So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.
If you give in to them every time they cry,
They will become little tyrants.
But they won't remember why.
Then when they are thwarted by people in later life,
They will become psychotic and they won't make an ideal husband or wife.
The spoiled baby grows into the escapist teenager who's the adult alcoholic who's the middle aged suicide boy.
So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.
So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.
When them saucers come, you're gonna need a clean pair of underwear.
It's like your mama said,
Make sure you're wearing clean underwear, you might get into an accident.
But it won't be an accident, brothers and sisters.
Let me tell you,
I will be happy to leave you,
Twisting in the wind.
Amen, brothers and sisters.
I am the God of Hellfire,
And I bring you,
Fire!
I'll take you to burn.
Fire!
I'll take you to learn.
I'll see you burn!
You pour tar in your safe ender,
But all the birds come to me.
Fire!
Yes, you might, you tiny might,
You know you've really been so blind.
Yes, you might, you tiny might,
You've fallen far too far behind.
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
You're gonna burn!
We've got bar and they don't!
And for that, we can hate them!
Hate them!
Hate them!
Fire!
Fire!
To destroy all you've done.
Fire!
To end all you've become.
I'll see you burn!
You've been living like a little girl,
In the middle of your little world.
Mind your mind, you tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now's your time, burn your mind
You're falling far too far behind
This is the generation that shall see
The bleeding flesh of the earth
And the broken bones of time
Can I get a praise bow?
Yes, brothers and sisters
Humanity is about to take the next big evolutionary step
Into the grave
Can I get an amen?
Oh yes, can I get a praise bow?
Oh
Fire
I take it true
Fire
I burn it for you
Fire
Fire
They're going to burn
They're going to burn

No, they're such, our nations even, such vessels are far too small to contain our great hate.
Copyright 1995, G. Gordon Gordon.
Yes, friends, ours is an all-consuming and all-encompassing and all-pervading hate.
A radioactive hate.
A burning, scouring, annihilating hate.
And that's when, when you build it up that, pump it up that much, friends,
that's when you start to become the hate.
Put on your PJs, you manly, cause it's bedtime.

He can create everything he can because of one man's sin.
He's cursed all the earth.
You can let the old together.
Yeah, God does.
He's gonna come back and prevent us.
That means you too.
You know, Jesus said, unless you're a thing, you're a rigtht日.

They have X days to fear.
They have a mountain to fear.

Extinction seems to be a plausible risk Whatever happens we're unboundable things
In my mind, I'm in a daze, what is my fault?
Take the salt from my tears, take the wealth of my years
Take it in, I'm already done with you
Resilience my show, always don't even know
Singing in the millennium radio
I'm out of here, I'm out of here
After all, we've only got a few months to live
Bob will come in the spring, we know he will
Yeah, brothers and sisters
Oh yeah, brothers and sisters
But there's not a lot of time remaining for you
There's not a lot of time remaining for you
It's just a few months away
Y'all are gonna die, no judge will stand on you
You don't have a subject, you might as well start to die
Oh yeah, the river is rising, brothers and sisters
The river is rising, brothers and sisters
The river is rising, you're gonna turn around
Bob Dobbs and his church of the subtenues
Are offering you a personal flotation device
Yes, a mighty surfboard of slack
So that you can hang ten into shag and grilla

Taste the sounds of my tears
Think the wealth of my years
Singing in my body, I'm with you
That's a new just for show
Always does it right now
Singing in my body, I'm with you
Ah hello, it's nice to see you all here
Now, as the more perceptive of you've probably realised by now
This is hell
And I am the devil
Good evening
But you can call me Toby if you like
We try to keep things informal here
As well as infernal
That's just a little joke of mine
I tell it every time
Now, you're all here for eternity
Which I hardly need to tell you
It's a heck of a long time
So you'll all get to know each other pretty well by the end
But for now I'm going to have to split you up into groups
Will you stop screaming?
Now, murderers
Murderers, over here please
Thank you
Looters and pillagers over here
Thieves, if you could join them
And lawyers, you're in that group
Fornicators, if you could step forward
My god, there are a lot of you
Could I split you up into adulterers and the rest
Male adulterers, if you could just form a line in front of that small guillotine in the corner there
Okay, um, atheists
Atheists, over here please
You must be feeling a right bunch of nitwit
I think so
And finally, you're all here for a little bit of fun
Finally, Christians
Christians
Ah yes, I'm sorry, I'm afraid the Jews were right
If you could come up here
That'd be really kind, thank you
Okay, right, well are there any questions?
Yes
No, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets
Um, if you'd read your Bible you might have seen that it was damnation without relief
So if you didn't go before you came
Then I'm afraid you're not going to enjoy yourself very much
But then I believe that's the idea
I'll run
Up the mountain
I'll kiss my hands
In fact, they both used exactly the same source material.
Human urine.
By exaggerating vast quantities of urine, sometimes up to 200 gallons at a time,
the Chinese were able to produce just a few ounces of these valuable salt crystals.
The crystals contained a concentration of human steroids and the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.
The resulting preparations were widely used to boost fertility, increase sexual potency,
treat various sexual disorders, and to improve the quality of life.
And in some cases, even encourage the growth of the beard.
To be continued...
pronounce the final epithet
that's gonna take you off
this world.
Who gonna speak for you?
Who gonna talk for Earth?
We know who speaks for the nation.
But who speaks for the planet?
Who speaks for Earth?
Coal giants of steel.
Umbrings without hearts.
Human beings without minds.
A world of pain.
No luxury.
No comfort.
No delight.
Suffering at every corner.
Enjoy yourself.
Enjoy yourself.
We must get out.
We must get out.
We must get out this place.
Is it all now?
There is no future.
We have destroyed
the last.
And we're living.
First we will enslave the Earth.
And we'll slave the Earth.
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.
And this is the
slut-jawed face of evolution.
This is the way it's been done
This is the slow-pitting,
slumbering, lullabering face
of evolution.
And uh,
you know even if X-Day doesn't work out
we'll go for
Sex Day!
Yeah!
We want you to have a dance in the air.
We want you to have

pills, but you're just too blind
yet dumb to see them.
Oh,
oh, friends,
I know you're not
the dumb-asticated
type. I know you're
the smart-asticated type.
Oh, but
people say,
Reverend Stagg, what is
slack? I want you to tell me
what slack is.
No, friends,
the television
doesn't have to watch
you as long as
you are watching the television.
And a lot of people,
a lot of people think that slack is
that Miller Beer commercial
where everybody's good-looking
and you're rich and your team just won the game
and you're drinking Miller Beer
and your favorite show is on.
And you know that's bullshit
because slack is not laziness, friends.
Slack is getting
into the zone. It's
being awake and alert
and doing what you wanted to do
until your eyes snap open
and you're smart enough
to realize that you are
God. Life is worth
living and everything is just
as psychedelic as an old
t-shirt that you can't fit into
anymore. Now, hold
that thought. Hold it
in your head because that is what
slack is all about, friends.
Slack is
something for nothing.

I cut my
.
.
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.
It swelled up to the size of a human head.
And then a mouth opened on it.
And this is what it said.
It said it killed the pink boys.
Quit your job.
Mock the world and worship Bob Dobbs.
We'll build a ship and take a trip.
Come on and get a pay ride to coordinates.
Three and a half months in my garage.
Tearing parts off of old used cars.
My groin at this point was unusually large.
It would occasionally hum while smoking cigars.
Our project was finished.
This ship would hold twenty.
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny.
We didn't need the slackless. They're hapless.
Our mercurial work is escaping a stark fix.
On our way to planet extra sex.
The next next.
The parry's with Harry Potter money shot at Connie Twa.
It's an all haas hour of bonanza.
It's like a world without Tony Danza.
A banza. The pink shit that gets the charts.
We hit a world of dead hearts.
I will paint this lobotomy and sodomy.
We take a moment and we pause to reflect on the pinks that we killed.
And the planet that they wrecked.
And we laugh like babies.
We're a victory dance.
In our under rooms and panties.
Our fantasy is a reality.
Earth turns to dust. Planet X are bust for us.
As Bob's pipe is split.
Space and time shift.
A temporal disturbance.
The cons of the slag.
We cross in.
A dimensional split.
Separates forever.
Subgenite from pink shit.
Bob walked in a circle.
And steadily exhaled in the smoke.
I can see why the pink boys fail.
The K and A's has con destruction.
Sick and full of slag with suction.
Paper view alien abduction.
Functioning on solar slack.
The money should be painted black.
The leak from space that stole your balls.
Will soon come back and take it all.
Return to slack.
Return to Bob.
Repent slack off and quit your jobs.
Smugly the beast.
Knob concrete.
Lick the throbbing vein of slavery.
Now you're sleeping like a baby.
Wait for the Bob who'll be up to the key.
And the dog.
The guy who's been talking with the UFO in his garage.
I cut my finger on a soup can lid.
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.
It swelled up to the size of a human head.
And then a mouth opened on it.
And this is what it said.
It said to kill the pink boys.
Put your job.
Mock the world.
And worship Bob Dogg.
We'll build a ship.
And take a trip.
Come on and get a pen right in the coordinates.
Three and a half months in my garage.
Tearing parts off of old used cars.
My grind at this point was unusually large.
I would occasionally hum while smoking cigars.
Our project was finished.
The ship would hold twenty.
The power source was like a ninja crew.
The thing was funny.
The slack was there hapless.
Our birth proof is worth it.
Escaping a star fixed.
On our way to planet extra sex.
The Rex next.
The Perry's with Harry Potter.
The house Tony's damsel.
Fans of the pink shit that hits the charts.
In a world of dead hearts.
I believe in this lobotomy and sodomy.
We take a moment and we pause to reflect.
On the pinks that were killed.
And the planet that we wrecked.
We laugh like banshees and howl like the banshees.
Where victory did it.
In our under rooms and canteens.
Our fantasy is a reality.
Earth hurts the dust.
Planet extra crusts are ugly.
Press the eddy blood that flows in your veins.
Let the froth pinecob bring slack like rain.
Our control is left up to the brain.
Oh gas and all your money.
Let the river I will stay.
Oh yes.
Send all your money to me.
Ah my god.

Jones, Killing Joke, Soundbites from Rainbow Bridge, me preaching in Austin, Arthur Brown
doing the song Fire, Robin Hitchcock with the uncorrected personality traits, and Dr.
Lake Hume at the Austin Devival preaching about X Day.
In the background, we hear Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Sphinx Drum and Dr. Ray Hay and Mojo
and the other swinging love corpses from the infamous Bay Dat Jams.
Ah, yes, it brings back memories, friends, and I remember my first visit to Dobbs Town,
how Bob first showed me the proof of his vision.
For the first time, I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.
What else could it be?
The frightening of the thought may be, it could happen.
The sun will become dark, the moon blood red, the stars of the heavens will fall, there'll
be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming, the islands and the mountains are
shaken out of their sockets, and the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the
face of the earth.
It's all coming.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times.
And think to yourself, there's no place like Bob.
That's great, it starts with a handshake.
Exits UFO's outer space.
J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.
He is the eye of a hurricane, watch your money burn.
Think, serve your own needs, yet he's every your own needs.
Feed him on a purse with workday strength.
End times are close at hand, uber woman, over man.
Liar in a fire, representing all we hate.
With a government for hire and a common good.



On bad side, the best is less a genie in a hurry with a con reading down their neck.
Group by group, normals falsified, bullfarts.
Look at that love playing, fine then.
Uh-oh, oh no, population they don't know.
Save yourself, serve yourself, pinks serve their own need.
Yet he's every your own need, time to plunge your own seed.
Yet he with a rupture in the rubber in the right.
Writing super slack, maniac, slam, fight, bright, light.
Feeling pretty psyched.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world.
It's the end of the world as we know it.

July 5th, X Day, pleasure ships are on their way.
Quit your job, keep your slack.

Hail Connie, hail Bob.
On your knees, self-righteous love.
Give it up, give it in.
Find yourself your Yeti kit.

There's going to be a glory hole confessional, right?
And who knows if Bob may be in there
Or Connie
Or both
Yeah
Just think of that, Rocknar
All you gotta do if you really want to be in the hot tub with me
Is you gotta go to the hot tub
Imagine it in your mind
And you'll have it
I won't necessarily have to be there
I can't even imagine Dave in the hot tub
Yeah
I can't either
You know, you'll begin vomiting freely

Perhaps evacuating and peeing at the same time?
No, their mind bogs at such things
We don't want to view this in our mind
Are you the one that evacuated in the hot tub, Dave?
No, man
Friends, on X-Day, when you're at Brushwood
You will finally get to evacuate
Or vacate the evacuation room
Or vacate the evacuation chamber
You will
You will get off
If you're smart enough to build your own ship
You will get off the pot
And build your, well
Build your own outhouse
You start with that

X Day's past, friends. It's an ESO
Swamp Radio with
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and
Professor Chaz Smith. You know,
friends, some people think that we're a dangerous
Texas saucer death cult.
Now, how is that dangerous?
How are you dangerous?
You don't
conform to proper thought patterns.
You need to be scanned. Well, neither
do you, and you need to be scanned
too.
Oh my goodness.
There's no accident that God has you on
at this late hour where decent people
can't hear you except for those
like me that are forced to stay awake
to feed their families.
What am I gonna do with this animal?
I'm gonna kill it.
Control, control, you must
be in control.
I'm gonna take a minute
just to show a real
emotion. Excellent,
excellent. I read you
loud and clear. Now
then, you are to take this
planet in the name of the Earth.
He's gonna bump you up, yeah.
He's got a gun, you know.
Well, all right, if you're gonna kill me, hurry up. I have to take my
tonic in two. I hope you enjoy
that.
I'll tell you the way it is
and I'm not gonna
be kind or easy.
Your low attitude
stinks, I say,
and the life you lead
is completely empty.
But let's leave things
of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob
for this brief minute of slack
from the Church of the Subgenius.
Now, friend,
I know you're
going through hell sometimes, trying to get
slack in this life, but
it'll all be worth it in the end
because it's a forgiven Lord.
He lets you get away with
murder. Of course, he'll make you
suffer through hell for it, but that ain't
nothing compared to the pleasure dimensions
that come after your eternity in hell.
Because, you know, if you went straight to the pleasure
dimensions without going through hell first, you wouldn't be
able to appreciate it. It's a simple
homey old rule, but oh,
so often forgotten in today's
world. People can't count up to the
ten anymore, so they aren't so good at counting
their blessings. They watch TV
instead of sitting on their front porch.
They don't have slack.
It's a slackless
land, and hell has even less slack.
Actually, it's a kind of a-slack
or anti-slack. Oh, it's bad, friends.
You could die and go there any second all the
times you've sinned against Bob,
denied his sweet name.
You know, they say it's Bob that puts
the teeth in south hell,
friends.
Yes, X-Day is coming, and what
about these X-ists? What?
You know, we know that we're gonna be the
deuce-pangs, so geniuses will be lifted
up by the escape vessels of
the sex goddesses and go to Planet X,
but who lives
on Planet X?
What is the X-ist?
Friends, the X-ist
remains a
complete mystery.
But with the power of negative art,
we can capture,
this alien in his negative
and yet natural
habitat. See,
dines off the bushes
over there,
keeps yanking at his head
like he's in pain.
He's suffering.
He's crying.
His head is shrinking.
He's in pain.
He can't stand
living another second. He must
kill himself to relieve himself
of such horrible, horrible pain.
He's in agony.
People thought negative art
wasn't just a trend,
but then it braced
back with all the vengeance of
shadow mastery.
But as soon as we're gone,
you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening
by radio, you folks listening by record, who know
not Jesus Christ, once the church is gone,
there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment,
and millions will die in those next few years.
They'll be glued to their sets,
watching rockets,
and jets, blowing up schools
and factories, putting an end to the birds
and bees. It's worth every penny
to tune in and see
who wins the enemy at the
root of the academy. Watch
World War III on pay TV
before your television
melts away.
It's the end of the
world as we know it.
It's the end
of the world as we know it.
It's the
end of the world.
As we know it, I
feel fine.
A-O, let's go.
Shoot them in the back now.
What they want,
I don't know.
They're all ripped up and ready to go.
Turn around.
Go back down, back
the way you came.
Can't
you see that flash
of fire? Ten
times brighter than the
day. And
behold, a mighty
city broken
in the dust again.
Oh, God,
pride of man,
broken in
the dust again.
It's gonna be me,
and it's gonna be
you.
We're gonna do everything
we want to.
It's gotta be,
now, and I
can't wait
to say goodbye to fear
and all that pain and hate.
Oh, like
a flaming baton
that's ready to
twirl. Like George
Bush on acid
singing the duke of
gonna be a new
world.
Gonna be a new world.
I'm excited.
Can't you watch
that switch?
There's nothing left for you to say.
Soon you'll be dead anyway.
Well, no one
here is getting
out alive.
There's someone really lost my mind
and I don't care.
So
close your eyes
and get yourself a fight.
And think about the
All the times he's been and what they've been
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
That's why we might as well take our time
Ah, yeah!
One more day on the road
Let's go!
If I scream they'll spin me faster
Everything gone backwards
And it's upside down
To stop me, said, oh, I think I'm falling
Falling from the 14 story
One more land and it will be morning
Hit the floor
To stop the traffic
Stop the clock
Stop the law
I want to know
I want to get on
I want to get on with you
I want to get on
I want to get on with you
One more job in the supermarket
One more kick to get me started
Everyone get on board
This ship is sinking
What?
Of the limitless
Sex and violence
In the wake of Ragnarok
Welcome to the slaughter
What are you going to do?
What will be your habitat?
When we get done with you
Are you gonna cry for your mama?
Or are you gonna have a good time?
Are you gonna be a bohab?
When it's your turn to die
The dog is going to take you crazy
Ragnarok all around
Anarchy, fear, it's the Ragnarok party town
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
He said I never engaged in this type of thing before, but yes, I believe it can be very
easily done.
Just put some breeches out in the sun in the Cabin Auto Highway 61.
Oh yeah!
Next days are coming and the pigs are bumming.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
And I feel fine.
I feel fine.

It's 1893, Dave.
It is.
For all we know.
For all we know.
Be cavitated?
You know the leading cause of death?
Yeah, the leading cause of death.
Oh, about 100, 125, 130 years ago.
Leading cause of death.
200 years ago was horse accidents.
Getting kicked by a horse.
Being run over by a carriage or a buckboard.
Yeah.
Horse-related incidents.
Or just in general, dealing with large, you know, hoofed animals.
Yep.
And killed a lot of people.
And they're coming back, dear friend.
Cows.
If you can call yourself a friend.
The cows are going to take our place on the genetic ladder.
On the evolutionary scale.
Soon, vast hordes of cows will be inhabiting perhaps parts of your home.
You can see them already in golf courses.
You can see them in public halls.
And in the chambers of the dead.
It's confusing.
I'm willing to do my part.
They have a chamber for the dead already.
Man, I'm going to go see if that dude wants to go on the air.
Get along, little Bobby.
Hold on.
You get your slackers.
Come on up this ramp.
Enter those spaceship doors.
Ignore the screams and the hammer blow sounds coming from inside.
Come on.
Yah!
Yah!
Rah!
Ha!
It's a real pleasure to hear you sing like that.
It's a fantastic thing.
We're all.
All.
Extra terrestrials.
On a cycle that is ancestral.
We're off to see the wizard.
On a paradise among the stars.
We're all.
Extra terrestrials.
On a mission that is ancestral.
We're off to see the wizard.
On a world among the stars.
You know that scientists have said.
That the Earth will soon be dead.
Philosophers have told us long ago.
You'd think by now we'd all be in the know.
Is that a bird-covered microphone?
I don't think so.
An M-perks.
Larry?
Larry, is that a microphone covered in a song?
Boys and girls.
Boys and girls, it's time for you to whatever.
The pacifier.
No.
It could knock a lot out here.
It could.
It could knock a lot out here.
It's just gonna be tiny.
It could.
It's still a corporation.
Academia.
And dream of pleasure ships.
From high above.
On July 5th this year.
Go to sleep.
And dream of flying high.
On lullabies.
And dreams that Bob has not.
And dreams that Bob has not.
And dreams that Bob has not.
Sex gonises and squid shall hide away.
The smiling face of Bob will keep you safe till no second.
The sex gonises and squids shall hide away.
Oh, I missed it.
Now it's the other part.
Oh, I get it now.
Oh, I get it now.
Oh, I get it now.
Oh, I get it now.
Oh, I get it now.
Oh, I get it now.
I got it now.



Sitting here.
Oh, I am the vesv.



I have all
Sex goth wannabes on my walking,

But I'll begin swaying back and forth.
Smiling face so I could keep you safe until next day.
2001.
For next day.
Adios, amigos.
The number you have reached.
P.O. Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

The new number is.
P.O. Box 2-0-4-2-0-6.
Austin, Texas 7-8-7-2-0.
Please make a note of it.
Think of all the hate there is in red China.
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama.
