1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,260
Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait, but you just gotta have another

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,440
Some Genius Hour of Smoking

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,500
From PR News in Washington, I'm facing two days of marijuana in Jacksonville, Florida.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,260
Trump said, good people don't smoke.

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,460
PR News, Washington.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,460
He said, we're only in the water.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,100
The Dow is 39.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,340
President Trump says this PR News is defective.

9
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,740
Trump says, we're only in the water.

10
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:36,480
The Dow is 39.

11
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:18,340
Trump says, we're only in the water.

12
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,300
Yeah

13
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,320
Oh

14
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,320
Man

15
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,460
Oh

16
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,120
Wow

17
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,840
Far out

18
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,280
I like the new landing pads on the bottom of the shows show well

19
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah, you agree

20
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,220
Everyone agrees these new show well landing pad struts or

21
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,780
Strut lifters are excellent. Excellent

22
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,440
You know, those are not immune to sabotage though. No, they're kind of delicate

23
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,500
Now I'm sure that on a certain planetoid of unnamed origin

24
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,260
they would be

25
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
rife for vandalism there are terrorists who use

26
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,480
chemicals

27
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,820
that

28
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,460
Slowly eat away at the infrastructure. I noticed that you know, and I'd say to them time bombs basically

29
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,980
You'd say bow Honda's man

30
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,840
Rust

31
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,700
Rust virus is loose. What would you say?

32
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,840
I got away from them. No. No, I can't say that we did

33
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:01,420
But what would you say to them I would say hello boys, I'm back but it's the wrong music I think

34
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,340
Hello boys

35
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,720
Oh

36
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,260
They got my attention that was really well don't we'll careful with his truck don't pay

37
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,460
Yeah

38
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,820
books millions of dollars

39
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,360
To replace those struts one thing you can there are lots of paperwork

40
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,640
I mean a good for clubbing baby seals, but other than that bio lifters. Yeah, you we club the baby harp seals

41
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,600
You gotta be tough and you gotta be mine to our field. Those are for you

42
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,260
Let me tell you

43
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
That's the sound I like sure sure sure yeah

44
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,300
Brilliant brilliant. I have to say that once a week. It's crowd-pleasing

45
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,520
Oh

46
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,680
Yes, thank you

47
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,680
puzzling evidence show from February 3rd 2012 when we were

48
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,600
Still driving to California every year

49
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,820
we'll be hearing more of that show and probably some fire sign theater and ESO swamp radio and

50
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,700
Lemur news and I don't know I haven't decided yet

51
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:14,060
This episode is late because we're in Texas and the whole state utterly shut down for repairs from Sunday to Thursday

52
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,380
the subgenius foundation

53
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,780
Headquarters is now repaired anyway for a while there. We were sleeping under nine blankets and five dogs and cats

54
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,600
And this was a real bad week for trying to house train the two new puppies

55
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,620
adopted yeti and chupacabra or

56
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,480
Yeti peas yet. He's a dog and chupi makes poopy

57
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,260
But yeah a long time ago the Texas government said they'd share electric power

58
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,280
With the rest of the country when hail freezes over

59
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,600
Well hell did that but these pinks in power and their few packing dupes

60
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:03,320
Still think they're brilliant and efficient enough to secede from the Union and still keep the horse-drawn

61
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,160
Shaves running on time

62
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,860
while vacationing in Cancun

63
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,100
Until they get caught

64
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,740
the music in the background here is

65
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,280
cyberchump

66
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,540
from their moment of perfect happiness and

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
And now this

68
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,460
Stands for most of us here all these Reverend eyes and staying third show

69
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,160
He's subgenius for fire. We don't really even have a day

70
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,500
so big

71
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,540
channel

72
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,220
162 and then the scene of

73
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,540
and

74
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,740
well

75
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,500
We've got some footage. We'd like to show you and also some arm edge and some handed

76
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,560
but we can't share it until the preparations are made

77
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,600
someone with a mortuary hat or some other kind of thing

78
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,080
Oh look

79
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,240
He's shooting the tits

80
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,520
Wow look at Bob Hanley

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,000
That curl

82
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,880
Friends don't you wish you knew where the subgenius bench party is

83
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,680
You know there's someone calling but I can't put them on the air

84
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,540
I

85
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,940
Don't know what does that mean the call is on the air or just waiting now to not be on there

86
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,360
I don't know see I'm not I don't have the great power of the Chaz man

87
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,560
I'll just push button here. Now. What if you go speaker? I'm just pushing red buttons. I'm pushing all the red

88
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,080
Wow

89
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,980
Wow

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,440
Now you get back up man. There's a phone. It's not 15 feet up. I can't see any light up there hard

91
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,520
I can't work none of the other buttons work at all now

92
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,460
Look at all the other buttons are the doors are all deactivated

93
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,760
Did you notice all the doors are all closed and they're like vacuum sealing?

94
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,520
Whoa

95
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,900
Yes

96
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Super

97
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,620
Taxi Bob

98
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,380
Hey taxi Bob are you picking up some some some ladies?

99
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,520
No

100
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,940
Carrying them to their places

101
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,800
I could I could go over and see but I haven't been doing that lately

102
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,120
What kind of line would you give me if you were gonna pick me up?

103
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,120
Hey baby do you want to ride home?

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,640
Wow that's pretty clever

105
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,880
Where is the taxi?

106
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,880


107
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,880


108
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,880


109
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,880


110
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,420
Do you want to ride home?

111
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,240
That works? Does that work for you?

112
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,640
I don't know

113
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,780
I'll get her either my home or her home

114
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,940
Hey baby do you want to ride home?

115
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm gonna try I'm right wait a minute where's my pen I'm gonna write that down

116
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You gotta say it just like that too

117
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,940
That makes me feel funny in my mouth

118
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,500
It's the sex goddesses

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,340
So yeah when you get the sex goddesses

120
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,880
You really gotta watch out

121
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,760
You gotta watch out

122
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,940
We have our own sex goddess here

123
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,860
Oh X goddess

124
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,980
Max goddess

125
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,560
X goddess

126
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,900
X

127
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:19,900


128
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,700
Oh my god

129
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,680
Do you dare to know the secret of

130
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,060
X

131
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,660
X

132
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,900
X goddess

133
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
Do you dare to pass through the doorway

134
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,760
And do

135
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,460
As if a black cat

136
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,720
It's just like we were talking about reverend Stang

137
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,960
Ok I have a question about the black cat

138
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,020
Black cat

139
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,900
In general

140
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,400
Ok now I've always

141
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,900
Heard that if they crossed one way in front of you

142
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,780
It's good luck

143
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,720
Is it true or is it

144
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,120
Either way they cross in front of you is bad luck

145
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,780
And if there is a good luck way

146
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,040
For them to cross in front of you

147
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,860
Which way is it left to right or right to left

148
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,880
If the cat

149
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,980
If a black cat walks

150
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,740
From left to right, in front of you, it reverses the previous...

151
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,180
It's a balancing...

152
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,080
Yeah, the last time one walked in front of you from left to right, forward, that produced a lot of bad luck.

153
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,300
So if you don't walk backward in the opposite direction, then that can negate that previous...

154
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,480
Oh, so you've got to track the little bastard down. It's like a rabies thing.

155
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,940
You get him to walk backwards.

156
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
It's a transaction reversal.

157
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,460
Now, can you drag him? Can you drag him, like, by the tail?

158
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,120
Oh, well, you can do whatever it takes.

159
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,860
You can do whatever... What? What's that so hard?

160
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,840
See, what you say on the radio happens in real life.

161
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,660
I guess so. It's happening in the studio.

162
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,760
Right now, even as we speak, there's a cat back there that's trying to get away.

163
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,160
That sounds a little like the X-Cat, actually.

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,380
But whatever, yeah, it's a cat.

165
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,600
Maybe you're right about that.

166
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,700
Yeah.

167
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,700
You've got to go with it, man. It's radio.

168
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,000
It's only in your mind. You just say it, and then it happens.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,580
Now, what would you rather do? Do what you're doing right now or sit through a session of Congress?

170
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,340
I do want to go right now, a session of Congress.

171
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
I mean, come on. You want to eat your own hat after that.

172
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,440
Yeah, you want to eat your own hat. Right, right, right.

173
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,940
Did you see that? That just went...

174
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,600
So whatever I say on the radio will happen in real life.

175
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,140
Yeah, it's done. That's what happened.

176
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,460
Well, except if you were in Congress right now.

177
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,260
Oh, I was going to say that there will be plenty of tickets.

178
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,740
Like, watch this. I think Ivan Stang's here.

179
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,880
There will be plenty of tickets for everybody.

180
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,640
No, that didn't work at all. Let me try again.

181
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,460
I think Ivan Stang's here.

182
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,840
Sherlock and the Ladd de Massouli.

183
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,760
See? I said it on the radio, and it happened.

184
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,420
How about that?

185
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,080
Never mind, you guys. They don't even know who you're referring to out here.

186
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,360
Indeed, we have again the mighty Ivan Stang joins us in here in the studio.

187
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,100
We're lit.

188
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,620
Get a second job.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,800
A lot of chaos.

190
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,720
Get them.

191
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,320
What happened is we get mail.

192
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,660
I don't read the fan mail on the air because that'd be bragging.

193
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
But I love reading.

194
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,420
I love reading the bitter, butthurt, politically offended rage quitters.

195
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,020
And here, I got this email from someone I've never...

196
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,640
The name doesn't seem at all familiar to me.

197
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,300
I saw the documentary.

198
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,180
Talking about the J.R. Bob-Bob's in the Church of the Subgenius by Sandy Boone.

199
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,280
Great film.

200
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,460
You hear Yeti? That's Yeti back there.

201
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,260
We think he's going to grow to be very...

202
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,760
Big and live up to his name.

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,680
Ivan, I grew up going to sci-fi conventions and the Church of the Subgenius was everywhere.

204
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,420
I doubt that.

205
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,320
It was anti-establishment and we all reveled in it.

206
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,240
The mere concept of the church was a silly promise that the world could be a different place.

207
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,280
Then you and the church publicly chose sides with the conspiracy.

208
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,400
In case you haven't noticed, I'm not a fan of the J.R. Bob-Bob.

209
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,400


210
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:47,700
You are now the fascist, crony establishment that hates freedom and spreads bigotry under the guise of being, quote, progressive, unquote.

211
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:56,200
I suggest you break out of your bubble and read some real progressive literature like Booker T. Washington or Thomas Sowell.

212
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,340
Ex-fan.

213
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,700
And the reason I like to read these is because...

214
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,280
Then I get to read my...

215
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,940
Response.

216
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,360
As follows.

217
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,400
I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.

218
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:11,920
Seriously.

219
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,500
Last letter I got like this was a guy who seemed to be mad because I was obviously not a Trump fan.

220
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,660
He was about as articulate as you are.

221
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,980
In other words, super easy to blow off.

222
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:33,120
If you'd care to be somehow a little more specific in your criticism rather than just expressing anger and righteous indignation,

223
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,380
I'd be happy to keep you tight.

224
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm not a fan of your typing, but I bet you just can't quite find the words to express the source of your outrage in any way that would make sense to another person.

225
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,640
Prove me wrong.

226
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,620
He did not.

227
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,720
He never responded.

228
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,420
They never do.

229
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,420
Your reference to my bubble indicates to me that you're just wildly guessing.

230
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,760
And, uh...

231
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,420
Yeah, my bubble.

232
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,300
Oh.

233
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,500
Oh.

234
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:04,600


235
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,760
Bad guess.

236
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,780
Real bad guess.

237
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,520
Um...

238
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,660
Thanks to Lib Murr for the news and titles.

239
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,920
And now this.

240
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,720
The decade has been marked by strong growth, the lowest unemployment in a generation, and yet remarkably little inflation.

241
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,140
Some think it's a boom without end.

242
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,900
I was about to give up on the church.

243
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:44,400
The thing was 10, 15 years old, and people were starting to get tired of it, and things weren't quite as terrifying as they are now.

244
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,380
As freer trade flourished this decade, the Internet evolved into a commercial phenomenon.

245
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,100
Then the Internet came along.

246
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,540
People can tune into it 24 hours a day.

247
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,880
Suddenly, we could reach those fringe people that weren't going to run into it.

248
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,500
They could do it in a bookstore.

249
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,660
There's the loss of, you have to know a guy.

250
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,000
In the 80s, there was a cost to knowing about them.

251
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:20,820
Now, you can meet people and signal who you are in quicker and more efficient ways.

252
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,220
Perhaps, you know, with less depth.

253
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:32,540
The Internet did so much to kill so much old ways of doing things, and I think it makes it a lot harder now to make a big splash.

254
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,400
Yeah.

255
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,880
It's a must.

256
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,140
The media, it flattens everything out like TV used to do.

257
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:46,120
So that an inconsequential event is the same as a horrendous calamity or a staggering triumph of humanity.

258
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:55,720
And the people exposed to it no longer can distinguish between factual things and fantasies and trite.

259
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,880
And that was from Sandy Boone's YouTube channel.

260
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:03,880


261
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:03,880


262
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:03,880


263
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:03,880


264
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:03,880


265
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:03,880


266
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,120
It's a movie about the Church of the Subgenius called J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

267
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:18,740
Streaming on a whole bunch of places that that whiny person was complaining about.

268
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,800
Boy, hey, you're danged if you do and danged if you don't.

269
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,380
But now, some Firesign Theater.

270
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,320
No, they don't bite.

271
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,420
And...

272
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,880
Well, Ben, as you know...

273
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,660
I know chinchillas or mutated chinchillas like these, blue mutants, we call them.

274
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Is that because of their peculiar coloration, Brad, that makes them so rare?

275
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:53,180
No, they were first crossbred or introduced, as we say, by Alistair Blue, a mutations expert who's been into the raising of these little sweethearts.

276
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,460
Oh, careful there.

277
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,020
Is he getting away?

278
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,740
That's all right.

279
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,820
We've got a lot more of them, and they do that, and that's part of the fun of raising them.

280
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,560
And they're very clean, clean animals.

281
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,880
I wanted to ask about that.

282
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,960
They're very clean.

283
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,760
And if they do mess, as we refer to it, they'll do it in their little cages, and it doesn't make any difference.

284
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,240
And they dig a little hole for it also.

285
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,180
Is that what this one's doing here?

286
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,160
Can we get a close-up of that?

287
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,560
No, no.

288
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,420
No, this one's just trying to get away.

289
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,100
That's his mate over there.

290
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,140
That's the one they're trying to catch.

291
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,160
Well, look at that.

292
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,960
They just caught it.

293
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,880
Oh, that's...

294
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
Our floor manager just told me they stepped on it.

295
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,140
Oh, that's a...

296
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,280
That's a female.

297
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,420
That's a squirrel, as we say.

298
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,100
Those bright colors around the snout.

299
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,860
Nose rings, we call them.

300
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,440
They differentiate between them.

301
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,800
And, of course, you just cover them up with this nair guard, and they won't breed.

302
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,640
They can't breed?

303
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,000
No, no, no.

304
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,680
They can't breed.

305
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,400
There's one crawling up my leg.

306
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,360
But seriously, Brad, Ken, we want them to breed as much as possible.

307
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:01,040
And this guard is only used, of course, when you're away on vacation, you know, and it becomes inconvenient for them to...

308
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,400
Uh-huh.

309
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,840
Uh...

310
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,300
Uh, Brad, now, how...

311
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,760
Did we...

312
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,500
Let's go over to that demonstration you told me to go.

313
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,560
Oh, sure.

314
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,080
Well, I'm gonna show you how absolutely trouble-free these little animals are.

315
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,840
Back here.

316
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,120
If you have kids like I know I have, you'll want to watch this very carefully now.

317
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,560
Now, we got a big close-up right there of the little...

318
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,820
If you just...

319
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,420
He's still here.

320
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,740
Yep.

321
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,460
Now, I'm gonna put out this lighted cigarette on this chinchilla now.

322
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,340
There.

323
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,480
Now, you...

324
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,680
See, you can see I'm just letting it burn there.

325
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,700
It doesn't harm the coat at all.

326
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,420
Oh, that's amazing.

327
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,240
Yeah, it certainly is.

328
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,260
Well, how's...

329
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,660
It's still smoking there.

330
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,160
Yes.

331
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,080
Well, how is this possible, Ken?

332
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,960
Well, Brad, this chinchilla is entirely synthetic.

333
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,820
That's fantastic.

334
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,360
And with these little fellas raised in your spare time in the playhouse or the garage or the slaves' quarters,

335
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,760
you'll be making hay while the sun shines and at midnight, too, with mutant blue.

336
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,580
Well, thank you.

337
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,460
Thank you, Brad.

338
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,720
And you two little...

339
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,220
What's his name?

340
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,920
He doesn't have a name.

341
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,600
They're all the same.

342
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,780
Oh, well, thank you.

343
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,740
Just a moment.

344
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,240
We'll tell you the numbers to call.

345
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,780
I thought that's where it was.

346
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,920
So, you're gonna be here again.

347
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,080
I'm glad I wasn't gonna go this year.

348
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,280
Why?

349
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,900
To X-Day?

350
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,440
He's talking about X-Day.

351
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,960
There's only, like, 30% of the people who try to get tickets haven't so far.

352
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,560
That's true.

353
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,820
What?

354
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,480
30% of all people total are males?

355
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah.

356
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,540
Anybody's ever heard?

357
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:26,880
Which is what?

358
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,320
How many?

359
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,280
That's 4,000 people right there.

360
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,520
You're talking about Starwood, right?

361
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,820
Yeah.

362
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,060
Talking about X-Day.

363
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,540
No, X-Day.

364
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,520
X-Day.

365
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,480
Yeah, sleep now.

366
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,000
X-Day.

367
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,600
I've never gone to X-Day.

368
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,140
I mean...

369
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,320
Why?

370
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,640
No, Drummond will be there.

371
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,540
How do you get tickets to X-Day?

372
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,620
Do you have to, like, send in a pinky finger or something?

373
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,140
Yeah, basically.

374
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,900
You have to be a sub-jewish minister.

375
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,940
You have to get all the way across the country.

376
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,360
And you have to pay to take it.

377
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
And you have to get this across the universe.

378
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,700
As a registered...

379
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,780
Extremely rural southern Ohio.

380
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,720
As a registered anti-gay.

381
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,900
What are we gonna do?

382
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,820
Because here it is.

383
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,880
What are all those giggling gaggles of...

384
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,640
What are you gonna do?

385
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,820
You will do anything you want to do.

386
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,220
Anything.

387
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,240
Those giggling gaggles of gals.

388
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,480
They had anarchy, though.

389
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,060
Of naked gals.

390
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,000
What's the anti-bob?

391
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,800
I don't know.

392
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
Cavorting and running, scampering.

393
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,100
There's a lot of cavorting and running and scampering.

394
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,800
Little nymphs.

395
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,900
There's a lot of puking and diarrhea.

396
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,120
Hurling and whizzing.

397
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:26,660
Scampering.

398
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,400
Skiddling.

399
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,320
Yeah.

400
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,560
Skiddling and skiddling and branding.

401
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,500
Scampering.

402
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,500


403
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,920
Scampering around.

404
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,760
Oh, come on.

405
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Down.

406
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,820
I heard the worst cover of Mongoloid ever at X-Day.

407
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,080
Oh, really?

408
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,400
Yeah.

409
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,500
The absolute worst.

410
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:40,780
Excellent.

411
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,460
That should be out on CD next year.

412
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,300
Maybe we should go for a contest where we try to do a worse version.

413
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,800
No, you don't...

414
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,920
No, if you try...

415
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, if you try it, that's worse.

416
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,600
Because then everybody gets up with their idea.

417
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,560
This is the real thing.

418
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,160
You just have to wait for that thing to fall on your lap.

419
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,080
Also, the very worst version of All Along the Watchtower I've ever heard was played.

420
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,760
Wow.

421
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,300
By the...

422
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,940
The same bunch at X-Day, including myself.

423
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Was that Lloyd's band, Mongoloid?

424
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,400
No.

425
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,280
No.

426
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
It was a jam band that formed spontaneously.

427
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:19,760
And sometimes was really good, but not when they tried to do Mongoloid and All Along the Watchtower.

428
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,960
Something went very, very, very wrong.

429
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,860
As it were.

430
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,140
Mongoloid.

431
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,800
He was a Mongoloid.

432
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,660
Mongoloid.

433
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,200
Mongoloid.

434
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,860
Boy, it seems like more and more subgeniuses are channeling Bob.

435
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,140
And that's good, because my last half of a brain cell needs to heal for a while after 40 years of it.

436
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,860
No, 41 years.

437
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,800
Anyway, I got this in the snail mail with no return address.

438
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,600
And it's...

439
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,280
It's a photocopy with a little bit...

440
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
A little bit of clip art on a pipe and an alien.

441
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,700
A big X.

442
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,200
The revelations of Reverend Xenofact.

443
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,580
It did come from San Jose, California.

444
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,080
And...

445
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,540
Here's the revelations of Reverend Xenofact.

446
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,420
One.

447
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,780
Do not be the best person you can be.

448
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,600
Be the best product Bob can sell.

449
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,060
Two.

450
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,140
Because...

451
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,880
Because he is lucky, Bob does not worry.

452
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,020
Because Bob doesn't worry, he's lucky.

453
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,580
Three.

454
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,380
The conspiracy outsources self-hatred.

455
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,380
Don't hate yourself.

456
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,960
Let the conspiracy do the hard work.

457
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,180
Four.

458
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,660
Money is a tool.

459
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,820
You can find slack putting it to use.

460
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,740
Yeah.

461
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,860
Five.

462
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,280
Four.

463
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:07,440
One day out from under the thumb of the conspiracy is a day they can never take away.

464
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,100
Six.

465
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,640
Be honest with yourself.

466
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,860
But remember, cruelty is rarely honest.

467
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,540
I guess that means don't be cruel to yourself, even when you're being honest.

468
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,580
Seven.

469
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,860
Slack is worthy of study.

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,260
And sometimes, studying slack is a form of slack.

471
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,280
Six.

472
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,620
If Bob didn't exist, we'd have to invent him.

473
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,160
If we didn't exist, Bob would have to invent us.

474
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,480
Nine.

475
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,460
Find slack in what gives others slack.

476
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,120
Invest in slack so it accumulates.

477
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,600
Ten.

478
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
Or X.

479
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,720
But just because it's smart doesn't mean it's not stupid as well.

480
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,260
Ten.

481
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,200
And X1.

482
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,940
Or 11.

483
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,500
One smart ass statement can save the world.

484
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,660
Keep making them until you find the right one.

485
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,000
The revelations of Reverend Zeno fact.

486
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:26,240
Now, if this hadn't been mailed from San Jose, I would suspect that Onan Canobite wrote this

487
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,520
stuff.

488
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,260
Because it seems a lot like his own book, and it's not a book that he wrote.

489
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,260


490
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,260


491
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,260


492
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,260


493
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,260


494
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,260


495
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:39,600
It's a little pithy lines in the Dobbs.town mirror, which all subgenius members should

496
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,140
look at.

497
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Also, dobscord.something.com.

498
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,480
It's another new one.

499
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,040
And, of course, subgenius.com.

500
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,300
And now, this.

501
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,240
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

502
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,180
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

503
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,280
Use me like an ashtray heart.

504
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,280
Right from the start.

505
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,440
Case of the punks.

506
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,220
Another day, another way.

507
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,860
Somebody's had too much to think.

508
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Open up another case of the punks.

509
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,460
Each pillow is counted like a rock.

510
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,240
The mother follows up the mother.

511
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:11,620
figure. Somebody's had too much to thank. Send your mother home, your navel. Case of the Pulse!

512
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:26,340
New hearts to the dining rooms. Violet hot cake. Dissolved in new cards, boards,

513
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,420
trouts, underwear.

514
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:43,920
Yeah, stray heart, you picked me up. Brushed me off. Crushed me while I was burning out.

515
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,320
Then you picked me up.

516
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Like an ashtray heart. Hit behind the curtain. Waited for me to go out. A man on a porcupine

517
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:18,660
fence. Used me for an ashtray heart. Hit me where the lover hangs out.

518
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,500
Stood behind the curtain.

519
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,260
Stood behind the curtain.

520
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,320
Stood behind the curtain.

521
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,700
While they crushed me out.

522
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,160
You used me for an ashtray heart.

523
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,920
Music

524
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,620
Music

525
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,300
Music

526
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
Music

527
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
Music

528
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,200


529
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,860
You looked in the window when I went out

530
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,980
You used me like an ashtray heart

531
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,720
That was Captain Beefheart, of course.

532
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,940
The song Ashtray Heart from his song Doc at the radar station.

533
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,720
And now we're going to go to a really interesting stretch of the Puzzling Evidence show from 2012

534
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:42,140
when Reverend Shining Path of Least Resistance called the show to discuss his visit to North Korea.

535
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,940
The seat is coming over.

536
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,260
Connect to the front of the North Korea station.

537
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,980
The seat is coming over.

538
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,500
It keeps coming over.

539
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,760
Come in, over.

540
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,480
He said something about it.

541
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,640
Next time I'm just passing.

542
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,400
Come in, over.

543
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,680
Come on over.

544
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,760
I'm just going to pack it into the radio show.

545
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,020
Well, that's what 60% of all of us do.

546
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
We just pack it in.

547
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,080
Yeah, just pack them right in.

548
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,060
Something like that.

549
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,560
Yeah, I figured I could do something like that.

550
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,340
60%.

551
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,100
60% of people don't understand.

552
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
They don't understand statistics.

553
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,900
And the other half of them don't know how to use them.

554
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,080
Yeah.

555
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,620
That's the Zulu King, North Korea, coming in.

556
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:30,960
Over.

557
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,580
Yeah, we can hear you, Sven.

558
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,280
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,260
Bumbling around in the semantic darkness.

560
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,900
Yeah, the briefing may begin now.

561
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,860
I will only speak to Puzzling Evidence.

562
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,640
All right.

563
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,200
Enigma.

564
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,880
We got your signal five by five from...

565
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,600
Where are you?

566
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,260
North Korea still?

567
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,680
I don't know where he's going right now.

568
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,280
I'm debriefing here with my case officer.

569
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,740
Oh, great.

570
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,220
Is that a shining path of least resistance?

571
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:58,920
It is indeed.

572
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,000
Good Lord, man.

573
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,200
He was thought to be extinct 80 billion years ago.

574
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,660
Ivan Stang speaking from the Mars system.

575
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,760
Ah, yes.

576
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

577
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,340
Ivan Stang.

578
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,700
We loved your report and video.

580
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,040
The report was really, really nerve-wracking and informative.

581
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,840
It was scary because of those security police.

582
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,180
Yeah.

583
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,580
It was a big man's arrest.

584
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,460
It was only my guide.

585
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,840
She asked me later, what was that paper you were holding up?

586
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,020
And I said it was an envelope.

587
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,220
Yeah.

588
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,540
What did you do with the envelope?

589
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,480
It wasn't an envelope.

590
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,800
It was a Dobbs head.

591
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,500
Yeah.

592
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,200
What did you do?

593
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,880
It was a Dobbs head.

594
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,520
By the way, you know, Ivan Stang did the same thing in China in his day.

595
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,120
Yeah, and three years to the day later, there was a massacre in the same place.

596
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,460
Yep.

597
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,660
The world famous Tiananmen Square massacre.

598
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,960
Three years exactly to the day that I'd left.

599
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,180
What?

600
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,400
I thought it was Chinaman Square.

601
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,980
I thought it was a copy of the book The Subjeans in China.

602
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,340
I thought it was Chinaman Square.

603
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,260
Tiananmen.

604
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
Tiananmen Square.

605
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Oh.

606
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,880
So how did Dobbs head to Chinaman Square?

607
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,340
It was like seeing the Norwegian raising the Norwegian flag at the South Pole.

608
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,040
Yeah.

609
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,420
So how did you get there?

610
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,840
What else?

611
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,320
Tell us more about that wonderful country.

612
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,020
Please ask specific questions.

613
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,880
Well, tell us why did Un have plastic surgery?

614
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,700
Did he look like his grandfather like they're saying?

615
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,060
No, no.

616
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,780
Un really looks like that.

617
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,560
In fact, that's why Kim Jong Il passed over son number one and son number two.

618
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:30,980
Ah.

619
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:37,260
Son number one had been to the Swiss high school and wanted reform, and Kim Jong Il decided

620
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,480
that son number two looked too effeminate.

621
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,920
So son number three won and said he would go for it.

622
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Yeah, because he's posing a lot like granddad.

623
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,840
Looks like granddad.

624
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,100
There are no pictures of the new guy up yet.

625
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,860
They're still working on it.

626
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:50,860


627
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:50,860


628
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:50,860


629
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,620
He's still working on his death angle and etc.

630
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,760
The perfect ill head.

631
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,620
But Kim's cult is a faith-based religion just like us.

632
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,500
Cool.

633
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,560
Yeah, I was thinking it's a faith-based.

634
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,620
Faith-based.

635
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,540
It is a faith-based religion.

636
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,320
So where do you stay?

637
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,040
So where do you stay?

638
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,640
They have the similar thing going.

639
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,800
They have the beatific face.

640
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,220
Where do you stay in?

641
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,980
Next question.

642
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,040
Next question, please.

643
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,640
Where do you stay in this country?

644
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,840
We stayed at the Hotel Yangda.

645
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:28,460
Yangda is a 40-story Soviet in-tourist hotel on an island in the middle of the river.

646
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh, man.

647
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,000
We could walk around up to the hotel and could not go off.

648
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,660
Wow.

649
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,400
Man, that's clever.

650
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,600
That's a good way to do it.

651
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,480
We should do that the next day.

652
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:35,760
Yeah.

653
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,260
So did you feel like your liberty was being repressed while you were there?

654
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,100
Yes, we had our minders watching us at all times.

655
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,340
They were nice lage minders, mind you.

656
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,200
Did they have minders minding the minders?

657
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,220
Unfortunately, I had my wife minding me.

658
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,040
I would have been minding my minder a little more closely if you catch my drift.

659
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,220
I know exactly what you mean.

660
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,900
I understand your drift.

661
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,780
You drifted a long time for a long ways.

662
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,380
My guide was a Miss Kim, a 33-year-old North Korean milf.

663
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,820
Well, you know, part of that is the Stockholm Syndrome.

664
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,540
You fall in love with your...

665
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,860
With your captor.

666
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,940
Your captor, yes.

667
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,800
That happened to me in China.

668
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,640
That happens to me.

669
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,180
I don't know.

670
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,820
That happens to me with...

671
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,080
Big accident.

672
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,700
Call back.

673
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,900
...Jasmik Bobcat.

674
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,980
I fell in love with my captor.

675
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,760
Okay, we temporarily lost our...

676
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,500
It's possible that Princess Wee might try to call in.

677
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:37,180
Then we'd have a representative from China, one from the planet of the UFOs, the unidentified

678
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,580
one.

679
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,620
Hello, doctors.

680
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,700
Hello.

681
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,200
No, no.

682
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,700
Where's...

683
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,120
Oh, no, just call me back.

684
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,020
All right, we're trying to lock in on your signal there, Shining Path.

685
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,820
Okay, back.

686
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,740
Thank you, Ben.

687
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,720
No.

688
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,280
We have lost much space.

689
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
Next question.

690
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,080
How long were you there?

691
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,520
Four days.

692
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,160
Do you have to scream like that?

693
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,120
Yes.

694
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,060
He's been brainwashed, man.

695
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,840
He can't help it.

696
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,740
He talked with his forceful, almost like...

697
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,300
It's too late.

698
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,220
There's no brain left.

699
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,440
They get him right away.

700
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:10,940
As soon as they...

701
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,800
Did you eat any strange and disgusting food, like maggots?

702
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,500
Actually, I gained weight in North Korea.

703
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
Did you eat the giant maggots?

704
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,160
No.

705
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


706
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


707
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


708
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


709
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


710
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


711
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


712
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


713
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


714
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


715
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,160


716
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,380
They have giant maggots there that they eat.

717
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,580
That's obscene.

718
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,480
And all you got was that lousy t-shirt.

719
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,020
Oh, there's Phineas and the Maggots.

720
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,440
Oh, it's the Finch.

721
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,800
The Finch.

722
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
Is that Phineas?

723
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,500
There's Phineas on there, too.

724
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,340
Not Jane Eyre.

725
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,300
Yeah, that's right.

726
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,320
Jane Eyre just...

727
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,400
He's all fed.

728
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,320
How much monies does it cost to go to North Korea?

729
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,360
For Chinese citizens, $300.

730
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,200
For EU Hong Kong citizens, $761.

731
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,080
For Americans, $1,400.

732
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,060
Yeah.

733
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,140
That's a lot of money.

734
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,140


735
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,140


736
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,140


737
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,140


738
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,140


739
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,420
Yeah.

740
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,740
Aha.

741
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,820
We're working on it.

742
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,180
You really have to have the yen to do that.

743
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,360
I've got a question for you.

744
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,880
Yeah.

745
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,860
Who shot Liberty Valance?

746
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,400
Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone.

747
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,920
Which Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone?

748
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,260
That's the big question.

749
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,320
The replica.

750
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,480
The replica Lee Harvey Oswald.

751
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,180
Which replica?

752
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,380
The fake replica.

753
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,780
The good copy or the bad copy?

754
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,260
Lee Harvey Oswald.

755
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,060
Because there was one where you could see the seams along the sides.

756
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,520
The never been scanned copy.

757
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,260
How do you get to North Korea?

758
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,240
You fly to a Chinese border town, which is sort of like El Paso, the North Korea's Juarez.

759
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,220
Oh, man.

760
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,600
That must be great.

761
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,120
I was recently in El Paso and was scared to go to Juarez.

762
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,680
Yeah.

763
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,520
Do they wear guns there and cowboy hats?

764
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,540
Not at the border town, but I was taking the local train from the Chinese border to Pyongyang,

765
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,580
which is forbidden to Americans, and it was quite heavy on the rail platforms.

766
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,240
Squatties with AKs, Friskies.

767
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,620
They were taking everyone.

768
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,240
Desperate peasants.

769
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,680
It looked like Japan in 1944.

770
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,620
Wow.

771
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,000
Cool.

772
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,520
But they don't know what POD is, so it's cool to carry a film camera.

773
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,560
They don't know who Michael Jackson is.

774
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,940
They don't know who Snooki is.

775
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,260
They don't know who Mitt Romney is.

776
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,500
They don't know who Snooki is?

777
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,060
But now they know who Bob Dobbs is.

778
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,320
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

779
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,420
They will praise Bob.

780
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,280
Yeah, and the secret police are going to be combing YouTube looking for that tape and

781
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,900
then that guy walked in.

782
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,100
Actually, Mike.

783
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,500
What?

784
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,200
He's not smart?

785
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,980
I told him, yes.

786
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,220
He's not smart?

787
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


788
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


789
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


790
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


791
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,920
I threw one copy of Arise onto the railroad tracks.

792
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,720
Yeah, that's what we need.

793
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,640
Well, at least a copy of Arise didn't throw itself on the railroad tracks, which is what

794
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,420
usually happens.

795
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,240
And instantly 300 countrymen killed themselves because they let that happen.

796
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,380
Then they jump on the tracks to protect a copy of Arise.

797
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,740
So how many more minutes do you have on your phone call right now?

798
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,780
Oh, no, no.

799
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,980
We're on Skype this time.

800
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,680
We're fine.

801
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:48,880
We're fine.

802
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,280
Forever and ever.

803
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,560
Did they take you to the military airfield again this time?

804
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,120
We passed by the North Korean airport, Sunan Airport.

805
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,940
I saw a few Tupolevs and Ilyushins.

806
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm not typing this out, OK?

807
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,520
No, I am writing it down, though.

808
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,080
Did you meet Bohandas?

809
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,860
I'm using my fart porn to write it down.

810
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,040
Bohandas has not been seen in North Korea since 1961.

811
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,660
Is the television or the television shows in North Korea as good as the one in the US?

812
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,240
The ones in Beijing in 1986.

813
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,260
There's only one channel in North Korea.

814
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,260
It shows Grandfather and Father's Greatest Hits.

815
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,640
It has the news.

816
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,960
And then it shows North Korean karaoke.

817
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,940
They're very patriotic music and schmaltzy homies.

818
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,080
And then there's a war movie.

819
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,920
So they don't have a Playboy channel over there, for instance.

820
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,380
No, they don't.

821
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,300
Pause.

822
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,760
I went to the North Korean side of the DMZ.

823
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,460
I'm not going to play.

824
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,660
I'm not going to play.

825
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,580
You went where?

826
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,900
To the North Korean side of the DMZ.

827
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,580
Nice.

828
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,200
Where they killed those poor Americans after they relieved them and they were watching.

829
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,120
Well, they showed us where the armistice was signed and the North Korean soldier got in

830
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,260
my face and said, what?

831
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,400
We started the war?

832
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:06,920
Yeah.

833
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,740
Tell that to me.

834
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,480
Say that to my face.

835
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,580
And you didn't have to say anything.

836
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,740
They didn't know that, right?

837
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,220
Yeah.

838
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,680
Right.

839
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,020
They did.

840
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,440
Nice.

841
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,440
So did you reteach them their entire history now?

842
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,160
I think we did.

843
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:18,840
Sorry.

844
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,180
Go ahead.

845
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,060
Did you reteach them their history?

846
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,700
I tried to engage them in friendly debate.

847
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,580
My interpreter smiled and chided the soldier.

848
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,100
Well, think of that.

849
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,040
Every single Euro that comes out here, they has to feel like he has to engage them in

850
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,680
friendly debate.

851
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:45,640
When I was in China at the Friendship Hotel, there were people from many climes and this

852
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,600
young sort of Arabic looking fellow said,

853
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,600
didn't you drink that?

854
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:01,440
I mean I don't drink any beer here, we talked about that, and then I said what are you drinking?

855
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,060
I don't drink something local.

856
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,960
Are you Square Enix?

857
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,060
Square Enix?

858
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:15,680
Formerny Chinese?

859
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,660
Before those bigقت.

860
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,640
guilty party. I had dropped the bomb on

861
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
Tripoli. Yeah, you mean

862
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,620
Ivan Stang? You did that, man.

863
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,840
I could have

864
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,700
if only I'd known that a few years

865
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,360
later I would literally be launching

866
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,720
a football-shaped Gaddafi

867
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,680
head from a pulpit at X Day.

868
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,340
Two years in a row.

869
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,220
It's funny how they always put their

870
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,380
criminals and the

871
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,560
ones they're seeking always seem to hide

872
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,000
out in hospitals and schools.

873
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,520
Reverend Stang. Yes,

874
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,000
Reverend Stang. They took us

875
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,020
to the Palace of Gifts.

876
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,720
There was an entire

877
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,780
Palace of Gifts to President

878
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,800
Kim Il-sung and a second Palace

879
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,720
to President Kim Jong-il of Gifts

880
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,020
only from foreign leaders and delegations

881
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,760
and it was there I saw the

882
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,680
gold scimitar given by

883
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,020
Muammar Gaddafi to Kim Jong-il

884
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,060
as well as a hiking rifle

885
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,720
from President Putin, a

886
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,960
pearl inlaid death from Hafez

887
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
al-Assad of Syria and yet

888
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,980
I saw the holy Michael Jordan

889
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,640
autographed basketball that

890
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,520
Madeleine Albright of our country

891
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,280
gave to Kim Jong-il. Oh my

892
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,500
God. Man, what a rich

893
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,540
dude. Okay, well I give dibs on that

894
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,420
Palace of Gifts for X Day.

895
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,600
I get dibs. I got new dibs

896
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,520
on it. I said it first. Okay, well you said it.

897
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,760
I don't care, but think about this.

898
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,560
You got a golden

899
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,260
scimitar in one hand

900
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,280
or a basketball signed by

901
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,220
Michael Jackson.

902
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,020
Michael Jordan.

903
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,220
Was it Michael Jackson or Michael Jordan

904
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,500
that signed it? It was Michael Jaskin.

905
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,020
Jaskin played basketball.

906
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,720
No, but he signed a basketball

907
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,420
probably.

908
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,420
I'll bet you he signed a basketball at some

909
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,400
point in time. That basketball

910
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,380
is going to be worth a lot of money someday with

911
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,640
Michael Jackson's signature.

912
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,040
Yeah, but maybe the gold scimitar

913
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,120
without Michael Jackson. The gold scimitar

914
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,460
would be worth a lot of money.

915
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,600
I want the signed copy of Gaddafi's

916
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,560
little green book.

917
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,800
I have a better

918
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
North Korea, Reverend Skank.

919
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,440
You have what?

920
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,680
I have a better book. I bought Kim Jong-il's

921
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,900
book on film theory.

922
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,220
Wow, right.

923
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,500
Man, we can revolutionize Hollywood

924
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,400
with that.

925
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,420
I want to sell it in an American edition

926
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,000
called Socialist Filmmaking for Dummies.

927
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,260
Cool.

928
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,220
Man.

929
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,940
Well, there must have been

930
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,820
thousands of subjects that he wrote on

931
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,800
in his spare time there.

932
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,640
Oh, you guys will get it. I'll scan it

933
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,380
and send it to you.

934
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,540
Didn't he kidnap film directors?

935
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,040
And make movies for them and stuff?

936
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,820
I don't think there were any North Koreans.

937
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,880
No, that was the dad, right?

938
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,480
He probably didn't kidnap them. He just persuaded them.

939
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,880
He used his advanced rhetorical

940
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,300
technique.

941
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,360
He made them an offer they could not refuse.

942
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,540
Right. He used his advanced

943
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,980
techniques in persuasion.

944
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,480
You mean like, oh, I see, like kidnapping.

945
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,200
Yeah.

946
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,920
We know where your children go to school.

947
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,980
Yeah, now let's make the movie.

948
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,660
Yeah, now let's make the movie.

949
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,020
Reverend Skank, you know who really liked my

950
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,960
book of North Korea was all the burners.

951
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,480
I had a separate email to the burners.

952
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,160
They all love it.

953
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,660
Oh, I have a question for you.

954
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,340
All of them.

955
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,120
Did you talk to him about him sending the torpedo

956
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,680
into the all of them into that South

957
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,580
South with the rich burners?

958
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,480
Which?

959
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,180
The North Koreans had lost the three three

960
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,800
previous rounds of ship to ship battle in that zone.

961
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,680
So when things went bad with the South Korean

962
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,420
president, the Navy tapped Kim Jong Il on the shoulder.

963
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,740
He was like, hi, you promised.

964
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,540
Yeah, I was to get paid.

965
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,420
So the North Koreans are still down three to one.

966
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,780
They lost three of their ships to the South Korean one.

967
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,440
And they bet, man, that's a lot of my battleship.

968
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,820
Yeah.

969
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,240
Or is any is there play said Hitler never played a risk?

970
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:06,560
Huh?

971
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,100
Oh, yes.

972
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,440
Hey, your fighter jet fell into my battleship.

973
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,520
Yeah, your battleship crashed into my fighter jet.

974
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,200
Okay.

975
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,940
Here's another question.

976
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,680
How many guys stood together?

977
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,520
How many?

978
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,140
How many North Koreans are coming to X day?

979
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,280
They are now.

980
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:24,840
They're lining up.

981
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,680
Everyone will be at X day.

982
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,520
Represent the North Korean agency.

983
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,060
No one has a choice.

984
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,280
This is every one.

985
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,180
Next day comes.

986
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,160
It comes to them.

987
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,100
It comes to everyone.

988
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:35,520
Hello.

989
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,740
We represent North Korea.

990
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,860
And the North Korean defected out of North Korea can't handle the rest of the world and have to go back.

991
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,460
Okay.

992
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,880
I'm not surprised that, you know, it's real hard for Native America.

993
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm not surprised that it's real hard for Native Americans to leave the reservation or the army.

994
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,680
It's like that.

995
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,420
Like a reservation or occupy to leave the square.

996
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,460
Well, it's hard for me to leave the country and not go back because I have a house here.

997
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,620
I was just going to say, did you say bedroom Phineas?

998
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,180
Yeah.

999
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,660
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.

1000
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,420
Long life.

1001
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,320
Long life.

1002
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,080
Long life.

1003
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,900
Oh, there's Phineas saying bonzai.

1004
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,400
Exterminate.

1005
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,340
Exterminate.

1006
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,660
Reverend Ivan.

1007
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,360
Evan Stang.

1008
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,300
Long live.

1009
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,040
Long live.

1010
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,640
Long live.

1011
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,120
Thank you all out there.

1012
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,280
At ease.

1013
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,880
At ease, man.

1014
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,800
Gentlemen, thank you.

1015
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,520
Kam sahamnida.

1016
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,160
Yes.

1017
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,060
Inshallah khannada.

1018
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,660
Aloha.

1019
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,080
Deba soya.

1020
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:29,980
Deba soya.

1021
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,800
I can't come to Asia someday.

1022
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,880
We are well ready to welcome you again.

1023
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,660
Okay.

1024
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,580
We, uh, tos gumbe.

1025
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,000
Gumbe.

1026
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,960
I'm in the airport now.

1027
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,260
Doi tatash mashtab.

1028
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,440
Gumbe.

1029
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,660
Ready to come back.

1030
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,000
All right.

1031
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,520
Thank you.

1032
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,240
I'm signing off.

1033
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,640
Thank you.

1034
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:44,640


1035
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:44,640


1036
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:44,640


1037
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,120
Thank you for calling.

1038
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:45,600
Bye.

1039
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,940
No problem.

1040
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,580
No problem.

1041
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,680
No lie, GI.

1042
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,260
No lie.

1043
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,080
I love you no show.

1044
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,980
Okay, folks.

1045
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,640
Now I'm going to stick my neck out and read a poem.

1046
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,520
It's fairly long.

1047
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:08,720
My dad used to refer to it frequently as a metaphor for how he would die.

1048
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,200
And he was right.

1049
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,640
Uh, when my partners in ancient subgenius high school, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

1050
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,080
hierarchy saw the poem, they all said I should read it on the air, even though it might

1051
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,980
take 10 minutes.

1052
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,940
Or maybe they were just making fun of me and getting me to make more of a moron of myself.

1053
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,520
But, uh, here it is anyway.

1054
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,620
If, if the puppies don't interrupt too much.

1055
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:40,440
The Deacon's Masterpiece, or The Wonderful One Haas Shay.

1056
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,740
A logical story.

1057
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,120
By Oliver Wendell Holmes.

1058
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,940
1809 to 1894.

1059
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,640
I'm going to let the music run out here.

1060
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:01,520
Have you heard of the wonderful one haas shay that was built in such a logical way?

1061
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,520
It ran a hundred years to a day.

1062
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,340
And then all of a sudden it, uh, but stay.

1063
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,660
I'll tell you what happened without delay.

1064
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,260
Scaring the parson into fits.

1065
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,000
Frightening people out of their wits.

1066
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,980
Have you ever heard of that?

1067
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,360
I say.

1068
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,520
1755.

1069
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,520
Georgius Segundus was then alive.

1070
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,280
Stuffy old drone from the German hive.

1071
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,520
That was the year when Lisbon town saw the earth open and gulp her down.

1072
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:40,400
And Braddock's army was done so brown, left without a scalp to its crown.

1073
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,260
It was on the terrible earthquake day.

1074
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,240
Uh.

1075
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,600
That the deacon finished the one haas shay.

1076
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,720
Now in building of shayses.

1077
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,540
I tell you what.

1078
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,380
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

1079
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,860
There is always somewhere a weakest spot.

1080
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,280
In hub tire fellow.

1081
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,440
In spring or fill.

1082
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,120
In panel or crossbar or floor or sill.

1083
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,440
In screw bolt thorough brace lurking still.

1084
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,240
Find it somewhere you might.

1085
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,020
And will.

1086
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,040
Above or below.

1087
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,620
Or within or without.

1088
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,320
And that's the reason beyond a doubt.

1089
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,780
A shayes breaks down.

1090
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,300
But doesn't wear out.

1091
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,240
But the deacon swore.

1092
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,360
As deacons do with an I do them.

1093
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,260
Or an I tell ye.

1094
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,560
He would build one shay to beat the town.

1095
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,840
And the county.

1096
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,660
And all the country around.

1097
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,840
It should be built so it couldn't break down.

1098
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,500
Fur said the deacon.

1099
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,920
Tis mighty plain.

1100
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,160
That the weakest place must stand the strain.

1101
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,000
And the way to fix it.

1102
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,980
As I maintain.

1103
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,740
Is only just.

1104
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,380
To make that place.

1105
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,220
As strong as the rest.

1106
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,140
So the deacon inquired of the village folk.

1107
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,480
Where he could find the strongest oak.

1108
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,600
That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke.

1109
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,060
That was for spokes and floor and sills.

1110
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,380
He sent for lancewood to make the fills.

1111
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,800
The crossbars were ash from the straightest trees.

1112
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,220
The panels of white wood.

1113
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,040
That cuts like cheese.

1114
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,280
But lasts like iron.

1115
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,660
For things like these.

1116
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,300
The hubs of logs from the settlers ail them.

1117
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,340
The last of its timber.

1118
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,700
They couldn't sell them.

1119
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,440
Never an axe had seen their chips.

1120
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,620
And the wedges flew from between their lips.

1121
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,040
Their blunt ends.

1122
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,980
Frizzled like celery tips.

1123
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,440
Step and prop iron bolt and screw.

1124
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,420
Spring tire axle and lynch pin too.

1125
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,180
Steel of the finest.

1126
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,620
Bright and blue.

1127
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:56,500
Thorough brace.

1128
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,060
Bison skin thick and wide.

1129
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,040
Boot top dasher from tough old hide.

1130
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,300
Found in the pit when the tanner died.

1131
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,220
That was the way he put her through.

1132
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,200
There said the deacon.

1133
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,380
Now she'll do.

1134
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,400
Do.

1135
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,520
I tell you.

1136
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,460
I rather guess.

1137
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,500
She was a wonder.

1138
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,580
And nothing less.

1139
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,580
Colts grew horses.

1140
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,640
Beards turned gray.

1141
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,860
Deacon and deaconess dropped away.

1142
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,780
Children and grandchildren.

1143
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,900
Where were they?

1144
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,060
But there stood the stout old one hoss shay.

1145
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,260
As fresh as on Lisbon earthquake day.

1146
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,240
Eighteen hundred.

1147
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,260
It came and found.

1148
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,360
The deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.

1149
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,280
Eighteen hundred increased by ten.

1150
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,260
Handsome carriage they called it then.

1151
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,000
Eighteen hundred and twenty came.

1152
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,520
Running as usual.

1153
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,580
Much the same.

1154
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,360
Thirty and forty at last arrive.

1155
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,140
And then come fifty and fifty-five.

1156
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,720
Little of all we value here.

1157
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,880
Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year.

1158
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,220
With a smile.

1159
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,760
The stout both feeling and looking queer.

1160
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,100
In fact there's nothing that keeps its youth.

1161
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,440
So far as I know.

1162
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,900
But a tree and truth.

1163
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,120
This is a moral that runs at large.

1164
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,840
Take it.

1165
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,360
You're welcome.

1166
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,420
No extra charge.

1167
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,180
First of November.

1168
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,000
The earthquake day.

1169
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,820
There are traces of age in the one hoss shay.

1170
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,760
A general flavor of mild decay.

1171
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,980
But nothing local as one may say.

1172
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:46,960
there couldn't be for the deacon's art had made it so like in every part that there wasn't a chance

1173
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,600
for one to start for the wheels were just as strong as the fills and the floor was just as

1174
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:00,280
strong as the sills and the panels just as strong as the floor and the whipple tree neither less nor

1175
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:10,280
more and the back crossbar as strong as the four and spring and apple and hub encore and yet as a

1176
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:21,820
whole it is past a doubt in another hour it will be worn out first of November 55 this morning the

1177
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:29,660
parson takes a drive now small boys get out of the way here comes the wonderful one hoss shea drawn

1178
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,120
by a

1179
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:37,780
rat-tailed you necked bay it up said the parson off they went the parson was working his Sunday

1180
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:48,080
text had got to fifthly and stopped perplexed at what the Moses was coming next all at once

1181
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:55,740
the horse stood still close by the meeting house on the hill first a shiver and then a thrill then

1182
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,860
something decidedly like a spill and the parson

1183
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:06,480
was sitting upon a rock at half past nine by the meeting house clock just the hour the earthquake

1184
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,660
shock what do you think the parson found when he got up and stared around the poor old chase

1185
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:21,840
in a heap or mound as if it had been to the mill and ground you see of course if you're not a dunce

1186
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:29,540
how it all went to pieces all at once all at once and nothing first just as bubbles do when they

1187
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:40,460
burst in the wonderful one hoss shea logic is logic that's all I say that Deamentos masterpiece

1188
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:47,500
or the wonderful one hoss shea a logical story by Oliver Rundle homemade quoted by my father a whole

1189
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:55,000
lot who figured he would all of his parts would probably last up until final tropical about well

1190
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,520
shut down at once and indeed she was still driving to the post office

1191
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,520
office and meeting his buddies a couple of weeks before he died.

1192
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,060
It went real quick.

1193
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,220
Praise Bob, I guess, you know.

1194
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,520
I don't know.

1195
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,600
Did I say this before?

1196
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,300
It's not the aging that bothers me.

1197
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,840
That's fair and square.

1198
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,760
It's the diseases.

1199
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,940
Oh, yeah, I did say that.

1200
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:19,500
I said that last.

1201
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,900
See, I'm getting old.

1202
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm just getting old.

1203
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,900
And now this.

1204
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,280
Well, none of this would be possible, of course, without the president's freeze price program.

1205
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,660
Yeah.

1206
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,000
There's also been a little space news today, or spaced news, as the young hippies would say.

1207
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,160
Those hippies aren't as young as they used to be, Charles.

1208
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,500
That's very true.

1209
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,480
All of us included, eh, Al?

1210
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,480
Time doesn't stop, you know, just because marijuana stretches out.

1211
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,500
My kids are in the next room.

1212
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,080
I don't know.

1213
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,840
Anyway, back to the news.

1214
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:58,340
You know, they've got a satellite now, George, that might detect fields of marijuana growing down there.

1215
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,200
In outer space.

1216
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,520
On the ground.

1217
00:55:59,540 --> 00:55:59,700
On the ground.

1218
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,460
No, George.

1219
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,080
In outer space is where the sun is, and they're going to send our garbage to the sun.

1220
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,880
So problems will be solved once again through the application of clever American technology.

1221
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,580
Now a word from gas and cars.

1222
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,320
We'll be back in just a moment.

1223
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,860
Hi, I'm back now.

1224
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,760
Glad to have you back, too, Larry.

1225
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,840
Thank you very much.

1226
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,800
I didn't have my eye on the director on the floor manager there.

1227
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,520
These drinks.

1228
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,220
Drinking brandy.

1229
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,060
The floor manager?

1230
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,360
Just a minute.

1231
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,480
I'm going to go get some from him.

1232
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,840
Excuse me.

1233
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,260
Well, here's another interesting little story that Larry has over there.

1234
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:49,820
Well, the new mayor of the city of Von Vago has made his first statement, his public statement in office, and I'm going to read it to you now.

1235
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,260
He refused to allow cameras into the throne room, and this is his first official statement.

1236
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,280
One, I will not use the crazy title of Gat Puno.

1237
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:08,720
Two, if the cat burglar cases could be solved at all, I will solve it and send the culprits to jail, if not to the electric chair.

1238
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:19,060
Three, I will try to improve the lot of the cockroaches and their children and will do away with tongue collection and eradicate graft and corruption in the throne room.

1239
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:26,040
Well, it's an interesting report, and I wish that we could speak to him personally, but unfortunately, he's gone on an extended vacation.

1240
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,500
It'd be nice to know how much we...

1241
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,760
We can trust these little fellas, wouldn't it?

1242
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,780
What, the cockroaches?

1243
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,060
We've lived happily with them for years.

1244
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,760
They're very intelligent, extremely clean, and quite tasty, too.

1245
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,440
And they make wonderful mayors.

1246
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,100
Yes, hello, friends.

1247
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:47,540
I'm Martin Dos Eques, the new anchor man for the Channel 18 News.

1248
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,900
Well, there's plenty of Chicano-flavored, that is, Spanish or Chile-flavored news today, folks.

1249
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,220
We've got to move more of our people onto the freeways.

1250
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,500
Now that they've cleared off 25% of the...

1251
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,500
Cars, we can start building houses where they belong, on the freeways.

1252
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,040
Isn't that right?

1253
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,180
Well, you don't have to answer.

1254
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:05,700
What the heck?

1255
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,480
I'll just keep logging.

1256
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,720
We could plant some gardens, you know, on the freeways.

1257
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:15,160
I figure, you know, you bring in some topsoil, man, about two feet, you know, you put it on the harbor freeway, man, pretty soon you're growing corn there, you know?

1258
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,420
What do we need cars for, you know?

1259
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,460
We could play tennis on the bare parts that we didn't put topsoil on.

1260
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,000
Or a ring ball.

1261
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,200
Or we could raise bears there.

1262
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,220
Certainly could.

1263
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,840
Sounds like a good job for a guy like me who likes working with his hands but doesn't like to get his fingernails dirty.

1264
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,840
You must be one of those computer repairmen.

1265
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,860
No, I am a computer.

1266
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:33,600
I see.

1267
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,320
No, I am a computer.

1268
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,100
I see.

1269
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,420
No, I am a computer.

1270
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:48,200
Thank you, the Firesign Theater, from their new ancient album, Dope Humor of the 70s.

1271
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,420
And before that, an all-star cast.

1272
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:59,500
We heard, I think, Bleepo Abernathy, Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Reverend Shining Path of Least Resistances.

1273
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,060
Phineas Narco, Puzzling Evidence, of course.

1274
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,860
Dr. Philo Drummond and Chaos McMomacat, the ex-goddess.

1275
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,680
Call her Taxi Bob.

1276
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,980
And Bohondis.

1277
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,320
Bohondis.

1278
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:21,700
The Bohondis Man song was in it, and Bohondis came up later on.

1279
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:27,540
Anyway, friends, everything about the Church of the Subgenius and this show is at subgenius.com.

1280
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,940
And that's all you need to know.

1281
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,080
