So, Bob, what religion are you converting to now?
The Soul Genius.
The All-Powerful Genius of the Soul.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Uh, yes, dear friends, and welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,151,
which is actually a rerun of the ancient, crumbling, early 1987 episode,
Hour of Slack number 82, which was an especially good one.
That's one reason for rerunning, and the other is that I'm busy being Professor Stang,
teaching a subgenius history and cult maintenance how-to course online
at Robert Anton Wilson's MaybeLogicAcademy.net.
Teaching by internet is easy, because you don't have to shave or look nice or anything,
sort of like doing radio.
The students are forced.
to listen to subgenius albums that even predate this show, which started in 1985.
The Puzzling Evidence show started in 1982.
Our first book came out in 1983, and our first pamphlet was self-published on January 1, 1980.
There, the history course is done.
Anyway, this old show, number 82, was done right after my first wife and I had a big fight over money.
And it shows in the show.
We also hear the young Michael Pazdik.
Heppie's classic ad, or part of it.
And some Ken Nordean, who is not a subgenius minister exactly, but did trade tapes with us.
We'll hear some of the greatest subgenius music ever, by Don Truby, Brother Cleave,
the late Reverend Clay Animation, and D.K. Jones in Malcolm X.
And even Buck Naked.
Some KPFA Puzzling Evidence show is going to be playing, which is so old that it has
Palmer Vreedies and Baby Dr. Howell and Baby Stang on it.
We'll hear Reverend Sister Chris doing William Burroughs for Bob.
Imagine that.
And best of all, an actual taped rant by Reverend Orton Nenslow, which is really wonderful.
The music in the background right now is from Stephen Kent's CD, Oil and Water.
But everything that follows is from the year of...
Of 1986, or 87.
21 short years ago.
Baby, I'm so making you burn.
Man, I'm...
This, this is...
Now, now, now, now, now...
FM in Dallas, Texas.
And, uh, dear friends, this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour.
I want to point out that if you take this station's call letters, 90.9, and turn them
upside down...
Countless worlds upon worlds.
Worlds without end.
In these galaxies, every possible reality exists.
And what is reality on any one world is mere fantasy on all others.
Here, all is real, and all is illusion.
What is, what was, and what will be start here with the words...
Bob?
Bob?
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...
Bob?
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
You see?
Maybe you should know what we're here for.
The Daddy S arte of the

And your smelly Lynds
When you arithmetic
but
it's phrase

See how well he obeys me.
He's loyal.
Stupid, but loyal.
A trait you will never share, Skeeto.
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?
Listen, you little listeners, whistling in the glistening mists.
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies,
Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse the Never.
The passage runs, and I quote,
If you be tired or depressed,
if you've got that run-down feeling,
remember, you're not just anybody.
You're special.
You are living proof that God does not exist.
Yes, you, little listener,
if you're like most of the people who listen to this show,
are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.
It's a duck hunt.
Hanson, please, don't start.
Please, please.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've got to start anyway.
I don't want to start, believe me.
Dear friends, I've got to admit,
I'm just too depressed to do a good show.
Today.
So, this one's going to be a terrible show.
I'm already convinced of it.
Because I started out depressed about money,
but now I'm depressed about everything.
You know, maybe slack and money are the same thing.
Maybe there isn't any reason to live without money.
Maybe nothing can ever be fun again.
Maybe the conspiracy is right.
A person without money, friends, is ipso facto a bad person.
A radio show without money, for that matter,
is by definition a bad radio show.
Goodness and one's value to humanity
is in direct proportion to one's income.
There's no reason to care about anything ever again.
Even if you inherit it,
that doesn't count.
It only counts if you've procured the money yourself.
Money, friends, is more important than any human being's feelings.
Feelings are ephemeral.
They're gone with the breeze.
You can't compress happy feelings or sad feelings
into tanks and store them in a bank.
Can't sell them, so they don't matter.
Feelings don't matter.
Not even action matters.
Not even trying to matter.
Not even trying to make money matters.
Even giving away money doesn't make you more of a man.
Only making money makes you worthy of anyone's respect,
including God's.
It doesn't matter what kind of job you have.
Just make money.
Even if your job is inherently immoral,
even if it exists to exploit and prey upon others,
as long as the conspiracy hasn't actually jailed you for it,
then that's okay.
It's better than a job that doesn't pay much.
I don't care if you invented a cure for cancer
if you weren't paid well for it.
Friend, you're a despicable fool.
I don't care if you spent the last ten years
in dangerous situations trying to aid oppressed, starving people.
You're lower than scum if you didn't get rich doing it.
And that includes Mother Teresa.
At PUBG, reliance on З me
And I only use B freelancer,

I don't care if it means hole myself.
I don't care if I make myself turn into Z me,
I don't care if I can do drugs.
I also don't care if I make what nobody else knows
and men.
I don't care if I dotı
Or put on a gold medal,
but I'm broke too.
It's because I don't have a head to prayer.
And my Vicent is really a reward for suffering.
Plenty of it.
I need dough and plenty of it.
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
Oh, 200 pesos.
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.
Hey, that's my number.
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.
Oh, I don't know.
everything goes wrong with me.
The office,
some guys there
that ought to get me.
And then at home, I don't know,
my wife,
all the kids, you know, everything.
And then there's the payments
due on the car.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Well, I'm just telling you,
I sometimes wonder if it's worth it.
I mean, really.
I wonder if it's worth even trying.
What am I killing myself for like this?
What am I...
I don't know.
Oh, if I had any brains.
That's the trouble.
I've got the brains,
but I don't know,
maybe it's my attitude.
It's wrong or something.
Nothing happens.
I figured,
that'd be
something in the office by this time.
Everybody gets pushed up ahead of me.
And that, of course,
and then there's
the wife
and the kids
and the trouble
and the car.
Yeah, and there's...
I don't know.
Let's have another drink.
Oh, stop it.
You're killing me.
See, it makes me feel much better
just talking to you.
Anytime, baby.
Anytime.
Anytime.

Oh, yeah.
That was Ken Nordean.
And that's how the conspiracies made me feel too, friends.
I don't know why I keep calling you friends.
I don't have any friends.
Nobody has any friends.
All we have are bosses and customers.
All the rest of it's bluff.
Pure bluff.
It's like on that Fireside Theater record.
We're all just faking being interested in each other as human beings.
All we're interested in is finding people we can have.

What pretending looks to be real is just imp musi.
None of now somewhat know what people they shot at us do.
Let's take a big step and see.
Yeah, you know the Mama thing.
Because Kim is such a little dummy in Canadian weather.
But, uh...
There's some kind of formula that's involved too.
함
Hey, you alright?
Okay.
and slammed against him and crushed him to death.
Crushed under quarters.
Slack friends?
Friends.
That guy got him.
Not as close to slack as any of us are going to get.
You know, it's gotten to where I can't even hate the conspiracy anymore.
At least they make money.
I can hate myself.
My money ran out and I haven't gotten any more yet.
Since I can't make any money when I hate myself this much,
I guess that means I'm out of money for good, huh?
The only thing that could make me like myself would be money.
That doesn't mean I'll like you if you have money.
I'll hate you even more, but at least I'll respect you.
Because I knew you could bluff better than I could.
So you can call Non-Nor-F-N-O-S-E-R-F-U-S-T-Y-A-N-O
and let the Will-O-Dobs bluff you.
You can bluff the Will-O-Dobs, I don't care.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil
and you ought to shout right back at them.
No, I'm not a Christian.
I'm not a Christian.
I don't have anything to do with that.
I'm not a Christian.
I want to say it so plain that a two-year-old child will understand me.
Be vocal.
Be loud.
Be concise.
And be clear.
I don't care who you are.
You ought to shout right back at them.
It's a cover-up.
It's a scam.
It's a facade.
There is no God.
Man is God.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
There is no God.
Man is God.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
No, I'm not a Christian.
I'm not a Christian.
No.
Christian.
A Christian.
A Christian.
A Christian held up to the American public as that which is good and noble,
when in reality it is.
Dirty, degrading, filthy, and rotten.
You'd better take a strong look, mister, at where you're going to change.
We can't give you all the answers.
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.
At our lab, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.
Love.
Children.
Huh.
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy,
grown right here by our special process.
A process in use since our first mom-and-pop operation.
Who are we?
We're the normal people.
The most normal people in the world.
But not quite as normal as you.
Why?
You're unique.
It's natural.
Everyone's unique.
But you stand apart from the crowd.
You're normal.
Normal is a typical herd of sea cows.
Normal is an exploding stellar nebula.
Normal is the world in which we live.
And what could be more normal than that?
Certainly not the competition.
How do we stay so far out in front of a pack?
By building a race for the world.

Cast, track, decoy, ideology.
The join with a pickup of a domestic.
And the maneuverability of an import.
Who are we?
We're the communication people.
The people who talk is strictly state-of-the-art technology.
Its disposable.
Não está usurpada.
Reversible.
Reusable with almost any living brand of idea,
including our deluxe line.
Yours.
yours. Sound costly? Put away that semantic checkbook. Now communication can be yours
in a fashion of what it calls rent.
The end times are here, but there's nothing to fear. If you just send us a dollar. Get
ready, get set, prepare for the launch of the leading bit of a bomb. Remember the motto,
perform the salute, smack off and study the pandemics. And if you shoot harder, then look
to the sky.
Cause by.
There's a pipe in the sky. And I'll follow you anywhere. Through the sun, there's no
power. Through American time. There's a pipe in the sky.
The mountains so high. Won't never set, these never bankers. Except for the 엄마 de havas.

Your dreams never go wrong.
I'm not the kind of person who came here to say what you like.
I got a plate in front of me, but nothing is on it.
Because all of us sitting on the same table are all of us diners.
I'm not a diner until you let me die.
Then I become a diner.
I was in a house last night that was by my own.
It isn't something that made me lose confidence in what I'm doing.
I'm not a diner.
I'm not a diner.
Travel to your favorite outlaw state.
Free a hostage.
Mine a harbor.

Hey, I'll brush some of those bugs off Sting.
He sat still.
Still too long.
They're crawling into his mouth.
Oh, Reverend Andy.
Oh, what?
You talking to me?
Get him off me!
Get him off!
What?
You guys had that dream monitor on again.
What, you don't have any business in you saving my adulterous dreams?
Hey, I thought that dream was pretty good.
Just unfortunately, we couldn't get the bugs out again.
Look, look, we can sell these dreams to...
Sell somebody else's dreams to the Bobby.
Why do I have to drag my...
I sold it up over the years.
Cutting it off?
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
These are the same dream monitors used by the Lord God Almighty.
And he records your sins and makes you watch as they're played back later.
When you're only glad your life is so full of holes.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
And I got it.
Well, as a matter of fact, we are Bob Dobbs Preach that, uh, uh, I don't, I don't practice what I preach, he said.
Because I'm not the kind of man or woman I'm preaching to.
I'm not the kind of man or woman I'm preaching to.
I'm not the kind of man or woman I'm preaching to.
Reverend Stang is referring to the cult of the...
Two, two, two subgeniuses, one.
...powerful blinding apostasy which fears no throne, but it looks in its own freedom to scatter its fundaments on the earth,
soiling the uppers of its shoes to let down the...
If there were any hope, I'd agree with you.
...fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.
And in addition, my dear friends, our ministry neither neglects nor fails to mention,
besides and beyond our mulching of the field of sorcery,
our enrichment of the acreage of coppery,
our fortification of the soil of platery,
our irrigation of the garden of teapottery,
or our husbandry of the rich loam of cream pitchery.
For lo, the frock cloudeth my brain, and my buckler and shield are ripped away.
I am naked before thee, Dobbs, thou who hast unbuckled my buckler and unsnapped my shield,
which was my sole protection.
Yea, my buckler being unbuckled, I am even as a poe-bucker, buck naked before Bob.
Bob dashes a bucket of ice water over my loins.
The buck passeth not, for the doe and the buck dwell in the same forest.
The buck is Bob. He is bucking tradition.
He changes brickbats into buckets of bucks.
Bucks, bucks, yea, bucks, bucks, but it's difficult to explain.
I am chicken before my epoch.
Yea, foul, like the birds of the ground.
Merodicus, chapter 13, buck six.
Sick is this world, O Bob, who has beslimed the ground after thee,
even like unto the slugs and snails of the garden,
whose chambered shells you may crush and step on inadvertently.
Them Mowgli-Bobs.
Bob, Bob.
I got a Bob in my pocket.
Whoo! Got a Bob in my pocket and he's waiting for you.
And I ain't glad, neither.
Bob-Bomb.
Gosh.
This reunion is the first time I've ever heard of the Church of St. John.
You gotta go up before the Senate tomorrow and, uh...
Very impressive, Mr. St. John.
I'm a little worried about your, your testimony here.
I think we better go over this one more time.
Alright, you wanna rehearse it one more time?
I, I...
Look, as far as, I just don't understand. I mean, first they pay us...
I just don't understand you, Ivan.
Look, one of your lawyers there, Wellman, what's his name?
Yea, Wellman.
Yea, yeah.
He's just sitting over there with a tape recorder.
Doesn't that make you nervous? He's supposed to be your lawyer.
What's that tape for?
Well, uh...
Your Honor, the special marshal has, uh, permitted the use of a tape recording in this proceeding.
What are you doing here? This is supposed to be a private conversation between counsel and, uh...
And victim.
I know a sister. I just know a sister. She said I could...
It's time we leave the chambers and convene again as we enter the fourth half of our...
I'm gonna sit behind you.
I won't listen to that unless you're done...
Manders?
Manders, come over here. Show Reverend Stang what you're made of.
And, leaning at the child's underwear, Reverend Stang committed yet another indiscretion.
It's the sub-knowledge, you know, underneath the... You know what it says there in the Bible.
I want you to keep your mouth shut.
Of course you know what this will mean when you get caught.
I've seen, I've seen the man, I've seen the man in the dinosaur suits.
I've seen the men in the dinosaur suits walking and waving their spindly little arms.
I've seen them tromping and tromping across the bushes, stamping through little tiny model cities,
BUSTING!
I've seen the Japanese temples to flinders.
I've seen the man in the bad King Kong suit climbing up the imitation Eiffel Tower that
stands in the middle of Tokyo.
I've seen it all, friends, but...
X day, O X day...
Somebody said to me once, he says to me, he says, well, Bob is too psychedelic for me.

I mean, Bob... Psychedelic, he said, psychedelic you haven't seen.
You haven't seen psychedelic, little pals.
You haven't seen psychedelic until you've seen the flesh boiling off your bones.
Not just one time, not just a million times, but over and over again for eternity.
You haven't seen psychedelic until you've looked up in the sky and seen those dead ships
flying away forever and knowing, knowing that the next thing that's gonna happen is gonna
be the Earth, the entire planet Earth turning inside out, inside out, and the golden burning
cities of the universe.
The Nazi clone beasts led by the clone body inhabited by the evil, evil brain of Adolf
Hitler.
The golden cities are gonna be on the outside, and where are you gonna be?
You're gonna be on the inside, falling forever into the infinite gravity well, which is,
which will be the new home of Jehovah One.
He's here now.
He's here now.
They call him the Vanity.


Van Allen radiation belts.
They call him the magnetic field of the Earth, but you and I know, you and I know that it's
the D-E-R-O.
Yes, they've used that word before.
They've used that word wrongly so many times.
They, they pronounced it D-R-O.
They've pronounced it D-R-O and they've said it was the horrible robot.
Oh.
Well, we'll continue with that, uh, statement from the guy who's gonna be the robot.












We'll continue with that statement from Reverend Orton Neslow of Boston next week.
This has been, that was the, uh, swinging love corpses there behind him and behind me.
And, uh, oh, this is the one I didn't play last week.
This is, uh, Brother Cleve Duncan.
No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.
Hit me.
Hit me.
With us I'm R음 מת halыҡ carts, but we should talk about some more of it.

If you think it's gonna get any better
Just keep dreaming away
You got to hold your head up high all day and night
Cause if you're the only weapon you need
To settle up a fight
Cause no matter how much you shake and dance
The last few drops go down your pants
No matter how much you scream and shout
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out
No matter how much you piss and moan
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone
No matter how much you whack your head
You're better off living than being dead
Society pushes harder on you every day
You gotta get the truth back and you hear them say
You can't work, you can't get, you can't eat until you know
There ain't enough to go around and it's starting to show
The planet's getting the power all the time
Romantic in your brain just like the grape turning to wine
We gotta destroy the forces that are stealing your slack
Scare all them mothers giving one big heart attack
We gotta regain control of our destiny
Cause they wanna take it away from you and me
But we gotta stop all this fighting amongst ourselves
Cause that just keeps them confused and they think that's swell
Set up all your lights and soon you'll win them back
Or else I'll barbecue you while you're lying there on your back
No matter how much you shake and dance
The last few drops go down your pants
No matter how much you shake and dance
What about government's role in offsetting the negative consequences of the free enterprise business community you talked about?
Oh, now, no, now you get back, no, now you get back to what I said earlier.
What I'm talking about is the free marketplace, free enterprise.
The regulations that government exists to have and are necessary
is yes, to ensure that someone can't sell us a can of poisoned meat.
I think, um, uh,
every can of poisoned meat had a problem that I think the people must recognize.
The problem is, uh, if you open a can of poisoned meat,
hold it in your hand, it gets warm very fast while you're drinking it.
We punch the holes in the top and drink it.
Well, this fella's made a very economical stein handle.
You can buy a dozen of them and have them like you have your silverware.
You're serving people, uh, poisoned foods in the can.
You just clamp the stand, snap the stand.
You just clamp the stand, snap the stand.
You just clamp the stand, snap the handle onto it,
and people hold it, but the handle in the drink doesn't warm up.
And he's gonna make a million dollars.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, uh, that was, uh, Doug Kahn did that, uh, cut, that amazing little cut there.
Doug Hunt.
Uh, Hanson, please, don't, don't, don't start. Please, please.
Ah!
Ah!
Listen, our evil has landed. The world is in great danger.
Yeah, it certainly is when you're out on the highway.
Look out!
Feels like something inside me.
I'm thawing at my guts. What's wrong with me?
What did you have for lunch?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Uh-huh!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Well, I guess I don't have to tell you everything you know about the revolution is wrong.
You know that now.
But did you know that Indians can be in two places at once?
That they can change into animals?
That they invented the wire recorder?
Oh, I've seen it. I've heard it.
Now, listen to this.
The idea is not to be funny here.
Okay.
The idea is to give you some clues as to what's happening in general.
Quite well. Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay, bye.
This is actually the only way to escape this show.
He's listening to it.
I know.
Yeah.
Oh, wake up!
Something may happen, Henry.
Tell him to wake up.
This one's not very reliable because there are no definite rules.
Why are the subgeniuses interested in it?
That is tough.
Bring the idea back to me.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Does it hurt to listen to this show?
No, no.
Okay. Here we go.
Should be washing all over on the mock.
That's right.
That's right.
The show should be laughing at your feet right now and just kind of licking at your
thighs.
The show should be too heavy, a little thinking.
Oh, God.
This is awkward.




Oh, God.
We've got to leave him.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?




Oh, dear friends, thanks to Puzzling Events and Gary DeBrogkram for that last little bit from the Subgenie show on KPFA in Berkeley.
I can see that he has a strong hold on this family.
I'm paid. It's like I'm transforming inside. I'm afraid I'm about to become something else.
Oh, great. Like a sex change or something.
Like something's growing inside me. It's replicating and superseding all my internal organs.
Well, we'll stop at a bathroom, then.
That monster's shape I saw.
Jennings!
It's inside my body.
This guy's delirious. He's not making any sense.
It's too late. The end of the world is coming.
I won't be the king.
Jennings, slow down. Steer, you big yo-yo. Steer.
Oh, my God.
This show is guaranteed to offend over eight people an hour.
That's right, and we're three of them.
Things are all stinky and smelly down here at this show.
Why go to work anyway?
It's scary.
What is this? How are we?
Okay, here's a little show part dripping onto the floor.
Ew.
That sure is awful.
Okay, now we kiss the show.
Beat it on this little diaper here.
Okay, thanks.
Hi.
Hi, Nicky.
I think what I'd like to see you do now is, you know, there's a little light on my radio.
It says stereo.
Yeah.
Can you turn that little light off and on and off and on?
Okay, watch this.
