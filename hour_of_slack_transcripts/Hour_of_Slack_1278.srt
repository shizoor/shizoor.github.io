1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,040
10.30 a.m. We arrived at the Department of Employment.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,380
The supervisor of data processing was the man who had called us.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,940
His name was Harvey Peterson. He was waiting for us in the computer section.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,780
All disability claims are first recorded, as you can see, on these computer cards.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,860
And now let's step across the hall.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,660
The next step is to place those cards into a card reader, which puts them on tape.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,040
This is the card reader.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,260
Now the information on those cards has been placed on magnetic tape.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,040
Is that right?

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,540
The card reader is connected by way of wires to this machine, the central processor.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,980
We call it the memory.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,680
The information from the card is loaded into the memory, and the computer validates the data.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,060
Validates the data?

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,800
Well, for example, it checks that the social security number has the required nine digits.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,360
After it's been validated, it's written onto magnetic tape.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,900
That's the magnetic tape machine.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,320
Rewind it, and it places the information in sequence.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,400
In sequence?

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,740
In order. According to social security number, for instance.

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,380
And from there, it goes to our high-speed printer.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,300
Now that you have some small inkling of what these machines are all about,

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,480
let's show you what turned up this morning.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,280
Mike, that's our console typewriter.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,020
We use it for communicating with the computers.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,820
Mike is requesting information on the social security number in question.

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,180
The computer is now searching for that record.

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,060
Illegal transaction.

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,880
And that's how this show is produced on a calculating machine called a computer.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,420
It's also how we spot check the security clearance status of all individuals

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,760
attempting to join the once secret subgenius news group, Scrubb.

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,280
It's by no means a subgenius.

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:09,660
It's made up of one or two.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,700
nio

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:16,700


35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,080
Don't specialized to.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,240
Some of the videos are propioly prepubescent.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
And if you can afford to learn how to use 머�ler,

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
and explain how we've exist FLIH,

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Police regulations say plainclothes officers must wear a coat and necktie on the street at all times.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
We wore our coats and neckties.

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,180
The search continued into the fifth day.

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,880
Our pace got even slower.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,600
After a while, we forgot our object was to recover the stolen neckties.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,040
All we wanted was to wear a coat at all times.

45
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,620
It was a point of pride.

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,240
Come on.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,060
No, thanks.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm hungry.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
When do we eat?

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,580
Tonight.

51
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:57,780
Tonight?

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll show you.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
I said, what is your name?

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:02,940
Billy.

55
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,500
You're a damn dumb, Billy.

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,400
All right, Billy.

57
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,360
What's your name?

58
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,860
Billy Crawford.

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,780
Damn dumb.

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,300
Walter Bakesy was tried and convicted on three counts of first-year aggrieved de glorie,

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,100
and he is now serving out his term in the state penitentiary for women.

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,140
Who, on the evening of September 24th, 1937, gave his life

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,440
so that yours might be more?

64
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,020
Sacramento.

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm hungry.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,900
I want to eat.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Now.

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Now.

69
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,200
Thank you, Lee Murr, for all of the above, and future is now.

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,420
By the time you hear this show, friends, we'll be home again,

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,520
and it'll be too late to rob us.

72
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,400
But at the time of this recording, October 3rd, 2010, Princess,

73
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,480
we and I are fixing to leave on our first camping trip and hiking vacation,

74
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,960
in years, as we're going to drive slowly from here in Cleveland Bluffs

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,840
to New York City for the big revival on October 9th and back.

76
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,880
So, you could have robbed the Slacker Mansion while we were gone,

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,460
if you could have found the Slacker Mansion.

78
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,160
Here's a hint.

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,100
It's the one that looks exactly like the Addams Family house,

80
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,720
but with a bright blue concrete gorilla in the front yard.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Anyway, for the rest of the show, I'm Billy Crawford.

82
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,460
Friends, this happens now and then on Hour of Slack,

83
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,220
where we're going to be out of town for a while,

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,600
and I have to whip out two or three shows in advance.

85
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,040
I was going to make this one a rerun, but I kind of hate to do that.

86
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,360
So, instead, I'm using some leftovers that didn't fit into previous shows,

87
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,120
but which are otherwise prepped and don't have any cussing.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Some chatter from live X-Day shows,

89
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,000
some music by actual bands with actual CDs,

90
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,780
some ancient ESO radio from Professor Chaz's show on WCSB,

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,140
and some music from Professor Chaz's show on WCSB,

92
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,200


93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,200


94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,200


95
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,200


96
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,700
and some radio synesthesia,

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,900
which is Dr. Sinister's show that follows Hour of Slack on WCSB Cleveland,

98
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,180
and assembly mer and the large kolache stuff, whatever's easiest,

99
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,880
because you can hear almost every old Hour of Slack as it is.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,240
All but the first 200 or so are all online as MP3s,

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,160
and if you poke around subgenius.com,

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,460
you will find the various stashes.

103
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,940
But now from their new album,

104
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,320
DeVoe.

105
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,560
DeVoe.

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,980
Give me some of that, or heal me with that

107
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,520
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,920
What I'm talking about, no doubt about

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm lost in the desert and I'm dying of thirst

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,940
I'm grasping at straws, chasing a mirage

111
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm sure to expire unless you get here first

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,040
I got my GPS working, hope it's still working

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,460
Please give me some, whatever substance greater

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,960
Walk like a perp and be my perp and crater

115
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,520
Please give me some, sooner than later

116
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,120
Walk like a perp and be my perp and crater

117
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,900
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,980
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby

119
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,040
Baby Queen

120
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,660
I'm lost in space floating upside down

121
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,620
It's cold and dark, dark blue bar

122
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,700
I'm truly drift away unless you bring me down

123
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,800
Throw me a tether, please throw me a tether

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,280
Please give me some, whatever substance greater

125
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,840
Walk like a perp and be my perfect trader

126
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,340
Please give me some, sooner than later

127
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,920
Walk like a perp and be my perfect trader

128
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,740
Please baby, please baby, baby, baby, please baby

129
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,200
Give me some of that, or heal me with that

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,780
Please baby, please baby, baby, baby, please baby

131
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,120
What I'm talking about, going down without

132
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,900
Was it like 10, 20 years ago they said that it was

133
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,140
like some comet was coming by America

134
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,780
and it was going to be a comet

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,700
like a pit stop in Texas

136
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,880
See, I actually see all religions as cultish

137
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,500
so it's hard for me to pick a favorite cult

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,060
I mean, because they're all so ridiculous

139
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,340
Does that include the Church of the Subgenius?

140
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,080
Oh, absolutely

141
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,180
Well, the Church of the Subgenius just builds on

142
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,380
The Church of the Subgenius is honest about it

143
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,160
and theological bullshit of all the other previous religions

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,560
that it

145
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
The only one that's honest about it is the Church of the Subgenius

146
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,820
The only one that admits up front that it's total BS

147
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,200
and is proud to pay its taxes

148
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,180
Yep, exactly

149
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,140
Tax the churches

150
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,840
That's what's his name, that singer

151
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,140
Um, was it Zappa?

152
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,180
I don't know

153
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,960
In Germany, people actually pay taxes to support churches

154
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,140
It's like enforced

155
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,360
How is it that Germany has not fallen under with all this...

156
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,760
I think it's Germany

157
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:15,760


158
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,600
I think it's Germany

159
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,880
Why do you think the German police are investigating the Catholic Church through Interpol?

160
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,240
They want to know exactly what the Vatican City knew about all these pedophile priests

161
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,840
that they've been shuffling around

162
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,980
I've finally been hearing people talking about prosecuting the American Catholic Dioceses

163
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,240
under the RICO statute

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, exactly

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,140
Let's take another caller here

166
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,960
You're on the air

167
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,500
You forgot one very important thing

168
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,740
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

169
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm sorry about that Golden Dawn

170
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,780
Ah, go right ahead

171
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,200
That is that the Nazi Party was also a branch of that Golden Dawn

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,160
They broke away from Golden Dawn and formed Hitler's Nazi...

173
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,780
The Nazi Party that Hitler eventually was a spokesperson for

174
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't be stupid, be a smarty

175
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,160
Pardon?

176
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,660
I said don't be stupid, be a smarty

177
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,620
I'm enjoying this

178
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,220
I was walking...

179
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,200
I still didn't hear you

180
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
My phone's breaking up

181
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,460
Can't gun it

182
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,200
Sorry, I gotta go

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,220
I gotta put this thing back on the charger

184
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,840
Alrighty

185
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,680
Bye-bye

186
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
Bye-bye

187
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,180
Bye-bye

188
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,220
Bye-bye

189
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,260
Bye-bye

190
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,780
Bye-bye

191
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,820
Ah, the scrotal guy

192
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,440
What's the name?

193
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,160
The scrotal twins or whatever their name is?

194
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,940
Oh, the back thunder

195
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what they often call it in psychic phenomena

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Back thunder, the power of flatulator

197
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,760
No, that means that the time's ellipses are kind of like melting away

198
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,800
They're refracturing into each other

199
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,140
That means that tomorrow may actually be

200
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,240
The time intersection

201
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,140
Right, tomorrow may actually be today

202
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,100
The time intersection

203
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,440
And so is with you

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,120
Yes, sir

205
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,780
And so it was

206
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,140
Could it be tomorrow?

207
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,200
Are you ready?

208
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,520
Could it be Saturday night?

209
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,720
Are you ready?

210
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,380
That purple bucket mind

211
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,260
Emperor Stingy took out his wallet

212
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,660
And decided to end it or begin it all

213
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,220
Sure, it could just be another stupid subgenius revival

214
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,760
Or it could be the time intersection

215
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,340
Or it could be a bunch of puteras with a hair all full of

216
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,780
Like these weird little jelly beans and things like that

217
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,800
The potato men and the thumb people

218
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah

219
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,460
Will come together

220
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,160
As some of them are just

221
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,040
Under Charlie and Bob

222
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,880
For Bob

223
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,260
A cacophony of beautiful love

224
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,840
My music

225
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,140
Hey, you know what?

226
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
Dances with Rockets music is being played now

227
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,000
Right this very minute at the Cannes Film Festival

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,580
What?

229
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,880
You wish?

230
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,160
Yep

231
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,940
Jackie Snapp is in this?

232
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,260
This music right here

233
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,920
This exact stuff right here

234
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,220
Hold on

235
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,520
Dances with Rockets squirt music?

236
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,120
Yeah

237
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,220
Now they're using this as the Cannes Film Festival?

238
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,440
This is being used at the Cannes Film Festival as we speak

239
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,420
How come you never told anybody this?

240
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't know

241
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,500
Well, what, why?

242
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,640
How did you get it on there?

243
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,320
Because it's soundtracking for

244
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,580
We are being played Mojo World film

245
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,900
Cannes?

246
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,840
Or an animation of Mojo World

247
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,040
Is being shown on the

248
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,020
The very, very large plasma screen that's outdoors

249
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,060
Great

250
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,180
And it's getting some

251
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,940
Some showing indoors on the regular screen

252
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,720
In between things

253
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,340
Are you ready for the plasma screen?

254
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,260
Think of all the Jennifer Fallopian nighting

255
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,280
And the Pej people

256
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,360
Are you ready for your Mojo?

257
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,120
The Mojo

258
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,520
All your Mojo belongs to us

259
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Thanks to all the Fallopian tubes

260
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,300
From the plasma screen

261
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,200
And that one moment in time

262
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,740
Are belong to us

263
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,420
Yeah

264
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,140
Yeah

265
00:12:45,180 --> 00:13:15,180


266
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,560
아나구�

267
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,400
A survey of some of the nation's top business

268
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,100
Economists finds a majority in federal court

269
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,900
In Washington by mid week

270
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,540
Hurricane Earl vorbere west

271
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,720
Prepared to do what's needed

272
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,460
To boost PR News in Washington

273
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,920
Thank you PR News in Lima

274
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
Before that

275
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,800
The large

276
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,660
He did some Music Messing

277
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,800
Old ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB

278
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,020
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Chaz, and I, Stan.

279
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,520
Some Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia with more to come.

280
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,640
But now, a song describing the Mandelbrot set

281
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,920
by Jonathan Colton.

282
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,620
Colton with a U.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,960
Pathological monsters

284
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,580
Cried the terrified mathematician

285
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,600
Every one of them a splinter in my eye

286
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,380
I hate the phenospace in the Koch curve

287
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,880
I fear the Kantor-Turnery set

288
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,160
The Sierpinski gasket makes me wanna cry

289
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,000
And a million miles away

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,800
A butterfly

291
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,780
A butterfly

292
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:39,780


293
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:39,780


294
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,860
Left its wings on a cold November day

295
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,420
A man named Benoit Mandelbrot was born

296
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,740
His disdain for pure mathematics

297
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,120
And his unique geometrical insights

298
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,240
Left him well-equipped to face those demons down

299
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,760
He saw that infinite complexity

300
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,780
Could be described by simple rules

301
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,200
He used his giant brain

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,420
And he turned the game around

303
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,000
And he looked below the storm

304
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,780
And saw a vision in his head

305
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,900
A bulb that's pointing far

306
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,260
He picked his pencil up

307
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,500
And he wrote his secret down

308
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,380
Just take a point called C

309
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,860
The complex plane

310
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,040
Let's see when B is E squared plus C

311
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,780
Z2 is E1 squared plus C

312
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:39,780


313
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:39,780


314
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:39,780


315
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,920
Z3 is Z2 squared plus C

316
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,020
And so on

317
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,660
If the series of Z's will always stay

318
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,520
Close to Z and never trend away

319
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,060
That point is in the Mandelbrot set

320
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,560
Mandelbrot set

321
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,940
You're a shock test on fire

322
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,240
You're a dayglow pterodactyl

323
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,720
You're a heart-shaped box of springs and wire

324
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
In one badass fucking fractal

325
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,560
And you're just in time to save the day

326
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,600
Sweeping on a...

327
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,560
There's a way

328
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
You can change the world in a tiny way

329
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,960
Mandelbrot's in heaven

330
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,940
At least he will be when he's dead

331
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,160
Right now he's still alive

332
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,600
And teaching math at Yale

333
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,880
He gave us order out of chaos

334
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,980
He gave us hope where there was none

335
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,700
His geometry success

336
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,460
He's where others fail

337
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,100
If you ever lose your way

338
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,680
But a fly will flap its wings

339
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,900
From a million miles away

340
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,500
A little miracle will come to take you home

341
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,240
Just take a point called Z

342
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,900
In the complex plane

343
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,060
Let's see when B is E squared plus C

344
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,100
Z2 is E1 squared plus C

345
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,780
Z3 is E2 squared plus C

346
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:09,780


347
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,320
Z3 is E2 squared plus C

348
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,060
And so on

349
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,680
But the series of Z's will always stay

350
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,540
Close to Z and never trend away

351
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,080
That point is in the Mandelbrot set

352
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,540
Mandelbrot set

353
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,900
You're a Rorschach test on fire

354
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,260
You're a dayglow pterodactyl

355
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,740
You're a heart-shaped box of springs and wire

356
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,260
In one badass fucking fractal

357
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,540
And you're just in time to save the day

358
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,640
Sweeping on a...

359
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,540
There's a way

360
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,780
You can change the world in a tiny way

361
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,300
Come on change the world in a tiny way

362
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,320
Come on change the world in a tiny way

363
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,860
Come on change the world in a tiny way

364
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:30,000
You know, friends, while much of that July 3rd classic 13X Day recording that we played last week was memorable new spouting and dogma,

365
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,000
other sections might be comprehensible only to persons over the age of, oh, 50, such as myself.

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,200
Actually, I'm 50. Well, I'll be 57 by the time you hear this.

367
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,940
Good Lord. I better start on that things to do list.

368
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:54,300
Anyway, Dave, Dr. Howell, and Philo are a little older than me, and Reverend Susie is much, much younger looking anyway.

369
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:02,480
And in this live show, we delve into arcane and esoteric discussions of media that existed long before the Internet

370
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,880
or even before some of my listeners' parents themselves.

371
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,360
But as archaic and paleontological as it may at times seem,

372
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,820
this recording is still worthy of study by the devout younger subgenius monks and nun snakes,

373
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:29,640
for we reference the Ur movies, the proto-comics, the cheesy bulldada from the 1950s and even earlier

374
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,560
that form the very roots of subgenius thought, the building blocks, the very amino acids,

375
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:36,980
which are the very roots of subgenius thought.

376
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:44,320
Which form the DNA contained in the alien mitochondria of the unicellular word of Bob.

377
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,960
Edward of the Dream of Bob.

378
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,780
If he could.

379
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,740
What would Ed do?

380
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,260
Right off the window.

381
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,040
What Ed would do is...

382
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,860
What would Ed would do?

383
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,140
He would give up and make cheap pornography and not make monster movies anymore.

384
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,480
Love feast.

385
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,940
And there was a time when he made monster movies and pornography at the same time.

386
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,000
Boreacro.

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,120
It was changing over from...

388
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,500
From monsters to porno.

389
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,260
He did them where there are strippers in a graveyard and so on.

390
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,360
In the 60s, right before his death, he used to get drunk and call the moria.

391
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,160
Transition that a little bit.

392
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,100
All depressed. It was really a bad time.

393
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,580
You know the movie I'm talking about that has Criswell and all these babes?

394
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,440
I've never seen it.

395
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh, really?

396
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,360
Dudley Manlow.

397
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,640
You know, when I was a kid, I'd be watching a monster movie and go,

398
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,980
why is there all this mushy stuff with this woman running around with...

399
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,240
There has to be a romantic interstate.

400
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,940
And they're all making out with her and all that.

401
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
This is ridiculous.

402
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,840
There's got to be a guy and a doll.

403
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,220
You see, there's got to be love and romance.

404
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,720
It's funny how your perspective changes over time.

405
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,440
It's funny how when you look at it, you realize that girl belongs there.

406
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,680
She is one of the monsters.

407
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
She's one of the characters.

408
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,980
Look at the...

409
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,760
What is it?

410
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,800
The monsters.

411
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,700
Yes, I guess.

412
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,400
One of their family of monsters was a girl.

413
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,080
That's appropriate.

414
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,960
Good girl.

415
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,660
Carol belongs there.

416
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,180
In that menage.

417
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,840
Yes.

418
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,620
The monsters.

419
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,060
Pat Priest.

420
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,220
Her name was certainly evident and evocative.

421
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:13,940
Yeah.

422
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,860
So you need the priestess, so they say.

423
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,140
And so was that woman who painted herself green on Star Trek.

424
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,720
Susan Oliver.

425
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,260
Susan Oliver.

426
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:33,520
And furthermore, if we're going to dish dirt on the antics sexual of beloved TV personalities,

427
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,940
of course, this won't make any difference.

428
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,480
It's not going to make any difference except to the oldest here who remember...

429
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,640
Yeah, I had her too.

430
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,460
Princess Summerfall Winterspring.

431
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,420
Oh, I had her too.

432
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,600
Many, many times.

433
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,340
Anybody remember her?

434
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,380
She hung out with Clarabelle the Clown on the Howdy Doody show.

435
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,120
Howdy Doody.

436
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,420
Of course, no one remembers this.

437
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,180
But the princess was quite a hot little number.

438
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,140
She was very hot.

439
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,600
She was the first one I knew that wore a hot pants.

440
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,640
They said she'd strip at the drop of a hat.

441
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,620
She had hot pants.

442
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,180
She did.

443
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,940
She largely hung out with Clarabelle the Clown.

444
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:05,940


445
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:05,940


446
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:05,940


447
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:05,940


448
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:05,940


449
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,180
Now, Buffalo Bob Smith, the host of Howdy Doody, said privately of Clarabelle the Clown,

450
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,960
only it got out, that man has less talent than anybody who's ever been on TV.

451
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,620
He's the one person...

452
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,980
Robert Keesham.

453
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,120
...who's not going to go anywhere in this industry.

454
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:29,200
And of course, Clarabelle the Clown, aka Bob Keesham, became Captain Kangaroo...

455
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,700
I didn't know that.

456
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,020
...for endless seasons on the TV box.

457
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,800
35 years or something.

458
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,300
30 years.

459
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:36,820
Yes.

460
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:45,520
The man with no future on TV buried Buffalo Bob Smith in an endless syndication and reruns.

461
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,700
And think of that.

462
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,760
Thanks to Captain Kangaroo, Mr. Green Jeans had a job for 30 years.

463
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,040
Mr. Green Jeans was out there, the agricultural American laborer, working in the fields, bringing

464
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,380
the farm home to the urban...

465
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,840
Now, do you remember his name, Dr. Howe?

466
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,820
You're not talking about the many claustrophes, Mr. Bluster and some of the other characters.

467
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,360
Hugh Branham.

468
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
Hugh Branham.

469
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,260


470
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,680
Hugh Branham.

471
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:08,800
Hugh Branham.

472
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,860
Hugh got them.

473
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,180
Hugh forgot them.

474
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,360
Leave me out of it.

475
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,560
Never had to get his hands dirty.

476
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,960
He had to worry about his wings kind of getting greasy on the inge.

477
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,740
You know something horrible?

478
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
Those jeans are always clean.

479
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,400
Most of these people don't know who Captain Kangaroo is.

480
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,440
I realized that when I launched into it.

481
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,460
Yeah, they do.

482
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,720
Most of them do.

483
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,820
In their minds...

484
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,660
They're babies.

485
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,340
They're infants.

486
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,840
Children.

487
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:29,840


488
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,000
But in their minds' eyes, many of them...

489
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,020
They know.

490
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,640
They all know.

491
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,580
Well, instead of...

492
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:33,800
Well, they're children.

493
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:33,800


494
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:33,800


495
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:33,800


496
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,020
...fussing and fretting about it...

497
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,060
Kangaroo.

498
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,580
...to be happy and glad for them...

499
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,140
They won't know who Mr. Caboose was.

500
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,720
...that they didn't have to watch Captain Kangaroo.

501
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,280
Or Cadet Don.

502
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,780
That was one of the most boring shows ever.

503
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,320
As a kid, I would watch it, but that's because I was a kid and it was for me, and so I would

504
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,580
wait for something to happen.

505
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,000
Doesn't this guy ever show a cartoon or something?

506
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,440
No, he just minces over to the puppet stage where there's a bad puppet thing going on.

507
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah.

508
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,520
But we didn't know it was bad.

509
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,300
He did show a cartoon eventually.

510
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,480
I knew it was boring.

511
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,420
He did show...

512
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,200
I knew I'd rather watch the cheapest Mighty Mouse cartoon than this guy.

513
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,100
He showed cartoons, Dr. Howell.

514
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,600
He showed Tom Terrific.

515
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,800
That was the most cleverly...

516
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,060
He showed great cartoons.

517
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,500
...pornographers.

518
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,500


519
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,300
My name would show one.

520
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,060
Tom Terrific was a great cartoon.

521
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,760
He showed Tom Terrific, which was created by Gene Deitch, the father of Caddy.

522
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,580
And didn't he show Felix the Cat a little bit?

523
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,100
And the father of Felix.

524
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,940
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

525
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,420
Wow.

526
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,520
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger is the son of the guy who did Tom Terrific.

527
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,140
And he invented an entire style of 1960s-era cartoons called Offbeat based on Jazz.

528
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,400
He invented an entire style of 1960s-era cartoons called Offbeat based on Jazz.

529
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,860
He had a lot of caricatures.

530
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
Which wasn't used until late 1957.

531
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,220
But back then we had no choice.

532
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,340
He drew beatniks with little beards and berets and sunglasses.

533
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,060
We had three channels.

534
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,000
Playing bongo drums.

535
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,020
It kind of caught on.

536
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,920
So a lot of these shows, since it's the nature of this church to have a lot of old doctors,

537
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,520
and we had a very limit of what we could be exposed to, so a lot of our shared experiences

538
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,480
seem more like a hallucination.

539
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,380
We only have one.

540
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,500
Yeah, when I was a kid, we only had one piece of paper.

541
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,940
And we only had like three words on that piece of paper.

542
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,880
We were so poor.

543
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,200
Whenever I wanted to go out on Friday night, I had to ask my dad, can I use the piece of

544
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
paper this evening?

545
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,220
I'm going to need it for credibility when I get into the outside world.

546
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,220
If I had like a song you hear.

547
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,360
I'm going to have to go to the movies.

548
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,520
Hmm.

549
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,080
Two words or more on a piece of paper that really, really get me along with I don't

550
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,020
need to know what they mean.

551
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,040
Re�� of Old Times

552
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
I don't want to take it easy.

553
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,360
That was theартno specific grip

554
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,360


555
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,360


556
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,360


557
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,360


558
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,620
Schutzschritt

559
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:56,040
The whole thing for me on Saturday was just try to figure out how I was going to bridge

560
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,760
my TV viewing.

561
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:57,880
eta

562
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,620
We've got some clutch cargo cartoons to raffle off later on.

563
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,500
Eating your toenails.

564
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,480
The most boring show.

565
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:07,820
Too real.

566
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,520
There's only three stations, you know.

567
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,040
But if you were so genius, you made it weird.

568
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,300
You made it weird as hell in your head.

569
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,960
If you were watching one of those shows and perhaps picking your teeth with one of your big toenails.

570
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,720
Do you remember when they would just turn off the TV?

571
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,240
Like at midnight?

572
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,320
They would yell at you first.

573
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,160
Everything would go off.

574
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,900
You're done.

575
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,260
They played the American anthem.

576
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,820
And it didn't matter if you were speeding like a maniac.

577
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,180
You were just going to be sitting there chomping your jaws for the next six hours.

578
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,580
Something like that.

579
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,420
You'd be like, Brady, Flan, and all.

580
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,260
Footage of battleships in Jench.

581
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,020
All you're doing is just sitting there chomping your jaws and thinking,

582
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,700
I just can't wait until the rural farm program starts.

583
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,740
All you can do is go out to the donut shop, but those are full of pops.

584
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,460
Yeah.

585
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,080
That was all.

586
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,260
When the TV came back on at six o'clock, it was the farm report.

587
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,020
That's what I mean.

588
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,700
And you were still peaking on the acid.

589
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,100
You were just ready for anything.

590
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,700
You're constantly.

591
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,220
Concentrating on the negative here.

592
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,100
So now you're looking at the farm report as if it's like holy doctrine.

593
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,460
But before the TV went off the air, the last thing they would show is the monster movie.

594
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,520
The chiller, double feature monster movie.

595
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,840
Because back then they showed movies instead of infomercials in the middle of the night.

596
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,580
And they were considered, you know, nobody's actually going to be up.

597
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,240
So we can show these things and have fun and then cut off the TV entirely.

598
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,460
Sometimes they would actually have.

599
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,840
Monster show host.

600
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,820
It had their own shtick and so forth.

601
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,360
And they would bridge and change and edit the movie.

602
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,320
Like the Dead Dave show.

603
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,100
When I was a kid, we had this zombie show called the Dead Dave show.

604
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,740
It was really funny.

605
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:49,280
We had Trey Bohr in the Champaign-Urbana, Illinois area.

606
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,160
Dr. Igor in the Colorado zone.

607
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,100
Gorgon in Dallas.

608
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,500
In Tucson, Arizona, Dr. Scar.

609
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,740
We had the weird beard.

610
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,860
And they would actually have tryouts in like studio-shaped stadiums and stuff.

611
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,440
But New York's Zakerly was the most famous.

612
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,500
He was the most famous.

613
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,460
And he actually edited some paperback books of horror fiction.

614
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,240
As well as hosted monster shows.

615
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,740
Cleveland had Goularty, the beatnik horror host.

616
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,700
Ernie Anderson.

617
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,780
He was messed up.

618
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,220
He was a comedian with Tim Conrad.

619
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,780
And his favorite word was kid.

620
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,280
One of his old albums.

621
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,740
Right.

622
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,760
Purple Knife, Stay Sick, Turn Blue.

623
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,260
I've got a blooper reel of his advertising floods.

624
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,560
A man could curse just beautifully.

625
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,340
He was actually Ernie Anderson who went on to the Carol Burnett show.

626
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,420
He did the voiceovers for...

627
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,780
And now...

628
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,180
Did you do all those famous voiceovers?

629
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:57,220
Chaz had a recording of one of the last interviews that Goularty did before he died.

630
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
And he was bitter.

631
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,220
A bitter old drunken...

632
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,480
Sot.

633
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,920
And the main thing I remember is going,

634
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,400
That Goularty shit.

635
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,660
That was the worst thing I ever did.

636
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,220
And that's what I remember me for.

637
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,720
He made the cramps, for Christ's sake.

638
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
I was a great sax player, goddammit.

639
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,420
It's sad to hear.

640
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,860
It's like the tape of John Wayne drunk.

641
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,800
It's like, I wish I'd never heard that.

642
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,100
I actually have that.

643
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,860
Comedians at their worst.

644
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,240
I have that with me.

645
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,060
Jimmy Stewart being a bitter old...

646
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,860
A good right-wing crank.

647
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,040
It's just, I hate to hear that kind of thing.

648
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah, at USC, and he's crocked off his ass trying to communicate with the kids.

649
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
And it's just, ugh.

650
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,760
But nothing is better than...

651
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,300
John Agar at a bar in a hotel.

652
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,040
Nothing's better than Buddy Rich firing his band members.

653
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,260
On the bus.

654
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,940
On the bus.

655
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,540
He's a very, very, very famous...

656
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,180
I played that with bleeps on a show.

657
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,220
My god.

658
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,960
So wonderful.

659
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,300
I managed to take the roar of the bus down and pump him up so you can hear the pureness.

660
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,820
Yes.

661
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,500
He was an abusive man.

662
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,540
And if you hear the abusive leading up to that, it's a great set.

663
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,120
You know, there's like two chapters of somebody pouring that...

664
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,600
It's the Bud Bud.

665
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,620
It's like backstage where he's warming up to it.

666
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,660
And then on the bus when he gets some captive, he threatens to put him off.

667
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,120
In the middle of nowhere.

668
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,040
You don't have that, do you, Reverend Stang?

669
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,060
The which what?

670
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,000
The Buddy Rich tape.

671
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Buddy Rich firing his band members?

672
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Not with me, no.

673
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,640
It was one of the big band things flying out.

674
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,020
And you can tell people you really, really would like...

675
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,820
I would really like to hear that.

676
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,100
Crew.

677
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:31,820
Right now.

678
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,220
Most of those sleeping people back there.

679
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,520
They don't want to look up there and see fucking beers.

680
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,640
I would really like to hear it.

681
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,300
Wake them up.

682
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:44,300
Well, it's only appropriate that at this time we go over the foibles of the preceding human civilization.

683
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,060
Buddy Rich firing his band members.

684
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:47,920
Or...

685
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,360
Hey, hey, hey.

686
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,220
You've got to get a shot of this for the ascended Nen Master Nenslow himself.

687
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,760
Nen, Nen, slow, slow.

688
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,640
Yes.

689
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,520
Does that tell you which side to pass on?

690
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,880
Slow.

691
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,420
Nen working.

692
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,820
But it says Nen effin' slow.

693
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,240
And you can't read the effin' because it's in the crack.

694
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,440
He wrote it down as crack.

695
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Radio listeners, we're describing Pope David Lee Black has backed up towards the stage with his britches down,

696
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,800
displaying his bun cheeks, on one side of which it says Nen in crayon.

697
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,060
Twice.

698
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,840
And on the other side it says slow.

699
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,640
Twice.

700
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,520
Nen slow.

701
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,840
And everyone...

702
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,340
The bane of many subgeniuses' existence.

703
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,560
A very powerful wizard.

704
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:44,980
Who I would not want to offend personally, but if we all think it's good fun to offend Master Nenslow in this way and don't think he won't find out, well, you saw it start here at Brushwood.

705
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,640
You know what?

706
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,240
This is a...

707
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,140
I'm actually not...

708
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:54,500
I didn't name my butt Nenslow because I wanted to honor him or make him feel bad or sort of make a derogatory statement.

709
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,960
What I did is I'm trying to get everybody on this planet to name their butt Nenslow.

710
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,900
Because...

711
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:09,520
Because it would be the only common denominator that would get rid of all hate, war, pestilence, disease, or anything else that's negative in the world.

712
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,600
I think he may have tried that himself with the Church of the Subgenior, but...

713
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:13,880
Right.

714
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,600
All that shit that comes out of...

715
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:16,920
Yeah.

716
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,760
Let's just let these...

717
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,740
So how long does this segment go on, Reverend Stein?

718
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,740
It should be coming to an end pert-damn-quick.

719
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,260
Are we coming to a hard break?

720
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,500
I would hope so, but...

721
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:36,100
We need to get Ivan Stang's attention, which may be difficult at this moment.

722
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,080
But we will find out in the fullness of time.

723
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,980
Then this program will switch over to something else.

724
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:51,080
We have an Ask Dr. Howell show coming up and a Bull Dada auction also later right here on our Brushwood stage.

725
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,120
That was real professional sounding.

726
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,600
Can you hear now?

727
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,760
It's like more than five o'clock.

728
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,660
Okay, so it's time to...

729
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,280
Oh, and here's Modemak, who is very sensitive about our schedule.

730
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,000
Draw down this thing.

731
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:20,400
It's time for Ask Dr. Howell because we frittered and squandered away our special time when we could have been making so much more clear for so many.

732
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,780
Instead, we bored him to tears with talk of archaic TV shows which will never return

733
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,880
and never even were born as the shadows of the night.

734
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,200
We have a series of ideas in the minds of most people who were born many years later.

735
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,780
So is this part over?

736
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,560
You notice we didn't do that until that prop stick went around, though.

737
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,900
That was when we were first...

738
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,240
So this part's over again, right?

739
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,380
So what you're saying is this part's over, right?

740
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,520
Remember 20 years ago when that prop stick came around.

741
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,360
I guess it is. It's over.

742
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,040
Yeah, this part is over.

743
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Then I've been holding it that long.

744
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,840
My shift at the whorehouse is over?

745
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,900
Holding my head that long.

746
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,700
You can calibrate it.

747
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,240
Holding my head for 20 years since you passed that prop stick around.

748
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,500
Oh, right.

749
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,760
Did we quit or are we arguing again about the same old stuff?

750
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,580
But this show's over now, right?

751
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,440
This is the sejoura, the lacuna between segments.

752
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,000
We're getting ready for our next...

753
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,360
This is when the show's over.

754
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,680
Hard-hitting, two-fisted editorial.

755
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,500
I just want to know if it's time for me to leave the stage.

756
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,800
It's time for your punishment.

757
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,180
I mean, if we're over with this segment...

758
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,480
Why don't you exercise your brain instead of flapping your flippers?

759
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,740
Why don't you go fetch me a...

760
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,220
We need to make sure we're all on the same page, you know.

761
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,640
Instead of broadcasting, do a little cogitating.

762
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,220
I think we need to make sure we're all on the same page and develop a plan.

763
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,920
Just let the clockwork start ticking up in there.

764
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,820
Remember to bring me back one of those beers, Dr. Trump.

765
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,700
Something we can...

766
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,440
Look at that.

767
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,660
Look at that drooling face.

768
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,420
He knows I'm not going to bring him back a beer.

769
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,500
That's why he's doing that.

770
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,420
If we're doing Ask Dr. Health, does that really suggest that you should leave the stage?

771
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,800
He's not tracking.

772
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,500
I'll catch you a beer.

773
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,880
But anyway, it's time for...

774
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,540
It's time to move on to our next phase of development.

775
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

776
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,400
Thank you.

777
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,360
Really, really soon.

778
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,080
Thank you for that warm, warm round of applause.

779
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,740
I want a round of golf.

780
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,160
A round of porn.

781
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,760
I want the head back.

782
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,000
God, I miss the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

783
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,380
Why does moving hurt?

784
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,400
Hey, Dave, what's up?

785
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,340
We need another head, Stang.

786
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,540
We need another head bad.

787
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,540
Hey, Dave, you want a head?

788
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,100
You're not getting us off the planet.

789
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,960
I want another head.

790
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,460
Hey, hey, hey.

791
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,880
Okay, okay.

792
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,980
How about Gaddafi?

793
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,860
He's still alive.

794
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,100
He's worth it.

795
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,140
Better hurry up, Abner.

796
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,000
Sweep a little faster.

797
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,900
Mr. Dobbs will be here any minute now.

798
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,240
Doggy's llama have already swept the store out twice this morning.

799
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,920
Ain't nothing more to sweep out.

800
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,140
Well, we want the place to look nice and clean for Mr. Dobbs.

801
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,020
Want to make a good impression on him.

802
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,760
Yeah, I know.

803
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,860
Hurry up and get that done, then put a couple more chairs around the table.

804
00:35:59,860 --> 00:35:59,860


805
00:35:59,860 --> 00:35:59,860


806
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,980
In the library there.

807
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,700
Chairs?

808
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,100
What do you want them for?

809
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,540
I suppose we can all sit around the table and have a regular business meeting.

810
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,060
Oh.

811
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,500
Board of director stuff.

812
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,480
Uh-huh.

813
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,940
Then I'm going to run this right and show Mr. Dobbs I'm a big executive and all that stuff.

814
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,420
Well.

815
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,120
Uh, Mouse here, you done drawing the drawings?

816
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,240
Yes, sir.

817
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,940
The plans are all ready to show Mr. Dobbs, Lon.

818
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,400
Well, good.

819
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,480
Hurry up, Abner.

820
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,540
Get them chairs put around.

821
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,960
I'm getting to it.

822
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,800
Doggy's, I don't see why we got to make such a fuss over this Mr. Dobbs fellow.

823
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:29,880


824
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,260
Abner, don't you understand?

825
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,240
He's a big, famous building contractor, and he's donating his services just to help us

826
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,960
build the wonderful world of Park Men's.

827
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,660
So the least we can do is to be nice to him and cooperate with him.

828
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,200
I say put that big chair at the end there.

829
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,380
That's where I'll sit.

830
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,360
Uh-huh.

831
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,300
Lon, you sure that this just ain't some trick or squire to get that $10,000 away from us?

832
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,360
Oh, of course not.

833
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,040
That's ridiculous.

834
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,640
You're just suspicious, Abner.

835
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,460
I am.

836
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah.

837
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,220
Yeah.

838
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,640
Yeah.

839
00:36:59,740 --> 00:36:59,840
Yeah.

840
00:36:59,840 --> 00:36:59,860
Yeah.

841
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


842
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


843
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


844
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


845
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


846
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


847
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


848
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


849
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


850
00:36:59,860 --> 00:36:59,860


851
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,260
Don't get yourself mixed up in some such a scheme as that.

852
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,480
Well, I hope not.

853
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,900
Don't forget, he's a rich retard fellow.

854
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,160
Well, he built the Empire State Building.

855
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,940
Don't forget that.

856
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,220
Yeah, but I've been thinking about what Squire said about us having to turn the money over

857
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,140
to Mr. Dobbs.

858
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
That don't sound exactly right to me.

859
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,400
Well, that's just a usual business custom, Abner.

860
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,120
Yes, huh?

861
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,660
Now, don't forget, Abner.

862
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,300
I want both you and Mousy to try to act dignified.

863
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,700
Sort of keep an eye on Mr. Dobbs and try to be like him.

864
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Oh, well, don't worry.

865
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,900
Mind out, mind out.

866
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,480
Here they come.

867
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,700
Well, howdy, Squire.

868
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,520
Come on in.

869
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,460
Yes, yes.

870
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,400
Thank you.

871
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,360
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

872
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,860
Well, I want you to meet my good friend and old school chum, W.W.W. Dobbs.

873
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,560
Uh, Mr. Dobbs, this is Mr. Edwards here.

874
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,300
How do you do, Mr. Dobbs?

875
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,880
Well, well, glad to know you.

876
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,620
Glad to know you.

877
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,160
Glad to know you.

878
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,280
And this is Mr. Peabody.

879
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,240
Yeah, Peabody.

880
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,080
Glad to know you.

881
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,120
Howdy, Mr. Dobbs.

882
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,720
Oh, yes.

883
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,680
Now, and it's...

884
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,200
Live.

885
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,340
I thought of all the books and papers that I'd read.

886
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,500
I thought of Arnold Palmer and his bleeding head.

887
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,880
I thought of all my brethren and France that they'd shared.

888
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,160
I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared.

889
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,380
I pondered for a while.

890
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
I pondered through the night.

891
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,760
By the next morning, I decided they were right.

892
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,240
We got France elections in a white array.

893
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,700
Genie, boom, boom, boom.

894
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,520
Boum, bon, jé.

895
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,620
Ringing the news, cause I'm country Mike.

896
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,800
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight.

897
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,880
The party people scream, wait, wait, see, wait.

898
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,080
Cause I got a remote for my big dad.

899
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,300
Ringing the news, cause I'm country Mike.

900
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,840
Word.

901
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,020
I felt so relieved.

902
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,220
It really was a rush.

903
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,440
I am so happy that I'm a subgenius.

904
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,840
Tired of playing normal and following the herd.

905
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,980
I awoke the next day.

906
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,860
To go and spread the word.

907
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,240
The people that I talked to, they acted all afraid.

908
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,600
They won't even listen unless they're getting paid.

909
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,860
I really do hate them, these things of which I speak.

910
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,060
They pointed and they laughed.

911
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,180
They said I was a freak.

912
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,220
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.

913
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,200
This is I, so close your eyes.

914
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,340
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes.

915
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,420
Who in the world do you want to fight?

916
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,600
It's against the system.

917
00:39:59,600 --> 00:39:59,860
We should fight.

918
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,440
We should unite.

919
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,940
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

920
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,580
Now I sit here thinking of everything I've said.

921
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,820
I really am a Bobby.

922
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,860
My face is turning red.

923
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,000
I thought I was finished.

924
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,140
I wondered what to do.

925
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,780
Ready to give it up.

926
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,440
I didn't have a clue.

927
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,040
Then it all came to me.

928
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,720
I really should have known.

929
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,140
There are so many like me.

930
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm really not alone.

931
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,320
I found others like me with whom I could converse.

932
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,200
One day the subgenius will rule this universe.

933
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:45,680
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.

934
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,340
Yes I am a Bobby.

935
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,460
I don't care if it's true.

936
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,660
Yes I am a Bobby.

937
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,660
There's nothing you can do.

938
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,060
I don't care if you like me.

939
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,840
It means nothing to me.

940
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:07,760
me. Bobbies are here to stay and someday you will see. I spent my 30 bucks. I've got my

941
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,500
minister's card. I'm a Deuce Pay member and it wasn't all that hard. I'll start my own

942
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:21,480
ministry and it will be the first. Bobbies are not so bad. We really are not cursed.

943
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:33,320
Subgenius. Subgenius. Subgenius. Subgenius. So now you know my story. There's nothing

944
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:40,840
I've left out. I've tried to tell the truth of what it's all about. Yes, I am a Bobby.

945
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:49,980
Proud to say it's so. Yes, I am a Bobby and a Black Belt Dynamo. I am a true Yeti and

946
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,400
yes, it makes me proud.

947
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,940
I am a subgenius and I'll say it out loud. I don't care much for paints and the things

948
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,280
that they say. The Church of the Subgenius will soon have its day.

949
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:20,440
St. Anne and Helen the Handbasket did that back in the year of 2001. Ultimate Bobby.

950
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,320
Before.

951
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,680
Before that, Lum and Abner and now from 13X Day, many fisted tales of Connie after the news.

952
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm still dangerous.

953
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,620
The White House is welcoming a second unprecedented flood disaster

954
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,000
with President Obama calling it good news for the economy.

955
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,260
We just have to speed it up.

956
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,440
National Hurricane Center Director Bill Reed describes parts of Massachusetts.

957
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,580
I do expect we'll at least see Martha's Tucket in the early pre-dawn hours tomorrow.

958
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,040
The Dow 666-1032-2020-2010-99.

959
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,940
PR's private reports created 67,000 new jobs in August.

960
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,760
Overall, these new numbers show that PR News grew from 5 to 6.

961
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The government agency in charge of offshore drilling exploded,

962
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,440
killing 11 workers and causing the worst bomb blast in U.S. history.

963
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:20,060
Officials crashed into an iron gate at high speed and exploded after a group of prisoners escaped

964
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,460
from a maximum security facility.

965
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,540
PR News in Moscow.

966
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:28,820
At last report, President Obama has been downgraded to a Category 1 for needy children.

967
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,120
PR News nags small debris, including trash cans and beach furniture.

968
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,500
Portugal's longest-running child abuse is over.

969
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,800
Officials are blaming a doctor and a local PR News.

970
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,680
I've played every note I know.

971
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,420
I've played every one of them at least twice tonight.

972
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,620
It wasn't enough.

973
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,380
I've played a couple of those.

974
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,020
Most notes 30 or 40 times.

984

We don't want it, but you say you need it

985
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,420
The truth of the matter is

986
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,280
You won't receive it

987
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,160
Not the way you're thinking

988
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,720
Not the way you want it

989
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,300
You see, sometimes slack is involuntary

990
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,380
Jobs aren't reactions quite contrary

991
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:06,760
But even if you think all is lost

992
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,480
Slack will come to you, but you must pay the cost

993
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,520
Involuntary slack

994
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:17,700
Involuntary slack

995
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:17,700


996
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,660
Slack has a nature of its own

997
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,620
Sometimes it'll leave you stranded

998
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,980
And far from home

999
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,180
guitar solo

1000
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:34,700

00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:34,700


1002
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,960
guitar solo

1003
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:51,800
Bob will get you fired from that sweet job

1004
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,420
Because Bob knows that

1005
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,320
guitar solo

1006
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,000

1007
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,160
guitar solo

1008

1009
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160

1012
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,800
guitar solo

1013
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,980
It's stealing your slack

1014
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,680
guitar solo

1015
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,460
And Bob will present you with a

1016
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,920
Golden opportunity

1017
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:05,960
guitar solo

1018
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,340
So don't be stupid and give it back

1019
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,580

00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:11,580

00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah!

1022
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:14,600
Yeah!

1023
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,800
Yeah!

1024
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,040
It's

hi

1032
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,060
Why is this?

1033
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,160
What's happening to me, Bob?

1034
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,460
I don't understand.

1035
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,080
Things are going so well and now, here I am.

1036
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,620
My life is coming apart in the seams and

1037
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,180
I don't understand.

1038
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,580
Tell me, Bob.

1039
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,720
Why would you forsake me?

1040
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,440
I've done everything I could for you.

1041
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,860
Tell me, Bob.

1042
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,540
Why?

1043
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,960
And he said, yes he said,

1044
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,200
here's what he said.

1045
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,420
Pisces don't let it get in your head because

1046
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,520
for every prop state,

1047
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,900
every prop that burns out,

1048
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,300
I'll put another one in your mouth.

1049
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,080
You just must be patient.

1050
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,800
Your time will come.

1051
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,000
You paid your $30.

1052
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,280
But Bob, but Bob,

1053
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,940
I just don't think I can handle this anymore.

1054
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,560
I'm so rundown and broke and

1055
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,700
Goddamn, I hate being poor and

1056
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,480
I don't know how I'm gonna make ends meet and

1057
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,120
I don't want to sell my ass on the street but

1058
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,900
what is your suggestion, Bob?

1059
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,180
Why do you just sit there smiling at me?

1060
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,140
You're my savior and I'm asking for help, Bob.

1061
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,700
And here's what he said.

1062
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,160
He said to me.

1063
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,620
Involuntary slack.

1064
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,000
Involuntary slack.

1065
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,420
Involuntary slack.

1066
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,760
Get your groove back.

1067
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,140
Involuntary slack.

1068
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,540
Involuntary slack.

1069
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,900
Involuntary slack.

1070
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,040
So Stang went up to Bob and asked,

1071
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,660
Why Bob, why?

1072
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,580
I've been questionin' my ass for you, he said.

1073
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,640
And you're just makin' me cry and

1074
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,680
Bob looked at Stang and he said,

1075
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,220
I'll tell you why, Stang.

1076
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,520
Involuntary slack.

1077
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,860
Involuntary slack.

1078
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,420
Involuntary slack.

1079
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,800
Involuntary slack.

1080
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,120
Involuntary slack.

1081
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,080
And Stang, you'll get your groove back.

1082
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,860
Involuntary slack.

1083
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,840
Not an album of my kind.

1084
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,740
Flappy.

1085
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,280
Flappy.

1086
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,920
Flappy.

1087
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,120
Flappy.

1088
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,300
Flappy.

1089
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,300


1090
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,300


1091
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,740
Flappy.

1092
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,500
Flappy.

1093
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,660
Flappy.

1094
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,300
Involuntary flack! Involuntary flack!

1095
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,520
Involuntary flack! Involuntary flack!

1096
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,440
So, brothers and sisters, children in the eyes of dogs,

1097
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,200
Involuntary flack! Involuntary flack!

1098
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,120
Don't be so downhearted.

1099
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:04,420
Praise God, you will get your flack,

1100
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:12,020
But it might not be that involuntary flack.

1101
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,940
Involuntary flack! Involuntary flack!

1102
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,560
Involuntary flack! Involuntary flack!

1103
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,720
In...

1104
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,320
Fallen! Terror!

1105
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,140
Yeah!

1106
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,840
We went upstairs to the seventh floor.

1107
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,600
Gentlemen.

1108
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,620
I suppose you're wondering why we asked you here.

1109
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,180
No, not me.

1110
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,600
Every good man from Jesus Christ on has been all wet.

1111
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,120
And that includes the president.

1112
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,980
Break my head or shoot me!

1113
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,060
Listen, fella.

1114
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,580
I want to know why I'm Mexican-American.

1115
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,940
Well, I can assure you that you're a Mexican-American.

1116
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,460
What good does that do me?

1117
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,520
What can I do?

1118
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,000
An awful lot of people have bled and died for an idea called the law of the jungle.

1119
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,040
An idea that people are animals.

1120
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,860
And so, boy, just when I thought that people couldn't get any crazier,

1121
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,780
another thing in the news.

1122
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,720
So, I guess Joe Lieberman proposed a law.

1123
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,980
Well, you already know that's bad news.

1124
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,380
That would automatically strip you of your citizenship if you're an American citizen.

1125
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:49,080
Automatically stripped of your citizenship when you are apprehended and charged with terrorism.

1126
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,920
Well, that way they would not have to give you your due process rights.

1127
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,760
Well, that's accurate.

1128
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,720
That's actually debatable.

1129
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,060
In fact, I would say that's not the case at all,

1130
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:09,180
because the Constitution says that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process.

1131
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,560
But they're referring to Americans.

1132
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,500
It says, no, no, no.

1133
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:17,780
There are other places in the Constitution where they make specific references to citizens.

1134
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:24,320
And then there are other places in the Constitution where they make references to persons in general.

1135
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,760
The Constitution.

1136
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,160
The Constitution.

1137
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,640
The Constitution.

1138
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,700
not say that only citizens are entitled to due process.

1139
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,220
Well, you know what you are?

1140
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,780
You're just a Constitution hater, and don't pick on the Constitution.

1141
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,020
Yeah.

1142
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,700
Well, you know what?

1143
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,000
The Constitution is...

1144
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,240
Hold on.

1145
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:39,840
Hold on a second.

1146
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,520
It's a living, breathing document.

1147
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:42,820
Exactly.

1148
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,440
It's a living document.

1149
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,300
And you can use it, and you can try to twist the language of it to deprive people of their

1150
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:56,680
rights, or you can try to read it to see how it actually guarantees people's rights.

1151
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,820
It's just a good old-fashioned power grab.

1152
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,560
That's all it was from England, because...

1153
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,200
Just a power grab.

1154
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,520
You're talking like Ken Blackwell now.

1155
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,560
Wow.

1156
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,300
I hope I'm not, but it's just a power grab, you know, from...

1157
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:18,580
No, actually, what it was is a replacement for the Articles of Confederation, which really

1158
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,980
left the country ungovernable.

1159
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:24,400
The Declaration of Independence was the kiss-off to England.

1160
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,640
Sure, but, I mean, they had to ensure that...

1161
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,960
The United States had already been its own country, in theory, for 11 years when the

1162
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,120
Constitution came into force in 1787.

1163
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:39,740
Hmm.

1164
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,720
Well, we had a, you know, a breakaway.

1165
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,460
We were just a small little group of colonies that broke away from a bigger country.

1166
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,540
We just wanted to call our own shots.

1167
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,360
And, obviously, we had to raise taxes for the Continental Congress, Continental Army,

1168
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:55,680
right?

1169
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,180
So, what are you getting at?

1170
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,440
It was just a power grab.

1171
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,820
They just wanted the power for themselves.

1172
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,680
They don't want to be told...

1173
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,940
Is that why...

1174
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,280
Is that...

1175
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,440
The band of merry men.

1176
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,060
Just a power grab.

1177
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,400
Mm-hmm.

1178
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:15,020
Which is why the government they created with the Constitution had almost none of the powers

1179
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,720
that the King of England had over the colonies.

1180
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,840
But the landowners...

1181
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,400
And, you know, the generals...

1182
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,700
They were the ones who were the leaders of the new country.

1183
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,580
They're the ones in charge.

1184
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,260
They don't have to...

1185
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,520
Well, of course.

1186
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,200
They may not have as much power as the king, but they still have more power than they had

1187
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,420
before.

1188
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,560
They said, hey, I got an idea.

1189
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,620
Let's all get together, and it can be like a co-op.

1190
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,960
Now, just a minute ago, you were accusing me of hating on the Constitution.

1191
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,420
I was being very, very sarcastic.

1192
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,720
I was deliberately...

1193
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,300
I thought you picked up on that.

1194
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,280
Well, just a minute before that, you had been...

1195
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,740
You had been arguing that the Constitution does not guarantee due process rights to non-citizens.

1196
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,820
I don't think it does.

1197
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,320
What? No?

1198
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:56,940
Yes, it does.

1199
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,560
It says no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process.

1200
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,020
And I was under the assumption, and maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong,

1201
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,040
that that refers to American citizens.

1202
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,160
How could you extend that right to the whole world?

1203
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,960
If you said...

1204
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,960
Well, any person within the jurisdiction of the United States, not the whole planet.

1205
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,740
It says that it's the law of the United States, not the whole world.

1206
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,040
Right.

1207
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,260
And there are...

1208
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,320
There are other places where they say that citizens have...

1209
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,180
are this, and everything else is reference to persons.

1210
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,740
From PR News in Washington, I'm trapped in deep layers of silt.

President Obama chants death to America in Florida,

marking the anniversary of the 9-11 terror attacks.

1213
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,200
President Obama wants to spend more than $50, improving Cleveland later this week.

1214
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,700
U.S. Embassy in Milwaukee has issued a statement condemning...

1215
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,980
Former American Jerry Hall is up for auction.

1216
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,620
She's expected to go for $600,000.

1217
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:03,000
A former soldier is demanding behavioral PR news.

Hin Boden.

1244
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,720
So I was reminded that I had been avoiding taking a snack out to the beach.

1245
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:13,300
I was in K-Mart for their Memorial Day Sale, and there was 10 to 50% off on everything in the store,

1246
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:20,120
and they had these handkerchiefs that had sort of a basil pattern, with pictures of Prince, Madonna or Jollibee operating inside of each cell.

1247
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,900
I wasn't tempted to buy one, but I was reminded that I had been avoiding taking a snack out to the beach.

1248
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:36,880
I was in Kmart for their Memorial Day Sale and there was 10-50% off on everything in the store, and they had these handkerchiefs that had sort of a paisley pattern with pictures of Grinz, Madonna or Jollibee offering beside of each cell.

1249
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,660
I wasn't tempted to buy one, but I was reminded that I had a boarding ticket and sat in it off to the beach.
