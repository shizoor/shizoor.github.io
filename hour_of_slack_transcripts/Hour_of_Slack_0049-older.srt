1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,120
Praise Phil!

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,560
Next.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,240
Well, friends, it's true.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,680
Robert Wisdom probably has the best musical taste of anybody at this whole station.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,140
But unfortunately for all of you, he's leaving and I'm coming in.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm going to say more about that Caravan of Dreams thing, too.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,040
That's going to open with a short subgenius devival, dear friends.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,800
Yes, indeed.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,260
I need to stick my headphones.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,280
This coming up is just to make a break here from the quality stuff.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
This is the worst song in the world, I suspect.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,800
Maybe not.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,280
There may be worse, but yes.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,020
So where did it go?

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,460
Where did it go?

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,520
Why don't I hear it?

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,500
Tape.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,160
Look at this.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, folks, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,060
I just don't know what the...

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,380
Oh, look at that.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,520
We turn up the output.

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,720
We're stepping up.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh, yes.

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh, yes.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,360
Let's do that time step and dance.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,240
Dance to the music of stepping high.

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,560
Stepping high, high in the sky.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,700
We will dance.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,800
We will sing to please you.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,160
You are stepping high, high, baby.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,360
But don't forget that I am here.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,380
You know that it is showtime.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


44
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,380


45
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,080
And it is your time.

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,960
And show must go on, baby.

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,220
Come with me.

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,060
And you will see.

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,940
We are stepping high.

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,980
What is that?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
What is the name of our show?

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,280
Stepping High.

53
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,120
Stepping.

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,600
High.

55
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,480
High, high.

56
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:23,220
Now, boys and girls, let's see if we can dance to the rhythm of stepping, leap把它

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,220


58
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,360
Stepping high, stepping, hey, now, stand still.

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,360


60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,360


61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,360


62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,360


63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,360


64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,360


65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,020
If you are ready, let's go and dance

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,340
Let's do that time step and dance

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,700
Dance to the music of stepping high

68
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,400
What did I tell you, folks?

69
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,760
Isn't that thing horrible?

70
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,440
And what a great intro song for the hour of slack.

71
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,080
You know, I don't know who did that.

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,920
I taped it off a similar station like this in New Jersey.

73
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,920
But yes, indeed, dear friends,

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,100
you have tuned in to the subgenius radio ministry

75
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,700
hour of slack here on KNON 90.9 FM

76
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,500
in Dallas, Arlington, Fort Worth.

77
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,200
I couldn't believe I was in Fort Worth earlier today

78
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,060
and could hear the station on my phone.

79
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,060


80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,380
My cheesy car radio.

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,040
That was an inspiring thing to discover.

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,540
This is another one of those slackless hours of slack.

84
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,000
That job, that job just won't stop.

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,420
They never stop, friends.

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,220
Oh, yes, but the power can come for one hour a week.

87
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,940
And, yeah, as I said,

88
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,080
just signing off last week, folks,

89
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,580
we were lying about not making any money on that pledge drive.

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,280
We actually did really well.

91
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,300
I couldn't believe it.

92
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,900
We raised about a thousand bucks.

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,380
And I want every, those of you who pledged

94
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,840
had better make good on that thing.

95
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,700
Buddy, I'm telling you, because last time I didn't.

96
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:13,760
Ugh.

97
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,900
Tonight's show is going to be a puzzling evidence show.

98
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,380
Folks.

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,980
.

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,640
And photos of.

101
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,140
.

102
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,140


103
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,780
.

104
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:32,880
.

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,980
.

106
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,980


107
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,980


108
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,980


109
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,980


110
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,000
.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,080
.

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,140
And yes, indeed, we had some incredible fallout from that last show, that Pledge Drive show.

113
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,620
I know many of you are waiting to hear what happened with my date with the $200 sex change pledger.

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,460
It didn't happen. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. It didn't happen. There was no way it was going to happen.

115
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,980
And I don't think we ever did see that mighty $200 pledge.

116
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,640
So maybe we didn't really make a thousand, but we did really good.

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,080
And thank you, the money-paying listeners out there.

118
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,120
Oh, yes. And boy, we had a hate caller that kept calling all night long.

119
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,260
He refused to turn his radio off. He just had to listen to that which he hated the most.

120
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,520
And of course, we had those that loved us.

121
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,700
In fact, one guy, last week, we actually had to tell him not to give us any money

122
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,820
because he was drunk as can be and wanted to give the station,

123
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,560
because he loved the Hour of Slack so much that night,

124
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,580
he wanted to give us...

125
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,260
He wanted to give us all his worldly goods, all the money in his checkbook.

126
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
Praise Bob. And we talked him out of it.

127
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,900
Can you believe it? I don't know what came over us.

128
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,300
It was kind of embarrassing, too, because the station manager walked by right in time to hear Dr. Grant say,

129
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,720
No, don't send any money here.

130
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,320
We had a caller who got really upset about playing Lee Harvey Oswald was a friend of mine

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,020
by Homer Henderson and the Dal Worthington Garden Boys.

132
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,060
And see, it's not that we...

133
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,900
We think it's great that Kennedy got shot, although even if we did, it's none of your bizwax.

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,660
It's just that we don't think Oswald did it.

135
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,900
But we'll be getting deeper into that subject a little later,

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,560
because as I said, it's the Puzzling Evidence Night.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,980
But, dear friends...

138
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,820
Oh, listen to those alien...

139
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,000
Computers jabbering at each other.

140
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,020
How insipidly stupid.

141
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,480
Well, I can talk...

142
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,980
We got a subgenius devival coming up, a short one, at the Caravan of Dreams.

143
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,880
And what...

144
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,720
It's really what it is, is me opening up, doing an opening sermon and invocation

145
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,540
and healing and sickening ceremony for...

146
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,120
to open up this Caravan of Dreams performance art show.

147
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,460
If you can imagine that.

148
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,860
Performance art!

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,740
Oh, we can't have our own church here.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,560
Nay!

151
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
We gotta have...

152
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,000
They have to call it, quote,

153
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,660
performance art, unquote.

154
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,020
But that's this Friday night at the Caravan of Dreams in Fort Worth.

155
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,400
And I can talk about this, because even though it costs six bucks to get in,

156
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,020
I'm giving my money, my pay, all six or seven bucks,

157
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
as a donation...

158
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,520
As a donation to K-N-O-N.

159
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,380
And, uh...

160
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,540
So there's gonna be a lot...

161
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,260
I'd say, who all...

162
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,520
John Hale, a bunch of...

163
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,040
There'd be some weird stuff going on, but the first...

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,580
First, right off the bat, 8 o'clock at the Caravan of Dreams this Friday night.

165
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,240
Caravan of Dreams in Fort Worth on 312 Houston Street.

166
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,100
Right off of I-30.

167
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,120
We're gonna start the thing off with a subgenius devival.

168
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,800
And it ought to be a pretty good one, folks,

169
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,420
because I'm gonna haul down there the giant six-foot bob heads

170
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,640
that, for those few of you who've never actually gazed upon

171
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,820
the mighty visage of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs!

172
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,360
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

173
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,300
Uh, this'll be your chance, folks.

174
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,460
Your big chance.

175
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,260
So, not only that...

176
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,720
I went to a very strange place.

177
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,160
It's called the Inner Zone,

178
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,660
in outer space.

179
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,620
When I climbed out of my golden spaceship,

180
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,540
I saw many things that would make you flip.

181
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,360
And you'll be seeing many things that'll make you flip,

182
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,380
besides the subgenius half-hour.

183
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,720
I mean, we're gonna show the subgenius video,

184
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,260
the first ten minutes of it.

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,680
That's two subgenius music video, folks.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,700
The X-rated rap song, and also, well,

187
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,320
something some of you will be quite familiar with.

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,980
Also, following the devival is...

189
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,780
And this is for real, folks.

190
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,720
J. Condom, or J. Cotton, depending on what church you go to.

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,540
J. Cotton, and also the song gods!

192
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,820
That's right, the song gods themselves.

193
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,660
The song gods themselves.

194
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:53,660


195
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,320
They play following the subgenius show

196
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,580
at this Caravan of Dreams thing.

197
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,540
Also, the show continues on Saturday night.

198
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,120
Now, I'm not gonna be there Saturday night,

199
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,400
and I don't believe the song gods are either,

200
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,780
but the producer of the show, Lainey Yarber,

201
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,620
is gonna...

202
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,840
She's doing something like...

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,100
It's like the Candace Montgomery story.

204
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,840
She was the lady who axe-murdered

205
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,420
her husband's girlfriend a few years back.

206
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,420
And I understand this show,

207
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,180
and I understand this show involves...

208
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,400
It's a very high-tech section,

209
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
the Candace Montgomery story,

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,700
including a washing machine full of body parts.

211
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
And then I woke up,

212
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,220
and I was really glad

213
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,140
that this was just another silly dream I'd had.

214
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,980
So, friends, you better show up at that thing.

215
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,520
Like I said, it's 8 o'clock Friday night

216
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,080
at the Caravan of Dreams.

217
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
That's the hippie...

218
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,540
The sort of hippie underground avant-garde

219
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,200
performance theater.

220
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,280
You know, they show William Burroughs movies

221
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,340
and all kinds of weird stuff over there.

222
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,920
It's a groovy hangout for you kind of beatnik types.

223
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,680
So the song gods and the subgeniuses,

224
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,700
and it's gonna be a killer show.

225
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,600
Well, we're gonna get on here with things.

226
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,340
God, I forgot to go pick up my co-host.

227
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,180
This is the season.

228
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,900
I turned on the Pee Wee Herman Saturday morning show

229
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,560
the other day,

230
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,080
and Bob's face is in the titles of that show.

231
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,280
Not only that,

232
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,480
but I want you to listen to this song coming up here

233
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,500
and see if you can count the subgenius references

234
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,260
in this song by this popular,

235
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,880
quote, new wave, unquote, group.

236
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,460
Here we go.

237
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,900
Here we go.

238
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:22,860
Here we go.

239
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,840
Here we go.

240
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:06,520
Here we go.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,020
Here we go.

242
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:44,840
Here we go.

243
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,180
Here we go.

244
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,920
Here we go.

245
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,400
Here we go.

See my little children

255
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,920
Like a family

256
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,360
When they live together

257
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,840
I need them home with me

258
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,660
But I hope you're not there with the one you made

259
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,380
In the land of the free and the home of the brave

260
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,100
I need you

261
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,360
Pusley, Everton

262
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,800
Pusley, Everton

263
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,080
Pusley, Everton

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,480
Pusley, I'm in your heart

265
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,840
Oh, I'm in your heart

266
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,660
Oh, I'm in your heart

267
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,660
Oh, I'm in your heart

268
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,640
Oh, I'm in your heart

269
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Oh, I'm in your heart

270
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

271
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,580
Pusley, Everton

272
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,540
Pusley, Everton

273
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,460
Pusley, Everton

274
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,880
Pusley, Everton

275
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,600
Pusley, Everton

276
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,060
Pusley, Everton

277
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,240
Well, that sort of goes, um, etc., etc., etc., just like that.

278
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,060
Um, there was a story back there.

279
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,100
behind that. By the way, somebody just called and said, when are we going to have another proper

280
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:26,960
subgenius convention in Dallas? And yeah, if somebody else wants to, what is that phone noise

281
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:35,560
doing in here? Huh? If somebody else wants to sink their money into that, that's fine with me.

282
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,600
I don't want to have another Edstock happen here. I'll tell you what though, dear friends,

283
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,800
that song that I just played. Now normally, you know, we don't play stuff like Talking Heads,

284
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,860
all the other stations play, or not on this show that frequently, but that particular song,

285
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:59,400
and I've got to tell the true story behind that because otherwise the credit will get misplaced

286
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,300
and people will think that we were copying Talking Heads rather than vice versa. Puzzling evidence,

287
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:13,140
as all of you diehards know, is the secret name of a great subgenius hierarchite in Oakland,

288
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,820
California.

289
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:24,320
Whose other code name is Unibrow, and he's like one of the main hosts and the granddaddy of

290
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,920
subgenius taping. He's also the host of the less than an hour, more than, no, less than a show,

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,440
more than an hour anti-show, which has been running for like four years in Berkeley now,

292
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:44,820
subgenius show. And so I'm going to, just because puzzling evidence has gotten more and more

293
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,680
puzzling, we're going to,

294
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:55,540
devote this hour to bits from his tapes and from the shows that he and the mighty radio doctors over there do.

295
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Haha, I just killed that noise with one press of a button.

296
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,520
I can't talk without background music. This is ridiculous.

297
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,020
Ah, yes, dear friends, I feel the power.

298
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:30,000
I want you to put your gland on the radio and feel that energy burst up through them wires, up through the flesh tubes, and into the soul gland at the bottom of your foot.

299
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,500
Anyway, as many of you know, David Byrne came to Dallas to shoot his movie True Stories.

300
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:44,580
Now, originally, there was this whole subgenius revival scene in it.

301
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:52,760
Well, it wasn't subgenius by name, but it was based on, more or less, on subgenius shows.

302
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,940
And originally, I was supposed to do an animation sequence that's shown in the background of this revival.

303
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:11,780
And the Pope of all New York, Reverend Dr. Dr. Mr. M.D. David N. Meyer, was supposed to play the preacher.

304
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,500
Well, that was all going well and good.

305
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:23,160
Until Hollywood money entered the scene, and slowly but surely, it fell by the wayside, except for all the lines and the scripts and the songs.

306
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,380
And a few little things cribbed from the mighty book of the subgenius.

307
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,100
Which is no big deal, because we've used their quotes from Talking Heads songs in the book of the subgenius.

308
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,900
But I didn't know they were from Talking Heads.

309
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,460
I didn't know where they were from.

310
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,720
Anyway, I just wanted to get that.

311
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,620
And, you know, as Bob said, I am the gun and you are the bullet, dear friends.

312
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:59,480
So be ready at any minute to ram into those who don't give you credit.

313
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,680
And you know which end to ram into.

314
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,220
Anyway, we're going to get off of this.

315
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm going to do a cart here.

316
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,040
You can tell this is one of the highly edited subgenius shows yet.

317
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,460
But it's about to turn into it.

318
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:22,300
After this cart, we're going to go into the land of the Puzzling Evidence show.

319
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,780
It's not just Puzzling Evidence.

320
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,520
It's the radio show in Berkeley.

321
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,620
Which also stars Dr. Howell.

322
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,300
The evil and verbose Dr. Howell.

323
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,480
The crazy Gary Gabrog Fran.

324
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,560
And the suckling Bob Nelson.

325
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,460
As well as...

326
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,100
Oh, there's so many of these.

327
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,380
These minor celebrities and giants of the art world.

328
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,900
I could...

329
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,240
But forget it.

330
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,820

¶¶

335
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,680
Everybody, this is the Nightman.

336
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,540
Calling from KNON 9.9 FM.

337
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,740
The home of rock and roll in Dallas, Fort Worth.

338
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,020
Monday, 7 to 9.

339
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,700
We've got Kelly and Elmo bringing you From the Hip.

340
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,260
If you're in Dallas, Fort Worth, and you dig rock and roll music.

341
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,200
Alternative rock and roll music.

342
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,660
There's only one place for you to tune to.

343
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,740
And that's KNON 9.9 FM.

344
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,040
The hottest station on the planet Earth.

345
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,060
Right here in Dallas, Fort Worth.

346
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,220
The hottest station on the planet Earth.

347
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,680
Oh, yeah.

348
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,440
All right, here's...

349
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,080
Now, get ready for some...

350
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
This is the kind of radio that you've never...

351
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,860
I don't know.

352
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,300
I mean, if you tuned in tonight to listen to music,

353
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,320
you might as well just shut it off, friends.

354
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,260
Because this is spoken word that you're going to have to listen to real close.

355
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,800
You're going to be in a different universe every 10 seconds

356
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,760
for the next 20 minutes, all right?

357
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,860
And, I mean, this is...

358
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,380
You thought you knew what surrealism was.

359
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,660
You thought you knew what Dada was.

360
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,040
You thought you knew what...

361
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,860
What Bob is.

362
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,820
Sometimes his normal size, he runs around from radio station to radio station

363
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,880
trying to show you what it is to talk about the tilting boxcar of Dobbs.

364
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,460
Bob is the real thing.

365
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,300
He came to re-fertilize your sexual preconceptions

366
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,380
to make us all relieve our reincarnality

367
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,040
in the million polyverse combinations we once enjoyed.

368
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,540
Sure, this church drips with machismo irony

369
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,580
with insanely overblown cajones.

370
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,420
This religion isn't for the amalgamation of the sexes.

371
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,600
No.

372
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,580
But it sure is as hell for the divine union of them.

373
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,100
He's Bob.

374
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,740
Everything will be just fine.

375
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,560
Look, everyone is a dream.

376
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,860
Bob don't ever change.

377
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,700
He's Bob.

378
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,920
All years will be Bob.

379
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,760
Who that Bob is to say.

380
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,760
He's Bob.

381
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,800
Bob.

382
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,380
Working on the sub-D railroad.

383
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,580
Bob don't ever change.

384
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,080
I've got a hand.

385
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,480
He's Bob.

386
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,220
He's Bob.

387
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,120
Oh, it's tough hammering these pipes.

388
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,080
Oh, where will it be Bob?

389
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,360
His pipe is the bowl with the doddle

390
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,900
that rains on the roof like fire.

391
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,480
Oh, hammer these pipes in the ground.

392
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,860
His neck is the skin with the waddle

393
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,580
in flaming folks' desire.

394
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:37,880
He's Bob.

395
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,760
How you learn to sing so good out here?

396
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,320
Just hammering pipes in the ground all day.

397
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,960
Don't make no noise.

398
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,180
Bob don't ever change.

399
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,860
He's Bob.

400
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,920
And he's got luggage with a brain.

401
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
Yes, luggage with a brain.

402
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,020
That's what Bob's got.

403
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:05,600
I first had my experience with Bob at a Bob's Big Boy on the corner of Bellevue Drive in Los Angeles, California in 1959.

404
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,940
It changed my life and I became able to open my third nostril and snort the divine word.

405
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,300
Bob's Big Boy is a man of the subgenius.

406
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:22,520
Every morning before breakfast, I find it helpful to go into my sternutition room, as we call them, and sniff up.

407
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes, violent sternutition may be observed.

408
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,340
Named after the famous sternio?

409
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:35,940
Well, yes, the famous sternio does practice sternutition, as does everyone who possesses the simple accoutrement of a handkerchief and a head full of ideas that need to be relieved.

410
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,100
Subdivide the box brain.

411
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,020
Oh, Bob, with your square little gray brain.

412
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,440
How do you use that thing?

413
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,400
It's hooked up all wrong.

414
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,660
Oh, Bob, what about this rumor that your pipe is a living organism?

415
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,860
Yes, that has invaded your brain and made everything all wrong.

416
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,700
Yeah, what about that Bob-grinning malarkey-turkey-flunky problem?

417
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,140
What about them aliens, as you say, or us aliens? We're not aliens.

418
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,560
How about it, Bob? And who's this anti-Bob? Some relation of yours? Some nepotistic cousin on the payroll end?

419
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,160
In a computer field of nerds.

420
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:12,260
We dare to question our supreme epopt-Bob because we have the freedom within the Church of the Subgenius to question even the basic verities.

421
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,940
That's right.

422
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:19,960
Like whether or not there is a Mokele and Bembe. Whether it's frog-like bellow does echo over the South American or even the African swamps.

423
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,820
Swamp? Swamps.

424
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,620
Swamps. Yes, yes, swamps.

425
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,060
Right now.

426
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,680
That's where they use it.

427
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,460
Glass Madness is in that swamp. Yes, he's gone down. There's a green hill.

428
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,520
They say the Mokele and Bembe lives in Lake Ukabalabonga, which is only four feet deep, but the creature of a considerate...

429
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:34,620
Balabumba.

430
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,500
No, Ukabalabonga.

431
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,760
Just a bunch of rubbish. These people are rubbish. Just keep walking. That's not stopping.

432
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,920
Huckabucka, huckabucka.

433
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,160
Yes, it looks like it's time to go.

434
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,940
Buy the book of the Subgenius from me.

435
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,540
I guess it's creepy.

436
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,040
Yeah, man.

437
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:55,440
Gotta go to, gotta go to, gotta go to a job. Gotta go to a job. Gotta go to a job. Gotta go to go to go to go to a job.

438
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,860
You gotta wait till seven o'clock.

439
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,980
And then I take it and let me be. I gotta pay.

440
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,380
Sure.

441
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,460
You're an Easter egg.

442
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,520
Woo!

443
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,020
Woo!

444
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,220
Gotta go to, gotta go to, gotta go to a job. Yeah, I gotta go to, gotta go to, gotta go to a job.

445
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,720
Yeah.

446
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,560
Gotta go to, gotta go to, gotta go to a job. Gotta go to, gotta go to, gotta go to a job.

447
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,320
Yeah, sure. Well, we'll find out. Good morning, Safe Muffin.

448
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,860
Howdy. I was just wondering if you could tell me...

449
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,320
Where?

450
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,040
...what those occasional extremely low...

451
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,960
...rumbling sounds that almost sound like acoustic feedback coming to my speakers are.

452
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,420
And then it happened.

453
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:53,940
Affection.

454
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,120
Oh, no! Look, it's happening!

455
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,100
Oh, yes.

456
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
And he should dabble in his coffee.

457
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
Okay, turn down your phone and turn up your mind.

458
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,060
Take off your...

459
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,620
Okay, here we go.

460
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,520
Got it. Dead center.

461
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,140
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

462
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
Well, let's hope for better practice.

463
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,960
And there, we're centered on...

464
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,320
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

465
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,020
Oh, okay. We're on the...

466
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,860
...the

467
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:45,280
Yes, this early misinterpretation of prehistory predicted the coming of Marlboro Man as a leader in the future.

468
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:55,600
Marlboro Man operated with these crude stone implements to pound the tobacco and roll the papers, which gave his caves and habitations this distinctive odor.

469
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,840
Okay, I suppose that explains it. Thank you.

470
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:10,120
It's Slotlap, talking to any tape. I know it's difficult because I've never called up a radio station before and talked to just a dumb old tape.

471
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,140
And here it is, an eight-track tape answering you.

472
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,460
Yes.

473
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,980
But you can't believe you're talking to an intelligent machine, Cleary. I know.

474
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,200
Ask any question.

475
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,500
This is your future. Your phones will act like us very soon.

476
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,260
Ask any question.

477
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,560
Bob will massage men.

478
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,320
Yes.

479
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,300
Seven, seven, six, two, four, three, eight.

480
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,100
Okay, Bob.

481
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,640
Is that your Bob?

482
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,340
That's right.

483
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:29,840
Yeah.

484
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,100
Not to mention the Weasel Men.

485
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,360
Yes, and their little teeny ones that came over the sands early in the morning without food and without tickets.

486
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,140
They stole away the picnic baskets and the babies.

487
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,200
They stole away the picnic baskets and the babies.

488
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,580
Don't say babies.

489
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,860
You know what happens when we say babies.

490
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,060
Oh, no.

491
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,700
Oh, I...

492
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,040
We're giving a mouth-to-mouth perspiration right now.

493
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,260
Hold on a second here.

494
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,900
It's your turn.

495
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Wait, there's a kitty here somewhere.

496
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,700
We're trying to find a kitty.

497
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,240
Yes, it's a cat.

498
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,880
Oh, my God.

499
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,360
I think he will.

500
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,560
Yes, it's Tristan.

501
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,020
You mean that this is one of them A.J. and Gandhi shows?

502
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,680
No.

503
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,980
I'll tell you what.

504
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,320
We all know this.

505
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,180
This is great.

506
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,200
Look at him.

507
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:22,980
Hey, what?

508
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,160
We can make him do anything.

509
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,100
We can make him just...

510
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,760
Hey, no, stay.

511
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,600
Hey, then look.

512
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,060
Don't make me do anything, man.

513
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,680
Yes, of course, Colin.

514
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,820
Anything can do me.

515
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,280
It's just a little too much to swallow, I think.

516
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Huh?

517
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,200
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


519
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


520
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


521
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


522
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


523
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


524
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,200


525
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,520
I don't think I can make him do anything.

526
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,680
Yes, I will.

527
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:58,000
All right, let's see.

528
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:04,300
Little Dr. Punto.

529
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,100
This is a little bit of a...

530
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,180
What is this?

531
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,820
Yes, I think you're right.

532
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:08,820


533
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:08,820


534
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:08,820


535
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:08,820


536
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:08,820


537
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,000
This is a little bit of a...

538
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,100
Oh, my God.

539
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,220
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


541
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


542
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


543
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


544
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


545
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


546
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


547
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,220


548
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,040
But the music always made me real sad.

549
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,940
It was just the Tijuana Bible quotes and all that stuff piled up in my soul.

550
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,120
Soon I felt guilty about what happened to Herb Albert.

551
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
You can't even talk anymore.

552
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,260
They just put Hal in this old speaker's home, I think, or something.

553
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,120
And he asked whether Hal had grown larger, stupider, and older.

554
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,440
And he thought he was on the show.

555
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,020
So, yes, we'd say, here, here's a microphone and here's some headphones.

556
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,300
And say something funny.

557
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,620
And little Hal would come out and he'd jibber and jabber.

558
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,720
And we'd take the tape.

559
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,620
We would play that stuff on KPFA.

560
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,860
No, we wouldn't do that.

561
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,180
No.

562
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,220
We'd talk about funny stuff.

563
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,500
Only poor Hal in his deranged state would try to do the charge of the light brigade in Pig Latin.

564
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,540
Hop-a-poppa-fop-a-lop-a-gop-a-wop-a-dop.

565
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,240
Hop-a-toppa-dop-a-vop-a-lop-a-yop-a-vop-a-shoppa-dop-a-wop-a-dop-a-dop.

566
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,040
Rap-a-dop-a-sop-a-dop-a-dop.

567
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,920
Hop-a-drop-a-dop-a-dop.

568
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,700
Yeah, these auditions can be time-consuming but necessary.

569
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,260
What are what like?

570
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,000
I think the problem is that we're getting a little off the beat track now.

571
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:34,420
The caller is seeming to want to distract us from the basic and bottom line that we're here to talk about.

572
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,500
Which is, of course, the puzzling evidence.

573
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,420
Which is, of course, the puzzling evidence.

574
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,000
Public whiz.

575
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,440
The right-hand picture shows the end of the new-new Stone Age.

576
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,300
New-new Stone Age.

577
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,860
Yes, here we are in the new-new Stone Age.

578
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,160
Yes, I think we should talk more about the new-new Stone Age and not be distracted by these tiny calls.

579
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,340
Yes, in the new-new Age, everybody's going to feel a little bit hinky.

580
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,620
That's to the deference that one...

581
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,080
And now we welcome our guest in a Liverpool .

582
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,080


583
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,280
Finally that family.

584
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,400
Yes I

585
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,560
Was

586
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,020
Defending

587
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,520
Go

588
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:25,780
I

589
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,600
the reason why I'm always useful is that mostación production can't communicate the NOT انين tudUT piano personne

590
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,520
Preacher, you're masterful controller for those two hours which you cannot escape.

591
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,980
And you will listen to Radio Soiree Thursdays at midnight until 2 a.m.

592
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,220
or come under the sudden threat of instant vaporization.

593
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,160
You have been warned.

594
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,700
Help me, somebody. She ain't got no legs.

595
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,560
My legs are on fire. Pull the lever. Down you go. Praise Bob.

596
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,080
UPS. Workers find 12 human heads in package.

597
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,800
United Parcel Service employees discovered 12 human heads when they opened a package

598
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,320
because it was leaking and the FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken.

599
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,700
This newspaper clip was sent in to us, I'm sure in reference to the

600
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,680
bleeding head of the World Cup player.

601
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:39,620
A golfer split off schism cult that split off the Church of the Subgenius in Little Rock, Arkansas.

602
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,060
Anyway, a doctor in Philadelphia said he shipped the heads to a medical training facility in Colorado.

603
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,060
But the county coroner thinks the physician should find another method of shipment.

604
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:59,380
We don't think that personnel of carriers such as UPS should be subjected to having to handle body parts

605
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,680
such as heads without being assured they're protected from any damage.

606
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,100
The UPS is a major source of infectious disease, and the handling of these body parts is a major concern.

607
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,460
These UPS workers were, quote, upset and discomforted by the fact that they'd found these human heads.

608
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,560
So, you know, any agency in this country that encounters a dead body or parts of dead bodies that they can't account for

609
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,700
ought to notify the coroner's office, folks.

610
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,500
We've got to identify these things to make sure somebody's not killing somebody.

611
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,240
So, somebody out there, you better be careful.

612
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,680
Speaking of that, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the UPS.

613
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,920
killing somebody another important piece of puzzling evidence not only important to dr howell

614
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:46,720
and and and gary gebrogfran and and uh puzzling evidence there in in oakland but also to all of

615
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,820
us here in dallas is of course the kennedy performance art piece that was done in dealey

616
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:03,920
plaza oh so many years ago and uh uh well you know it's just point in time can you believe that

617
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:12,860
one man alone couldn't assassinate john kennedy three days ahead look out now turn on the tv

618
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:21,160

619
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,540

620
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:23,800

644
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,680
now

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:23,760


647
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:23,760


648
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,560
I'm terrified. I don't enjoy feeling temporary.

649
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,040
And for many of you, following common sense safety precautions

650
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,660
could mean the difference between the vacation of your life

651
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,780
and the last vacation of your life.

652
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,160
For maximum protection, all doors and windows should be part of the alarm system.

653
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,600
And LBJ said, let us continue.

654
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,800
And they continued.

655
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,520
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

656
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,180
And LBJ said, let us make war on poverty.

657
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,880
And lo, there were welfare checks fallen upon the land.

658
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,300
And upon them it was writ, fold not, neither shall ye spindle nor mutilate.

659
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,400
And LBJ saw that it was good.

660
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,120
Very strange happenings, you know.

661
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,360
And...

662
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,860
And...

663
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:20,780
And...

664
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


665
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,700
If there'd been something legitimate there and I could have seen

666
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,440
exactly what was going on, I guess I really would have

667
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,280
done my best.

668
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,540
But there wasn't nothing I could do, you know.

669
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,280
You understand? You know?

670
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,800
You're on my side.

671
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,240
Well, anyway, the point is, is that, however, a lot of the kinds of things

672
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,140
that people have brought up about the Warren Commission

673
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,680
and about the Kennedy assassination have sort of gotten tilted off into this area,

674
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,560
the area of the fringe participants.

675
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,780
And as we...

676
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,280
As we stated at the earlier part of the show,

677
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,660
and as we're going to prove conclusively next week,

678
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,760
the fringe has very little to do with it.

679
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,880
Although, as with any event of any magnitude,

680
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,160
fringe groups have become attracted to it.

681
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,500
And I don't know anything about Mr. Thornley other than what we've talked about here.

682
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,920
But fringe groups certainly are attracted to events of this magnitude.

683
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,180
However, as we've stated before at the beginning of the show,

684
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,180
you either believe in the Warren Commission or you believe in the laws of physics

685
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,620
and there are no two sides to that particular street.

686
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,380
It is strictly a one-way voyage.

687
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,820
Anyway, so I hope that we can put the Church of the Subgenius to bed with that.

688
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,500
In fact, why don't we formally do it?

689
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,600
I'll state right here, if you want to talk about the Church of Subgenius,

690
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,400
call up Bob Nelson and talk to him about it.

691
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,100
Don't bother us with that nonsense anymore.

692
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,140
Call the Church of the Subgenius.

693
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,060
Anyway, back to the phone.

694
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,420
Yeah, call the Church of the Subgenius.

695
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,140
No way, friend.

696
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:47,520
You know, assassination is a big part of our government, really.

697
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,100
And, you know,

698
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,480
the Church is a patriotic group.

699
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,800
This is...

700
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,140
You know, I got a call from somebody earlier that said,

701
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,780
Reverend Stang, we were worried hearing you play talking heads.

702
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,660
We thought maybe you were really selling out.

703
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,400
Well, I'm gonna play another ex-pop group, and that's Devo.

704
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,320
But I can because they're dues-paying members of the Church of the Subgenius, friends.

705
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,460
I can make free records in the ou-

706
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,800
Do not you have a

707
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:37,800


708
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:47,920
Da, c'mon.

709
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,380
You're arowing?

710
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:49,380


711
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:49,460
R앙 đ riseau chi.

712
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,060
Good.

713
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,360
Let me tell you why.

714
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm a man with a mission.

715
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,280
A boy with a gun.

716
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,500
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one.

717
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,240
I'm an absolute winner on the radio.

718
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,520
With my microphone, I do a super show.

719
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,180
I wear a cowboy hat.

720
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,660
It is my business hat.

721
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,140
I'm on to one of them.

722
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,660
I must tell you that.

723
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm a man with a mission.

724
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,660
A boy with a gun.

725
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,920
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one.

726
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,520
Who doesn't know?

727
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,020
I'm a big mess.

728
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,740
I mean a really big mess.

729
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,820
A big, big mess.

730
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,200
He was all mixed up.

731
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,420
And a big mess.

732
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,820
Big mess.

733
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,880
He was a.

734
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,300
He was really mixed up.

735
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,580
He was a big mess.

736
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,940
Big mess.

737
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,980
He was a.

738
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
He was really mixed up.

739
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,240
Big mess.

740
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,120
He was a.

741
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,320
He was a.

742
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,380
He was a.

743
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


744
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


745
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


746
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


747
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


748
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


749
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


750
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


751
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


752
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,380


753
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,620
I want him I am.

754
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,680
This new reality.

755
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,580
The most important thing.

756
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,200
I put away my toys.

757
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,440
With my microphone.

758
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
I do a super show.

759
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm an absolute winner on the radio.

760
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,120
I'm a man with a mission.

761
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,160
A boy with a gun.

762
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,640
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one.

763
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,340
A lucky one.

764
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,080
Who doesn't know?

765
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm a big mess.

766
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,240
I mean a really big mess.

767
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,300
A big, big mess.

768
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,720
He was all mixed up.

769
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,900
And a big mess.

770
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,360
Big mess.

771
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,440
He was a.

772
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,820
He was really mixed up.

773
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,020
He was a big mess.

774
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,480
Big mess.

775
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,420
He was a.

776
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,960
He was really mixed up.

777
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,260
I'm a man with a mission.

778
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,320
A boy with a gun.

779
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,500
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one.

780
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,060
Let's go.

781
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,660
I'm a big mess.

782
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,480
I mean a really big mess.

783
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,460
A big, big mess with all things love and all.

784
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,660
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

785
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:20,880
You know, it only takes one vote to put somebody out of office these days,

786
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,480
as long as that vote is coated in lead.

787
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,800
Not that we recommend that you vote that way,

788
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,660
but I have a feeling that some of our most respected citizens have arranged that very thing.

789
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,020
Doesn't that bless your heart?

790
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,860
Well, since we've been name-dropping like crazy on this show tonight,

791
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,160
and that's okay because the Church of the Subgenius

792
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,640
recruits...

793
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,420
We recruit celebrities because we need money,

794
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,280
and people, you know, nowadays,

795
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,060
so many people, they can't take anything at face value.

796
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,700
They can't believe that it could be good because they themselves think it good.

797
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,080
Oh, no, no, they've got to have somebody on television

798
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:10,560
or on their demonic back-masked records tell them that it's good, you know?

799
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,400
Just ask John Lennon or any other assassinated,

800
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,360
and they'll tell you the same thing, baby.

801
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:39,560
Thank you, John.

802
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,980
Oh, yes, that beautiful.

803
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,660
It was all mixed up, friends.

804
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,380
It's a problem these days.

805
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,960
Businesses, don't forget the KNON scrapbook.

806
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,060
You can support KNON and attract new customers to your business by advertising in our KNON scrapbook.

807
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,900
20,000 copies of each issue are distributed throughout town and sent to all KNON supporters.

808
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:38,240
To find out about our reasonable rates and to place your ad, call Phyllis Arp at KNON 828-9500.

809
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,440
And I'm going to make sure tomorrow.

810
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,560
I'm going to make sure tomorrow that there's some of those things down at the studios at Las Colinas

811
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,320
so that people can pick them up in the lunchroom there.

812
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,880
Well, that was Reverend Chris Gross.

813
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,080
Here it said low.

814
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,400
And here it said high.

815
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,960
Yeah.

816
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,400
Chris, Dr. Herr Dr. Gross tells us more and more.

817
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,400
But you know, our lead story tonight,

818
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,800
Dee and Daniel Sweeney hired cameraman Dennis Carroll to videotape their Brandon.

819
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,140
Florida wedding.

820
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,060
When Carroll delivered the finished tape,

821
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:19,940
the Sweeneys discovered that following the wedding sequence was 70 minutes of Carroll nude playing with himself.

822
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,580
He had mistakenly taped the wedding over a personal tape.

823
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:28,280
So those of you people who videotape weddings out there, which I've had to do in the past,

824
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,780
just be careful now.

825
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,860
Also, these little news items here, I'm going to get through back to puzzling evidence pretty quick here.

826
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,100
But these are very interesting.

827
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,460
It's from.

828
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,400
It's from a little newsletter called View from the Ledge,

829
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,020
which for those of you taping right for information from P.O.

830
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,480
Box 57141 Washington, D.C.

831
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,520
Two oh oh three seven.

832
00:46:53,240 --> 00:47:03,580
Two two hundred thousand used bras were blessed in Tokyo when Buddhist priest used the brassieres in a temple memorial service for cast off underwear in Tokyo.

833
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,420
The abandoned bras were heaped in a big pyramid for blessing and pouring rain outside the main doors of the.

834
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,400
The wooden temple in the center of Tokyo.

835
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,080
South Burlington, Vermont.

836
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:25,840
Police yesterday had no idea who stole a life sized big boy statue from its display at a hamburger restaurant, shot it in the head and dumped it in some nearby woods.

837
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:33,900
And this is Captain Ray McGee found the 50 year old big boy covered in branches in woods behind the restaurant.

838
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,680
He had been shot in the head right in the ear.

839
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,040
Is there no respect?

840
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,580
Friends is nothing sacred.

841
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:50,400
Here's some items that based on articles in various medical journals, the following items have been recovered from the rectums of patients.

842
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,740
Alive, shaved, declawed, gerbil, a bottle of Mrs.

843
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,360
Butterworth syrup, an axe handle, a nine inch zucchini.

844
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,740
Now, these are all things that have been extracted from people's bodies, friends from a certain specific place.

845
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:19,200
A 14 inch vibrator with two diesel batteries, a plastic spatula, a coke bottle, an 11 inch carrot, an antenna rod, 150 watt light bulb.

846
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,820
Let's get down to the good ones.

847
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:36,460
This goes on a frozen pig's tail, a plastic toothbrush package, a 10 inch length of broomstick, an 18 inch umbrella handle, two Vaseline jars, a whiskey bottle with a cord attached.

848
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:36,720
A bottle of whiskey.

849
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:36,720


850
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:36,720


851
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:36,720


852
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:56,460
An oil can, a six by five inch toolbox, a baby powder can, a test tube, a peanut butter jar, a pair of eyeglasses, tumblers and glasses, a polyurethane waste trap from the U bend of a sink and a corborundum grinder with handle.

853
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,340
Friends, these medical facts are just amazing.

854
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,300
And here's one quote from President Reagan on psychics.

855
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,140
Quote.

856
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,420
I've found it difficult.

857
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,800
To write them off entirely.

858
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,920
The scriptures say there will be such people speaking of psychics.

859
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:19,800
And at the 1950s, actress Jackie Park said that Reagan was in bed was the worst he had ever had.

860
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,660
Mechanical.

861
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,620
The worst.

862
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,280
The worst.

863
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:22,920
Unquote.

864
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,860
Well, well, OK, back to puzzling evidence, folks.

865
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,700
This is it.

866
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,280
I've been told, you know, it's not weird.

867
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,240
Where's the.

868
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,840
Where's all the assistance?

869
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,240
Where's all the zombies?

870
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,180
Huh?

871
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,880
The one show on the planet.

872
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,800
So what if your hair falls on your right arm, sir?

873
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,140
Perhaps your nose falls off onto your feet.

874
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,460
Bob does.

875
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,400
Call me, Mr.

876
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:51,800
Dobbs.

877
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,820
Bob, is that you?

878
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,280
Yeah.

879
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,720
And what the hell's going on?

880
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,080
Nothing like a little togetherness to take care of this scrambled shell structure of mine.

881
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,600
What can we do about it in the 80s?

882
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,700
This is the scrambled shell structure.

883
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,300
This is the.

884
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:05,940
You like it?

885
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,100
Sure.

886
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,360
This point has not led to any new conclusion.

887
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,620
Try to define what exactly you've been seeing from your vantage post out there.

888
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,080
Well, it looks pretty.

889
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,060
Looks pretty terrible out here.

890
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,140
I'm trying to get a hold of Werner Klempel.

891
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:27,140
There's some guy out here in a half melted phone booth trying to dial desperately for old friends long dead.

892
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,460
Oh, that's the DJ who showed this normally is.

893
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,560
See, some of his skin's been blasted away there in the polyester shirt he was so proud of only a few minutes before.

894
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:35,880
Oh.

895
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,640
Completely melted around his chest.

896
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,700
Hey, who is this?

897
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,540
I've got you right under my armpit.

898
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:42,940
Oh, my.

899
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,940
His mind has snapped.

900
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,360
Use scopolamine if this show makes you dizzy.

901
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:46,900
Right.

902
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,100
Don't use those other pills.

903
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,960
I rubbed the ball to my feet with a quality name.

904
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,420
You're welcome.

905
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,500
You're the greatest star of all.

906
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,420
I don't care how much money you make, Tobin.

907
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,720
I won't listen to this fucking music.

908
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,520
Oh, no, no, no.

909
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,280
He was completely surrounded by a bevy of 14-year-old girls all dressed up in Brady Bunch outfits.

910
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:03,820
Yeah.

911
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,520
Actually, I just couldn't believe it.

912
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,420
I never thought a guy like him would be able to attract such a crowd of willing TV females.

913
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,460
But there they are, drinking that TV water and hanging out with a little neat guy.

914
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,900
It takes about a month to get a car.

915
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,240
Yes.

916
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,560
It's true.

917
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,260
I know what will bring him back.

918
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,600
Yes, hell, we're in some serious trouble now.

919
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,000
It was time for the doctors.

920
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,440
Oh, no.

921
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,540
And ladies, we're operating tonight.

922
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,940
New patient coming in every hour.

923
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,420
Oh, here comes the asthmatic.

924
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,500
Let's cut out his legs.

925
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,680
Oh, here comes the heart patient.

926
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,820
Let's cut out his heart.

927
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,900
Hand me that scalp.

928
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:38,960
Oh, look at this guy.

929
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:39,660
He's got broken legs.

930
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,780
It's the doctors.

931
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,240
Oh, oh, watch out.

932
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,560
This is the film that was supposed to be run right as the bomb was happening.

933
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,480
This is a very pleasing film and calming.

934
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,440
You can see here that...

935
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,940
Yes, they called this one the sex bomb, and it itself was responsible for much of the

936
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,460
dismay we've seen this evening.

937
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,560
Never mind.

938
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,300
Skip from your bones.

939
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,000
Some say Smith and some say Jones, and either one will skip the screen for your bones.

940
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,340
Some say back and some say way, but it just makes two halves of my brain break.

941
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:09,560
Right.

942
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,060
Welcome to Dr. Ranch.

943
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:11,660
Yes.

944
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,560
What about a little stop there, and I'll just cut out that fibrostic tumor.

945
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:16,540
Come on in here.

946
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:16,780
Here goes.

947
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,260
This is pretty amazing here.

948
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,660
Bring me that sigmoidoscope.

949
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,260
I want, I want to take a look.

950
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,620
You know where.

951
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,120
This is sigmoid colon and his brother, the descending semicolon.

952
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,620
The elevator operator at Sisters of Mercy appears of Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

953
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,380
Oh.

954
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:33,840
Oh.

955
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:34,980
Oh.

956
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


957
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


958
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


959
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


960
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


961
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


962
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


963
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:34,980


964
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,740
Nurse, nurse, nurse, bring me another shot please.

965
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,860
Got it dead center.

966
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,740
As you can see, it's a modern, highly up-to-date facility.

967
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,940
Yes, and using every kind of doctor-prescribed device.

968
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,760
If a doctor needs it, they buy it.

969
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,740
This floor is the exclusive obnoxio-pirosis ward.

970
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,940
Floor three, pills.

971
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,760
Let's step in, shall we?

972
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,240
Chainsaw and operations.

973
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,940
Will the honor of a large German shepherd please come to the salt flats behind the hospital.

974
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,640
Thank you.

975
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,200
Yes, here the doctors work in complete comfort, sometimes ignoring the patients altogether.

976
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,120
They operate with the newest tools.

977
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,040
Here's where the doctors kick back.

978
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,260
It's the luxury lounge in Beguineville.

979
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,180
Yes, these are the transport.

980
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,960
On Vibes, you see Dr. Spiegelman and there's Dr. Clutterhouse over there on drums.

981
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,880
Okay, folks, now back out onto Dr. Highway.

982
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,760
Wow.

983
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,360
Whoa.

984
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,340
That's right.

985
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,740
Flying high over Oakland now.

986
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:33,920
Just a little bit.

987
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,320
We're discovering there is a false bottom to the container and the death ship drops

988
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,200
its load.

989
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,080
What's this?

990
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,600
It's better than the...

991
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,940
It's deadly bacteria over in the Bay Area.

992
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:49,780
And now you see the Subjection kitchen as they cook the morning meal.

993
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,380
We're going to mix up our pre-holocaust breakfast.

994
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,620
Because all the bacteria are dead, too.

995
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,900
It's all right, but it's a lot easier to cook things.

996
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,360
You're at the cafeteria about to eat something.

997
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,380
No, you just set it out and it cooks itself.

998
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,600
You gave me plenty of rest.

999
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:03,760
Yes.

1000
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,340
They always draw the furniture into the circle when you do that, but there's a way to get

1001
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,240
over that circle.

1002
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:09,760
Fire arrows.

1003
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,240
Sofas with a flaming arrow.

1004
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,380
Something was missing from Little Napa Caller's menu.

1005
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,460
It was the tuba.

1006
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,300
So we put it in here on the show.

1007
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,240
If you're listening, you can put it on your sandwich and have it just the way you wanted

1008
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,540
it there.

1009
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:21,760
Ah.

1010
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:22,720
Yes.

1011
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,180
And if you have a four-channel stereo, put the tuba on the front.

1012
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,260
Ah.

1013
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,100
Little tiny Wotans in the background.

1014
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:33,580
Oh, yes.

1015
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:33,580


1016
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:33,580


1017
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,520
It's true.

1018
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,440
Ah, yeah.

1019
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,180
Here we go now.

1020
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,340
I think I'll practice that.

1021
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,240
This is the Relax Show, so don't get too upset.

1022
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,960
Yeah, just lay back on the bed.

1023
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:47,840
And they were able usually to understand the flaming arrow and turn it to their own advantage.

1024
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,020
Then you have to think of yet another weapon.

1025
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,760
Come on, guys.

1026
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,420
Let him talk.

1027
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,060
Let him talk.

1028
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,560
Which one?

1029
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,760
You know, I never thought atomic war would be so much fun, guys.

1030
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,040
Well, you know, we heard about nuclear winter.

1031
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,520
Nobody heard about nuclear toaster.

1032
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,560
We have an atomic toaster out there.

1033
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:03,560


1034
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,920
We're talking about nuclear winter sports, and I'm going out for the downhill skiing.

1035
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,680
Yes, here, the downhill fallout skiing.

1036
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,720
You can see the contestants for the Olympics are so...

1037
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,800
Yes, on their flaming skis.

1038
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,500
Whoosh, whoosh.

1039
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,180
There they go.

1040
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,580
And then they race towards the shelter.

1041
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,140
And then they miss the rod to turn around and smash their face on the bottom of the

1042
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:20,340
run.

1043
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,460
Of course, each contestant only can survive one run, but it is a fabulous show of final

1044
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,520
surge of energy of humankind as we...

1045
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,200
Losing their hair in the wind as they fly down gun barrel.

1046
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,820
Yes.

1047
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,360
And they're so optimistic in the face of eternal darkness.

1048
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,260
And now...

1049
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,120
Is she a nun, by the way?

1050
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:42,800
Yes.

1051
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,300
No.

1052
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:43,460
Oh, no.

1053
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,620
None of the above, right?

1054
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,740
No, it's just the way it is.

1055
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,600
It's always contradictory.

1056
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,840
I'm a reverend, reverend dominatrix.

1057
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,200
Let's go to it first.

1058
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,660
It's cool.

1059
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,700
Food, food monsters.

1060
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,280
Yes, the food monsters were on the prowl through the studio, eating all the old hamburger

1061
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,900
stubs and the leftover hot dog buns.

1062
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,280
The food monsters.

1063
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:03,540
The food monsters.

1064
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1065
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1066
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1067
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1068
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1069
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1070
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1071
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1072
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1073
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,540


1074
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,820
The food monsters.

1075
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,320
Yeah, thank you.

1076
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Well, this is the last time we play this club.

1077
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,340
They don't give you enough to eat.

1078
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,420
I want royalties.

1079
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,140
I want dessert.

1080
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,620
I want post-brandy liqueurs.

1081
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,760
I want the best cognac and, you know, the whole shot.

1082
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,080
Thank goodness.

1083
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,740
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're with us, because it's fun to be the only thing

1084
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,520
keeping somebody alive.

1085
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,100
Really?

1086
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,020
Yes, sir.

1087
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,560
We're going to be having a news feature more ways than you think, listen.

1088
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,100
We're speaking now called From the Brow, so if you have a subject you'd like the Brow

1089
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,540
to speak on, just ask the Brow.

1090
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:41,440
The nasal passages are cemented shut and the brain is pulled out and stored in a little

1091
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,180
jar overnight.

1092
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,860
Yet the patient lives.

1093
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,600
Oh, there it goes.

1094
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,000
Well, I dropped the jar, but the patient lives.

1095
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
The patient lives.

1096
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,460
All because of the ministrations of the good brofram and the special plastic implement

1097
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,220
they use shown here.

1098
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,940
And now we'll show you that technique once again.

1099
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,040
Dr. Brofram?

1100
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,800
Yes.

1101
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:08,540
We hope to welcome you all tonight to the fervid celestial spoutings of the inner epops

1102
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,460
and clockwork workings of the Church.

1103
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,620
But this task will not be easy.

1104
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,720
The fruits of the subgenius plant are not as cordial to the taste as others may be,

1105
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,740
kind of mucilaginous paste.

1106
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,720
But it's easy to become tangentially twisted along precarious paths that have nothing to

1107
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,780
do with the straight path.

1108
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,720
And the true direction of our search.

1109
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,040
We are born with the Dobbs nature.

1110
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:45,060
However, only exist technology can complete a subgenius's transfiguration into overmanhood

1111
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,080
or overwomanliness.

1112
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:52,960
And so far, Bob has allowed this to happen to one solitary guinea pig, his friend, Dr.

1113
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,560
Philo Drummond.

1114
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,260
Where?

1115
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,260
God damn it!

1116
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,560
My man was born with original slack.

1117
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,760
Yet most civilized people don't believe it.

1118
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,760


1119
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,760


1120
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,760


1121
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,500
And the most learned scholar can't even comprehend it.

1122
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,020
Well, I've studied the Saurian stage in human evolution.

1123
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,560
As it turns out, many of our ancestors are not the primates as commonly thought, but

1124
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,640
the theropod line of the great archosaurs of the Mesozoic.

1125
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:16,660
Oh, no!

1126
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:16,980
Look out!

1127
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,180
Get him out of here!

1128
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,720
Oh!

1129
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,460
Bohandas is approaching Tokyo!

1130
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,300
We will have to get away from the city now!

1131
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh!

1132
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:22,780
Oh!

1133
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:22,820
Oh!

1134
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,360
Move your karate school away from here!

1135
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,220
It does not help!

1136
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,860
We must keep Bohandas from approaching the science center.

1137
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,280
Yes, I complained that I had no starter fluid, and then I met a man who had no chainsaw.

1138
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,820
And he'll be able to fight the monster!

1139
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,020
And we will be able to protect the super racist people!

1140
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:36,720
We need to grow!

1141
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,540
We need to grow!

1142
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,440
Before the weekend!

1143
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,320
That is what we do with our troublemakers on Melton Pints.

1144
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,340
We pack them off to Monster Island, where they are buggered by prisoners.

1145
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
These creatures are something amazing.

1146
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,880
You can't imagine all the little spines and projections, the scaly outer epidermis, the

1147
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,040
rind, the wart-like sagging covering.

1148
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,440
The babies, they're not even going to...

1149
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,180
They're not going to hurt themselves anymore!

1150
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,520
...cover the outer cuticles of these critters.

1151
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,160
They're really a sight to see.

1152
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,640
And when they all get going, it's better than a party.

1153
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,220
It's like bobbing for apples in a giant barrel of radioactive sludge.

1154
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,660
And I only wish every one of you...

1155
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:18,280
...movie that's swept America is one entitled The Encounters of the Third Degree.

1156
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,620
May I tell you this?

1157
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,520
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

1158
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,780
I don't know if I believe them or not.

1159
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,640
I don't think someone's beenרים to zero the quènifism of them.

1160
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,120
Because quarantine is important.

1161
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,800
Of course it is.

1162
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,160
But there was the apparent exception of a Rs wound in my arm.

1163
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:42,160


1164
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:42,160


1165
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,860
Why don't you feel free to add emotion at Google von Kassie, the 1971 persona, to

1166
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,260
ask for her life on her sh Anton's tattoo of EntomDerbarabin, the ACL being worn up

1167
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,260
on th yumi snuffporn in the air as a reproduce?

1168
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,260
We aren't paying back.

1169
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,820
What a shameless cover...

1170
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,880
Yeah, I am looking for my mother in the Bewegación missed andordo man 인 the

1171
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,620
yellow dress I found found on h Greenhouse McConnerhane and she was

1172
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:55,620


1173
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:02,620
This man could have been killed, but he didn't say or kill.

1174
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,880
It was that simple.

1175
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:14,760
So instead, you'll have everlasting life here in Happy Town.

1176
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,820
Where everything will be gratifying and free.

1177
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,540
And you'll never have to say, we can't even say it here.

1178
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,300
You cross the gates over into Bobtown.

1179
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,780
That's much better.

1180
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,120
I think it's going to be awesome here in Bobtown.

1181
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:43,020
You'll have to pay obsequious homage to the great bearded figure, Jehovah One.

1182
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:50,940
Jehovah One.

1183
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,520
Here, hold on.

1184
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:59,780
In the sky, Jehovah One presents his own history in a small slideshow that you'll be obligated to attend every day.

1185
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:13,100
And friend, you'll be obligated to attend that mighty show at the Caravan of Dreams.

1186
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:21,720
This Saturday night, like we were, or Friday night, Friday night at 8 o'clock, Caravan of Dreams, Fort Worth, Subgenius D Vival.

1187
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,360
All proceeds of...

1188
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:23,840
Mine.

1189
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,640
Go to KNON.

1190
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:30,540
And also the Song Gods and John Held and somebody else.

1191
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,240
I can't remember who.

1192
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:36,260
Anyway, friends, if you need information on the Church of the Subgenius, here's that mighty P.O. Box to write.

1193
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,300
Just write for the free information.

1194
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:45,720
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1195
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,600
I'm going to read that number again.

1196
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:52,860
That's P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1197
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,520
Praise God.

1198
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:53,720
Bob.

1199
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,120
And coming up next here is Ron Lindsey and Soul Oldie.

1200
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,200
So stay tuned for slack in pure, pure form.

1201
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,820
Praise Bob.

1202
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:41,080
And coming up next here is Ron Lindsey and Soul Oldie.
