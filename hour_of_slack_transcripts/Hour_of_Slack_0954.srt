42
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:57,660
It's

43
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,380
Have you seen Bob Dobbs personally?

44
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,420
No, I never have, and I don't think I would.

45
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,240
Strange occurrences, omens, portends follow him around.

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,420
I was reading the account the other day of the attempt to assassinate Bob.

47
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,420
It apparently took seven to eight tries and was never ultimately successful, obviously.

48
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,520
We wouldn't be here today.

49
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,840
I don't see how you could assassinate someone who's got that kind of luck.

50
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,460
Well, that would be the thing.

51
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,400
You know, things, the car wouldn't start, car alarms go off,

52
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,140
always something, some little stupid accident to get in the way.

53
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,180
Nothing, nothing, let me stress this.

54
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,880
Bob's power has nothing to do with anything conscious,

55
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,580
just with how smart he is or what he's got.

56
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,380
Bob is the luckiest man ever.

57
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,380
Well, man, I use that term loosely.

58
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,720
Entity.

59
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,500
That's why he smiles.

60
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,380
Looks like a man, got him high, got teeth, eyes, everything.

61
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,540
He's got a few more dots than the average human, but, you know, whatever.

62
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,640
We're all pixelated in some way.

63
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,120
I think he appears that way to us because he's sort of got his feet in two different realities.

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,660
At least two different realities.

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,980
At least two, so, you know, he's coming through to us.

66
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,500
There's going to be a reception problem.

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,480
That's a problem on our end, our receivers.

68
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,280
Yeah, a little static in our...

69
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,560
perceptive capabilities of our minds there.

70
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,340
Can't quite let it in.

71
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,160
You know, who knows?

72
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,760
Bob could walk right by and you'd never even notice.

73
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,200
No, just all you'd hear is this little buzz.

74
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,400
Yeah, a little buzz, maybe a slight sucking sound.

75
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,980
You'd open your wallet and have less money, even though, you know, no one had taken anything out.

76
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,740
But you'd have something stupid.

77
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,880
What does he buy with our money?

78
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,180
It's a big shell game.

79
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,420
It's a big shell game.

80
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,060
Shell, shell.

81
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,900
What does he buy with our cash?

82
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,040
Well, more souls.

83
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,220
He finances the ministry.

84
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh, oh.

85
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,300
When I...

86
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,000
When you.

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,540
Heh heh.

88
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,860
Sign over your house or your trust fund or your savings account or your stash or whatever you got.

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,720
That goes into the church coffers.

90
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,780
Bob doesn't need any of that.

91
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,220
He's lucky.

92
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,020
He's lucky.

93
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:10,500
I would be willing to wager that if Bob slept in the desert that, I don't know, some insects would crawl all over him to provide him shelter from the sun.

94
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,580
That'd be pretty...

95
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,060
He's that kind of guy.

96
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,220
He doesn't need money.

97
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
The things he needs fall into his lap.

98
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,400
Literally fall into his lap.

99
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,400
People, food, what have you.

100
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,280
It's all right there.

101
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,720
Trousers.

102
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,740
Trousers, yes.

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,640
Trousers.

104
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,460
The coin.

105
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,520
The coin.

106
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,540


107
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,360
The coin isn't an afterthought.

108
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,200
That goes to the church.

109
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,140
Uh, that's a thing for the physical world.

110
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,380
Triple your money back.

111
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,180
I mean, come or don't come, we don't care.

112
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,720
Squirt away.

113
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,280
Squirt.

114
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,360
Squirt, squirt, squirt.

115
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,420
Squirt or just squirt.

116
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,140
Or get off the pot.

117
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,800
You're lucky.

118
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,880
Because that will, uh, suppress your ability to do so.

119
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,440
To squirt?

120
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:41,720
Yes.

121
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,120
No.

122
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,740
This was all recorded months ago.

123
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,480
In case you're wondering, is that live?

124
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,360
How do they do that?

125
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,080
This was recorded months ago, possibly years ago.

126
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,700
Who knows when this will be played.

127
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,260
And then I shall come to you.

128
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,260


129
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,540
I shall offer my secret to the world with all its terrible power.

130
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,420
The nations of the world will bid for it, thousands, millions.

131
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,860
The nation that wins my secret can sweep the world with invisible armies.

132
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,260
Dirk, I want you to let my father help you.

133
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
You know how clever he is.

134
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Your father?

135
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,060
Clever?

136
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,320
You think he can help me?

137
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,140
He's got the brain of a tapeworm, a maggot beside mine.

138
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,400
Don't you see what it means?

139
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,300
Power.

140
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,860
Power to rule.

141
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,240
Power.

142
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,420
Power to make the world grovel at my feet.

143
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,920
Dirk, listen to me.

144
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,460
Listen.

145
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,000
My father found a note in your room.

146
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,560
He knows something about Mount Achein even you don't know.

147
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,240
It alters you, changes you, makes you feel differently.

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,780
Power, I said.

149
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,740
Power to walk into the gold vaults of the nations.

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
Into the secrets of kings.

151
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
Into the holy of holies.

152
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,540
Power to make multitudes run, squealing in terror at the touch of my little invisible finger.

153
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,700
Even the moon's frightened of me.

154
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,880
Frightened to death.

155
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,340
The whole world's frightened to death.

156
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,040
Ah!

157
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
You sheep.

158
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,980
Wake up.

159
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,580
You sheep.

160
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,300
Wake up.

161
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,980
You sheep.

162
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,760
Wake up.

163
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,200
You sheep.

164
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,980
Wake up.

165
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,540
You sheep.

166
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,280
Wake up.

167
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,860
You sheep.

168
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,840
You are asleep.

169
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,060
Wake up.

170
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,500
You sheep.

171
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,220
Wake up.

172
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,800
You sheep.

173
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,440
Wake up.

174
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,140
Wake up, you sheep.

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Why do you sleep?

176
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,760
Wake up, you sheep.

177
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,840
Wake Up, You Sheep, Part 1 by Regan Spolin.

178
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,760
Dear friends, more of that to come.

179
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,840
And before that, the invisible stang.

180
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,920
And an introduction by Lee Moore and me, your host.

181
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:27,560
This hour of slack number 954 is an hour of 7X day recordings.

182
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:35,020
Priceless historical moments from the subgenius end of the world preparations held recently.

183
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,700
Plus quite a bit of puzzling evidence radio material from KPFA.

184
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,680
In Berkeley.

185
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,740
As well as readings by the Lymphnode Institute folks at WREK Atlanta.

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,420
From the book of the subgenius.

187
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,460
Yes, friends, lots of doctrinal material interspersed with the...

188
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,260
Well, what's really going to be kind of a laid back show.

189
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,940
Like 7X day itself was.

190
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,020
Not very political of a show this particular time.

191
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,300
Just slack.

192
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,780
Just slack.

193
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,360
Random slack.

194
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Like life at its best.

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,420
This music in the background, by the way, is Acid Corpse.

196
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,160
At 7X day, there'll be more of that.

197
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,620
But most importantly of all, friends, we have details coming up on the Tensor Compressor Shorts.

198
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,320
Get support where you need it the most with these Tensor Compressor Shorts.

199
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,920
So how long is X day these days?

200
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,780
X day is about five days.

201
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,720
A week of fun.

202
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,740
Now get that sound, man.

203
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,820
Non-stop.

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,620
Non-stop fun.

205
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
Are you talking about this sound?

206
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,640
The death march of fun.

207
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,880
Certainly that's the way Modemac felt.

208
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,680
He was unable to relax and enjoy.

209
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,520
But he was the first one to produce an X day report, which is available on the internet now.

210
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,640
I think I could probably pull up Modemac's report.

211
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,560
That would be interesting.

212
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,040
And then you could read from it.

213
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,340
But I'd have to get up out of my seat.

214
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,620
I'm too lazy to do that.

215
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,540
Well, there's a handle.

216
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm not too lazy.

217
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,860
I'm just conserving energy.

218
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,400
Who you gonna call?

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,120
Bob Busters.

220
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,220
You know, I don't think anyone really is interested in an old, jizzly X day anyway.

221
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,880
We're firing back the little sub-deenies as they come up the hill.

222
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,680
Something strange in your neighborhood.

223
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,700
When you see the whites in their eyes.

224
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,200
Who you gonna call?

225
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,900
Bob Busters.

226
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,420
Bob Busters.

227
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
You saw, um...

228
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,960
You were playing something earlier this evening which was rather interesting.

229
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,900
Not only the X day.

230
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,220
Bob Busters.

231
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,020
Action-magic band, but also...

232
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,680
They're busting Bob right now.

233
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,720
They're busting his chops.

234
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,420
Oh, those are his chops.

235
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,100
Those are his chops hanging out like that.

236
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,740
Man.

237
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,120
Yeah.

238
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,820
Terrible, terrible.

239
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,680
Bob chops.

240
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,000
Look how big they are.

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,460
Whoa!

242
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,360
That's hideous.

243
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,540
People are grabbing for them.

244
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,160
People are hanging onto his chops now.

245
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,400
Throwing them in the fire.

246
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,100
They're gonna have...

247
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,940
Bob chops.

248
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,200
Will somebody answer that phone?

249
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,800
Can anybody get it?

250
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:11,840
Can anybody get it?

251
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,180
Can anybody get the license plate number?

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,480
People...

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,240
Oh well.

254
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,720
Well...

255
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,860
Oh well.

256
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,880
Well.

257
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,040


258
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,220
Well...

259
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,040
This is an excerpt from chapter 8 of the book of the subgenius, Your Subgenius Heritage.

260
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,340
This is the precursor to the interview with The Overman.

261
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,100
This is the pure doctrine on evolution.

262
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,880
Some geniuses came from a better world, and they're going to avoid it.

263
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


264
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


265
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


266
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


267
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


268
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


269
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


270
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


271
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


272
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


273
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


274
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:51,360
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight, on some evening in late 1998 or later, into overmen and overwomen.

275
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:05,060
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pigs who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels as mere humans for the last million years or so.

276
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:20,640
The goal of any subgenius, besides slack, is to somehow live until 1998 or later, when he or she will be changed into what might as well be a superhero, possessed of mental and bodily powers practically unknown to man today.

277
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:33,460
If you cleave to Bob, you will see magic come to pass in your life. However, only excess technology can complete a subgenius' transfiguration into overmanhood or over-womenliness.

278
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,040
And so far, Bob has been a superhuman.

279
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Bob has allowed this to happen to only one solitary guinea pig, his friend, Dr. Philodrummond.

280
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,100
But someday, when the angelic host descends, we will all make this great leap into tomorrow.

281
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,080
It is important that we know what lies ahead.

282
00:10:50,520 --> 00:11:00,720
Then, after we have been given doctorhood in Dobbs Town, after our initiation in the Exos rescue ships, what is this fabled overman?

283
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,780
Overmania is a changed physique.

284
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,040
Yes, it is.

285
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:11,520
The huge cranium, the permanent smile, the powers of flight and invisibility, the great power of command.

286
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,940
But it is far more than that.

287
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,560
Above all, it is a state of mind.

288
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
All subgenii, no matter their racial background, are kin.

289
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:33,040
We, as a world cult, are bonded together by mere threads, but they are threads of titanium steel forged in the minds of Jupiter, for the link of blood is the strongest.

290
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:44,260
We are Wotan's prime breeding stock, and no matter how different in shade our skin colors may be, we carry in our DNA a common code.

291
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,040
A tracking device, so to speak, implanted by our monster lord, years, so many millions of years ago.

292
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,160
Humans lacked this code and have tried to snuff it for millennia.

293
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,760
At their beginnings in antiquity, the humans, a wild nomadic, pre-subgenius race, reverted to civilization.

294
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,020
We are Wotan's prime breeding stock, and no matter how different in shade our skin colors may be, we carry in our DNA a common code. A tracking device, so to speak, implanted by our monster lord, for the link of blood is the strongest.

295
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,000
Our civilization accepts the conspiracy rule.

296
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:21,680
As crocheting an arch on the ground first, and then a

297
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:30,760
ray of old rearing the spoon, the human beings of Yukon Administration accept the conspiracy rule.

298
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,000
Every subgenie in the Jewish system paid ologjis on people Randus I Strahan, orように

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,320
especially Bob's.

300
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,700
Secular humanism,

301
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,580
the awful theory of evolution,

302
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
can now be challenged.

303
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,900
Understand, however,

304
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,180
that we are not descended from humans.

305
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,520
In fact, man is not really even descended from the ape.

306
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,900
Man, humans, and subs alike preceded the monkey.

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,520
It began shortly after the Elder Gods

308
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,920
forced the Exes to exterminate the dinosaurs.

309
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,220
At this time, the stark fists of all the gods

310
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,100
smote a tiny monkey-like mammal called Primo Anthropocus

311
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,440
and split his gene line into two.

312
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,960
One, a seriously flawed attempt called Australopithecus,

313
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,000
which, under Jehovah One's occasional smiting,

314
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,580
evolved into the modern human.

315
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,100
And another, the true Atlanteans homo directus,

316
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,560
of whom the first was the first Bob.

317
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,100
There are still full-blooded Atlanteans in the world,

318
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
now called Zugarians in their own tongue.

319
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,500
They inhabit the Lost Glass City of Chang'e,

320
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,280
on the ice plateau that time forgot

321
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,620
in the least accessible reaches of Tibet.

322
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,220
Bob's advisors on the Council of None dwell in this place.

323
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,300
Lymph Node Institute, from WREK in Atlanta,

324
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,480
reading from the Lymph Node Institute.

325
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,340
From the Book of the Subgenius,

326
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,460
and now Acid Corpse, live!

327
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,560
Dance of the Midget Dwarves.

328
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,680
This is Dance of the Midget Dwarves?

329
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,760
That's small.

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,080
Stumpy likes the Midget Dwarves.

331
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,360
The Midget Dwarves make Stumpy feel tall and big.

332
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,240
The made of happily,

333
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,860

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,180

361
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:33,880
the guy who shot J.R. Bob Dobbs on that stage in San Francisco that black January night.

362
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,900
It's very, very painful for me too, Ivan.

363
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,780
Some people collect original paintings. They collect original tapes even from studio masters.

364
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,620
These are the original teeth of the artist.

365
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,740
And although I would be the first to say...

366
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,960
You could not get any closer to the actual artist than the lungs or the brain.

367
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,400
Puzzling evidence may not be the same.

368
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,340
And we hope to offer those soon.

369
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
But these are like a saint's relics in value.

370
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,960
Surely there's a lap dance to be offered up for these, but slightly bucked.

371
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,280
In fact, ship Mark Clark...

372
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,220
They're scary looking, in fact.

373
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,840
It's a pity that we don't have a close-up camera so you could see these incisors.

374
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,840
But we already have a $10 bid.

375
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,940
I think that recognizes that this is no Jim Crow.

376
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,280
This is a crack item from a 5 and 10 cent store.

377
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,460
These are off... These can be authenticated by shoving them into the skull of Doug Wellman himself.

378
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,420
Remember, when you own these, you'll own something that all your boyfriends will want and all your girlfriends will secretly admire.

379
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,600
$15!

380
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,740
All right.

381
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,740
$15. We have a $15 bid on the Wellman's two front incisors.

382
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,940
Friends, just the amount of HabaFrop Zipulops that has been sucked past these front teeth...

383
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,280
in the time that Wellman had them...

384
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,240
will last you the light weight for a year.

385
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,420
We had a $15 bid on these teeth, these tusks of puzzling evidence.

386
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,660
Elephant ivory goes for a lot of money, friends.

387
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,540
This is subgenius ivory.

388
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,480
These are the teeth of the gentleman known as... once known as the handsome subgenius.

389
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,980
Well, women seemed to think so.

390
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,820
Those were the days.

391
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,600
Otherwise called the brow.

392
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,220
Unibrow himself. We wished that we could offer the brow, the rug-like, shaggy brow.

393
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,120
Strikingly possessed of a single eyebrow running across his face like an orthographic symbol

394
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:41,380
and paralleling the enormous mustache, which was, until recently, a blind behind which lurked these very teeth.

395
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,060
$16 so far.

396
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,440
$16 is the bid.

397
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,760
No, $17.

398
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,960
No, $17. Yes, that's correct.

399
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,800
$20.

400
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,280
$20.

401
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,360
$20.

402
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
The same price of the cost of a...

403
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,300
$20.

404
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,160
See, that's not OK to membership, friends.

405
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,280
We heard the price just went down.

406
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,460
It still costs $10 more to be a member of the church of the subgenius.

407
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:58,780
That's right.

408
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,160
$20 going once.

409
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,920
$20 going twice.

410
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,220
Sold!

411
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,320
For $20 to teeth the front tusks of Saint Doug Wellman, the accursed killer of J.R. Bob Dove.

412
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,240
You might want to keep this item in a jewelry box and on permanent display in your home.

413
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,560
If not your mouth.

414
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,480
Well, that's something I didn't suggest.

415
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,020
but of course, given human nature, anything is possible.

416
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm still just beginning to watch all the great stuff that people brought for the auction,

417
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,620
but which I typed and put in sky.

418
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,000
And actually, we had to go through all the stuff first.

419
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,260
So how did the band footage look on your videotape?

420
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,660
And notice that Dr. Drummond is mostly concerned about how he looked in the band footage.

421
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,600
Dr. Drummond, when you and your brothers and cousins would raise your legs

422
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
in that stork-like manner that's meant to indicate that the song needs to end now,

423
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,160
I thought that was just like a ballet.

424
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,140
We finally got taught.

425
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,120
Was that reach around good enough?

426
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,140
Yeah, man.

427
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,160
You guys were the greatest band that ever happened.

428
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,060
Can I stop complimenting you now?

429
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,600
You can stop now. I'm getting sick.

430
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,900
But your voice sounds great in that chipmunk tone.

431
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,220
Yeah, as he falls into the planet.

432
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,700
It's the gas you're breathing.

433
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,340
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,580
That's what I'm talking about.

435
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,180
That's what it is.

436
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,960
It sounds different down here.

437
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,540
Ow!

438
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,180
Some kind of weird thing happening.

439
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,660
Stand back, please.

440
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,240
Give me more oxygen, nurse.

441
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,880
And so the time is at hand for your humble servant to speak that which has been revealed

442
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
and which must come to pass.

443
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,280
Oddly enough, my first visitation occurred not while I was engaged in any spiritual pursuit,

444
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,580
but while absentmindedly.

445
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,220
I was constantly tinkering late one night with an experimental television receiver of my own design.

446
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,980
The hour was certainly after 1 a.m.

447
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,220
And, as I was temporarily living at the home of my beloved parents,

448
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,420
my divine seizure overtook me not twenty paces from where they lay asleep.

449
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,800
Yet, when questioned the next morning,

450
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,620
they could recall nothing of the thunderous voice or voices

451
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,580
that I know from my crude recordings must have reverberated throughout the little room.

452
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,400
I was thoroughly engrossed in my project,

453
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,860
and whatever thoughts I had were surely far from pious.

454
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,420
I was likely drunken to some extent,

455
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,820
for this was long before I freed myself from the joyous curse of the bottle.

456
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,000
I was bent over the picture tube of my ambitious home appliance,

457
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,240
about to attach it to a power cord for the first time,

458
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,040
when I realized that the screen was already glowing.

459
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,260
I stopped what I was doing,

460
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,180
and stared at it in befuddlement.

461
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,680
The screen hummed, and was suddenly bathed in light.

462
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,380
I swear I saw a brief, very overexposed image of a man clothed in flame,

463
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,180
with a bar of metal extending from his mouth,

464
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,680
before the tube went to total brightness.

465
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,680
I felt a sudden, swiftly building tension in the air,

466
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,380
a sort of vacuum between myself and the device before me.

467
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,780
Abruptly my head was filled with light,

468
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,240
my vision almost wholly obscured by a blinding light.

469
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,560
I was in a state of white-ness,

470
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,300
that seemed somehow to have instantaneously travelled from the tube to myself,

471
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,680
and was now bursting from a melting point at the exact centre of my brain.

472
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,420
There was no pain,

473
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,960
but the change of pressure inside my skull was such that I felt it must surely have hollowed itself out,

474
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,100
my brains and juices joining with the light,

475
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,700
and streaming out through now empty eye sockets in a dazzling wet beam.

476
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,260
My whole body felt simultaneously hot,

477
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,340
and freezing,

478
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,800
suffused with a ticklish numbness that made me want to climb out of it.

479
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,600
Blah blah blah.

480
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,300
My body and its pain were gone.

481
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,580
The white-ness and the noise returned,

482
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,780
and with them came an idiot calm.

483
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,120
For a moment I merely floated in the light and sound,

484
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,500
which were now merging to become one sensation.

485
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,040
Then a tension,

486
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,260
a weird instant of warning,

487
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,140
as if the very white-ness and noise were making ready to flee,

488
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,360
and I felt the mindless suspense of the moment,

489
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,340
what words are there for this?

490
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,540
Perhaps it was like riding in the socket of emptiness and suction

491
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,260
that follows racing behind a jet airplane,

492
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,600
at the precise instant before a sonic boom,

493
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,820
or maybe it was as if I were standing in the spot of trembling hesitancy,

494
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,800
exactly between two walls of storm air about to produce a thunderclap.

495
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,460
The inevitability of the next moment was a solid thing which could be touched,

496
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,000
and there was nothing else.

497
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,940
Silence, suspense, and then the voice boomed,

498
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,760
and I no longer existed.

499
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,900
There was only the voice, and my hearing of the voice.

500
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,480
The two were one.

501
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,140
It was not the voice of a man, or even a thing.

502
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,880
There were no sounds.

503
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
The voice was my hearing of the voice.

504
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,400
And I say there were no words.

505
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,100
There was only a great unbroken word,

506
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,980
and it was only my hearing of it that made it into words.

507
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,080
The words were these,

508
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,080
the pre-scriptures.

509
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,560
Behold, little pink earth brain within my void grip,

510
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,880
and receive Logos, and lay with the war.

511
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,340
I am Jehovah One, the God of wrath,

512
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,460
the one who to make man pull the triggers of his thousand opposable thumbs,

513
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,060
caused the apes of the ground to spill their seed on the dust.

514
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,360
I am the first and the last which is to come,

515
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,100
and which is, and which was.

516
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,340
I am in the brain pan of every human babe,

517
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,200
of left and of right,

518
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,860
the outer and the inside,

519
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,860
the particle, the totality.

520
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,620
For the gavel of the grid is mine own,

521
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,520
and I spat the silly formula of man upon the waters,

522
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,120
and fashioned his spirit after the image of mine own.

523
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
For Jehovah is a vengeful God,

524
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,800
and I urinate on the heads of men.

525
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,600
I am the Alpha. I cometh with the clouds.

526
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,320
I am the Alpha. I am the Alpha.

527
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,060
Lymphnode Institute reads the pre-scriptures, friends,

528
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,260
from the book of the subgenius.

529
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,840
Pretty scary stuff there, huh?

530
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,080
Well, so is this upcoming ancient American poem,

531
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,840
recited at 7X Day,

532
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,140
from memory by Dr. Howard.

533
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,860
Little orphan annies come to our house

534
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,460
to stay,

535
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,620
to wash the cups and saucers up

536
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,140
and brush the crumbs away,

537
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,340
and chew the chickens off the porch,

538
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,160
and dust the hearth, and sweep,

539
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,920
and make the fire, and bake the bread,

540
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,920
and earn more and keep.

541
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,280
But all us other chillin',

542
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,860
when the supper things is done,

543
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,160
we sits around the kitchen fire

544
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,940
and has the mostest fun

545
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,360
of listening to the witch tales

546
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,560
that Annie tells about,

547
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,520
of the goblins,

548
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,840
that gets ya if ya don't watch out.

549
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,660
Now once there was a little boy

550
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,940
who wouldn't say his prayers,

551
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,500
and when he went to bed at night,

552
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,240
away upstairs,

553
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,540
his mammy heard him holler,

554
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,060
and his daddy heard him bawl,

555
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,380
and when they turned the covers down,

556
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
he wasn't there at all.

557
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,040
And they searched him in the rafter room

558
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,560
and cubbyhole and press,

559
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,780
they searched him up the chimney flue,

560
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,840
and everywheres, I guess,

561
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,700
but all they ever found

562
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,280
was just his pants and roundabout,

563
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,340
and the goblins will get ya

564
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,680
if ya don't watch out.

565
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,840
And once there was a little girl

566
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,020
who used to laugh and grin,

567
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,120
and make fun of everybody,

568
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,180
and all her blood and kin,

569
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,680
and once when there was company,

570
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,920
and old folks was there,

571
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,840
she mocked him and she shot him,

572
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,600
and she said she didn't care,

573
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,720
and then just as she turned her heels,

574
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,740
and turned to run and hide,

575
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,220
there was two great big black things

576
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,800
a-standin' at her side,

577
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,080
and they snatched her through the ceiling,

578
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,140
for she knew what she's about,

579
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,120
and the goblins will get ya

580
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
if ya don't watch out.

581
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,820
And little orphan Annie says

582
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,440
that when the blaze is blue,

583
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,460
and the light flickers,

584
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,720
and the wind goes

585
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,120
whooooooo,

586
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,300
you better mind your parents

587
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,380
and your teachers,

588
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,360
fond and dear,

589
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
and cherish them what loves ya,

590
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,240
and dry the orphans' tear,

591
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,860
and help the poor and needy ones

592
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,560
what Cluster's all about,

593
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,460
or the goblins will get ya

594
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,500
if ya don't watch out.

595
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,300
That's James Quinton Rodgers.

596
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,200
This is Bob.

597
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,880
Bob is looking cool.

598
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,740
And with natural male enhancement,

599
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,220
Bob is livin' large.

600
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,880
In a few short weeks,

601
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,840
Bob has a big new spring of confidence.

602
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,600
A generous swelling of pride.

603
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,240
You ever saw that, uh,

604
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,100
Enzite commercial?

605
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,660
Notice how the, uh,

606
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,040
the Enzite commercial bases it around Bob?

607
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,700
Oh yeah, in fact, there's an entire, uh,

608
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
video that's been,

609
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,320
take those Enzite commercials.

610
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,740
It's available on the internet use net group

611
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,360
known as alt.montermovie,

612
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,380
alt.binaries.monter-movies.

613
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,500
And that's the internet use net group

614
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,920
where a lot of subgenius movies get posted.

615
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,200
And, uh, that one is out there right now.

616
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,680
Even as we speak.

617
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,740
It's there.

618
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
If you could go there,

619
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,360
you could see it and watch it.

620
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,380
And you'd be happy.

621
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,640
But just make sure,

622
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,040
Yeah, it's like this.

623
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,540
Wee.

624
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,100
Just make sure you take your little oboe

625
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,760
and your flute.

626
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,340
Is this supposed to be your little flute?

627
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,440
Is this supposed to be your little oboe?

628
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,200
That's what they tell me it was.

629
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,900
And so the subgenius danced and danced

630
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,620
around in a circle.

631
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,060
Holding their oboes above their heads

632
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,140
like so much flotsam and jetsam.

633
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,300
But in the wild ecstasies of the dance

634
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,980
they all lost themselves

635
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,360
and whirling around the floor

636
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,080
separated from time and space.

637
00:32:43,100 --> 00:33:10,260
I wonder if those genuinely

638
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,260


639
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,060
of losing myself

640
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,120
for a took?

641
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,080
Can't be take a me they're uglier

642
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,080


643
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,080


644
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,860
That's too pink! That's too fucking pink, man!

645
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,520
Reverend Stank says that song's too pink.

646
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,060
That's stupid!

647
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,340
It's stupid and it's pink.

648
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,580
This is Bob. Looks like Bob is really in a role.

649
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,320
Bob has a lane full of an uplifting measure of pride.

650
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,180
And now everyone can see, Bob is gay.

651
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,120
Speaking of coincidences, what are we going to do about those Bob Insight commercials?

652
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:53,120
They're really funny, they're really good, but some pink boy is getting paid for...

653
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,440
Bob! What should be Bob's!

654
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,820
And certainly if Philo and I can manage to get some recompense for what that pink boy...

655
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,220
Why, that's our trademark.

656
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,160
As J.R. Bob Dobbs says...

657
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,740
In the movie Valor for Pay in 1958...

658
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,120
I dare you to challenge my taunt!

659
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,280
I gotta do it, it's my thing, you know? People just gotta do what they gotta do.

660
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:28,380
Just as we hate almost anyone named Bob who isn't named J.R. Bob Dobbs...

661
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,560
And has many commercials made after him.

662
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,480
Now what are we gonna do about that?

663
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
So are you coming out for the film festival?

664
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,800
No, I'm gonna come out there for the lawsuit!

665
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,280
God damn it, I hate the future!

666
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,700
That and the future all day long!

667
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,980
That's really where we're going, man.

668
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,160
They blew it all up!

669
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,400
The future was a great place, wasn't it?

670
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,480
Yeah, it wasn't until we got there.

671
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,300
It was a great place.

672
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,420
We're doing a show right now.

673
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,940
But you know, since the future happened so long ago...

674
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,680
We are thinking back in time and think fondly of it.

675
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,540
Because we only remember the good times we had in the future, not the bad times.

676
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,120
Wow, who's your therapist?

677
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,240
What pills did you get?

678
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,020
The selective memory pills.

679
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,420
They came in my mammoth encyclopedia of masonry.

680
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,860
Wow, a mammoth? I didn't know that.

681
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,540
The memory editing pills that make us remember, which make us forget, actually.

682
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,380
They make us remember to forget.

683
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,920
Memory alert.

684
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,780
But the rest of us remembered.

685
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,520
You are now forgetting what really happened on X-Day.

686
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:33,960
I wish.

687
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,140
Oh, God.

688
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,020
I'm here to show I tried to forget it.

689
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,240
On X-Day, we were interested in the secret which we were not supposed to reveal.

690
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,560
Please, blank out X-Day.

691
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,680
Church of the Subgenius is about change and spare change.

692
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,420
And no one I know has changed over the course of their membership in the church as Pope S. Lilith, my daughter.

693
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,780
Don't stay out too late.

694
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,780
Not me.

695
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,860
Friends, can I get a praise bob out of you?

696
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,100
Praise bob!

697
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,700
Can I get a hail Connie out of you?

698
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,900
Hail Connie!

699
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,560
Can I get a salute out of you?

700
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

701
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:29,060
But, friends, honestly, it warms the cockles of my heart when I think about the fact that tomorrow is our great nation's day of independence, you could say.

702
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,360
Yeah.

703
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,660
This great nation, this great planet-balling nation.

704
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,380
Which was forged in the sweltering, sweaty forge of rational thought.

705
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:52,820
You see, about 250 years ago, there was a whole generation of statesmen and philosophers, Rousseau, Voltaire, Franklin, Jefferson, Smith.

706
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:02,180
People who all preached that the path to utopia is lined with schools, museums, and the rotting, decrepit churches.

707
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,480
And maybe their experiments succeeded well beyond all expectations.

708
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,820
It's hard to see it now, but 250 years ago, things were rather nasty.

709
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,300
There's something to be said for air conditioning, microwaves, and the lazy boy.

710
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,080
Miracles of rationality's bastard child, science!

711
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,380
But science also brings terrors.

712
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,080
Terrifying new ways to control, placate, and destroy.

713
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,480
You don't have to watch TV to know what I'm talking about.

714
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,960
The television is what I'm talking about!

715
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,820
And what about rationality's promise to destroy religious superstition?

716
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:58,460
Well, needless to say, I really shouldn't have to remind you of one billion Christians!

717
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,380
One billion Muslims!

718
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:13,980
Who knows how many Buddhists out there, hundreds of millions of Hindus, enough Jews to fill up a dozen Zions, and tons of other sects which continue to this day.

719
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,160
And they all breed.

720
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,840
Why this abject failure of rational thought?

721
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,660
Well, ultimately, it boils down to a failure to understand human nature.

722
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,460
People.

723
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,960
People prefer the lies.

724
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:40,460
People saw a world increasingly stripped of wonder and mystery, and chose instead to chase the shadow of God's ass, praying for the slightest of dingleberries.

725
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,660
Friends, in order to fight bullshit, it's going to take bullshit.

726
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,220
And friends, I'm here to tell you tonight that that man Bob sells the best BS for your buck!

727
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,960
I don't mean any old stale, dry shit either.

728
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,780
I'm talking about the good shit.

729
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,120
Nay, I'm talking about the holy shit!

730
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,980
Nay, I'm talking about the pure shit that comes forth from the very mouth of that man, J.R. Bob Topps!

731
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,840
Friends, if you've got to buy a pack of lies, you may as well get it by the crate.

732
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,320
And you just might find in that crate the true lies.

733
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,240
The lies that are truer than the truth itself!

734
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,020
Friends, buy bulk.

735
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,920
Buy Bob.

736
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:25,320


737
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:55,320


738
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:25,320


739
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:55,320


740
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:25,320


741
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:55,320


742
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:25,320


743
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,620
much

744
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,160
Dan?

745
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,320
Something about Bob Topps?

746
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,320
Depends.

747
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,740
I'll fight it out with you and you'll be all RICH again.

748
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:53,320
I were all too keen on someค

749
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,860
Just a moment.

750
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,560
He's just brainwashing at his best.

751
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,200
Now, tell us about the parade after the post-parade activities.

752
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,180
Do you remember those?

753
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,660
No, I was just in the cornfield there.

754
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,780
You were in the, oh, you were the scarecrow in the cornfield.

755
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,440
Well, I don't get paid for that, but.

756
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,300
No, it's a very, yeah, you get to watch.

757
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:21,120
I was out there in the cornfield, and it was pretty magnificent, Space Woman.

758
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,900
Yeah, it was actually very.

759
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,880
You mean like a little raven man?

760
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:27,500
Very.

761
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,700
Like a raven, yeah.

762
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,160
He said it was very magnificent, like a raven man.

763
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,900
A little tiny raven man.

764
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,700
Yeah, it was a novel experience.

765
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,740
A novel, unique, wonderful experience that few people get the chance to look at

766
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,860
from the vantage point of a scarecrow in a cornfield next to it.

767
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,720
Well, I'm not sure that would suit everybody.

768
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,560
Okay, this.

769
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,080
Now we're coming to the dangerous part of the show.

770
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:01,120
This is when we pass out the sharp objects, and everybody acts like they're going to poke them in their eye,

771
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,040
but they really don't.

772
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,420
We're going to run with scissors.

773
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,520
If anybody has any brothers, we've got some BB guns so you can put his eye out.

774
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,580
Really dangerous stuff this part of the evening.

775
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,540
We're going to juggle with broken shards of glass.

776
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,440
With our teeth.

777
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,820
Uh oh, it's dangerous music time.

778
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,780
Danger music.

779
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,220
guitar solo

780
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,100
guitar solo

781
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,660
guitar solo

782
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,100
guitar solo

783
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,820
guitar solo

784
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,640
guitar solo

785
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,100
guitar solo

786
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,060
guitar solo

787
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,840
guitar solo

788
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,080
Oh, whatcha gonna do?

789
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,820
Oh, whatcha gonna do?

790
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:45,700
Yeah.

791
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,420
Whatcha gonna do?

792
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,040
Yeah.

793
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,020
Whatcha gonna do?

794
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,680
That coffee's flammable.

795
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,740
Did they call back with puzzling evidence as teeth, ready to return them?

796
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:16,320
No, but Princess Wee was saying that now that we've broken the ice by bringing both Dr. Howell and Dr. Truman out here,

797
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,080
the next real challenge would be to get puzzling evidence out there.

798
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,720
Yeah, you'd have to pay him money.

799
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,540
But the important thing would be that we would keep all three of you guys away from KPFA.

800
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,280
At the crucial moment of that day.

801
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,260
Possibly thus saving all of Northern California.

802
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,600
That's true, we could save them for once.

803
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,980
For their own good, for the children, Dr. Truman, for the children.

804
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,140
It's everything we do is for the children.

805
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,040
You think of the children.

806
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,940
Yeah, I know, Dr. Truman always thinks of the children in his sarcasm.

807
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,240
The depths of his sarcasm.

808
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,620
Well, my sarcasm is also my truth.

809
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,040
What?

810
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,980
Some people think that sarcasm is a way of lying.

811
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,340
All you're saying is that your sensibility is your dogmatism.

812
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,320
That's correct, and they fit right here under my billy-bob teeth.

813
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,560
Oh, there we go.

814
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,440
Wow, those are billy-bob teeth.

815
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,900
Oh, I'm a journalist.

816
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,420
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to...

817
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,840
They have a striking effect on the ladies.

818
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,840
Okay, I'm sorry, sorry.

819
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,440
No, don't, you shouldn't do that.

820
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,800
I think it's okay, though.

821
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,580
The show's getting all foggy.

822
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,580
It's not going out on the air.

823
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,260
She moves like a demonic possessed hand.

824
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,040
This is some incendiary material.

825
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,180
Dead air, Bear.

826
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,420
Really hot stuff.

827
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:33,860
Dead.

828
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,840
Well, it sounds like puzzling evidence was ruptured.

829
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,440
Perhaps he was.

830
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,440
Because while we waited for the saucers to come to us,

831
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,760
they paid a private visit to...

832
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,820
Puzzling evidence.

833
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,820
He is kind of limping around a little bit.

834
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,860
Well, without his front teeth that we sold at the show.

835
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,800
Yeah, what happened to my teeth?

836
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,300
Well, I've about decided that this whole idea of staying awake

837
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,920
or being awake at all at 7 o'clock on July 5th morning

838
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,920
is proof that we haven't learned the slack that we need to learn.

839
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,060
Come on, build a stage.

840
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,580
It would have been easier for me if I hadn't been up all night doing it before.

841
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,360
Maybe we should...

842
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,300
Maybe we should...

843
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,060
Improve our space by staying in bed.

844
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,900
You sheep, wake up.

845
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:24,900


846
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,200
Wake up, you sheep.

847
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,300
Wake up, you sheep.

848
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,420
Wake up.

849
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,520
Wake up, you sheep.

850
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,240
Wake up, you sheep.

851
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,840
Wake up, you sheep.

852
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,520
Wake up.

853
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,460
Wake up.

854
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,360
Wake up!

855
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,620
Wake up, you sheep!

856
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,900
You are?

857
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,840
Why do you sleep?

858
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:25,560
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

859
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,920
Wake up, you sheep.

860
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,640
Youth and craft89 술

861
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,920
Wake up, you sheep.

862
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,780
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

863
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,800
Wake up, you sheep.

864
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,700
You are asleep.

865
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,160
estsleep.

866
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,720
Why do you sleep?

867
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,940
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

868
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,680
Stop!

869
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,980
Ah, yes, dear friends.

870
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,320
Reagan's Polyp there.

871
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,260
You can get more about Reagan's Polyp from Trashfish.com.

872
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,900
www.trashfish.com.

873
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,660
We've been listening to tons of the Puzzling Evidence Show

874
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:24,020
with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrum and Puzzling Evidence himself

875
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,760
and his new team from KPFA in Berkeley.

876
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,820
Music in the background by the Acid Corpse,

877
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:35,600
which is actually the amino acids mixed with the swinging love corpses.

878
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,680
And friends, you're listening to Hour of Slack,

879
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,060
the voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

880
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,480
Hour, we just moved.

881
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:48,840
Rather, the Austin Business Headquarters had to suddenly move to Georgia,

882
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,320
Columbus, Georgia, of all places.

883
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,840
And that makes, until we get our feet on the ground again,

884
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,200
that makes my Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

885
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,820
Megafist Temple Lodge, the current and new subgenius address to use.

886
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,540
And here it is.

887
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,760
Friends, if you want to send tapes to the show.

888
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:16,160
And that would be Post Office Box 181417,

889
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:22,200
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

890
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,200
And you can fax us, friends, at this phone number,

891
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,180
216-3228.

892
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,980
216-3228.

893
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,520
I'm stang at subgenius.com.

894
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,460
Praise the...

895
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:51,460
Hey, Dr. Drummond, it sounds like you got that demonic-possessed hand that I mailed you.

896
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,060
I do have it.

897
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,640
I'm surprised that came so quickly.

898
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,920
Yeah, it's a special effects masterpiece.

899
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,860
Well, you know,

900
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:03,720
the special effects of the future turned out to be a lot better than the future itself, didn't they?

901
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,900
Ah, yes.

902
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,840
The flying cars look great in the movies about the future,

903
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,260
and the robots work perfectly in the movies about the future,

904
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,880
about the year 2004.

905
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,860
But the demonic-possessed hands are a little bit...

906
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:17,440


907
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,160
Yeah, now, those really came out.

908
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,020
They weren't just in the movies.

909
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,540
That was one thing I thought would have remained in the movies.

910
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,700
Ah, cheap.

911
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,440
Ah, sound and motion.

912
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,380
Excavated, under the bed, panic-inducing.

913
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,140
It's just designed for children.

914
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,420
Where do they get so many disembodied hands?

915
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,060
I don't know.

916
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,740
I just don't see that many handless people walking around

917
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,920
to account for all the hands that I see crawling around in stores.

918
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, they're dead people from the past.

919
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,600
His only physical manifestation is their leftover hand.

920
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,280
Oh!

921
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,020
So they've been long dead.

922
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,040
Long, long dead.

923
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,700
Some of them longer than others, but it's shockingly realistic.

924
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,160
They're all plastic, molded vinyl now.

925
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,960
So those shockingly realistic hands are crawling around

926
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,060
with a vengeful hate of their own

927
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:10,220
that's independent of any wrongs done to the body they want to accept.

928
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,700
Right, their maleficent presence

929
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,240
is completely disconnected from their former self.

930
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,140
The disembodied hands have a blanket hate for all things.

931
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,680
There's a tenuous connection.

932
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,480
When you put them under the bed, that's true.

933
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,760
But when they're stored on top of the closet shelf,

934
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,540
then their love rains down on all.

935
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,160
The important question is, will they scare Grandma?

936
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm afraid they will.

937
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,460
And they are horrifyingly realistic.

938
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,640
Yeah.

939
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,360
Wow.

940
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,960
Horrifyingly realistic and panic-inducing.

941
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,800
We should carry those in our catalog with all the other horrifyingly realistic men.

942
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,760
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

943
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,040
They're not horrifyingly realistic.

944
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,900
They're shockingly realistic.

945
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,440
Oh, oh, oh, Sam.

946
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,920
Time for the fun!

947
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,180
Look at the victory.

948
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,500
See the sky.

949
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,680
It's horrible.

950
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,620
It's amazing.

951
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,020
And this is The Amino Acids.

952
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,360
Live at 6.

953
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,500
On this screen may be projected

954
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,700
the total scientific knowledge of the crowd

955
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,840
from its primitive beginning to the day of its annihilation.

956
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,060
Thank you.

957
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,160
Thank you.

958
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:28,860


959
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,900
My mind is not my mind.

960
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,600
My mind is not my mind.

961
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,500
My mind is not my mind.
