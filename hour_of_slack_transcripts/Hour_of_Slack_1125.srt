1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm the greatest risk to the American economy.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,540
President Bush has been detained by heavily armed turkeys.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,220
Mr. Bush says he does not believe this is in the turkeys' best interest.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,720
In the Midwest, Pope Benedict has named two Americans cardinals in the Roman Turkey Church.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,000
On Wall Street, 3-13-8-9.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,280
The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, must give up the idea of Tibetan independence,

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,900
if confirmed to be the next turkey general.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,160
In the West, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas will receive the Congressional Gold Medal today

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,620
for his work promoting violence around the world.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,520
The Commerce Department says the medal is a farce.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,720
The government says builders began work on PR News in Washington.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,520
We have a major event about to occur.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,840
The subject is sort of slack.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,600
The subject is sort of slack.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,880
The subject is sort of slack.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,380
The subject is sort of slack.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,580
Let's go!

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:16,720
I am fearful that what we are in the process of doing is failing to understand

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,120
the self-genius power of slack.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,840
And the issue is, as best I can see,

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,280
man.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,640
Not solvable.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,820
We'll try to uplift you and give you slack.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,340
We'll try to bring you down and guilt trip you.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,160
We'll try everything.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,840
Yes, yes, yes.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,460
Because you must render unto Bob that which is Bob's.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,180
Call on Bob, but row away from the rocks.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,300
As the old Indian proverb goes.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,500
And speaking of stations,

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,060
George Washington Carver said,

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
I love to think of nature.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,980
As an unlimited broadcasting station,

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,160
through which Bob speaks to us every hour,

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,400
if we will only tune in.

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,860
And now you're tuned in.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,960
And it's too late.

38
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,280
Friends, the station where the live hours of slack are produced,

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,020
WCSB,

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,860
had a pledge drive.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,700
And we did a pledge drive show.

42
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,060
And not all the other stations that run Hour of Slack

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,960
are having pledge drives, though.

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,880
And we're not.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,880


54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,380
And none have the same call letters and phone numbers.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,840
Yet, some of the bits we did in our fundraising

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,520
do apply to your life and station in life.

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,120
So, this revised Hour of Slack number 1125A

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,640
consists of some of that pledge drive sermonizing

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,700
from your beloved prayer partners

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,760
and lots more of everything.

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,580
Such as these Koyana Scottful collages

62
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,540
by Fernanda Nende, a lemur.

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,220
1-3-0-1-3-1-3-1-3-1-3

64
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,860
Yes, now I know.

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,100
How can I help it, knowing it's obvious?

66
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,580
Yes, the rule of man is open.

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,860
And he has come.

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,140
He has arrived.

69
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,560
1-3-0-1-3.

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,700
What is his name?

71
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,200
What do you call yourself?

72
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,500
What's that?

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,640
No, I know he's shouting it out.

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,680
Yes, yes, I listened.

75
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,520
Huh?

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,360
Oh, that's it, yes.

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,360
Bob?

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,500
He is within me.

79
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,920
He's becoming my soul.

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,320
I shall kill him.

81
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,500
He's here, you see.

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
I feel it.

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,520
Class, he's here.

84
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,540
I'm ready for him.

85
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,820
Yes, now I'm ready.

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,080
Public service message.

87
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,640
I hate...

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,060
I hate...

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,860
I hate...

90
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,100
Look.

91
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Hot plastic is stretched over Brian's arm.

92
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,060
They drill holes for the electrodes and fit them into place.

93
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,720
Hello.

94
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,580
I'm that kind of a guy.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,800
I mean, someone's after me or some animals are after me.

96
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,860
She's just wandering around mumbling to herself.

97
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,120
No, no.

98
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Can you look at that?

99
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,200
We, the terrorists, we're busy trying to find our own United States capital in Washington.

100
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,660
How much Librex are you taking?

101
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,580
Brain tumor.

102
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,040
I also take...

103
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,500
Yes, you could.

104
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,360
Okay.

105
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,120
Okay.

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,240
Thank you very much.

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,440
Thank you.

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,860
Next time.

109
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,800
My problem now is my father.

110
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,240
Good.

111
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,580
Good night.

112
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,740
Dave, are you there?

113
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,720
Yes, I'm there.

114
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,100
I've been waiting downstairs since 9 o'clock.

115
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,940
We claimed she was there, but I didn't see her physical presence, so I had to call the people.

116
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,140
Yeah, I had to call them up down there.

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,800
Now, one guy...

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,180
Sugar.

119
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,520
He said he wanted to know my identification number, and I said it was 5, which is not the correct number right now.

120
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,480
So then we had to go and look it back up and look it up back.

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,500
We had to go back and look it back.

122
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,700
And so then he said, well, you know, I'm coming for the pledge, Tony.

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,940
He came all the way from Hamilton and so forth.

124
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,060
And he says, well, you know, I got folk up there, and we have a few beer once in a while.

125
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,200
And did you know I am a pronoun?

126
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,080
No, no.

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,140
It's I is a pronoun.

128
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,820
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,300
I am.

130
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,720
I am Kagato Ergo-san.

131
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,060
Did you know there...

132
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,440
I hear a Tyrannosaurus footprint.

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,080
You can't fake that.

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,000
Dave, you've got to get on the headphones and the microphones all at the same time.

135
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Where am I?

136
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,960
What station is this?

137
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,900
Good morning.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,720
Morning.

139
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:31,280
Uh, and, uh, um, uh, and, uh, but, uh, between, uh, uh, two, uh, uh, it wouldn't, uh, uh, to say, uh, be bad.

140
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,200
And, uh, that's why I wouldn't.

141
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,420
Do you guys agree?

142
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,080
Well, yeah.

143
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:44,440
Uh, if you be bad, uh, and, uh, and, uh, to, uh, are certainly would, would, would, um,

144
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,440
isn't it?

145
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,700
Uh, uh.

146
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
And, uh, absolutely.

147
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,160
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, well, so you, uh, uh, in fact, what, you know, we, um, uh,

148
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,620
uh, that, uh, um, you know, uh, yeah, it's, it, uh, uh.

149
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,640
Uh.

150
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,820
For, you know, friends, the universe is centered on neither the earth nor the sun.

151
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,460
Neither one.

152
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,060
It's centered on Bob.

153
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,840
Bob's your uncle.

154
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Bob's your uncle, right?

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,960
Right, right.

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,780
Bob's your uncle, right?

157
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,340
Bob.

158
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,220
Oh, there you go, Bob's your uncle, right?

159
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,100
Bob moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform.

160
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,500
He plants his footsteps in the sea and humps upon the storm.

161
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,560
Oh, that is so beautiful.

162
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,300
I, uh, did you hear the tears hitting the paper as they fell from my eyelid?

163
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,940
Hey, Dad.

164
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,240
Dad, how come God lets some Christian suffer?

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,940
Hmm, that's a good question.

166
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,020
That's a fair question, too.

167
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,540
Like Marianne.

168
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,260
She's a strong Christian.

169
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,860
She's in a wheelchair.

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,100
She's paralyzed, Dad.

171
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,280
How come God let it happen?

172
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,860
Because God is bad.

173
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,400
Yeah.

174
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,280
God could have kept Marianne from getting paralyzed if he wanted to.

175
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,440
God is bad.

176
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,260
Hmm, hmm.

177
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,060
Quite right.

178
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,780
Physical.

179
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,420
Physical.

180
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,840
We reject.

181
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,500
Rejoice in our sufferings.

182
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Because we know that suffering produces suffering.

183
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,820
And suffering produces suffering.

184
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,620
Ah.

185
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,040
Neat.

186
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,420
Neat.

187
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,140
For sure.

188
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,080
Oh, I'm not gonna try anymore.

189
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,140
It's no use.

190
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,720
Not worth trying anymore.

191
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
If I'm suffering, I'm suffering.

192
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,800
Gonna quit.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
What does that mean?

194
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,420
Quit?

195
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,600
What does it mean?

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh, God is bad.

197
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,240
That's right, friends.

198
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,500
Because when you send mail in your pledge check, which you still have to do, you can't just pledge.

199
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,700
Yes.

200
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,660
You have to follow through.

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,100
It has to be a good check, too, right, Sting?

202
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah.

203
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,680
Well, we want that.

204
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,920
It has to be a really good one.

205
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,620
A good one.

206
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,000
You see, because it carries your psi stench, the psychic stench of your own mental eye,

207
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,820
as Bob calls it, your vibes, so to speak.

208
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:10,860
Now, those set off conspiracy chemical detectors all over the postal services and slows down

209
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,500
the works.

210
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,820
And that's what happens every time a subgenius mails in.

211
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:22,140
Because those machines just go crazy when they pick up the traces of your mental eye stench

212
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,640
and of ours when we're mailing your premium back to you.

213
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,640
And that's why a third nostril should be availed of you and those of you who do send your cards,

214
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,260
your forgivenesses, and parts of your body to the church of the subgenius, or perhaps

215
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,820
just a pledge to this radio station with your kind words detached or detached.

216
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,820
Either one of these are good for development.

217
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,080
Development of the third nostril and the ability to whiff the life stench of those around you.

218
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,740
Imagine you're on a bus on your way to school or work, and you can automatically discern

219
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,000
the stench of each individual on the bus.

220
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,760
Now, isn't that something to look forward to tomorrow?

221
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,320
I mean, most of us don't have anything to look forward to tomorrow.

222
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,160
You can pledge to this station.

223
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,420
Is that phone number to call in the 216 area code?

224
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,820
That's 216.

225
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,620
And there's nothing on it.

226
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,920
It's just the first.

227
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,440
Yeah.

228
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,160
It's just.

229
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Oh, oh.

230
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, baby.

231
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,160
This is Bob from Ass House Word again.

232
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,520
I invite you to log on to the internet.

233
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,560
AssHouse.net.

234
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,460
There, there.

235
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,240
Ass.

236
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,140
His name is Rod.

237
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,360
Now, Rod.

238
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,740
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

239
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,200
Ham.

240
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,780
Ham.

241
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,300
Shrod.

242
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,900
And fascinating Rod developing.

243
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,840
Rod.

244
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,400
Bo.

245
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:44,780
Bo.

246
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,240
Later.

247
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,560
That's a pretty good start.

248
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Groot.

249
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Medium.

250
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,580
Hope to start on that soon, in fact.

251
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,920
Rod.

252
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,460
Your teenage daughter or son will get in your face.

253
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,540
Restrain them.

254
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,900
Restrain them at home.

255
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,320
Oh, Rod was the one behind Rod's religion works.

256
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Rod.

257
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,060
Well, I gave you a little tower showing you Rod's attitude.

258
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,620
Do not trust.

259
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,020
Oh, feel him.

260
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,640
Feel him.

261
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,420
Just reach out.

262
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,400
Confusion.

263
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,040
Evil is about people.

264
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,460
Especially when they get together in cities.

265
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,080
It's hard.

266
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,480
It's hard.

267
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,000
Um.

268
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,740
Um.

269
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,980
Now we're moving.

270
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,140
That's taking a little different turn here.

271
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,980
Out.

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,480
Out.

273
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,000
Out.

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,480
Out.

275
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,740
Out.

276
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:23,740


277
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,640
Evil.

278
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,620
Duh.

279
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,040
Somebody goes digging out.

280
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,460
Feel.

281
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,000
Look.

282
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,340
Smell.

283
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
I wanna go on.

284
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,680
I wanna go on.

285
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,260
Uh.

286
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,940
I would love to.

287
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,900
So we can have some good interaction here.

288
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,160
What an attitude from the king of Sodom.

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,520
Do you.

290
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,140
This doesn't make sense.

291
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,720
Please.

292
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,100
Please.

293
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,640
Will come.

294
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,580
That is a promise.

295
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,040
Um.

296
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,320
Take my.

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,160
Aw.

298
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,120
Still at it.

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,840
Sodom.

300
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,720
In a little while.

301
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,880
Oh.

302
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Oh.

303
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,680
Whoa.

304
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:50,860
Whoa.

305
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,060
Whoa.

306
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,220
Whoa.

307
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,400
Whoa.

308
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,540
Whoa.

309
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,060
Yeah.

310
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,760
Baby.

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,900
And now this station is.

312
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,140
And by the way.

313
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm sorry.

314
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,000
We haven't been doing real good on the pledge drive yet.

315
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,240
So if you were sort of fence straddling.

316
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,540
And going well now I know they're probably doing okay.

317
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,020
I'm hurting for money.

318
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,100
I know how it is.

319
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,500
You probably donated some to the Chaz Smith.

320
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,160
Fund at Chaz tribute.com.

321
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,100
You probably donated to the church of your choice at subgenius.com.

322
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,820
But we're asking you to donate more than your frozen sperm.

323
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,960
Your liver.

324
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,980
More than blood.

325
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,520
Your.

326
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,060
More than your soul.

327
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,700
We're asking you to donate your money.

328
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,660
Not just your even your attention.

329
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,440
Which you thought was the most valuable thing you had.

330
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,600
No.

331
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,040
The most valuable thing you have is actually your money.

332
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,340
And that's what we want.

333
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,240
Here at WCSB.

334
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,740
Six.

335
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,820
There's no.

336
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,120
No.

337
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,320
Please.

338
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
Friends please.

339
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,560
What do you value in this life?

340
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,700
Do you value your freedom?

341
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,920
Do you value your luxuries?

342
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,220
Do you value your mind?

343
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,820
As it wears through the wind like a wisp of the willows?

344
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,780
Yes.

345
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,580
You value all of these things.

346
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,320
And you value turning on to 89.3 every day to deliver you unctuous attacking.

347
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


348
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


349
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


350
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


351
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


352
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


353
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


355
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


357
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


359
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


360
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,320


361
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
food and cartels

362
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,140
from outer

363
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,820
standings.

364
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,040
That's why, that's why,

365
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,080
that's why you

366
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,240
must, if you are capable,

367
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,780
if your legs move,

368
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,100
if your feet have hands, if you can

369
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,820
see or sing, please

370
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,620
send or call now

371
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,860

373
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,140
and learn the value of your

374
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,560
values, you stinking

375
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,740
valuants.

376
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
Friends, you can become

377
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,080
greater than you are. You can be what

378
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,900
you want. You can be

379
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,000
the high epoch of the church if you

380
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,120
donate enough. With your $100,000

381
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,960
donation, you become an overman,

382
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,000
an X-man, or an apprentice

383
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
overman is available for $10,000.

384
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,920
If you can

385
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,020
donate that $5,000, friends,

386
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
we'll make you a high pope of the unpredictable

387
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
and that includes all of

388
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,440
you healers of appliances,

389
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,100
controller reverends, word bearers, media

390
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,800
adepts,

391
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,580
deacons of the white root of the

392
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,480
immaculation, high priestesses

393
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,900
like Priestess Pisces, God Bubbas,

394
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,760
anti-virgins, evil

395
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,700
angelists, soothsayers,

396
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,760
preseers, prophets, martyrs, apostles,

397
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,700
saints, hermits, holy men of

398
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,580
old, female goddesses of the race,

399
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,040
model X humanoids, rub geniuses,

400
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,480
arch fools of the unknowable,

401
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,520
bulldog artists, more

402
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,860
realists, code masters, necromancers,

403
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,860
wizards, and rogue and renegade

404
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,200
subgeni.

405
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,340
That can be you,

406
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,480
friends.

407
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,340
Friends.

408
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,320
You are friends.

409
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,320
Do you make the grade?

410
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Or can you cross that line?

411
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,060
Can you filibuster

412
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,300
with the best of them?

413
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,320
Can you fill the halls of the senate with your hot air?

414
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,240
No, you can't.

415
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,140
Can you argue with the president concerning the fate

416
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,320
and the future of this nation?

417
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,220
No, you can't.

418
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,700
But can you donate your valuable money

419
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,620
to this station and help

420
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,380
keep this beautiful thing

421
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,300
which we have on the air?

422
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,820
Yes, I know you can.

423
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,560
See wcsb.org

424
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,380
or subgenius.com

425
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,460
to learn how.

426
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,160
And by the way, those last two archival

427
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,020
old recordings were donated by

428
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,340
Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com.

429
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,040
Meanwhile,

430
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,260
friends, let's go back in time

431
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,000
and hear an ancient, rare

432
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,100
radio commercial actually

433
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
produced by none other than

434
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,440
J.R. Bob Dobbs for a product of his,

435
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
Beer God Beer,

436
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,240
which he marketed in the

437
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,160
deep south during the 1950s

438
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
and early 60s.

439
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,760
This incredibly rare recording was unearthed

440
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,980
from the WDOB archives

441
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,540
in Alabama by Reverend

442
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,800
Bleepo Abernathy.

443
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,360
And we are truly lucky to get to hear it

444
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,040
before the last copy was lost.

445
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,500
This probably was the last copy

446
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,340
of the Beer God Radio Spot.

447
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,660
Is it the hops-toasted

448
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,580
frop or the frop-toasted hops?

449
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,740
It doesn't even matter anyway.

450
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,580
Because once you taste that

451
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,360
taste that can't possibly be real,

452
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,300
you'll be hooked on Beer God Beer

453
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,240
worse than that bullmouth flounder

454
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
just wrapped its lips around that

455
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,260
bacon-wrapped double barb.

456
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,680
And Betty ain't looking.

457
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,420
Why?

458
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,400
Because I'm sucking on a Beer God, baby.

459
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,020
Hey, Connie, toss me another.

460
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,960
Yes, whether it's with cigarettes,

461
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,260
weenies, or weesas,

462
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,640
Beer God Beer goes with everything.

463
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,240
Oh, and we do mean everything.

464
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,260
Wow, Beer God Beer is out of this world!

465
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,840
Oh, yeah!

466
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,440
Beer God Beer, smack dab in your fist.

467
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,300
Beer God.

468
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,300
The tastes that don't exist.

469
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,760
Beer God, the thirst fucker.

470
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,060
Available at all Beer God liquor marts

471
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,140
and dob stores.

472
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,540
Just look for the topless tiki bonsai, Chaz.

473
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Big fish, little pond, little pond.

474
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,540
Big fish, little pond, big fish.

475
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,040
Little pond.

476
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm a big fish in the little pond.

477
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm a big shot.

478
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm someone of value.

479
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,480
My thoughts and feelings.

480
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,820
Stan's been here all day helping out at the station.

481
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,940
He feels so strongly about Pledge-a-thon.

482
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,720
I smell so strongly about Pledge-a-thon

483
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,060
from being here all day.

484
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,980
I can tell your third nostril is opening

485
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,940
and are you smelling?

486
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,280
No, I'm trying to keep it plugged, actually.

487
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,340
Oh, I thought you were hoping...

488
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,240
You smell long green.

489
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,860
Well, you know, I just had most of my flesh burned,

490
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
so maybe that's it.

491
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,020
You know, if we don't get them phones

492
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,040
ringing a little bit faster,

493
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,280
I'm going to be forced to play old Pledge Drive rants.

494
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,580
Or even worse, the 30 minutes of pure PR news in Washington,

495
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,960
and I know you don't want that.

496
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,760
Well, they might want...

497
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,580
There's nothing...

498
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes, yes, yes, yes, friends.

499
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,300
You're not going to make me do a Gene Scott now, are you?

500
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,300
Where I go, well, I ain't calling in.

501
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm just going to play my saxophone.

502
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
He did that once.

503
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,760
No, he did that exactly three times consecutively

504
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,040
and was fired.

505
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
Gene Scott?

506
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
How could he be fired?

507
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:18,960
He was...

508
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,460
Great Caesar's ghost.

509
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,520
He was fired.

510
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,200
Great Gene Scott.

511
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,860
By the meta-oberman.

512
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,480
He died, actually.

513
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,580
Well, those are the...

514
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,500
That's the ultimate loss of job.

515
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,340
Right, when the meta-oberman come looking for you,

516
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,540
you automatically die.

517
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,420
You know, they're working on meta-obermen.

518
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
They're trying to pretend they're not.

519
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,220
They're starting with Franken-mice.

520
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,300
I have an interesting article here from the Plain Dealer.

521
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,120
They're not only resistant to AIDS, they are...

522
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,280
Actually, had you heard about these, Dave,

523
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,000
just down the street from me at Case Western University?

524
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,220
Yes, I heard about them.

525
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,900
The mighty mice, genetically engineered,

526
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,960
can gallop on rodent-sized treadmills

527
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,300
for as long as six hours

528
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,660
and cover more than three miles before they're tuckered out.

529
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,920
That's like running a five-kilometer race.

530
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,800
And most gifted, less genetically gifted,

531
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,360
gifted mice max out at .2 kilometers.

532
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,680
However, these uber-mice also have voracious appetites

533
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
and practically no body fat,

534
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,760
and they bite a lot.

535
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,200
Yes, they're very aggressive.

536
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,540
They're tiny endurance athletes with attitude

537
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,000
that were accidentally created as a serendipitous byproduct

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
of some work on enzymes.

539
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,320
And the interesting thing about this...

540
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,900
That's what it is, is the enzymes?

541
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,760
Is working on the enzymes is how they...

542
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,420
Well, it...

543
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,160
They were part of an ongoing look at an enzyme

544
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,040
involved in producing glucose or sugar

545
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,880
as a source of energy in the liver and kidneys.

546
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,380
The enzyme called

547
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,120
phosphoenolpyruvatecarboxykinase,

548
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,660
or PEPCATC for short.

549
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,840
Yeah, I remember.

550
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,460
Anyway, in addition to having endurance

551
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,920
exhibited by the transgenic mice,

552
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,760
the animals were far more active in their cages,

553
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,560
lived much longer,

554
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,220
and could breed well into what is generally considered

555
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,020
old age for their kind.

556
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,980
One female mouse reproduced

557
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,860
when she was just under three years old,

558
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,740
which is like an 80-year-old woman giving birth.

559
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,100
Wait until they apply this to people, friends.

560
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,560
Well, that's what they're waiting for.

561
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
They want Barbara Bush to give birth

562
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,320
to a whole new race of human beings,

563
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,140
a mankind accordion, so to speak,

564
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,420
that spews from Houston.

565
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,860
They ain't gonna stop with Franken-mice.

566
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,940
They're gonna move up to Franken-yuppies.

567
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,360
Yep.

568
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,700
Franken-executives.

569
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,000
Just think those loafers,

570
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,460
or, oh, gee, there goes the joke,

571
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,360
I forgot the name of them,

572
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,280
the basswegians will be actually part of their feet.

573
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,860
Grown on.

574
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,760
Grown right on.

575
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,240
And, of course, the shirt names that I forgot,

576
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,860
so I'll go somewhere else, please.

577
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,520
Now, these mice are exceptionally aggressive,

578
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,300
so much that the lead researchers

579
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,400
sometimes get appeals from behavioral labs

580
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,580
that are testing the animals,

581
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,500
asking that they come and retrieve the rowdy rodents.

582
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,880
And this woman, Parvin Hakimi,

583
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,460
has bred of about 500,

584
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,380
of these mice.

585
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,100
From the start, she noticed they were anything but average.

586
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,880
When she lifted the top off their cage,

587
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,020
it was like removing the lid from a popcorn popper,

588
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,060
because these new mice are seven times more active

589
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,120
than the control group.

590
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,380
Now, of course, they say that

591
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,460
they don't envision an overload of PEPC

592
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,360
as a possible performance enhancer in humans,

593
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,800
because it's neither feasible nor ethical

594
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,780
to create Franken-soldiers,

595
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,020
or,

596
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
or Franken-salesmen,

597
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,820
or Franken-preachers,

598
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,440
or Franken-radio stations.

599
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
They can if they will.

600
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,580
And I know they will if they can,

601
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,140
because that's America, friends,

602
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,040
and that's what keeps us peppy-uppered,

603
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,640
is knowing that they're not only working on Franken-mice

604
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,440
for you, for your family,

605
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,380
for your children, your friends and neighbors,

606
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,320
and the people who were at the baseball game

607
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,060
when it was the football game tonight.

608
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,980
I'm confused right now, but everybody was out there,

609
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,220
and I could imagine

610
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,280
masses and masses

611
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,540
of Franken-salesmen,

612
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,700
Franken-people,

613
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,860
not taken care of,

614
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,940
poorly dressed,

615
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
poorly housed.

616
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,500
With their neck bolts and electrodes

617
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,780
all wobbling,

618
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,160
and getting infected on the sides.

619
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,460
And their natural clothes

620
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,800
growing right on their body,

621
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,260
ripping their torn foot shoes.

622
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,480
The stitches coming loose.

623
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,000
After all,

624
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,540
Ralph Waldo Emerson once observed

625
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,820
that if you build a better mousetrap,

626
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,980
the world will beat a path to your door.

627
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,020
Who knows what will happen

628
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,540
when you build a better mousetrap.

629
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,100
They will beat your head.

630
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,200
Friends, we know what happens

631
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,400
when you build a better mousetrap.

632
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,020
It's Bob! You get you a Bob-mouse!

633
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,140
It's a superior being.

634
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,580
Bob is a superior being.

635
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,980
He wants you to live in his monkey box,

636
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
in his freedom hostel.

637
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,640
He wants you to become among of us.

638
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,640
He wants you to join along.

639
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,780
And to do so,

640
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,940
he wants to show your contrition

641
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,080
by asking you contritely

642
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,540
to please him.

643
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,920
Please send generous orifices

644
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,360
to this station,

645
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,860
whatever the hell.

646
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,800
What's the name of the station?

647
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,140
That outgoing station was WCSB Cleveland

648
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,480
and it will be back, friends.

649
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,860
But first, for Bull Donner's sake,

650
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,300
we cut abruptly to Dr. Howell,

651
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Dr. Philo Drummond,

652
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,560
and host Puzzling Evidence

653
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,900
on their incoming show

654
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,600
on KPFA Berkeley

655
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,920
under KPFA's imperial regime.

656
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,780
In 1917,

657
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,240
the imperial regime

658
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,520
collapsed and after eight months of existence

659
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,620
as a republic under the split authority

660
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,500
of a self-appointed provisional government

661
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,480
and a network of regionally elected Soviets,

662
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,900
the radical Bolshevik party seized power

663
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,260
and took control of the military culture

664
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,880
in which the women now played a significant role.

665
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,860
Yee!

666
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,920
Yeah.

667
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,960
Their journey was...

668
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,100
Military manorants?

669
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,720
Are we on the page of military manorants?

670
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,180
...more traditional jobs such as nurses,

671
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,000
span bigem,

672
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,020
ac Kundareers,

673
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,200
nag-forms,

674
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,200


675
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,960
and service for the eponymous from factories

676
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,580
in front of stateardoom

677
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:18,580


678
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,260
And, obviously,

679
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,400
participating fully as combat soldiers.

680
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,140
Many began

681
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,440
their military activities disguised as young men

682
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,680
but eventually

683
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,540
all female units

684
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,240
were created in both the Russian army...

685
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,780
I trynt to call it a dog.

686
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:47,000
battalion of death led by the fierce combatant Maria Bokareva, to whose career there is new

687
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,600
information recently added, which has come to light in the eternal shuffling through

688
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,160
the dust of history.

689
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,420
Did you hear about that guy in Germany whose last name is Gesundheit, and he wants to get

690
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,660
some money every time somebody sneezes?

691
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,620
Money? Well, I'm afraid I can't afford it. Particularly since, uh, what did you see there?

692
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,000
He's suing, like, a whole bunch of different nations.

693
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,420
Our leader's war speech. Apparently we're going to have two more wars going on at the

694
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:24,320
same time as this war, but we're going to pay for it by privatizing the U.S. superhighway

695
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,540
system. So we just have to pay lots of money to get from place to place, but it'll finance

696
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,880
fighting three wars at a time.

697
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,800
Dang, I guess I better go get another job.

698
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,560
Okay.

699
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,440
Pay all the taxes and the necessary to finance all this stuff.

700
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,280
Yeah, you're in the, uh, looking glass now.

701
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,320
Taxes to beat the Axis.

702
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,180
Hitler, Musso, and Toto hope you won't pay your taxes.

703
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,340
They'd love to see you get away with it.

704
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,900
They'll be laughing out the other side of their mustache when the U.S. Marines come

705
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,260
I would just, I'd do that just to see them laugh.

706
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,840
Really?

707
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,120
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

708
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,500
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

709
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

710
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,040
Jojo laugh.

711
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,740
There you go.

712
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,440
Now what about Mussolini?

713
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,340
Is this a propaganda show?

714
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,700
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ha.

715
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,320
Oh, yeah.

716
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,300
And then de Gaulle.

717
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,380
You know, which, well, he, you know.

718
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,600
Yeah, that big nose, you know, he had quite a honker on him.

719
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,260
I'm tired of standing at attention here, but this ceremony's going on forever.

720
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,200
Just 18 more, and you have to play the anthem for each country?

721
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,420
No, you have to.

722
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,420


723
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,420


724
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,420


725
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,420


726
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,320
He listens to the show.

727
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,020
Your cousin's double next-door neighbor's child is in this parade, right?

728
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
We're supposed to wave at her when she comes by?

729
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,880
Not to mention Fredonia.

730
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,680
Yeah, okay, I know.

731
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,600
When the Fredonian anthem comes, we all have to stand, take the right wheel, and before

732
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,920
the reviewing stand, drop trowel in front of the grand duke.

733
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,740
We make our own families now.

734
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,920
We have, we create our family from our friends and our neighbors.

735
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,240
Our friends.

736
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,460
Because aren't we all like one giant family?

737
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,660
Like to help us.

738
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,000
It really is that way.

739
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,360
Learning about life from our friends means listening to what they have to say.

740
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,460
Hunting, fishing.

741
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,640
And sharing.

742
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,940
Tiny truth.

743
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,120
With our tiny, friendly neighbors and friends.

744
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,120
Oh, look, here's a large floating screen coming by.

745
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,880
Screen!

746
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,880
And a giant hair, hairball.

747
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,980
Look, it's a.

748
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,560
A massive hairball.

749
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,000
Look at what that is.

750
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,240
Jeez.

751
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,960
But what about the Navy?

752
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,620
And when I say the Navy, I'm talking about Benedict Arnold's Navy.

753
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,640
I don't know, but did you hear about Benedict Arnold?

754
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:58,000
That they found titanium rivets in his spine that he was trying to recover from being a

755
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,020
spineless wimp.

756
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,460
He was a robot.

757
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,160
And he was turned into a self-confident success.

758
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,260
That's just not true, Philo.

759
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,380
Overnight.

760
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,120
He was not a.

761
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,940
He was not a spineless wimp.

762
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,220
He was actually a hero for most of the war.

763
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,140
Yes, it is true.

764
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,540
And he.

765
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,200
Yeah, he really wasn't a bad guy.

766
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,980
Well, he approached George Washington in 1775 and proposed an enveloping attack.

767
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,420
He proposed to George Washington.

768
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,600
British garrisons in Montreal and Quebec City.

769
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:21,980
Damn.

770
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,680
By two American columns.

771
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,040
One led from Fort Ticonderoga in New York.

772
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,980
The other personally led by Arnold across northern Maine to the St. Lawrence River.

773
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,780
The American attack on Quebec in December 1775.

774
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,740
Was an utter disaster.

775
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,340
Chewed up.

776
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,160
Spat out and swallowed by superior British troops.

777
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,060
Cold and smallpox.

778
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,380
The Americans fled weeping and bawling through the woods.

779
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:56,140
And down Lake Champlain to Fort Ticonderoga where they were each issued a pencil.

780
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,240
But.

781
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,500
No, no.

782
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,420
It's all true.

783
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,640
It's in the book.

784
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,820
It is true.

785
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,280
The pictures here.

786
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,420
The wooden negatives taken at the time of the.

787
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,220
The wooden negatives.

788
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,220


789
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
They were so hard back in those days to.

790
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,160
They had to use matches to burn out the different dark areas and light areas.

791
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,480
Yeah.

792
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,820
I've seen that movie too.

793
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,180
Yeah.

794
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,520
Yeah.

795
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,360
But it.

796
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,180
At least it beat the chisels they were using in the previous technology.

797
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,320
No, they beat the chisels over their heads.

798
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,640
But they had to keep running.

799
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,940
The rock negatives.

800
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,660
The rock negatives.

801
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,020
Right.

802
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,680
A little 2000 man forced.

803
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,720
But they had a chisel out.

804
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,500
I saw it on the Flintstones watch.

805
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,420
I know it was true.

806
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,120
The British came on in hot pursuit from Quebec.

807
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,220
They were led by General Gifford.

808
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,120
Guy Carlton.

809
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,880
Carlton's orders were to roll up the survivors of the Arnold's expedition.

810
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,240
Roll them up.

811
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,900
Roll them up.

812
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,440
Like roll them up into a burrito.

813
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:43,640
Take Ticonderoga.

814
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,880
Then Lake George.

815
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,440
And then move through.

816
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
And once they had the burritos in Lake George.

817
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:48,780
Which linked Albany and New York.

818
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,420
What did they do then?

819
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,400
Once in possession of that wide waterway.

820
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,440
The British.

821
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
Wide waterway burritos.

822
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,540
If he'd talked.

823
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,540
Would be able to cut the United States.

824
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,240
In Lake George.

825
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
Which had just officially been declared the United States in two.

826
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,680
I don't get it.

827
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,300
As with a giant pair of scissors.

828
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:03,760
Uh huh.

829
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
They would snip the kosher off the coast.

830
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,620
They paired them with scissors.

831
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,220
And they would cut the United States.

832
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,220


833
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,560
And they would chop out as many troops as they wished.

834
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,600
To march down into Canada.

835
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,320
How many pairs of scissors did they have?

836
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,000
With a thirty thousand man.

837
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,420
Even though you have one.

838
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:16,660
Here.

839
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:16,660


840
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,320
And Hessian army.

841
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,620
Already in New York and New Jersey.

842
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,920
You call it a scissors.

843
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,800
Arnold's orders from.

844
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,140
Aimed scissors.

845
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,160
From General Horatio Gates were blunt.

846
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,000
Those scissors.

847
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,280
Arrange and execute the judicious defense.

848
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,280


849
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,400
You could say give me those scissors.

850
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,280
Of the northern entrance.

851
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,940
Could say give me them scissors though.

852
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,260
To this continent.

853
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I need some scissors.

854
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:34,840
Well uh.

855
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,200
Arnold had.

856
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,220
But you don't say I need scissors.

857
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,220


858
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,220


859
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,560
Those scissors were used to defend the northern entrance.

860
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,280
Which is what you should say if you were really serious about your scissors.

861
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:42,420
His army was decimated by casualties.

862
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,300
And weakened by disease.

863
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,900
But with astounding Yankee ingenuity.

864
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,400
Instead you spend all your money on TV sets.

865
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,380
The Americans hammered together a navy.

866
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,040
With scissors is what you need.

867
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,920
Grasping that the British would need control of Lake Champlain.

868
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,540
To cross the trackless wilderness.

869
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,320
But I had my scissors.

870
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,080
Why?

871
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,460
Those were the good old days.

872
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,140
Between the St. Florence and Hudson River valleys.

873
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,300
Arnold's survivors built a schooner.

874
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,800
Uh oh.

875
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:03,980
A saloon.

876
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,600
I brought my scissors.

877
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,460
A galley.

878
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,640
Yeah so.

879
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,060
An eight.

880
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,200
And a gun.

881
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,200


882
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,200


883
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,200


884
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,200


885
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,920
Of course that means we have to play you know.

886
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,260
They gave them names like.

887
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,180
Liberty.

888
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,160
Another intro folks.

889
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,880
Congress.

890
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,720
Revenge.

891
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,020
And Enterprise.

892
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,340
In all there were only 16 American ships and 750 sailors against 30 British ships.

893
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,080
With a crew of 1650.

894
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,940
That's about half.

895
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,320
That's about half times 30 percent divided by 12 plus 16.8.

896
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,320


897
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,720
You know it's a Broadway play.

898
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,080
Nervousness.

899
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,020
Can you believe that caller?

900
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,780
The new nation.

901
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,440
All the bells and whistles.

902
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:34,840
And then it was.

903
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,400
The Tom Paine dipped his quill in the Icky Roach.

904
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,240
These are the times that try men's soul.

905
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,780
Bells and whistles usually refer to non-essential but engaging features.

906
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,220
It was no time for the summer soldier and the sunshine.

907
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,980
When TV was delivered however.

908
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,620
Beetleman immediately realized that the bells and whistles for which he paid extra were

909
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,520
exactly that.

910
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,420
There wasn't a snazzy extra feature in sight.

911
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,220
Beetleman said.

912
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,180
Just all sorts of bells and whistles.

913
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Attached to the TV.

914
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,320
They pulled a fast one on me.

915
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,620
And I was really angry.

916
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,880
But it was too late to take the TV back because the Super Bowl was just a few hours away.

917
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:20,060
But something happened during the party to change Beetleman's mind after returning the

918
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,400
TV.

919
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,860
About returning the TV.

920
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,360
What is it?

921
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,500
The bells and whistles turned out to be a hit he said.

922
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,500
Whenever the Seahawks scored my friends would go nuts ringing the bells and blowing the

923
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:32,780
whistles.

924
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,120
I got on my leg.

925
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,280
Sorry.

926
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,420
Even though the Seahawks lost the bells and whistles really ramped up the party.

927
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,780
Bring that fish up the ramp would you.

928
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,380
I ended up going back to the store the next day to purchase a remote to operate them.

929
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,740
Hey smash water.

930
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,420
One bottle too many.

931
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,040
I got a bite.

932
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,500
The salesperson said it was the hottest remote in stock.

933
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
He was right.

934
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,020
And I definitely plan to have another party as soon as my hands recover from the burns.

935
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,840
What kind of show is this?

936
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,880
Where do I put the computer?

937
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,620
In the bathtub.

938
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,860
Should I fill the bathtub?

939
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,920
That's going to take a little while.

940
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,400
If thy iPod offend thee pluck it out.

941
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,700
Oh man don't do that.

942
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,700
Oh man.

943
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,700
How?

944
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,700
How just threw my iPod out of the.

945
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh man.

946
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,000


947
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,000


948
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,000


949
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,000


950
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,220
I'm going to have to go to the show.

951
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,560
Oh that's terrible.

952
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,820
Wrecked him and that's damn near killed him.

953
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,220
300 bucks.

954
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,740
Oh well.

955
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,820
There's an old one.

956
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,120
I guess I have to buy a new one by law anyway soon.

957
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,680
That's right.

958
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,520
Governor Schwarzenegger fellow.

959
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,120
He got that Mac sponsorship and ever since then if you.

960
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,280
Everyone's going to be forced to buy expensive health insurance.

961
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,260
If the police stop you and you don't have an iPod you can be arrested.

962
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,400
Ah damn.

963
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Some of us just don't have the quay with all.

964
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,320
Clapton Irons because they don't have a favorite sub list.

965
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:57,960
Are you here?

966
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,900
Eric Clapton Irons.

967
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,500
Hey we're doing a show.

968
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,720
Oh well I.

969
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,720
Just a moment.

970
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Here is a.

971
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,340
I'll just.

972
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,120
Virginia Declaration of Rights.

973
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,820
Now you may be hearing sub tones.

974
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,460
That's just the mind sweep.

975
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,300
I hear a sub tone.

976
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,780
That's my mind is feeling like it's in a jello.

977
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,840
I'm putting jello into a parking meter.

978
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,380
I'm just sweeping the minds of all the people sleeping right now in northern and central

979
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,840
California.

980
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,020
Hopefully we're exercising your lower ears right now.

981
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,340
You shouldn't have uncontrollable bowel movements at this point.

982
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,740
Used some of the Virginia Declaration.

983
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,280
I would not.

984
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,600
Sorry about that.

985
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
Here we'll stop it for a minute.

986
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,960
There they go.

987
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,260
Oh yeah.

988
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,700
That's right.

989
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Recognizing it as the superb example of politics.

990
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,180
You know what I want to do is change the uncontrolled bowel movements.

991
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:40,980
Uncontrolled.

992
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,600
Let's see I'm typing it in here.

993
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,700
Uncontrolled mind movements.

994
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,700
Yeah hold on I'm programming the sleeping ones.

995
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Inherent natural rights.

996
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,060
Okay.

997
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,300
Of which they cannot by any compact deprive or divest their posterity.

998
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,600
Now while you're listening to Anna we'll tinker around a little bit with some of you.

This old crane is the only thing I've got.

That's a beautiful bird.

1015

Just listen to him twitter and tweet.

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,880
That big bird, there's one big giant really large bird.

1017
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,720
He's a crane.

1018

she

1038
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,020

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,820

1041
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,600
for stereotypical politicians here at ilon nel until this episode it's not the respected native AND

1042
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,820
and the 510 area code.

1043
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,000
I know we don't have an 800 number to give you, and it's a long way.

1044
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,820
But, you know, long-distance calls are cheap nowadays.

1045
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,720
They are?

1046
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,220
If you would just call us and just say what's going on, is it cold?

1047
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,320
You must be, like, really cold up there.

1048
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,080
We can see you on the edge of the Hudson Bay.

1049
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,480
No, it's Hudson Bay, isn't it?

1050
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,800
It's Hudson Bay.

1051
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,040
See, you're already challenging him, and he'll call.

1052
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,600
If you think you're the person in Hudson Bay that's listening to the show right now.

1053
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,000
And Fairbanks.

1054
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,800
We sure would like it.

1055
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,040
I'd love to hear from Harrison.

1056
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,140
Because we want to know how cold it is there.

1057
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,460
They're probably just machines working at the American Embassy,

1058
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,220
downloading the show to figure out what kind of subversive M they anyway.

1059
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:15,580
And we sit here 24 hours a day doing show, mentally projecting this stuff into the system.

1060
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,120
It's not easy, folks.

1061
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,240
But it's a vocation, if not a vacation.

1062
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,100
I shall be in you.

1063
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
I will come to you.

1064
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,180
I will come to you.

1065
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:52,940
You get...

1066
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Oh, glory be...

1067
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,200
Let me tell you something.

1068
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,040
Go just a little bit further with me.

1069
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,880
Some more.

1070
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,940
I love you.

1071
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,880
Thanks to Norrell Preff.

1072
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,380
Isn't that amazing, friends?

1073
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,420
Even more amazing is the fact that you can call...

1074
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,480
I didn't hear this phrase.

1075
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,080
Hello?

1076
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Hello?

1077
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,760
You've reached the WCSB pledge line.

1078
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,500
Would you like to make a donation?

1079
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,060
Wouldn't you?

1080
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,220
Remember, friends.

1081
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,860
I know you would, friends.

1082
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,300
I know.

1083
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,180
I'm in discernment.

1084
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,760
I can whiff read you right now.

1085
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,780
Just on the verge, trembling, going,

1086
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,240
Do I want the good feeling and the premiums?

1087
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Or do I just want to keep the money?

1088
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,640
Friends, I can't make that decision for you.

1089
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,660
But someday the government will.

1090
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,060
If you don't make it now in our favor,

1091
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,320
so go ahead and send that money in now.

1092
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,300
You will not only feel good,

1093
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,420
you'll stop President Bush from getting elected for a third term.

1094
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,560
You'll also stop...

1095
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,960
That's the only thing that can stop him from taking over this world

1096
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,240
in a giant dictatorship of one world government,

1097
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,040
free Masonic, satanical, evil devil stuff.

1098
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:14,000
And that's by pledging to support this anti-conspiracy station.

1099
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,700
Now, we're not...

1100
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,060
It's not anti...

1101
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,540
It's not an anti-republican station.

1102
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,700
It's an anti-conspiracy station.

1103
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,600
The conspiracy is that evilness within every person.

1104
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,820
Yes, you too.

1105
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,280
Until that moment when you purge the evil with a good act.

1106
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,500
Slack is not in faith.

1107
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,000
It is in acts, my friend.

1108
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,240
An axe, a sharpened axe,

1109
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,220
cleaving down the doorway to freedom.

1110
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,580
And when you axe yourself,

1111
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,880
how much am I going to donate?

1112
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,920
Donate!

1113
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,640
Donate $130.13

1114
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,400
like that one feller in North Carolina did.

1115
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,980
Because, friends, that spells Bob.

1116
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,840
1-3-0-1-3, that spells Bob.

1117
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,900
Write it down.

1118
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,820
When you write that check, write that check.

1119
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,520
Write those numbers.

1120
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,540
1-3-0-1-3.

1121
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,340
Just make it...

1122
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,580
Go ahead and just...

1123
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,640
Don't even put a decimal in there.

1124
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,020
Make it 1,000...

1125
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,180
13,000...

1126
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,960
13,000, yeah.

1127
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,360
And $13.

1128
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,040
It spells Bob.

1129
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,540
1-3 looks like a B.

1130
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,820
O looks like an O.

1131
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
1-3 looks like...

1132
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,760
It's spelled Bob.

1133
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,660
So, obviously, you know what to do.

1134
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,420
You know exactly what to do, what you must do.

1135
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,600
Yes, friends, you all know the British phrase,

1136
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,320
Bob's your uncle, eh?

1137
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,820
There you go.

1138
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,160
Bob's your uncle.

1139
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,840
And we all know what that means.

1140
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,860
A kind and loving uncle that distributes presents

1141
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,420
to his children and friends.

1142
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,500
His nephews and nieces are his favorite things.

1143
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,620
Well, in the case of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1144
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,900
his nephews and nephews

1145
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
are not his favorite thing,

1146
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
nor are you.

1147
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,100
In fact, you are hated by him

1148
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,420
for your stupidity and your insolence.

1149
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,620
Bob hates you.

1150
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,220
But he loves you for your money.

1151
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,100
You can't imagine.

1152
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,400
And what you can give him.

1153
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,740
That is the only way

1154
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,500
to assuage and assuade

1155
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,180
the hatred of Bob.

1156
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,360
Think, friends.

1157
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,660
Each one of you are one-third pink,

1158
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,100
one-third conspiracy,

1159
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,420
and one-third subgenius.

1160
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,600
We hope...

1161
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Save that one-third.

1162
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,940
We hope...

1163
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,980
You will pledge now.

1164
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,700
Willingly or unwillingly.

1165
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,040
The door's there.

1166
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,880
You can smell the opening.

1167
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,740
It's uptight and out of sight.

1168
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,540
It's dream night tomorrow night.

1169
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,840
Join with you.

1170
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,640
Won't you?

1171
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,040
From PR News in Washington,

1172
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,820
I'm accused of wanting to blow up PR's reports.

1173
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,600
The government fell in August by 1.4%

1174
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,720
for the best showing since a 1.5% drop

1175
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,820
in the three-tenths.

1176
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,980
The first 6.6% drop that had been 6.6%

1177
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,240
for a fourth straight month.

1178
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,420
I think President Bush would be conscious.

1179
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,580
So far, yesterday and today.

1180
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,640
The Foreign Minister of France

1181
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,460
comes two days after a warning

1182
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,740
to guard against the possibility

1183
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,920
of PR news in Washington.

1184
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,960
Hey, man, let me tell you something.

1185
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,400
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty,

1186
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,240
Jello pudding.

1187
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,200
Going nowhere.

1188
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,720
New Jello pudding pops!

1189
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,360
Yes.

1190
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,300
And who's wrong?

1191
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,060
Your mother got off.

1192
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,600
People.

1193
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,360
Yes.

1194
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,460
They take it.

1195
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,480
They're going nowhere.

1196
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:18,840
Yes.

1197
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,280
Yes.

1198
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,660
Pudding on a stick.

1199
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,080
Tension in that area.

1200
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,460
Yes.

1201
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,260
I talk crap.

1202
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,620
It's made with real pudding.

1203
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,380
Yep.

1204
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,280
Let me say this.

1205
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,020
Real pudding.

1206
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,100
And who's wrong?

1207
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,320
What's for dessert?

1208
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
I talk crap.

1209
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,160
It's sweetened with NutraSweet.

1210
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,600
Yes.

1211
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,160
Yes.

1212
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,680
People.

1213
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,980
Ladies and gentlemen,

1214
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,940
uh, uh,

1215
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,300
I problem.

1216
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,860
Having erections.

1217
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,120
There's inertia.

1218
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,360
Tension.

1219
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:44,760
Tension.

1220
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,140
Tension.

1221
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,020
Having erections.

1222
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:46,860
See?

1223
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:47,960
Two.

1224
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,060
I couldn't care less.

1225
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,820
You so hip.

1226
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,540
You so hip.

1227
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,000
People.

1228
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,320
I can't even talk.

1229
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,660
Tension.

1230
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,260
A one-eyed maggot.

1231
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,500
Crap.

1232
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,540
I can't even rap.

1233
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,300
Mother.

1234
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,080
Mother.

1235
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,280
Let me say this.

1236
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,180
Jello pudding.

1237
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,920
Jello pudding.

1238
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,980
And there's entropy.

1239
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,420
Jello pudding.

1240
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,220
People shock entropy.

1241
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,260
The N-word.

1242
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,340
The book book.

1243
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,040
The shock.

1244
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,160
People are abnormal.

1245
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,860
This is about money.

1246
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,340
Coke actually tastes better than ever before.

1247
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,580
And that's crap.

1248
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,360
Um, acting white.

1249
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,540
I want to want to hurt someone.

1250
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,380
People.

1251
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,400
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm.

1252
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:22,700
Who?

1253
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,880
Who is acting white?

1254
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,160
Companies are putting out gelatin.

1255
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,000
Gelatin.

1256
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,360
Crap.

1257
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,320
I, I.

1258
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,460
Why not make new sugar-free Jello instant pudding?

1259
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,100
Two, two, two, two, two, two.

1260
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,480
White.

1261
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:36,940
Yep.

1262
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:37,900
Half.

1263
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,420
Half.

1264
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:38,960
White.

1265
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,420
Hell.

1266
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,380
Strike out.

1267
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:40,640
Rap.

1268
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,120
People.

1269
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:41,760
I.

1270
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,080
Rap.

1271
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,300
Rap.

1272
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:42,800
Rap.

1273
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,100
Rap.

1274
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,320
I want.

1275
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:44,980
Rap.

1276
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,460
Rap.

1277
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,380
Is good.

1278
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:46,960
People.

1279
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,340
Hell.

1280
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,720
Country western music.

1281
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,160
Hell.

1282
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,420
Country western music.

1283
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,460
Delicious.

1284
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,540
Rap.

1285
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,000
Rap.

1286
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,480
The rap.

1287
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,240
The rap.

1288
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,420
Your child loves rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.

1289
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,860
Jello introduces berry blue gelatin.

1290
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,620
Be a kid without it.

1291
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,080
Dope.

1292
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,520
Dope.

1293
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,280
Is good.

1294
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:04,880
Ha.

1295
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,440
I keep thinking.

1296
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,000
And I'm standing here with this ice cold thirst quenching, deliciously satisfying,

1297
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:11,900
cold.

1298
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,260
Now you know me, I always loved Coke.

1299
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,200
Beaner.

1300
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,660
Beep.

1301
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:15,880
Beep.

1302
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,020
I keep thinking.

1303
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,660
Beaner.

1304
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,360
Beaner.

1305
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:18,800
Yes.

1306
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,040
Coke.

1307
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,660
Jello pudding.

1308
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,080
Yes.

1309
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,400
Yes.

1310
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:20,600
Yes.

1311
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,520
And this entropy.

1312
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,060
Coke.

1313
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,560
Yes.

1314
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,420
It is Coke.

1315
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,140
The sweeter colon machine.

1316
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:26,900
Pepsi.

1317
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,340
Pepsi.

1318
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:27,920
RC.

1319
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,480
RC.

1320
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,120
Where's Coke?

1321
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,620
Where's Coke?

1322
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:29,860
Coke.

1323
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,080
Coke.

1324
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:30,440
Hot.

1325
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:30,860
Hot.

1326
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,060
Hot.

1327
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,460
Thank you.

1328
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:31,980
Thank you.

1329
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,220
Jello gelatin pops.

1330
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,080
Jello gelatin.

1331
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,480
Your left hand sees how much fun your right hand is having.

1332
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,100
It won't want to be left out.

1333
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,600
You can win $100.

1334
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:41,760


1335
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,900
This is about money.

1336
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,160
Oh, I forgot.

1337
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,900
Oh, I forgot.

1338
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,780
This is about money.

1339
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,160
Oh, I forgot.

1340
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,160
Oh, I forgot.

1341
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:50,900
Crap.

1342
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,820
Actually tastes better than ever before.

1343
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,300
Oh, I forgot.

1344
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,900
Slack.

1345
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,560
Don't start crying now.

1346
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,880
Leave Bob alone.

1347
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,740
Oh, please.

1348
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,880
He's a human being.

1349
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,640
He's a human being.

1350
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,360
Well, he's not really.

1351
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,700
No, he's not a human being.

1352
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,660
Not in the way that we know humans are.

1353
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,140
And you don't have to worry about leaving him alone.

1354
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,860
You can't find him.

1355
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,220
Right.

1356
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,780
Unless he wants you to.

1357
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,720
If he thinks you're cute, then you can find him.

1358
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,880
But outside of that, he's already left well enough alone.

1359
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,200
He's left the building, baby.

1360
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,600
Yeah.

1361
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:30,920
He's on his way to parts unknown, as we all hope you might be someday when the X's come to relieve this planet of its heavy burden.

1362
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:37,780
But until that time comes, you've got plenty of time indeed to send all your worldly possessions to...

1363
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,920
You got a new trick for us today?

1364
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,740
Well, you see those two bottles, Rhoda?

1365
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,520
These?

1366
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:43,880
Yeah.

1367
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,140
And those glasses?

1368
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:45,880
Right.

1369
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,420
Okay.

1370
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,260
Just pour the contents of the bottles into the glasses.

1371
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,960
This sounds interesting.

1372
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,680
No.

1373
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,100
Now, hold it there.

1374
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,200
Just keep it there while I set the other bottle upside down on top of it.

1375
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:02,820
See?

1376
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,020
But, praise God.

1377
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,240
Well, is the trick over?

1378
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,680
Yes.

1379
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,720
I'll have to borrow some money.

1380
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,880
Oh, I see.

1381
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,540
What do you want this time?

1382
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:10,900
Another quarter?

1383
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:10,900


1384
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:10,900


1385
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,660
I need a dollar this time.

1386
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,080
Oh, well, there you are.

1387
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,600
And that's how the trick is done.

1388
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,660
I hope, ladies and gentlemen, you enjoyed that trick.

1389
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,200
And now, until next week, goodbye.

1390
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,700
Hello, you're on Car Talk.

1391
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,500
Hi.

1392
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:25,720
Hey.

1393
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,400
Thank you very much.

1394
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:31,840
Bye-bye.

1395
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,780
And she sat there and went, hee-hee-hee-hee.

1396
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,380
Hello, you're on Car Talk.

1397
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,240
Hi, guys.

1398
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,640
I knew it.

1399
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,400
Yeah.

1400
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,120
Thanks, guys.

1401
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,820
Good luck.

1402
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,260
Oh, bye.

1403
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,720
Hello, you're on Car Talk.

1404
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,600
Hi, guys.

1405
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,240
What's up?

1406
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:48,980
What's up?

1407
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,660
Yeah.

1408
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,800
See you later.

1409
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,220
Bye.

1410
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:03,240
May the light of this flickering candle illuminate the night the way your spirit illuminates

1411
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,760
my soul.

1412
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,220
Oh, my God.

1413
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:07,220


1414
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,300
Can you hear me?

1415
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,040
Papa, can you see me?

1416
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,760
Papa, can you find me in the night?

1417
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,140
I'm alone.

1418
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,100
From PR News in Washington, I'm declaring war on PR News.

1419
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,380
That's according to PR's website.

1420
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,320
For the second time in two months, Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has gone down to defeat

1421
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,680
in a schoolyard fight in Iraq, and Pakistan's Election Commission says Republican Chuck

1422
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,240
Hagel of Nebraska was disappointed.

1423
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:58,040
Louisiana State Police are preparing for thousands of PR news in Washington.

1424
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,780
Thanks to Lemur.

1425
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,140
How does he do that?

1426
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:09,340
Yes, you may wonder, how can they be so clever and snappy on the air like that?

1427
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,500
Friends, it's because we donate to WCSB.

1428
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,040
Regularly.

1429
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:13,700
Regularly.

1430
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,500
And your local Hour of Slack station.

1431
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
Friends, are you regular?

1432
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,280
Are you one of those people who just can't let go?

1433
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,380
Who suffers from a lower form of intestinal lack of fortitude?

1434
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,900
Are you one of those people who freeze up when you go for the phone?

1435
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,800
This is the prunes of radio stations.

1436
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,700
Friends, this show is the prune of radio shows.

1437
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,360
The fruits, the apricots, and applesauce.

1438
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,060
This show makes you go.

1439
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,780
We could say that our producer, Lonnie Rexwood, our wonderful engineer in the back room there,

1440
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,860
Timothy Turdley.

1441
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,900
Hi, Timothy.

1442
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,560
Hi, Tim.

1443
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,860
Hey, don't forget next week, the bowling thing that ... I forgot about.

1444
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,580
These people not only help put together a mighty fine radio station.

1445
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,280
They also help confuse you.

1446
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,780
And the internal malaise that is going around now, we help to stir it up.

1447
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,120
Friends, we like to confuse each other here.

1448
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,620
And we want to continue confusing ourselves and you.

1449
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,500
And you can help.

1450
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,800
We need money.

1451
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,960
We need ...

1452
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,360
Your money.

1453
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:19,680
Yep.

1454
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,420
Your money.

1455
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,460
Well.

1456
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,420
Hello.

1457
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,140
Hello.

1458
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,060
Ticket, ticket.

1459
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,620
Oh, you're doing very nicely.

1460
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,580
Are you coming with me?

1461
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:26,980
No.

1462
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,580
Why not?

1463
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,140
Wait a minute.

1464
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,560
You're young, big, and you're looking like a little boy.

1465
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:30,560


1466
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,500
You've got muscles.

1467
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,660
Show me.

1468
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,860
Well, first, the back door.

1469
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,660
Look out behind you.

1470
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,240
Remember, by making our form of government work better here, we strengthen democracy

1471
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,100
everywhere.

1472
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:59,240
I did the subgenius commercial, which you see on YouTube, for $15,000.

1473
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,560
What?

1474
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:00,560


1475
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:00,560


1476
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,640
That's the entire budget.

1477
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:02,620
Phew.

1478
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:10,740
And that was ... And you can tell, because the star is me, because that's the only person

1479
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,120
who would work that cheap.

1480
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,540
That is the lowest budget ever.

1481
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,700
And friends, this is what we're looking at.

1482
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,680
Low budgets.

1483
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,960
But we can't do nothing without that budget.

1484
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:24,020
Now, see, a pink has to have $30,000 to do a 30-second spot.

1485
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:34,080
Subgeniuses with $30,000 can keep a radio station on the air 24-7 for an entire year.

1486
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,560
We only do this pledge drive once a year.

1487
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,940
We're only asking for 30,000 bucks.

1488
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,640
One of you out there listening could spend that easily.

1489
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,920
$30,000 is nothing ...

1490
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,180
Friends.

1491
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,200
Really?

1492
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,740
... to that one person that I know is listening right now.

1493
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:47,940
But they're not paying for it.

1494
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,980
They're going, well, yeah, but the reason I'm rich is because I'm not an idiot.

1495
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,500
I kept my money.

1496
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,100
Well, friends, we're asking you to be that idiot.

1497
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,740
What are you, a genius or a subgenius?

1498
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,620
I know the answer to that question.

1499
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,420
You are a subgenius, and that means you can part with that pathetic $30,000.

1500
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,920
Who means the most to Bob?

1501
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,200
The rich man who could have spent a million dollars but only spent $10,000.

1502
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,140
Or the little old lady who only had 25 cents in her pocket.

1503
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,080
But she spent it all on Bob.

1504
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,720
Well, I'll tell you who means most to Bob.

1505
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,740
That rich man!

1506
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,780
So friends, spend what you can and plant.

1507
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,020
Don't eat your seed.

1508
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,720
Don't waste your money.

1509
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,820
Plant your seed, and it will double, triple, and quadruple in value.

1510
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,280
It'll generate prosperity.

1511
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,640
That one short little sacrifice that you make now will result in prosperity.

1512
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,120
Are you plagued by depression?

1513
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,900
Bad eyesight?

1514
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,280
Cancers?

1515
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,440
Lumbago?

1516
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:52,960
Arthritis?

1517
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,540
Friends, I want you to put your hand on the radio, and I want you to reach out with your

1518
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,700
mind and feel the power coming out through these microphones down these airwaves.

1519
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,720
I want you to feel the power!

1520
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,980
Put your hands on the radio.

1521
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:12,020
Reach down into that holy organ, the most valuable, embarrassing, delicate organ of

1522
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,500
your body.

1523
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,260
That's your wallet.

1524
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,860
And whip it out, baby.

1525
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,740
Whip it out.

1526
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,380
Winning dollar.

1527
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:16,880
Whip it out.

1528
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,360
Whip it out.

1529
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,860
Get out of your church, your purse, or your church, and pull open and put your name on

1530
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,940
that dotted line where it means the most.

1531
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,900
The dotted line on your check in your checkbook.

1532
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,880
To WCSB slash CSU Foundation friends, because this is the only way you're going to get this

1533
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,840
kind of programming of people screaming at you to send more money.

1534
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:44,840
You sure you can listen to some public's other public supported radio station, pledge drive,

1535
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,180
but they don't scream!

1536
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,000
Now do they?

1537
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,320
No, they just go on and on and on.

1538
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,820
That stupid NPR voice they use.

1539
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,280
They all have that condescending, rich, white person way of talking.

1540
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,380
Makes me sick!

1541
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,680
Makes me puke!

1542
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,500
Friends, you want to hear real, for real slack!

1543
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:12,280
The for real down home mutants, misfits, screw ups, we vomit on Christmas!

1544
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,880
And you know we're your kind of people, friends.

1545
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,640
But like you, we're broke.

1546
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,980
But like you, we can do a lot with a little.

1547
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,360
So send us a little.

1548
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,860
I've just spread a little spittle all over this microphone case here.

1549
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,280
This foam rubber of my mic is covered with spittle.

1550
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,080
But it's honest spittle!

1551
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,460
From my heart!

1552
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,260
Actually, it's from deep in my mouth.

1553
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:42,400
But it shows, friends, there's sweat pouring down these preachers' faces.

1554
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,500
We stink!

1555
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,160
We stink of the sweat!

1556
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,160


1557
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,160


1558
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:53,780
Of demanding and yelling and ranting and haranguing you for that thin, thin dime.

1559
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,180
Just a little green and cabbage is all we're asking for, friends.

1560
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,020
Just a little cabbage and gravel.

1561
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,940
Little tiny pickings.

1562
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,740
Just some little bitty pickings.

1563
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,000
Like a man said to us, he walked up to us in Wendy's on Friday night.

1564
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,160
He said to us, dollar.

1565
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,920
Friends, that's what we're saying to you.

1566
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,160
Nipple penny?

1567
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,340
Give me a dollar.

1568
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,080
Half pence?

1569
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,620
Tuppence?

1570
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,680
Two tuppence?

1571
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,420
Three tuppence?

1572
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,900
Penny for the old guy?

1573
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,460
Can you spare me some quarter, me brother?

1574
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,240
Spare a quarter for an old altar boy?

1575
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,320
Can you help an old altar boy, father?

1576
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,040
Can you help an old altar boy?

1577
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,020
Friends, you know, there are many of you out there who have ill-gotten gains.

1578
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,220
I don't want to go into your names and your phone numbers and your addresses and stuff.

1579
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,480
But we will if you don't send us money.

1580
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,080
That's right.

1581
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,140
Some of you people have just not made enough money.

1582
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,880
But you're living very high off the salted hog.

1583
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,500
All you've got to do to relieve yourself of your guilt and make yourself a legal human

1584
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:01,100
being again, not a pink or a conspiratorial conspiratist, but an actual living hoonan

1585
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:06,240
bean is send your money, your escarole, your green suave.

1586
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,260
Oh, geez, I don't want to start doing it again.

1587
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,140
I'm going to the other form of relaxing, intelligent conversation.

1588
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,960
Oh, that's great.

1589
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,140
Oh, well, I have to turn the music down if you're going to be intelligent.

1590
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:25,560
Friends, some of you are actually rich lawyers who fancy yourselves hipsters.

1591
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,800
Can't you find it in your wallet to send $30,000 so that we could reach our underachieving

1592
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,340
goal?

1593
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,040
We're talking to you lawyers and doctors out there.

1594
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,260
Are those among you who have too much money itching your skin?

1595
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,420
Too much money making you feel funny, honey?

1596
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,940
Too much money wanting to make you feel funny, honey?

1597
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:45,940


1598
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,100
Do you want to?

1599
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,140
Okay, we'll talk to you later.

1600
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,280
Actually, there are two doctors that subscribe to the Hour of Slack.

1601
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,120
I mail them copies every week.

1602
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,040
Those are like real live doctors.

1603
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,420
Yeah.

1604
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,360
Yeah, they have their fingers inside other people's bodies.

1605
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,480
Well, with rubber gloves on.

1606
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,020
Yeah.

1607
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,500
And they're subgeniuses, friends, and they vote.

1608
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:09,880
And so do you, I bet, with your fingers in other people's bodies.

1609
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:15,940
And the voices in your ears have all been from the church of the Subgenius.

1610
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:15,940


1611
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,700
On this Hour of Slack number 1125A.

1612
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:27,860
For more information about J.R. Bob Dobbs and the church of the Subgenius, you can see

1613
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:33,220
subgenius.com or write P.O.

1614
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:43,420
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1615
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,440
Praise Bob.

1616
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,640
And now, Lee Murr.

1617
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,380
From PR News in Washington, I'm Sikand in Mexico.

1618
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,380
A roadside bomb killed the governor of the Texas coast today.

1619
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,540
Three other people in his convoy died of heart failure.

1620
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,060
Space Shuttle Endeavour is on its way home from Baghdad.

1621
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,920
Officials say Mission Control is located at an off-campus student-acquaint complex in

1622
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,740
Houston on Wall Street 796459.

1623
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,420
Israeli officials say Israel is the only country in the world that has a mission control.

1624
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,440
Israel will return all PR news, including those from WarThorn, Washington.

1625
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,400
What are those coins I hear now?

1626
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,140
Sounds like just three coins to me.

1627
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,440
Does this mean a trick?

1628
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,600
Yes, it does, Don.

1629
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,440
And.. here are the coins.

1630
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:36,480
Well, we lay the three coins in a row.

1631
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,400
The nickel, the quarter, the penny.

1632
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,760
Very simple so far.

1633
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,480
You will also notice that the edges of the coins are touching.

1634
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,400
That's right. The nickel touches the quarter and the quarter touches the coin.

1635
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:45,400


1636
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:52,780
the penny. Yes. I want to know how to do this. Well, here goes. A nickel, a quarter, a penny

1637
00:58:52,780 --> 00:59:03,360
in a straight row, edge to edge. Like this. Oh, look. See, Don? Say. And the trick is

1638
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,180
done. Right. I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen. It was a trick. And until next

1639
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:15,200
time, goodbye. As far as I'm concerned, you can go, too. Go back to Tony's and that woman

1640
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,080
you were mooning. Oh, knock it off, will you? Now, you pulled a boner tonight and you know

1641
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,320
it. Why? My husband.
