1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,120
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,800
It's chaotic.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,580
And it's X day coming up.

4
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,040
But we've had a screw up on our catalog, our online catalog that I need to tell you about.

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,440
Because if you ordered anything between May 20th and May 30th, you still have your money.

6
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,720
And I didn't get your order for Knife and Ivans, this section of the Subgenius website.

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,540
If you ordered membership or books or ministership.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,620
T-shirts, you're cool.

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,860
That's no problem.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,660
But if you ordered the CDs or the videos, those go to me.

11
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,960
And if you sent me a letter begging me to give you reasons to not kill yourself.

12
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,540
Man, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,680
You're going to have to send it again if it's not too late.

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,240
But you'd be a dumbass to be a subgenius and kill yourself before X day.

15
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,740
No, my friends.

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,540
You'd be a dumbass not to if you're a human.

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,760
Because X day.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,760
5,000.

19
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,780
Annihilating.

20
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,380
Hell.

21
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,000
Hell.

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,640
Hell.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,800
All right.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,020
It's X day, friends.

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,220
X day is coming quick.

26
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,920
You better get that information from the Church of the Subgenius.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,900
If you want to survive X day.

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Or if you just want to go to the big party in Brushwood, New York.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,940
Or hell, have your own party, friends.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,500
We don't care.

31
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,580
The X's are going to pick you up no matter where you are.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
If you're a news band subgenius member.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,980
So, friends, check that catalog.

34
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,640
The subgenius website.

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,980
www.subgenius.com

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Or write to the sacred P.O. box number at the end of this broadcast.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,740
And friends, now we're going to go back into the X day's past.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,300
Which then tell us about X day's future.

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,840
Because the previous X days, I guess, were all X day drills.

40
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,160
What we will experience from now on had better be the real thing.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,440
Friends, or else, or else, well, I guess Bob just slacked off.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,980
And maybe that's what happened to Knife and Knife.

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,800
And Ivan's email.

45
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,140
And friends, if you ordered a membership, a book, or a t-shirt, or a Bob mug.

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,000
Everything is cool.

47
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,640
Those go through Cafe Press.

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,460
But I stank.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,640
So, the video and audios.

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
Because I'll be damned, friends.

51
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,620
I'll be damned if a pink in a suit gets one dime for subgenius talent at work.

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,540
Even if my bank account suffers too.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
And is damned.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,180
Because, my friend, I am that ornery.

55
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,120
I'm that ornery.

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Because I'm keeping up the F-I-B.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
The faith in Bob.

58
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,400
Praise Bob.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,100
Help me, somebody.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,160
This background music is by Lamb Prey Systems.

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:59,160
On July 5th, 1998, 7 AM, when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scripture is called, the

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


71
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


74
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,160


75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,920
Advent of the Angelic Host.

76
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,100
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,860
Only his predictions are just a little different.

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:26,340
July 5th, 1998, at 7 AM, to be exact, the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them, will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

79
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,140
And believe it or not, plenty of people, four or five, will be there.

80
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,500
Four thousand of them so far, and more every day, have already joined up.

81
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,080
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,440
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

83
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,020
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,300
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

85
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,420
Remember now.

86
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,420
It's no surprise, if I should be found dead someday, I'll think that you were in the way.

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, gimme Bob.

88
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,040
Confusing that face.

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,200
With my own.

90
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,640
Can't remember my place.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,320
Bob's role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold on that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.

92
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,880
When the men from Planet X arrive.

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,960
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous.

94
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,740
It may sound ridiculous to many of the believers out there.

95
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,740
It may sound impossible.

96
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,540
All nuts, all those people.

97
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,280
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,940
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbant.

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,920
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

100
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,520
Evil stalks them.

101
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

102
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,160
Do they come down in flying saucers?

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,660
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

104
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,560
We don't know what to do.

105
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,700
We're here all alone.

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,720
The planets are fading.

107
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,260
The blood is running.

108
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,020
The lights were fading.

109
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,760
And they stalked us one by one.

110
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,580
Hooray.

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,780
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,160
Jerry Reith and Dr. Morabund there.

113
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,060
Some, uh, Pope David and Meyer.

114
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,340
And before that, Dr. Howell.

115
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,740
And puzzling evidence from old media barrage types, friends.

116
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:36,400
And now, twisted by pater nostril, Dr. Katahdin Legume.

117
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,940
The earth was bleeding thick black blood.

118
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,460
And it smelled like blood.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
And it looked like blood.

120
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Oh, yeah.

121
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,560
And every day, every day I'd wait for my daddy to come home from work.

122
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,600
And he'd come into the house.

123
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,960
And he'd be all covered in that thick black blood.

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
He'd have that blood in his hair.

125
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,400
He'd have that blood in his clothes.

126
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,600
He'd have that blood caked around his nails.

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,080
He was covered in that blood.

128
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,360
And I'd look up at my daddy all covered with that blood.

129
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,960
And I'd say,

130
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,440
Daddy, someday I want to be just like you.

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,580
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a father.

132
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,880
And a fully grown adult.

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:34,080
Lack of involvement with the father or over involvement with the mother can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual peace.

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
And in homosexual leanings, narcissism, transsexuality,

135
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,100
Curls from the waist up and from the waist down,

136
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,740
Attempts to be your own love object.

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,120
Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once.

138
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,520
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man.

139
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,160
But this tends to get overlooked by our mother fixated overweight sexist media.

140
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,220
So,

141
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:12,620
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

142
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,240
If you give in to them every time they cry,

143
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,120
They will become little tyrants.

144
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,510
But they won't remember why.

145
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,150
Then when they are thwarted by people in later life,

146
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,310
They will become psychotic and they won't make an ideal husband or wife.

147
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:45,350
The spoiled baby grows into the escapist teenager who's the adult alcoholic who's the middle aged suicide boy.

148
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:45,870
So,

149
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,450
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

150
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:50,810
So,

151
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,410
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

152
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,810
When them saucers come, you're gonna need a clean pair of underwear.

153
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,290
It's like your mama said,

154
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,750
Make sure you're wearing clean underwear, you might get into an accident.

155
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,490
But it won't be an accident, brothers and sisters.

156
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,590
Let me tell you,

157
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,850
I will be happy to leave you,

158
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,150
Twisting in the wind.

159
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,470
Amen, brothers and sisters.

160
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,210
I am the God of Hellfire,

161
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,930
And I bring you,

162
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,870
Fire!

163
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,330
I'll take you to burn.

164
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,750
Fire!

165
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,290
I'll take you to learn.

166
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,050
I'll see you burn!

167
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,250
You pour tar in your safe ender,

168
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,410
But all the birds come to me.

169
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,210
Fire!

170
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,530
Yes, you might, you tiny might,

171
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,270
You know you've really been so blind.

172
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,870
Yes, you might, you tiny might,

173
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,470
You've fallen far too far behind.

174
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,330
Oh no!

175
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,090
Oh no!

176
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,670
Oh no!

177
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,730
You're gonna burn!

178
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,490
We've got bar and they don't!

179
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,910
And for that, we can hate them!

180
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,270
Hate them!

181
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,550
Hate them!

182
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,670
Fire!

183
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,610
Fire!

184
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,210
To destroy all you've done.

185
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,510
Fire!

186
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,970
To end all you've become.

187
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,650
I'll see you burn!

188
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,890
You've been living like a little girl,

189
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,130
In the middle of your little world.

190
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,890
Mind your mind, you tiny mind

191
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,570
You know you've really been so blind

192
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,230
Now's your time, burn your mind

193
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,670
You're falling far too far behind

194
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:05,110
This is the generation that shall see

195
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,550
The bleeding flesh of the earth

196
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,610
And the broken bones of time

197
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,390
Can I get a praise bow?

198
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,630
Yes, brothers and sisters

199
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,990
Humanity is about to take the next big evolutionary step

200
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,170
Into the grave

201
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,990
Can I get an amen?

202
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,410
Oh yes, can I get a praise bow?

203
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,490
Oh

204
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:31,850
Fire

205
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,230
I take it true

206
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,670
Fire

207
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,430
I burn it for you

208
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,310
Fire

209
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,610
Fire

210
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,610
They're going to burn

211
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,230
They're going to burn

212
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,450
Burn

213
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,650
Burn

214
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,210
Burn

215
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,870
Burn

216
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,810
Burn

217
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,870
Burn

218
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,590
Burn

219
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,770
Our hate is not wisdom

220
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,070
Our hate is not wisdom

221
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,190
Our hate is not wisdom

222
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,390
Our hate is not wisdom

223
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,430
Our hate is not wisdom

224
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,430

235
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,590
Wasted on individuals.

236
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,550
No, they're such, our nations even, such vessels are far too small to contain our great hate.

238
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:33,250
Yes, friends, ours is an all-consuming and all-encompassing and all-pervading hate.

239
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,990
A radioactive hate.

240
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,550
A burning, scouring, annihilating hate.

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,430
And that's when, when you build it up that, pump it up that much, friends,

242
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,090
that's when you start to become the hate.

243
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,450
Put on your PJs, you manly, cause it's bedtime.

244
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,730
If you're strong inside your body, you don't know when you're gonna check it out.

245
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,810
You're gonna die.

246
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,710
He's powerful and he's visible.

247
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,470
Chance gets a lot, man.

248
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,710
He can create everything he can because of one man's sin.

249
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,610
He's cursed all the earth.

250
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,850
You can let the old together.

251
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,130
Yeah, God does.

252
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,690
He's gonna come back and prevent us.

253
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,970
That means you too.

254
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,830
You know, Jesus said, unless you're a thing, you're a rigtht日.

255
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,850
How can you escape theheet?

256
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,590
No, I've not recorded it.

257
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,270
You are powerful.

258
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,530
You're a rabbit.

260
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,110
You're a rabbit.

261
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:58,850
You're a rabbit.

Th Dennison.

274
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,050
Christianity is kind of like a silicone titty implant.

275
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,790
Oh, they look great.

276
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,750
They look great.

277
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,610
They feel great.

278
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,510
They feel great.

279
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,250
But they're fake.

280
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,170
But they're fake.

281
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,750
And deep inside.

282
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,950
And deep inside.

283
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,070
Alerts an ugly spark of cancer.

284
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,530
Yes, brothers and sisters.

285
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,450
Yes, brothers and sisters.

286
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,010
Cancer.

287
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,110
The cancer of fear.

288
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,470
Oh, yeah, the cancer of fear eats away at them.

289
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,010
That's what their whole religion's around.

290
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,070
Fear of Satan.

291
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,690
Fear of sex.

292
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,710
Fear of sex.

293
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,330
Fear of sex.

294
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,170
Fear of...

295
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,270
Fear of...

296
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,550
Tupacabras.

297
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,570
Tupacabras.

298
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,170
Fear of alien abduction.

299
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,210
Fear of alien abduction.

300
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,550
Fear of alien abduction.

301
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,670
Fear of...

302
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,770
Fear of...

303
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:07,950
Paparazzi.

304
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,910
Paparazzi.

305
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,890
Paparazzi.

306
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,230
Why?

307
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,150
Why?

308
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,650
They're afraid to wash their genitals.

309
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,750
They're afraid to wash their genitals.

310
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,890
They don't look God to think they're masturbating.

311
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,910
They don't look God to think they're masturbating.

312
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,550
Oh, yes.

313
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,650
Oh, yes.

314
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,430
Oh, yes.

315
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,430
They really do have something to fear.

316
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,770
They have...

317
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,750
They have...

318
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,370
They have Bob to fear.

319
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,550
And they have his mighty church of the subgenius to fear.

320
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,430
They have X days to fear.

321
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,610
They have a mountain to fear.

322
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:39,610


323
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,810
They are very, very young.

324
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:50,770
They are very, very, very young.

325
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,930
Shit.

326
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,490
Shit.

327
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,650


328
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,650


329
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,650


330
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,650


331
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,650


332
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,650


333
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,290
Shit.

334
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,690
Shit.

335
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,310
Shit.

336
00:15:59,550 --> 00:15:59,830
Shit.

337
00:15:59,830 --> 00:15:59,830


338
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,990
Should.

339
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,790
In second hope.

340
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,470
It's jadi Mes Gimme.

341
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,650
感じ.

342
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,670
Yes.

343
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,290
I'm waiting.

344
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,050


345
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,010
Yes.

346
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:19,770
Extinction seems to be a plausible risk Whatever happens we're unboundable things

347
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:28,390
In my mind, I'm in a daze, what is my fault?

348
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,830
Take the salt from my tears, take the wealth of my years

349
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,630
Take it in, I'm already done with you

350
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,210
Resilience my show, always don't even know

351
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,910
Singing in the millennium radio

352
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,910
I'm out of here, I'm out of here

353
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,810
After all, we've only got a few months to live

354
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,570
Bob will come in the spring, we know he will

355
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,510
Yeah, brothers and sisters

356
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,270
Oh yeah, brothers and sisters

357
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,430
But there's not a lot of time remaining for you

358
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,310
There's not a lot of time remaining for you

359
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,750
It's just a few months away

360
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,710
Y'all are gonna die, no judge will stand on you

361
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,450
You don't have a subject, you might as well start to die

362
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,070
Oh yeah, the river is rising, brothers and sisters

363
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,750
The river is rising, brothers and sisters

364
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,270
The river is rising, you're gonna turn around

365
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,530
Bob Dobbs and his church of the subtenues

366
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,650
Are offering you a personal flotation device

367
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,970
Yes, a mighty surfboard of slack

368
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,570
So that you can hang ten into shag and grilla

369
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:19,750
Yes, I am Bernal, I am a true, true, true

370
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,530
Sam Thiel

371
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,050
It's the time to spit on this

372
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,910
It's the top 10 top 10

373
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,370
Nice como

374
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:32,970
反 extra that

375
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,350
Theuke

376
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,510
Nice como

377
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,830
Five, a few passing through

378
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,410
I'm ready for this world to go

379
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,350
Taste the sounds of my tears

380
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,990
Think the wealth of my years

381
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,750
Singing in my body, I'm with you

382
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,890
That's a new just for show

383
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,290
Always does it right now

384
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,990
Singing in my body, I'm with you

385
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,950
Ah hello, it's nice to see you all here

386
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,470
Now, as the more perceptive of you've probably realised by now

387
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,430
This is hell

388
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,910
And I am the devil

389
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,590
Good evening

390
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,610
But you can call me Toby if you like

391
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,890
We try to keep things informal here

392
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,490
As well as infernal

393
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,970
That's just a little joke of mine

394
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,410
I tell it every time

395
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,450
Now, you're all here for eternity

396
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,470
Which I hardly need to tell you

397
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,050
It's a heck of a long time

398
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,590
So you'll all get to know each other pretty well by the end

399
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,930
But for now I'm going to have to split you up into groups

400
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,230
Will you stop screaming?

401
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,590
Now, murderers

402
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,630
Murderers, over here please

403
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,150
Thank you

404
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,790
Looters and pillagers over here

405
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,930
Thieves, if you could join them

406
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,930
And lawyers, you're in that group

407
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,550
Fornicators, if you could step forward

408
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,530
My god, there are a lot of you

409
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,910
Could I split you up into adulterers and the rest

410
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,910
Male adulterers, if you could just form a line in front of that small guillotine in the corner there

411
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,350
Okay, um, atheists

412
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,790
Atheists, over here please

413
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,730
You must be feeling a right bunch of nitwit

414
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,050
I think so

415
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,750
And finally, you're all here for a little bit of fun

416
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,470
Finally, Christians

417
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,130
Christians

418
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,930
Ah yes, I'm sorry, I'm afraid the Jews were right

419
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,610
If you could come up here

420
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,470
That'd be really kind, thank you

421
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,750
Okay, right, well are there any questions?

422
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,450
Yes

423
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,170
No, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets

424
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:12,130
Um, if you'd read your Bible you might have seen that it was damnation without relief

425
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,890
So if you didn't go before you came

426
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,750
Then I'm afraid you're not going to enjoy yourself very much

427
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,250
But then I believe that's the idea

428
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,750
I'll run

429
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,410
Up the mountain

430
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,030
I'll kiss my hands

431
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,410
In fact, they both used exactly the same source material.

432
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,930
Human urine.

433
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:23,050
By exaggerating vast quantities of urine, sometimes up to 200 gallons at a time,

434
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,330
the Chinese were able to produce just a few ounces of these valuable salt crystals.

435
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:37,430
The crystals contained a concentration of human steroids and the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.

436
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:44,390
The resulting preparations were widely used to boost fertility, increase sexual potency,

437
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,910
treat various sexual disorders, and to improve the quality of life.

438
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,130
And in some cases, even encourage the growth of the beard.

439
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,910
To be continued...

440
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,790
pronounce the final epithet

441
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,970
that's gonna take you off

442
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,030
this world.

443
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,830
Who gonna speak for you?

444
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,950
Who gonna talk for Earth?

445
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,110
We know who speaks for the nation.

446
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,830
But who speaks for the planet?

447
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,310
Who speaks for Earth?

448
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,690
Coal giants of steel.

449
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,650
Umbrings without hearts.

450
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,650
Human beings without minds.

451
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,970
A world of pain.

452
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,110
No luxury.

453
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,210
No comfort.

454
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,310
No delight.

455
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,310
Suffering at every corner.

456
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,090
Enjoy yourself.

457
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,050
Enjoy yourself.

458
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,950
We must get out.

459
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,470
We must get out.

460
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,990
We must get out this place.

461
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,470
Is it all now?

462
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,870
There is no future.

463
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,190
We have destroyed

464
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,910
the last.

465
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,610
And we're living.

466
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,610
First we will enslave the Earth.

467
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,210
And we'll slave the Earth.

468
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,810
This is the way it's been done

469
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,730
for billions of years.

470
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,330
This is the way it's been done

471
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:54,930
for billions of years.

472
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,910
And this is the

473
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,630
slut-jawed face of evolution.

474
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,130
This is the way it's been done

475
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,530
This is the slow-pitting,

476
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,810
slumbering, lullabering face

477
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,750
of evolution.

478
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,650
And uh,

479
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,850
you know even if X-Day doesn't work out

480
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,510
we'll go for

481
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,890
Sex Day!

482
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:12,690
Yeah!

483
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,910
We want you to have a dance in the air.

484
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,450
We want you to have

485
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:28,450


486
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,470


487
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,030
for the rest of your life.

488
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,530
It is

489
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,930
we're all part of the decent male

490
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:30,930


491
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,830
Actually it's not all the Kind.

492
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,170
It's the sameع

493
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,970
not what we're called.

494
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,510
Is it just a little?

495
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:45,870
write you a couple words I'llиться if you're that making a plug about want a soap job.

496
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,710
pills, but you're just too blind

497
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,650
yet dumb to see them.

498
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,830
Oh,

499
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,230
oh, friends,

500
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,250
I know you're not

501
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,790
the dumb-asticated

502
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,830
type. I know you're

503
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,850
the smart-asticated type.

504
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,870
Oh, but

505
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,490
people say,

506
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,650
Reverend Stagg, what is

507
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,750
slack? I want you to tell me

508
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,590
what slack is.

509
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,730
No, friends,

510
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,850
the television

511
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,570
doesn't have to watch

512
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,590
you as long as

513
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,170
you are watching the television.

514
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,730
And a lot of people,

515
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,590
a lot of people think that slack is

516
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,130
that Miller Beer commercial

517
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,210
where everybody's good-looking

518
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,710
and you're rich and your team just won the game

519
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,250
and you're drinking Miller Beer

520
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,050
and your favorite show is on.

521
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,710
And you know that's bullshit

522
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,170
because slack is not laziness, friends.

523
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,050
Slack is getting

524
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,510
into the zone. It's

525
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,030
being awake and alert

526
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,090
and doing what you wanted to do

527
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,550
until your eyes snap open

528
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,030
and you're smart enough

529
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,430
to realize that you are

530
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,510
God. Life is worth

531
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,530
living and everything is just

532
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,430
as psychedelic as an old

533
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,570
t-shirt that you can't fit into

534
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,570
anymore. Now, hold

535
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,550
that thought. Hold it

536
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,470
in your head because that is what

537
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,750
slack is all about, friends.

538
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,730
Slack is

539
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,890
something for nothing.

540
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,930
.

541
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,550
.

542
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,310
.

543
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,710
.

544
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,130
.

545
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


546
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


547
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


548
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


549
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


550
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


551
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


552
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,130


553
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,990
.

554
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,250
I cut my

555
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:44,350
.

556
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,490
.

557
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,390
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.

558
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,510
It swelled up to the size of a human head.

559
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,110
And then a mouth opened on it.

560
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,090
And this is what it said.

561
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,510
It said it killed the pink boys.

562
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,570
Quit your job.

563
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,090
Mock the world and worship Bob Dobbs.

564
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,170
We'll build a ship and take a trip.

565
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,130
Come on and get a pay ride to coordinates.

566
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,950
Three and a half months in my garage.

567
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,490
Tearing parts off of old used cars.

568
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,850
My groin at this point was unusually large.

569
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,330
It would occasionally hum while smoking cigars.

570
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,630
Our project was finished.

571
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,810
This ship would hold twenty.

572
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,170
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny.

573
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,130
We didn't need the slackless. They're hapless.

574
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,630
Our mercurial work is escaping a stark fix.

575
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,790
On our way to planet extra sex.

576
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,450
The next next.

577
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,030
The parry's with Harry Potter money shot at Connie Twa.

578
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,770
It's an all haas hour of bonanza.

579
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,130
It's like a world without Tony Danza.

580
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,230
A banza. The pink shit that gets the charts.

581
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,490
We hit a world of dead hearts.

582
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,590
I will paint this lobotomy and sodomy.

583
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,990
We take a moment and we pause to reflect on the pinks that we killed.

584
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,230
And the planet that they wrecked.

585
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,430
And we laugh like babies.

586
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,630
We're a victory dance.

587
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,210
In our under rooms and panties.

588
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,730
Our fantasy is a reality.

589
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,970
Earth turns to dust. Planet X are bust for us.

590
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,210
As Bob's pipe is split.

591
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,230
Space and time shift.

592
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,210
A temporal disturbance.

593
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,790
The cons of the slag.

594
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,550
We cross in.

595
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,870
A dimensional split.

596
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,270
Separates forever.

597
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,770
Subgenite from pink shit.

598
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,470
Bob walked in a circle.

599
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,210
And steadily exhaled in the smoke.

600
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,010
I can see why the pink boys fail.

601
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,090
The K and A's has con destruction.

602
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,690
Sick and full of slag with suction.

603
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,050
Paper view alien abduction.

604
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,250
Functioning on solar slack.

605
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,770
The money should be painted black.

606
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,310
The leak from space that stole your balls.

607
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,430
Will soon come back and take it all.

608
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,810
Return to slack.

609
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,010
Return to Bob.

610
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,610
Repent slack off and quit your jobs.

611
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,670
Smugly the beast.

612
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,710
Knob concrete.

613
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,010
Lick the throbbing vein of slavery.

614
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,470
Now you're sleeping like a baby.

615
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,430
Wait for the Bob who'll be up to the key.

616
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,150
And the dog.

617
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,630
The guy who's been talking with the UFO in his garage.

618
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,610
I cut my finger on a soup can lid.

619
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,190
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.

620
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,270
It swelled up to the size of a human head.

621
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,910
And then a mouth opened on it.

622
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,950
And this is what it said.

623
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,330
It said to kill the pink boys.

624
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,290
Put your job.

625
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,470
Mock the world.

626
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,870
And worship Bob Dogg.

627
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,910
We'll build a ship.

628
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,950
And take a trip.

629
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,990
Come on and get a pen right in the coordinates.

630
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,670
Three and a half months in my garage.

631
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,310
Tearing parts off of old used cars.

632
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,670
My grind at this point was unusually large.

633
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,210
I would occasionally hum while smoking cigars.

634
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,450
Our project was finished.

635
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,590
The ship would hold twenty.

636
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,250
The power source was like a ninja crew.

637
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,990
The thing was funny.

638
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,930
The slack was there hapless.

639
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,210
Our birth proof is worth it.

640
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,350
Escaping a star fixed.

641
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,590
On our way to planet extra sex.

642
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,250
The Rex next.

643
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,650
The Perry's with Harry Potter.

644
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,050
The house Tony's damsel.

645
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,070
Fans of the pink shit that hits the charts.

646
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,310
In a world of dead hearts.

647
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,410
I believe in this lobotomy and sodomy.

648
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,390
We take a moment and we pause to reflect.

649
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,790
On the pinks that were killed.

650
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,010
And the planet that we wrecked.

651
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,510
We laugh like banshees and howl like the banshees.

652
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,470
Where victory did it.

653
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,030
In our under rooms and canteens.

654
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,610
Our fantasy is a reality.

655
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,210
Earth hurts the dust.

656
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,790
Planet extra crusts are ugly.

657
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,930
Press the eddy blood that flows in your veins.

658
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,310
Let the froth pinecob bring slack like rain.

659
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,410
Our control is left up to the brain.

660
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,590
Oh gas and all your money.

661
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,650
Let the river I will stay.

662
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,210
Oh yes.

663
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,470
Send all your money to me.

664
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,930
Ah my god.

665
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:34,930


666
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:34,930

00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:34,930


672
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:34,930


673
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,530
My good friends.

674
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,930
Well that was the El Queso All Stars.

675
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,110
Planet X or bust.

doing the song Fire, Robin Hitchcock with the uncorrected personality traits, and Dr.

Lake Hume at the Austin Devival preaching about X Day.

699

In the background, we hear Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Sphinx Drum and Dr. Ray Hay and Mojo

700
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:06,870
and the other swinging love corpses from the infamous Bay Dat Jams.

701
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:13,490
Ah, yes, it brings back memories, friends, and I remember my first visit to Dobbs Town,

702
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,790
how Bob first showed me the proof of his vision.

703
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,210
For the first time, I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.

704
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,510
What else could it be?

705
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,090
The frightening of the thought may be, it could happen.

706
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:39,270
The sun will become dark, the moon blood red, the stars of the heavens will fall, there'll

707
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,150
be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming, the islands and the mountains are

708
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,770
shaken out of their sockets, and the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the

709
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,610
face of the earth.

710
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,690
It's all coming.

711
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,030
Yes, I'm ready now.

712
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,230
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times.

713
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,330
And think to yourself, there's no place like Bob.

714
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,050
That's great, it starts with a handshake.

715
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,250
Exits UFO's outer space.

716
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,450
J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.

717
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,210
He is the eye of a hurricane, watch your money burn.

718
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,850
Think, serve your own needs, yet he's every your own needs.

719
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,810
Feed him on a purse with workday strength.

720
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,410
End times are close at hand, uber woman, over man.

721
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,490
Liar in a fire, representing all we hate.

722
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,290
With a government for hire and a common good.

723
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:30,290


724
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:30,290


725
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:30,290


726
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,930
On bad side, the best is less a genie in a hurry with a con reading down their neck.

727
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,830
Group by group, normals falsified, bullfarts.

728
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,030
Look at that love playing, fine then.

729
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,630
Uh-oh, oh no, population they don't know.

730
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,010
Save yourself, serve yourself, pinks serve their own need.

731
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,310
Yet he's every your own need, time to plunge your own seed.

732
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,370
Yet he with a rupture in the rubber in the right.

733
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,890
Writing super slack, maniac, slam, fight, bright, light.

734
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,530
Feeling pretty psyched.

735
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,350
It's the end of the world as we know it.

736
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,290
It's the end of the world.

737
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,150
It's the end of the world as we know it.

738
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,730
It's the end of the world as we know it.

739
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,870
Bob feels fine.

740
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,190
July 5th, X Day, pleasure ships are on their way.

741
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,330
Quit your job, keep your slack.

742
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,470
Jared, I've scout your back.

743
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,610
Hail Connie, hail Bob.

744
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,810
On your knees, self-righteous love.

745
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,970
Give it up, give it in.

746
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,070
Find yourself your Yeti kit.

747
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,390
New religion, radio, hell, pope, gonna blow.

748
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,590
Pay to find out what you know.

749
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,750
Pass the pipe, take a check.

750
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,930
I'm telling you this is no joke.

751
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,030
Spirits see, steer clear.

752
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,290
Turn a minute, turn a minute.

753
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,290


754
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,470
문은, token는, 죽는onsense

755
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,970
Turn a minute, turn a minute.

756
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,470
Life's offering me solutions, and then you offer me alternatives.

757
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,430
And I, I, I.

758
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:34,930
Decline

759
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,250
It's the end of the world as we know it.

760
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,890
It's the end of the world as we know it.

761
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,510
It's the end of the world as we know it.

762
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,670
Bob feels fine.

763
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,610
Hold on, I've been walking away.

764
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:53,610


765
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:28,750
It's the end of the world.

766
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,410
I feel fine.

767
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,170
Of the world.

768
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,690
We know it.

769
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,330
It's the end of the world.

770
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,990
As we know it.

771
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,550
We know it.

772
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,010
of the world.

773
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:35,070
It's the end of the world as we know it

774
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,310
It's the end of the world as we know it

775
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,930
And Bob feels fine

776
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:27,930
It's the end of the world as we know it

777
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,650
You shall see www.subgenius.com

778
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,490
Our website there

779
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,130
There will be many new events next day

780
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,290
And new objects

781
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,510
There's going to be a glory hole confessional, right?

782
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,490
And who knows if Bob may be in there

783
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:50,990
Or Connie

784
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,370
Or both

785
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,710
Yeah

786
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,630
Just think of that, Rocknar

787
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,010
All you gotta do if you really want to be in the hot tub with me

788
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,290
Is you gotta go to the hot tub

789
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,630
Imagine it in your mind

790
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,010
And you'll have it

791
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,710
I won't necessarily have to be there

792
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,970
I can't even imagine Dave in the hot tub

793
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,330
Yeah

794
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,490
I can't either

795
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,510
You know, you'll begin vomiting freely

796
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,310
Unimaginable

797
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,650
It's disgusting the way we treat humans

798
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,210
We must get off

799
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,250
We must get off

800
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,430
We must get off

801
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,470
We must get off

802
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,490
We must get off

803
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,730
We must get off

804
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,290
We must get off

805
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,430
We must get off

806
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,350
We must get off

807
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,630
Can you imagine all of your friends

808
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,490
Perhaps evacuating and peeing at the same time?

809
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,650
No, their mind bogs at such things

810
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,410
We don't want to view this in our mind

811
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,390
Are you the one that evacuated in the hot tub, Dave?

812
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,950
No, man

813
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,990
Friends, on X-Day, when you're at Brushwood

814
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,650
You will finally get to evacuate

815
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,270
Or vacate the evacuation room

816
00:39:59,290 --> 00:39:59,930
Or vacate the evacuation chamber

817
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,290
You will

818
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,910
You will get off

819
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,790
If you're smart enough to build your own ship

820
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,210
You will get off the pot

821
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,670
And build your, well

822
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,850
Build your own outhouse

823
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,850
You start with that

824
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,110
Yeah

825
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,010
Put some homemade explosives underneath

826
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,870
Everybody's leaving Zagnuts in the pool

827
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,710
Or Butterfingers, whatever you call it

828
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,330
Round, round the slack foam

829
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,450
On the bob down in the saucer roll

830
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,070
Round, round the slack foam

831
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,190
On the bob down in the saucer roll

832
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,090
And in that air there was a ship

833
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:29,270
On the bob down in the saucer roll

834
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,010
A rare ship

835
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,990
An expensive ship

836
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,050
With a ship in the air

837
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,950
And the air through the smoke

838
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,890
And the smoke from the flap

839
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,770
And the flap in the pipe

840
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,370
And the pipe in the pipe

841
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,170
And the grid in the grid

842
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,630
And the bob dowed down in the saucer roll

843
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,350
Round, round the slack foam

844
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,470
On the bob down in the saucer roll

845
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,170
Round, round the slack foam

846
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,390
On the bob down in the saucer roll

847
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,690
And in that ship there was a bob

848
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,930
A rare bob

849
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,850
J.R. Bob Dobbs

850
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,110
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

851
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,170
Caleb Polden

852
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,670
With a bob on the ship

853
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,270
On the Mack��

854
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,310
in the air and the air through the smoke and the smoke from the

855
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,350
prop and the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin

856
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,050
and the grin and the bop. Bob Down

857
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,170
in the Saucer Row!

858
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,090
A Pope

859
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,250
Fred. Bob Down

860
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,990
in the Saucers

861
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,630
at Double X Day.

862
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,250
X Day's past, friends. It's an ESO

863
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,010
Swamp Radio with

864
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,950
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and

865
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,790
Professor Chaz Smith. You know,

866
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,050
friends, some people think that we're a dangerous

867
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,330
Texas saucer death cult.

868
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,990
Now, how is that dangerous?

869
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,410
How are you dangerous?

870
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,130
You don't

871
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,170
conform to proper thought patterns.

872
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,310
You need to be scanned. Well, neither

873
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,130
do you, and you need to be scanned

874
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,530
too.

875
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,190
Oh my goodness.

876
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,370
There's no accident that God has you on

877
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,410
at this late hour where decent people

878
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,330
can't hear you except for those

879
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,590
like me that are forced to stay awake

880
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,810
to feed their families.

881
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,490
What am I gonna do with this animal?

882
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,810
I'm gonna kill it.

883
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,670
Control, control, you must

884
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,390
be in control.

885
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,110
I'm gonna take a minute

886
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,030
just to show a real

887
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,150
emotion. Excellent,

888
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,350
excellent. I read you

889
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,230
loud and clear. Now

890
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,250
then, you are to take this

891
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,270
planet in the name of the Earth.

892
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,170
He's gonna bump you up, yeah.

893
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,630
He's got a gun, you know.

894
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,330
Well, all right, if you're gonna kill me, hurry up. I have to take my

895
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,230
tonic in two. I hope you enjoy

896
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,490
that.

897
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,430
I'll tell you the way it is

898
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,270
and I'm not gonna

899
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,350
be kind or easy.

900
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,370
Your low attitude

901
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,030
stinks, I say,

902
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,070
and the life you lead

903
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,130
is completely empty.

904
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,910
But let's leave things

905
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,510
of this world behind

906
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,090
and walk now down the path of Bob

907
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,010
for this brief minute of slack

908
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,650
from the Church of the Subgenius.

909
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,250
Now, friend,

910
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,050
I know you're

911
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,030
going through hell sometimes, trying to get

912
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,970
slack in this life, but

913
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,070
it'll all be worth it in the end

914
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,950
because it's a forgiven Lord.

915
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,070
He lets you get away with

916
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,010
murder. Of course, he'll make you

917
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,090
suffer through hell for it, but that ain't

918
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,970
nothing compared to the pleasure dimensions

919
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,170
that come after your eternity in hell.

920
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,010
Because, you know, if you went straight to the pleasure

921
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,070
dimensions without going through hell first, you wouldn't be

922
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,150
able to appreciate it. It's a simple

923
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,970
homey old rule, but oh,

924
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,310
so often forgotten in today's

925
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,030
world. People can't count up to the

926
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,130
ten anymore, so they aren't so good at counting

927
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,050
their blessings. They watch TV

928
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,230
instead of sitting on their front porch.

929
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,770
They don't have slack.

930
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,150
It's a slackless

931
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,010
land, and hell has even less slack.

932
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,030
Actually, it's a kind of a-slack

933
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,990
or anti-slack. Oh, it's bad, friends.

934
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,990
You could die and go there any second all the

935
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,550
times you've sinned against Bob,

936
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,290
denied his sweet name.

937
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,970
You know, they say it's Bob that puts

938
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,770
the teeth in south hell,

939
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,430
friends.

940
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,910
Yes, X-Day is coming, and what

941
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,630
about these X-ists? What?

942
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,730
You know, we know that we're gonna be the

943
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,910
deuce-pangs, so geniuses will be lifted

944
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,970
up by the escape vessels of

945
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,990
the sex goddesses and go to Planet X,

946
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,210
but who lives

947
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,050
on Planet X?

948
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,130
What is the X-ist?

949
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,170
Friends, the X-ist

950
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,890
remains a

951
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,470
complete mystery.

952
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,910
But with the power of negative art,

953
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,450
we can capture,

954
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,110
this alien in his negative

955
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,850
and yet natural

956
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,850
habitat. See,

957
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,270
dines off the bushes

958
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,030
over there,

959
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,470
keeps yanking at his head

960
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,590
like he's in pain.

961
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,350
He's suffering.

962
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:45,650
He's crying.

963
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,690
His head is shrinking.

964
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,130
He's in pain.

965
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,730
He can't stand

966
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,490
living another second. He must

967
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,990
kill himself to relieve himself

968
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,930
of such horrible, horrible pain.

969
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,330
He's in agony.

970
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,170
People thought negative art

971
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,270
wasn't just a trend,

972
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,070
but then it braced

973
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,950
back with all the vengeance of

974
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,410
shadow mastery.

975
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,230
But as soon as we're gone,

976
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,150
you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening

977
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,110
by radio, you folks listening by record, who know

978
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,670
not Jesus Christ, once the church is gone,

979
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,430
there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment,

980
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,210
and millions will die in those next few years.

981
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,670
They'll be glued to their sets,

982
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,730
watching rockets,

983
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,850
and jets, blowing up schools

984
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,010
and factories, putting an end to the birds

985
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,830
and bees. It's worth every penny

986
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,270
to tune in and see

987
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,830
who wins the enemy at the

988
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,650
root of the academy. Watch

989
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,190
World War III on pay TV

990
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,990
before your television

991
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,090
melts away.

992
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,950
It's the end of the

993
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,770
world as we know it.

994
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,870
It's the end

995
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,350
of the world as we know it.

996
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,610
It's the

997
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,710
end of the world.

998
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,650
As we know it, I

999
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,270
feel fine.

1000
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,890
A-O, let's go.

1001
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,630
Shoot them in the back now.

1002
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,010
What they want,

1003
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,250
I don't know.

1004
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,930
They're all ripped up and ready to go.

1005
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:15,990
Turn around.

1006
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,770
Go back down, back

1007
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,670
the way you came.

1008
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,210
Can't

1009
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,630
you see that flash

1010
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,690
of fire? Ten

1011
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,710
times brighter than the

1012
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,590
day. And

1013
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,870
behold, a mighty

1014
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,490
city broken

1015
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,570
in the dust again.

1016
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,730
Oh, God,

1017
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,530
pride of man,

1018
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,470
broken in

1019
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,110
the dust again.

1020
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,590
It's gonna be me,

1021
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,570
and it's gonna be

1022
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,010
you.

1023
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,630
We're gonna do everything

1024
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,130
we want to.

1025
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,430
It's gotta be,

1026
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,550
now, and I

1027
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,410
can't wait

1028
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,630
to say goodbye to fear

1029
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,670
and all that pain and hate.

1030
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,630
Oh, like

1031
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,510
a flaming baton

1032
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,470
that's ready to

1033
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,310
twirl. Like George

1034
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,730
Bush on acid

1035
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,990
singing the duke of

1036
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,710
gonna be a new

1037
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,270
world.

1038
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,830
Gonna be a new world.

1039
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,230
I'm excited.

1040
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,350
Can't you watch

1041
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,130
that switch?

1042
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,350
There's nothing left for you to say.

1043
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,670
Soon you'll be dead anyway.

1044
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,470
Well, no one

1045
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,910
here is getting

1046
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,950
out alive.

1047
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,530
There's someone really lost my mind

1048
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,770
and I don't care.

1049
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,070
So

1050
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,690
close your eyes

1051
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,870
and get yourself a fight.

1052
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,930
And think about the

1053
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,630
All the times he's been and what they've been

1054
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,410
To me it's nothing

1055
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,990
To me it's nothing

1056
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,570
To me it's nothing

1057
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,030
To me it's nothing

1058
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,370
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

1059
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,350
That's why we might as well take our time

1060
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,270
Ah, yeah!

1061
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:44,410
One more day on the road

1062
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:44,470
Let's go!

1063
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,470
If I scream they'll spin me faster

1064
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,130
Everything gone backwards

1065
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,030
And it's upside down

1066
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,930
To stop me, said, oh, I think I'm falling

1067
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,450
Falling from the 14 story

1068
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,970
One more land and it will be morning

1069
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,050
Hit the floor

1070
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,790
To stop the traffic

1071
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,510
Stop the clock

1072
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,110
Stop the law

1073
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:27,910
I want to know

1074
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:28,750
I want to get on

1075
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,850
I want to get on with you

1076
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,470
I want to get on

1077
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,590
I want to get on with you

1078
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,030
One more job in the supermarket

1079
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,590
One more kick to get me started

1080
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,810
Everyone get on board

1081
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,570
This ship is sinking

1082
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,590
What?

1083
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,570
Of the limitless

1084
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,610
Sex and violence

1085
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,990
In the wake of Ragnarok

1086
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,130
Welcome to the slaughter

1087
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,450
What are you going to do?

1088
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,890
What will be your habitat?

1089
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,270
When we get done with you

1090
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,850
Are you gonna cry for your mama?

1091
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,210
Or are you gonna have a good time?

1092
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,750
Are you gonna be a bohab?

1093
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,910
When it's your turn to die

1094
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,530
The dog is going to take you crazy

1095
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,090
Ragnarok all around

1096
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,410
Anarchy, fear, it's the Ragnarok party town

1097
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:38,750
Music

1098
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,330
Music

1099
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,290
Music

1100
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,930
Music

1101
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,510
Music

1102
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:46,890
Music

1103
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:06,450
He said I never engaged in this type of thing before, but yes, I believe it can be very

1104
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,550
easily done.

1105
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:19,470
Just put some breeches out in the sun in the Cabin Auto Highway 61.

1106
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,110
Oh yeah!

1107
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,350
Next days are coming and the pigs are bumming.

1108
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:59,250
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1109
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:03,670
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1110
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,870
And I feel fine.

1111
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,530
I feel fine.

1112
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:07,530


1113
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:07,530


1114
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,590
ně

1115
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,210
��� protective band decorations are not bad...

1116
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,810
It's 1893, Dave.

1117
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:44,670
It is.

1118
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,390
For all we know.

1119
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,670
For all we know.

1120
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,330
Be cavitated?

1121
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,950
You know the leading cause of death?

1122
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,750
Yeah, the leading cause of death.

1123
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,710
Oh, about 100, 125, 130 years ago.

1124
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,770
Leading cause of death.

1125
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,730
200 years ago was horse accidents.

1126
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,090
Getting kicked by a horse.

1127
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,790
Being run over by a carriage or a buckboard.

1128
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:23,370
Yeah.

1129
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,630
Horse-related incidents.

1130
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,770
Or just in general, dealing with large, you know, hoofed animals.

1131
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,270
Yep.

1132
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,550
And killed a lot of people.

1133
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,190
And they're coming back, dear friend.

1134
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,570
Cows.

1135
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,070
If you can call yourself a friend.

1136
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,390
The cows are going to take our place on the genetic ladder.

1137
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,290
On the evolutionary scale.

1138
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:49,210
Soon, vast hordes of cows will be inhabiting perhaps parts of your home.

1139
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,770
You can see them already in golf courses.

1140
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,690
You can see them in public halls.

1141
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,470
And in the chambers of the dead.

1142
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:57,970
It's confusing.

1143
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,190
I'm willing to do my part.

1144
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,770
They have a chamber for the dead already.

1145
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,830
Man, I'm going to go see if that dude wants to go on the air.

1146
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,310
Get along, little Bobby.

1147
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:11,670
Hold on.

1148
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,890
You get your slackers.

1149
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:13,970
Come on up this ramp.

1150
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,370
Enter those spaceship doors.

1151
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,310
Ignore the screams and the hammer blow sounds coming from inside.

1152
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,310
Come on.

1153
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:22,530
Yah!

1154
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:23,270
Yah!

1155
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:24,430
Rah!

1156
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:24,950
Ha!

1157
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,870
It's a real pleasure to hear you sing like that.

1158
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,290
It's a fantastic thing.

1159
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,070
We're all.

1160
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:34,270
All.

1161
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,250
Extra terrestrials.

1162
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,870
On a cycle that is ancestral.

1163
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,770
We're off to see the wizard.

1164
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,570
On a paradise among the stars.

1165
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:46,450
We're all.

1166
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,210
Extra terrestrials.

1167
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,750
On a mission that is ancestral.

1168
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,770
We're off to see the wizard.

1169
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,610
On a world among the stars.

1170
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,310
You know that scientists have said.

1171
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,010
That the Earth will soon be dead.

1172
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,030
Philosophers have told us long ago.

1173
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,830
You'd think by now we'd all be in the know.

1174
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,490
Is that a bird-covered microphone?

1175
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,230
I don't think so.

1176
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,570
An M-perks.

1177
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,290
Larry?

1178
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,690
Larry, is that a microphone covered in a song?

1179
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,190
Boys and girls.

1180
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:29,210
Boys and girls, it's time for you to whatever.

1181
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,970
The pacifier.

1182
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,450
No.

1183
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,830
It could knock a lot out here.

1184
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:33,270
It could.

1185
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:34,710
It could knock a lot out here.

1186
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:35,550
It's just gonna be tiny.

1187
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:36,170
It could.

1188
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,390
It's still a corporation.

1189
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:37,990
Academia.

1190
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,050
And dream of pleasure ships.

1191
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,850
From high above.

1192
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,670
On July 5th this year.

1193
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,150
Go to sleep.

1194
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:58,390
And dream of flying high.

1195
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,190
On lullabies.

1196
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,990
And dreams that Bob has not.

1197
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,790
And dreams that Bob has not.

1198
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,450
And dreams that Bob has not.

1199
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:14,490
Sex gonises and squid shall hide away.

1200
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:23,130
The smiling face of Bob will keep you safe till no second.

1201
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,330
The sex gonises and squids shall hide away.

1202
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:28,070
Oh, I missed it.

1203
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,830
Now it's the other part.

1204
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,110
Oh, I get it now.

1205
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,530
Oh, I get it now.

1206
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,170
Oh, I get it now.

1207
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,950
Oh, I get it now.

1208
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:44,970
Oh, I get it now.

1209
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,210
Oh, I get it now.

1210
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:47,330
I got it now.

1211
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:47,330


1212
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:47,330


1213
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:47,330


1214
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,170
Sitting here.

1215
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,030
Oh, I am the vesv.

1216
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,030


1217
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,030


1218
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,030


1219
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,410
I have all

1220
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,150
Sex goth wannabes on my walking,

1221
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:54,470
…swing-a

1222
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,010
…a

1223
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,510
But I'll begin swaying back and forth.

1224
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:33,950
Smiling face so I could keep you safe until next day.

1225
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,150
2001.

1226
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,870
For next day.

1227
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:44,830
Adios, amigos.

1228
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,010
The number you have reached.

1229
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:55,790
P.O. Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

1230
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:57,230
Has been changed.

1231
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,770
The new number is.

1232
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:04,410
P.O. Box 2-0-4-2-0-6.

1233
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:11,370
Austin, Texas 7-8-7-2-0.

1234
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,090
Please make a note of it.

1235
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:20,130
Think of all the hate there is in red China.

1236
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,990
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama.

1237
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,050
P.U.

1238
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:25,450
Manny.

1239
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:25,770
P.O.

1240
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,330
287- Qiu

1241
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:40,330


1242
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,090
Hooray.

1243
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:41,110
We're a.

1244
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:50,830
next door neighbor but don't forget to say grace and tell me over and over and over and over again

1245
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:56,790
my friend you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

1246
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:04,330
oh no no you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

1247
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,990
oh

1248
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,310
ah
