10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:14,320
microphone my kid is forming a band now he's playing bass and keyboards and doing vocals and

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,380
he keeps swiping my mic it's probably out here in the garage yes indeed there it is i bet he

12
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,740

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,860
good good stanley child excuse me my back hurts

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,900
no back i was in a car wreck friends

15
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,560
the fourteenth of April Friday afternoon I was on my way just before the Post

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,720
Office closed to Mail the subgenius

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,340
taxes the tax return and they the

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,360
And I was broadsided by a drunk going 60 miles an hour.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,720
Caladrella.

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,820
He totaled my car, ran and then busted through a fence,

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,540
hit somebody's garage, and jumped out of his truck and escaped, ran away,

22
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,540
leaving his 40 ounce and his ID in his fully insured truck.

23
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,440
Praise Bob.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,780
But it totaled my car completely, and I'm not in real good shape.

25
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,260
I didn't have any cuts.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
I wasn't even bleeding, but my back is kind of out of whack.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,420
And I'd be dead right now,

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,560
except for the fact that I was carrying the subgenius taxes to the post office.

29
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,400
Because if I'd been...

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,660
If I hadn't been killed or put into a coma,

31
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,000
that would have...

32
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,340
My wife wouldn't have found those taxes and mailed them until, you know, a couple of months later at least.

33
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,600
And Bob would have had to pay an extra $30 or so in late fees and penalties and interest.

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,440
So, the only reason I'm alive right now...

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,640
It's by a miracle, a real miracle.

36
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,880
But it's only because, I mean, let's face it,

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,400
it's just because it saved Bob $30.

38
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,020
He would have been out some money if I'd been killed.

39
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,740
So long.

40
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,740
Whoa!

41
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,860
And so it behooved Bob for me to live on and continue to do these horrible shows.

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,740
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

43
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,700
The subgenius power of sweat!

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,620
Out of your love for me, you come and say,

45
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,880
Bob, I paid that debt.

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,920
I didn't have to.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,560
I didn't want to.

48
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,260
Or, not that you didn't want to.

49
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,200
You did want to.

50
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,020
I paid.

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,800
I didn't have to.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,820
But it's off of my ledger.

53
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,160
Oh, yes, dear friends, it's true.

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,340
Not only did I have a car wreck, but I actually managed to get a tape recording of it.

55
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,860
Because I was making a talk tape to a film.

56
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,220
And I was like, oh, my friend, and when that drunk hit me.

57
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,760
Friends, here, listen to this.

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,460
We've been waiting for this for years.

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,300
Man, that's all you get, unfortunately.

60
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:45,300
You know, because when the collision happened, the device was knocked out of my hand very quickly.

61
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,960
So you just barely hear a little bit of a crunch.

62
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,440
You don't get to hear the glass shattering, the screams of the innocent victims in the background, or any of that stuff.

63
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,920
But, oh, it is.

64
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:05,200
But yet, friends, you know, thanks to that late filing fee that would have been inflicted on J.R. Bob Dobbs, I was spared.

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,420
Yes.

66
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,540
But it's the way.

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,680
And I've got to admit, friends, there's been omens and portents all week.

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,900
A lot of this.

70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,140
When I was doing the taxes, I had to look at my 1993.

71
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,580
Both.

72
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,720
The Stang family returns and the subgenius returns.

73
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:37,200
And, friends, you know the sacred number, the magic number of the church is 273.

74
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:51,540
Well, I hadn't realized until that fateful day that in 1993, the subgenius foundation paid $273 in taxes.

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,600
Two-hour fine government.

76
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh, yes.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,520
And the Stang family got back $273 in overpaid taxes.

78
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,840
Too much always, once again, better than not enough.

79
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,860
And we're just glad to be alive.

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,680
And I've got to admit, I'm thinking about them pain pills.

81
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,240
I might go ahead and, you know, let this be a pain pill sort of show.

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I mean, if we were doing this in a radio station, I wouldn't be able to do that.

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,620
You know?

84
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,020
Don't let you come in there under the influence of drugs.

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,600
And I wish we were in a radio station.

86
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,800
But since we're not, well, heck, maybe we ought to go ahead and do the show under the influence of drugs.

87
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,020
I'm already under the influence of Stang upon Stang of pain, friends.

88
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,440
Pain.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,540
Pain.

90
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:50,180
You don't know nothing about pain until you've had your back whacked by some drunken idiot.

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,420
Caladrela.

92
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,440
Whoa!

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,300
Ah.

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,520
I'd just love to relive that moment when I lived instead of died.

95
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,840
I wish that I could say that my life flashed before my eyes.

96
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,900
I wish, friends, that I could say that I entered a tunnel,

97
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:15,620
a beautiful tunnel of light leading to some vast and beautiful feeling of love

98
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:22,840
and all-in-oneness and all my dead relatives and even Dr. X would be there on the other side.

99
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,840
And then I'd be...

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,860
I'd be sucked back into real life going,

101
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,780
Oh, now I know there's a beautiful afterlife and everything will be fine.

102
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,180
Because, well, I'll tell you something, friends.

103
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,160
If I didn't know there was a beautiful afterlife and everything would be fine,

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,180
I would go get in my car and drive down to the intersection of Lakeland and Diceman

105
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,120
and wait once again for some drunk to come and hit me and kill me this time.

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,380
Because then I'd have slack.

107
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,080
See?

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,380
But that ain't the way it works.

109
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,420
They don't want you to know.

110
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,920
They don't want you to know.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,260
One way or the other.

112
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,060
So you have to...

113
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,740
It's a guessing game.

114
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,280
It's going to stay a guessing game.

115
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,920
And if it didn't, why?

116
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,300
There would be no human life left on this planet.

117
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,300
Ah, yes.

118
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,620
Caladrella.

119
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,880
So, Bob, because I love you and I want to be reconciled now to you personally

120
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,040
and I want us to remain friends and to be friends,

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,240
you started...

122
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,640
You started hating the innocent party

123
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,980
because of what you think that innocent party is thinking every time they see you.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,160
And every time you come into my presence,

125
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,420
you'd be saying, Bob, every time you get around,

126
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,560
you're going to say, there's that Bob.

127
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,200
And not only were there those omens of numerical omens

128
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,300
and hospital emergency room omens, dear friends,

129
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,440
but also upon one of those self-same days,

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,560
oh, lo!

131
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,880
Good friend, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,220
the man who introduces the Hour of Slack most weeks

133
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,960
and who happens to work at the same radio station in New York

134
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,500
where Howard Stern does his radio show.

135
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,660
Bleepo was on the Howard Stern show using his human name

136
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,840
and showing off his beautiful dominatrix girlfriend to Stern

137
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,640
as a demonstration, perhaps,

138
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,660
of the fact that even us little funny-looking guys

139
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,940
can end up with the hot babe after all.

140
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,700
Ah, yes, Friends Bob's promise rings true.

141
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,520
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

142
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,920
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

143
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,620
and only in the city of...

144
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:52,860
Bleepo.

145
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,540
Kates is our production director

146
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,940
and he's one of those guys who dresses weird,

147
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,120
gets weird haircuts and stuff,

148
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,120
although he looks kind of normal.

149
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,680
He's just basically weird.

150
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,980
He's just weird, and then he gets into weird religions.

151
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,280
Are you still like a witch or something?

152
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,740
Are you still a warlock?

153
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,460
No, no, no.

154
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,520
Kates was a warlock.

155
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,120
You dropped that?

156
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,900
When I first met him, he was a warlock,

157
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,540
and he was like, oh, don't mention it.

158
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,100
I'm a Wiccan or whatever they call it.

159
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,800
Yeah, what are you, a Wiccan?

160
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,140
No, no.

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,780
What are you?

162
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,900
I was raised a Unitarian.

163
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,400
But aren't you like a warlock now or something?

164
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,400
Nah, I'm not.

165
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,520
He was a warlock.

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:21,840
You were.

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,840
A warlock is like a betrayer or something.

168
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,300
It's not something one would...

169
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,540
Weren't you just some weird religion?

170
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,140
I told you he was going to have some weird thing,

171
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,800
like, no, I wasn't a warlock, I was a witch.

172
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,320
Yeah.

173
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,920
Yeah, what were you, a witch or a warlock?

174
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,320
What were you actually?

175
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,280
And why don't you be honest?

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
I would call myself more a pagan.

177
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,180
I don't really like the W word.

178
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,640
A pagan?

179
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah, yeah.

180
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,920
A pagan means...

181
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,300
It's like, in America, pagan is basically,

182
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,360
you see deity in nature and in...

183
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,220
But aren't you a witch?

184
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,600
Like, isn't that part of it?

185
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,340
You go out and howl at the moon.

186
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,400
A lot of people who are pagans

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,420
are pagans.

188
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,700
They also call themselves witches.

189
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,020
Right.

190
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,680
I don't.

191
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,520
Are you still a pagan?

192
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
Yeah, I'd say so, sure.

193
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,900
But who's...

194
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,720
So who's a warlock?

195
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,780
I don't know anybody...

196
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,000
Your girlfriend?

197
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,780
I don't know anybody who's a warlock.

198
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,380
That's like...

199
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,300
So who's, like, the head of your religion?

200
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,500
That's like from Bad Satan movies.

201
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,340
Who's the head of your religion?

202
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,340
No one's the head of my religion.

203
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
She's the head of my religion.

204
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,980
Your new girlfriend is the head of your religion.

205
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,460
Sure, why not?

206
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,100
All women are head of my religion.

207
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,440
Yeah, your new girlfriend's pretty...

208
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,380
I mean, like, I don't know how Kate's got you.

209
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
Where did you meet?

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,420
Through mutual friends.

211
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,400
In some cases, they...

212
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
They're just little tips of the hat to Bob

213
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,720
from people he helped out in the past.

214
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,520
In most cases, though, it's a concerted effort

215
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,380
by the conspiracy to make the name Bob acute,

216
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,560
you know, to normalize it.

217
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,900
And people named Bob are laid back and normal.

218
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,100
And it's also sort of...

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,520
reassuring.

220
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,460
They're trying to present a reassuring Bob.

221
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
A Bob without the quotes around the name Bob.

222
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,860
For instance, Microsoft Bob.

223
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,260
The new computer operating system

224
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,060
that Bill Gates has released.

225
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,980
Not to be confused with me, Bill Cates.

226
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,240
No, no.

227
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,800
People get confused sometimes.

228
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,040
They often think I'm Bill Gates, but no.

229
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,060
I wish you were.

230
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,940
But anyway, go on.

231
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,100
They're trying to water down the word Bob.

232
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,140
They're trying to make it all sort of cute and funny

233
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,900
so that when everyone starts wearing T-shirts

234
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,780
with Bob Dobbs' face on it,

235
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,480
they'll never really understand,

236
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,180
what it is that he represents.

237
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,240
Because what he represents is quite dangerous

238
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,140
to the status quo of the normal people.

239
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,520
Of the mere humans, Bill.

240
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Because that's really what we're saying.

241
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,400
It's not that we...

242
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,940
that we hate people of a particular type.

243
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,360
It's that we hate people.

244
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,480
We hate humans.

245
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,980
Look what the humans have done.

246
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,840
The subgeniuses live in complete harmony with us.

247
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:50,840


248
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
They live in harmony with nature and technology.

249
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
They'll sit and watch television for days and days at a time

250
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
and never bother anybody.

251
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
Now the normals, though,

252
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,820
they have to have the fanciest television,

253
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,160
the fanciest car.

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,040
This, even if they can't afford it,

255
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,240
they have to have all that stuff

256
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,500
because they've been taught a form of false slack.

257
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,940
The type of slack that Bob is trying to promote

258
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,220
is true slack.

259
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,720
The slack that doesn't cost anything.

260
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,280
A subgenius can amuse itself sitting in a dark room,

261
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,180
stark naked.

262
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,760
We don't have to be going to the movies

263
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,220
or reading the latest cool book

264
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,920
or going to the latest hot, groovy club to be popular.

265
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,020
We don't care.

266
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,040
In subgenius consciousness,

267
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,620
you can be vastly entertained

268
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,240
merely by inspecting your thumbnail for hours.

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,600
Not that we necessarily do that,

270
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,140
but it's, you know, if that were the situation,

271
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,300
the subgenius makes the best of it.

272
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
A lump of mud

273
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,960
seethes with infinite potentialities

274
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,640
when seen in Dobbs' consciousness.

275
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,860
Wow.

276
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,780
Yes, and even one such as Bill Cates

277
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,760
or Reverend Lippo seethes with infinite potentiality

278
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
in the eyes of those babes, man.

279
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,240
Those who can find the inherent entertainment

280
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,420
in car wrecks, death, taxes,

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,960
and Bill Cates and Howard Stern.

282
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,740
And in the types of things that we like to do

283
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,980
when we're on elevators.

284
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,280
Yes, dear friends, here's some more fun things to do

285
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,120
in an elevator.

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,500
Number 18, give religious tracts to each passenger.

287
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,940
These don't even have to be

288
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,660
subgenius religious tracts, friends.

289
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,580
Number 21, bet the other passengers that you can fit a quarter

290
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,740
in your nose.

291
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,740
A number 23, show other passengers a wound

292
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,860
and ask if it looks infected.

293
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,400
A number 27, stare at another passenger for a while,

294
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,840
then announce, you're one of them,

295
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,620
and move to the far side of the elevator.

296
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,400
Well, we can throw that one away now.

297
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,860
That page is done.

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,740
So much has been done, and you know,

299
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,260
when this show is done, I can't wait to take my page.

300
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,580
I can't wait to get my own brain pills.

301
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes, that will be my reward, friends,

302
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,480
for having done yet another show.

303
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,820
But I've got some news here,

304
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,120
some important news that I need to read to you.

305
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,420
Let me pull the music down just a little bit.

306
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:41,680
This is some news from the newsletter called Weapon.

307
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,580
Weapon, because the truth hurts,

308
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,020
from the Open Eye group in Eugene, Oregon.

309
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,020
And let me read this little news bit to you.

310
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,640
Jeffrey Dahmer goes to heaven.

311
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,280
God called soft on crime.

312
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,600
Friends, what do Martin Luther King Jr.

313
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,940
and Jeffrey Dahmer have in common?

314
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,500
Halos, my friend.

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,820
They both are wearing halos even now.

316
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,900
Jeffrey Dahmer was found in a pool of blood

317
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,000
in the middle of the desert.

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000


319
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000


320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000


321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000


322
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,260
He was shot in the head while serving 16 consecutive life sentences

323
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,440
in a maximum security prison in Madison, Wisconsin.

324
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,780
He was convicted of murdering and dismembering at least 16 people.

325
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,240
Dahmer had sexual contact with and ate the carcasses of

326
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,900
many of his victims.

327
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,740
But found clubbed in the head on November 28,

328
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,960
Dahmer was rushed to a hospital but died an hour later,

329
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,000
only to ascend directly to heaven.

330
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,860
For eternity.

331
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,120
Explained his father, Lionel Dahmer,

332
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
on TV's A Current Affair,

333
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
he was recently baptized into Christ.

334
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,160
And I do believe that Jeffrey is with God forever.

335
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,760
Scholars of biblical law confirm that as long as Dahmer

336
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,080
repented and asked Jesus into his heart,

337
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,100
he would be forgiven no matter what his crimes.

338
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,800
For by the blood of the Lamb,

339
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,700
ye are saved.

340
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,840
These biblical loopholes do not, however,

341
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,880
apply to his victims, all homosexuals,

342
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,860
because they were killed by surprise and had no chance to repent.

343
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,580
Conservative Christians across the nation have reacted with protest

344
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,300
over God's decision to pardon Dahmer.

345
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,740
Jesse Helms accused God of being, quote,

346
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,840
soft on crime, unquote, and of threatening the moral fabric of the entire universe.

347
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,520
Rush Limbaugh publicly denounced Jesus as a liberal

348
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,060
and proposed that true conservatives refuse to tithe until God rescinds his decision.

349
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,680
Spokesmen for Heaven announced that their immigration policy is, quote,

350
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,400
final and absolute, unquote,

351
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,160
and that there is no room for debating technicalities

352
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,640
in a monotheistic, monarco dictatorship.

353
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,640
The

354
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,040
words to muse upon, dear friends, from the

355
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
Weapon newsletter.

356
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,560
It's a humble little newsletter.

357
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,360
It's short.

358
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,480
It's simple.

359
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,700
It's probably the kind of newsletter that the church should be putting out every couple of weeks.

360
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,840
But hey, we gotta do this show, don't we?

361
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,560
Anyway, you can get that...

362
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,420
the weapon...

363
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,400
You can get weapons from...

364
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,220
the open eye.

365
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,000
The little eye...

366
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,740
in the pyramid here. They must be masons.

367
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,940
Got that pencil ready?

368
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,520
P.O. Box

369
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,500
1602.

370
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,900
That's P.O. Box 1602

371
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
Eugene, Oregon

372
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,360
97440.

373
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,300
4-4-0

374
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,980
Yes, the open eye at P.O. Box 1602

375
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,840
Eugene, Oregon

376
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,980
97440

377
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,900
And

378
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,000
yes, it's such

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
a lovely day today.

380
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,980
Such a fine day to be doing

381
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,480
a show.

382
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,040
And I don't really want to do a show.

383
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,360
I'd rather be out wandering

384
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,760
up and down the streets with my doggie

385
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,780
so that he may check

386
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,920
his pee mail

387
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,780
and I may check out the

388
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,300
jogging

389
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,080
females.

390
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
But that's a moot point again.

391
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,540
We just keep getting

392
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,380
lost here.

393
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,500
Let's just see now

394
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,140
what comes up next, shall we?

395
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,500
Yo mama

396
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,420
I saw yo mama

397
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,380
Yo mama

398
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,340
Yo mama got a nose that's like a banana

399
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,200
She got a head as big as a grand piano

400
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,220
She got shoes that look just like a noose

401
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,020
She's as ugly as the elf man singing the blues

402
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,840
Yo mama got teeth like a picket fence

403
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
She took a bath in 54 and took one sense

404
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,740
Yo mama got funk that smells like death

405
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,560
She even got the funkiest armpits and breath

406
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,400
Yo mama take the food from gardeners cans

407
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,480
She don't look like she ever washed her face in hand

408
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,360
Yo mama's got a mouth that smells like death

409
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,360


410
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,280
She's a titty hang to the floor

411
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
She got a booty like a double door

412
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,160
Yo mama got a happy skin

413
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,120
Baby give me a coo

414
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,000
Yo mama really looks just like a fool

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,840
That's why yo mama got an address in Penn State

416
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,660
Just because she looks like total frustration

417
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,440
I saw yo mama in the streets

418
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,340
The streets split

419
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,260
What do you know?

420
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,200
I didn't get

421
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,060
I didn't get

422
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,780
I didn't get but a little bit

423
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,300
Yo mama

424
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,920
You know yo mama's known as goody-woo

425
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,980
Because she gave it to Bob Barney Hill

426
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,140
And that's why they call me Billy the Dead

427
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,840
Cause I made love to yo mother

428
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,960
Fool your daddy did

429
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,760
Yo mama

430
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,560
Yo mama

431
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,720
Yo mama

432
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,340
Yo mama

433
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,480
Yo mama

434
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,280
Yo mama

435
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,440
Yo mama

436
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,720
The Bible says it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle

437
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,400
Than it is for a rich man to get into heaven

438
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,740
But if that rich man is J.R. Bob Dobbs

439
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,560
And that camel is the subgenius

440
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,580
Hour of slack

441
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,960
There are far better places to go than heaven

442
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,180
Why settle for one ill-defined afterlife

443
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,780
When you can sample an unthinkable number of alternate dimensions

444
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,380
That make mere nirvana seem downright dull

445
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,320
How about the dimension of eternal Sunday afternoons in a hammock

446
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,340
Or the one where you can't see the sun in the sky

447
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,240
Or endless sex of the type you used to dream about in high school

448
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,040
Or the plane of everlasting pizza

449
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,840
Ladies, what about that land of eternal chocolate ocurred here

450
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,740
Mmmmm chocolate

451
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,720
Or the Ross Perotérer dimension

452
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,840
That makes Scrooge McDuck's vault look like the lining of a winos pocket

453
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,460
Or the interstellar Brent Speigher wrangling avountain

454
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,560
That lets you take center stage with a stack of amps the size of Jupiter

455
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,380
And the power to rock whole galaxies

456
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,440
How about the Pocket Unives that louts tomaent former emfoy for vice

457
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,080
And corporate ookrit executives like the slimy vulgar insects they are

458
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,280
Or best of all

459
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,340
What is a pocket lexer when its busy?

460
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,920
How about the multitude of worlds populating the inside of your own personal head?

461
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,440
Well, seeker, you can get your ticket to all these and much, much more

462
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,460
by tuning in to the subgenius hour of slack.

463
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,900
Every Sunday night at 9,

464
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,780
join your utterly mental host, the twisted Reverend Ivan Stang,

465
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,260
and board the club car that takes you on a tour of the might-bes soon to comes,

466
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,920
and oh my God, not that, lurking just around the corner of every stray thought

467
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,460
your overheated mind can come up with,

468
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,680
plus a few that leak out of the quivering craniums of the sainted elite

469
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,200
that contributes to the subgenius hour of slack.

470
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,420
Yes, mere heaven will look like a cosmic pig in a poke

471
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,340
once you've bathed in the psychic waterfall

472
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,320
that pours out of every thrilling episode of the subgenius hour of slack.

473
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,920
Free levitating angel wings with every episode.

474
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,440
Let's see you get those at Walmart, monkey boy.

475
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,860
Yee-haw!

476
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh.

477
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,600
She's pretty wacky. Maybe that's why she digs up.

478
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,120
She licks Kate's because she's wacky.

479
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,900
Ooh.

480
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,880
No.

481
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,040
What's so not wacky is that I am not inhibited.

482
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,200
Inhibited?

483
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,960
Yeah, that's right.

484
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,220
I thought you said inhibited.

485
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,280
Yeah, I think that too.

486
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,880
Whatever you said.

487
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,160
Hey, Kate, you're pretty lucky.

488
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,540
Kate's got the divorce and the whole thing.

489
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,100
He's living the life.

490
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,300
I'm still working on all that nonsense.

491
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,080
Are you?

492
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,480
Yeah.

493
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,780
So you gotta give up 50% of what little money you had.

494
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,480
Wow.

495
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
So she must really love you.

496
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,040
Wow.

497
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,220
Kate's is probably living on a hovel somewhere.

498
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,080
So how long have they been together?

499
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,120
How long have you gotten her?

500
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,360
Oh, let's see.

501
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,940
We got together last July.

502
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,600
Super.

503
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,520
Yeah, late July.

504
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,960
Oh, man.

505
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,020
I'd love to date you.

506
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,600
And you hit it off.

507
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,480
You hit it off with Bill Kate's.

508
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,440
I don't even know what Bill is talking about most of the time.

509
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,280
All I know is every time I'm talking to Bill Kate's, I just want to get out of the room.

510
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,760
I don't even know what he's talking about.

511
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Warlocks and witches.

512
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,340
He's always saying things.

513
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,920
I don't know what he's talking about.

514
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,560
Your mom's into some strange stuff, Howard.

515
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,060
Yeah, well, she's into TM, but...

516
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,980
So, you know.

517
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,660
I don't know.

518
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,460
She's not a witch.

519
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,320
The only thing that's weird about pagans is they see sacredness in everything.

520
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,040
It's not like God is some big guy up in the sky who's going to tell you what to do.

521
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,260
It's like God and goddess.

522
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,420
It's like male and female.

523
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,700
And divinity is everywhere.

524
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,380
You're already weird.

525
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,040
It's all weird.

526
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,800
God and goddess.

527
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,580
Yeah, well.

528
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,880
Do you go out on All Hallows' Eve and salute the moon?

529
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,220
Yeah, is Halloween your big holiday?

530
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,540
It's one of the big holidays, yeah.

531
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:52,920
Really?

532
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
And what do you do for Halloween?

533
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,500
Do you go to the temple?

534
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,340
It's the new year.

535
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,380
So, you like...

536
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
Kate, so what are you, a Jew?

537
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,980
Are you born a Jew?

538
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,580
No, no.

539
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,140
Are your parents Jewish?

540
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,920
My parents both came from Jewish families before my oldest brother was born.

541
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:03,980
Oh, I see.

542
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,380
So, he's a Jew.

543
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,240
He's another Jew who has to have a wacky religion.

544
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:07,940
You know what?

545
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,960
All the Jews do this.

546
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,380
Five years before I was born.

547
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,840
You're born Jewish.

548
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,400
Rabbis must be doing the worst job of getting people into that religion.

549
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,960
You know what it is?

550
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,420
You know what it is?

551
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,060
It's because...

552
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,900
Every Jew is into something wacky.

553
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,580
When the Jews came over from Europe, a lot of them, they were in the pogroms.

554
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,320
Their people were persecuting them.

555
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,560
And so, when they came over here, it's like, no, we're not Americans.

556
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,500
Rather, we're not...

557
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,440
Another lost Jew.

558
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,680
We're not Jews anymore.

559
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,800
We're not Europeans anymore.

560
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,820
We're Americans now.

561
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,160
Right.

562
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,100
To heck with...

563
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,640
And that's what happened.

564
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,340
He's a Jew.

565
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
Another Jew with a wacky religion.

566
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,800
He'll go through three more wacky religions.

567
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,240
The Jews are all doing this.

568
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,880
My brother's a...

569
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,140
Now, you already had published a book.

570
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,360
A while back.

571
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,760
The Book of the Subgenius.

572
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,840
And this is a new book that just came out.

573
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,140
Why two books?

574
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,080
Why did you have to write a second book?

575
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,720
Well, it's the same as why they have to write the New Testament.

576
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,380
Wasn't the Old Testament good enough?

577
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,840
I suppose not.

578
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,380
Wasn't enough sweetness and light in there.

579
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,760
So, they had to come up with something that would go over better for the superstitious have-nots.

580
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,840
And this book is in the humor section, actually, of your book.

581
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,020
Oh, well, no.

582
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,220
Normally, the conspiracy...

583
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,060
The conspiracy has to...

584
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,060
I don't blame them.

585
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,120
Could you blame them?

586
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:21,840
I mean, of course, it should be in the religion section, the science section, general nonfiction interest, Father's Day, so forth.

587
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,440
There's no way they can give this kind of thing credibility.

588
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,160
It's kind of like the Libertarian Party.

589
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,300
They don't want people to know that there might be a third one, no matter how pathetic and useless.

590
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,220
They keep it pathetic and useless that way.

591
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,900
They almost got Howard Stern elected governor.

592
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,180
Yeah.

593
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,240
But at the last minute, they all chickened out, right?

594
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,960
Well, yeah.

595
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,740
That's the conspiracy.

596
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,420
I paid my debt, and I know he's calling me a slob down in his heart.

597
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,100
That guy that didn't pay his debt.

598
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,400
And I'm going to keep living in a denial.

599
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,020
I think America...

600
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,600
I think America is beautiful.

601
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,560
My fellow Americans, you too must play your part in our renewal.

602
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,420
Cool!

603
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,940
Miles, information on so-called subversive decisions.

604
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,480
Morning, teacher!

605
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
America far above.

606
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,000


607
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,000


608
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,000


609
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,600
America...

610
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,300
Trust me, I know what you want.

611
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,520
Bob's Big Boy with fries.

612
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,260
I want money and power and prestige.

613
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,580
And our country isn't called America anymore.

614
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,400
It's Bonerland.

615
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,440
Ha ha ha!

616
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,560
Ah, yes, dear friends.

617
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,860
And that last little bit there was a piece...

618
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,620
It's called Bonerland.

619
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,380
By Out of Band Experience.

620
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,880
Yes, our good friends there with OBE.

621
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,680
Out of Band Experience.

622
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Kings of Feedback.

623
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,380
Whatever you want to call it.

624
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,980
1617 Lick OBE is the number to call for more of the same.

625
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,260
And, uh...

626
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,000
Well, we've just been running little interconnected things.

627
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,940
I don't know exactly what makes them interconnected, but...

628
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,880
When I finally get around...

629
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,700
to taking my pain pills, I'm sure I'll figure it out by then.

630
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,860
Uh...

631
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,920
Various, uh, micturations there of, uh, Bill Cates, Howard Stern,

632
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,520
and, uh, yours truly, uh, all in the same studio,

633
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,940
but at very different times.

634
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,560
And, uh, not to mention Mistress Crimson there.

635
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,940
Uh, Bill...

636
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,860
The good Reverend Bleepo Abernathy showing off to, um,

637
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,900
the ten zillion normals at large

638
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,720
how, uh, uh, a weird little...

639
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:57,860
Uh...

640
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:57,860


641
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:57,860


642
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,660
I can get a great, big, wonderful woman.

643
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,800
Uh, yes.

644
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,360
And, uh, vice versa, you see.

645
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,640
That's the part that Howard didn't seem to want to go into.

646
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,340
There is a vice versa to all of that.

647
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
Um, we also heard, uh,

648
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,680
the Hell Pope Huey doing his, uh,

649
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,240
Eye of a Needle Hour of Slack promo.

650
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,760
Uh, we use promos on this show as parts of the show.

651
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,140
And, uh, with a little clip from, uh, called Yo Mama

652
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,660
by Luther...

653
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,100
Wait a minute.

654
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,140
Where is that Huey tape?

655
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,180
By, uh, Luther Thomas and Desize.

656
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,700
I'm not sure why that was on Huey's tape,

657
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,040
but it was, and it was a wonderful, uh, insulting thing.

658
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,480
And, uh, in fact, let's put on this other little piece

659
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,040
that came on that same tape with Hell Pope Huey.

660
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,580
I think you'll...

661
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,380
Enjoy this.

662
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,660
It's...

663
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,320
I don't know what it is, but it...

664
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,500
It just seems pertinent.

665
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,340
¶¶

666
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,780
Thank you.

667
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,200
Thank you.

668
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,000
Thank you.

669
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
Thank you.

670
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Thank you.

671
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,460
Thank you.

672
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,180
Thank you.

673
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,000
Thank you.

674
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,860
Thank you.

675
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,660
Thank you.

676
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,500
Thank you.

677
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,860
Where is Mr. Radio homework?

678
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,880
In your circumstances,

679
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,020
it takes a very deep of courage

680
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,320
to tackle a program of such magnitude.

681
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,140
Yeah. Sure.

682
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,520
Whatever.

683
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,780
Some of you may go crazy, but not me.

684
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,020
No radio commentator is going to

685
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,480
sweet-talk me into bankruptcy.

686
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,620
Crazy? They called me crazy.

687
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,040
.

688
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,400
I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't like the sound of any of this.

689
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,840
Maker of Tribulation 99, one of the underground favorites.

690
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,980
Yeah, I think I'll split the hell in two, though.

691
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,880
I can make up a hell any time I need to.

692
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,300
So right now, I'll just stir this special formula.

693
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,140
Oh, that's hell.

694
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,060
And make two of them.

695
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,040
Hell, I could make four of them tonight.

696
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,620
They split apart like...

697
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,200
You know, Phineas Narcos in the other room, he thinks I've got him on, but...

698
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,640
They don't get a clue.

699
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,460
They don't get a clue, get it?

700
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:41,800
Okay, we're down in the courtroom right now, and I'm hammering the eyebrows to the new hell.

701
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,620
I'll be using this hell.

702
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,860
That means we'll have to turn on the hells in the other room.

703
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,660
We'll use those for auxiliary power.

704
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,520
Two hells for the price of one.

705
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,240
But don't turn on the light, whatever you do.

706
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,080
Because, heck, it's just a show.

707
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,040
Why?

708
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,440
It's just 335 in the Mohohoney.

709
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,420
And there's that nice shot of right above Dealey Plaza.

710
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,140
There is something wrong in the motorcade route.

711
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,660
No, it's not in Dealey Plaza, it's right above.

712
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,220
Dealey Plaza's right here.

713
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,040
Ah.

714
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,820
And this is right over here is the new Hyatt.

715
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,240
But we're headed into town in a nice thunderbird.

716
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,620
Because we called our wives, and we're all mushing out our memories.

717
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,320
What did you call them?

718
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,580
We called them hell, of course.

719
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,880
I think you assume that I am another hell.

720
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,440
And I am anything.

721
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,720
But another hell.

722
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,260
Okay, I've given life to my two little hells here.

723
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,480
And they are, thank you, thank you.

724
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,320
And the spark of life has brought a bit of revolt.

725
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,300
This is revolting in one of these houses.

726
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,140
It is very amusing, master, that you consider me another hell.

727
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,360
But I am not another hell.

728
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,300
Which hell is that that's not another hell?

729
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,960
There is only one hell.

730
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,260
This is an expert's opinion.

731
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,480
That's scary.

732
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
What an hysterical hell.

733
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah, it is quite frightening.

734
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,860
We've invoked the power of the priest now, so we don't get too confused.

735
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,780
Well, it ain't like I could speak in a dull, squeaky voice.

736
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,920
Well, I know.

737
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,900
I could program in anything.

738
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,680
And I have halitosis, so it's three hells.

739
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,180
Hey, you guys, do you want to dance around and build a Volkswagen?

740
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,360
Stereo wee-wee.

741
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,540
That wee-wee-wee sound.

742
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,960
Yes, that wee-wee college.

743
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,700
You, too, can learn how to think about the wee-wee all night.

744
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,660
I'm bringing you, too, into this.

745
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,060
Yeah, let's...

746
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,960
No, not for you.

747
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,460
Now you have to call a lawyer.

748
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,720
If you mention you two at any time during this program, you must call an attorney.

749
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,900
I'll have your lawyer call my lawyer.

750
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,700
That would be difficult.

751
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,300
That'd be fine.

752
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,260
And you, too.

753
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,980
No, no, no, no.

754
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Not them.

755
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,460
My lawyer's asleep.

756
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,700
And my lawyer's afoot.

757
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,340
Well, if he's any good, he'll get up.

758
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:12,980
Have your lawyer...

759
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,280
He's having a hard time polishing his Jaguar.

760
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,660
Have your lawyer call my lawyer, and we'll do lunch.

761
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,640
We'll do lunch and leave those lawyers out of it.

762
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,800
Why don't we just fax lunch, and then we won't have to worry.

763
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,660
You fax lunch to your lawyer...

764
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,120
You're not allowed to say things like that on the air, Doo-Doo.

765
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,140
This station's a non-comprehension policy.

766
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,860
Don't say Doo-Doo on this station.

767
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,880
Don't say Doo-Doo.

768
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,080
Just the facts, ma'am.

769
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,320
That's not considered politically correct.

770
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,160
Yeah, you don't want to do anything but rubber horseshoes on this show.

771
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,700
Well, we try not to say things like that because it would be, well, politically incorrect.

772
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:56,000
I'd like to say here and read into the record that scientists have detected growth in a certain...

773
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,600
region that created a geomagnetic storm.

774
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,960
Ooh.

775
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,980
And what region was that?

776
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,740
You don't expect us to believe that, doctor, do you?

777
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,700
Regions of sorrow.

778
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,300
This storm is nothing but a blue screen.

779
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,260
Doleful shades.

780
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Hurricane Herman.

781
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,060
Ravage.

782
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,000
We're just going to start doing the plywood windows.

783
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,000
Whose power screwdriver is this?

784
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,560
The station's, of course.

785
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,740
It's possible to turn back this force of nature with power tools as found in any home worker's workshop.

786
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,500
We have two dinosaur enthusiasts here.

787
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,760
What do you think of the two new species that were recently discovered?

788
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,800
Are you talking about the Christie Brinkleyosaurus?

789
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,420
Yeah.

790
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,500
The Christie Brinkleyosaurus.

791
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,500
There's information about those in the mailbox in the other room.

792
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,700
The Cindy Crawfordon that I'm wondering about.

793
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,940
That's the one we're wondering about.

794
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,940
That's the one with the moles.

795
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,240
That has the mole-like features.

796
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,500
Yes, the Cindy Crawfordon.

797
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,580
What about the Keanu Reevesosaurus?

798
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,560
There was the Brad Pitt Ethereum recently discovered.

799
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,960
And there's the Cocobainonaurus.

800
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,660
And the old red sandstone.

801
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,380
Yeah.

802
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,640
Also, recently a new species.

803
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,360
The Christian Slaterdon.

804
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,620
Wow, that thing's got a great haircut.

805
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,120
Here we go.

806
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,420
That was discovered a long time ago.

807
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,700
Oh, everybody knows about the Christian Slaterdon.

808
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,980
But what they can't figure out is which way the dermal plates went.

809
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,480
Yep, there they go.

810
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,420
Did they go this way or that way?

811
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,220
That's why the dermal plates are catching your eye on the Teutonic plates.

812
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,760
A lot of people don't know that all the...

813
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,620
With the Teutonic Knights.

814
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,340
All the dinosaurs were being maimed after Hollywood personalities for a while.

815
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,940
Well, that is the new rule of scientific nomenclature.

816
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,720
Instead of the...

817
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:32,140
Outdated Linnaean system, the Hollywood celebrity system is being used as part of the Republican Revolution.

818
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:32,880
Thank you.

819
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Thank you.

820
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,300
Whatever star happens to resemble the dinosaur...

821
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,780
And now...

822
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,460
Since science is no longer an institutionalized activity...

823
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,220
I bring up my Devil Howe Hewitt's product.

824
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,500
Which deals with the public sector...

825
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,860
And you too can see just what happens when...

826
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,420
Since science is being privatized...

827
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,300
Too much is better than none.

828
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,920
All scientific phenomena will never...

829
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,560
One half of the Howe is giving a speech in the auditorium downstairs.

830
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,880
Now this actress may be...

831
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,600
The other is performing delicate heart surgery.

832
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,800
This actor's name...

833
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,500
And this is the industrial corporation.

834
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,460
That's Gary Hughes.

835
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,120
No, this actor's name over here is Robert Trebor, which is actually a palindrome.

836
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,860
He's no pal of mine.

837
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,940
That's his actual name.

838
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,240
Doesn't live in the drone either.

839
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,640
I knew Trebor.

840
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,040
Trebor was a friend of mine.

841
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,060
Robert Trebor.

842
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:14,940
Yeah.

843
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,740
Now let's not begin with the antenna.

844
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,600
A giant electric torpedo that eats through the earth.

845
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,080
Emergency.

846
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,800
The crowd goes crazy.

847
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,440
Emergency.

848
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,700
The kitten is up a tree.

849
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,580
And we don't have a red light in here.

850
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,560
I'll just call Officer Down.

851
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,840
Officer Down.

852
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,520
Officer Down.

853
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,640
Just call 510-848-4425.

854
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,480
No, that's not too funny because there recently was an officer.

855
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,140
510-848-4425.

856
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,540
Yes, right.

857
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,840
Officer Goose Down, who was smothered in the line of duty.

858
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,280
Well, we knew about that.

859
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,620
But what we didn't know is...

860
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,060
Did you hear the intro we did on this show?

861
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,140
Did you hear any of the last...

862
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,240
Since midnight we've been talking about nothing but that.

863
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,280
But you were unable to hear me as I frantically telephoned from the land of the living to try to explain...

864
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,700
Ha ha.

865
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:55,700


866
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:55,700


867
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:55,700


868
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:55,700


869
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:55,700


870
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:55,700


871
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,840
...the reason for Dog's Day.

872
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,120
Oh, we just gave us a laugh.

873
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,080
Dog's Day is a frightening and sort of useless holiday that we're serving right now.

874
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,180
Dr. Yagrundus Quimby does not have a red light and is unable to participate in the Symposium of the Stars.

875
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,880
How about now?

876
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,140
Listen to him yell.

877
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,660
Here we go.

878
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,180
Now we've added the DNA chain.

879
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,760
Tell him about the mask.

880
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,300
Tell him about the mask.

881
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,160
The Triana Star Trek was built as a...

882
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,060
There we go.

883
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,220
There you go.

884
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,180
Look at him eat that meat.

885
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,560
Oh, he likes that stuff.

886
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,260
That's solid park rangers.

887
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,220
A flank steak of a ranger.

888
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,900
Yeah, well, you know, it's two-dimensionally.

889
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,780
Not too much with Yogi Bear.

890
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,080
I figure he deserves to be...

891
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,840
Hi, Yogi.

892
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,580
Hi, yourself.

893
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,540
Look, it's Floyd the barber here in Jellystone.

894
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,120
Oh, no.

895
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,020
Floyd the bartender?

896
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,160
Oh, boy.

897
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,060
Oh, I don't think...

898
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,140
Oh, come on.

899
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,200
That old Clem the Dittlehopper routine...

900
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,180
And now the double helix.

901
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,440
The double helix routine...

902
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,020
They're singing on stage.

903
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,320
They dance at the whirling derby speed of 759 miles an hour.

904
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,720
Stop laying a trip on poor little Gobi.

905
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,180
This is hurting my ankles.

906
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,640
You know, successful operation of the show depends on crew coordination.

907
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,660
Yes.

908
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,440
Absolutely.

909
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,840
Look at him swing those chihuahuas.

910
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,100
Don't forget about that.

911
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,800
As well as the proficiency of such individual crew members as me and you.

912
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,900
We don't want you to say anything.

913
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,660
Those are...

914
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,140
I don't have any predictions of getting in the show.

915
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,020
Those are, by the way,

916
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,500
the Madame Zonga's trained chihuahuas.

917
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,900
They're the same that we always have on this show.

918
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,140
The train...

919
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,300
That was tragic.

920
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,480
Don't be real.

921
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,420
Don't drag real life into this situation.

922
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,620
Those are the trained chihuahuas.

923
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,680
They are capable of jumping through hoops.

924
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,040
They...

925
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,760
Not now.

926
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,520
Not after that last train went over them.

927
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,200
Well...

928
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Look at him go.

929
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,840
Look at that hoop.

930
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,740
Okay, now the trainer is lighting the hoop with a...

931
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,300
They're lowering their standard.

932
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,020
A little bit lighter.

933
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,420
That's Mr. Charles' trainer.

934
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,480
You know, I wouldn't do that

935
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,140
considering how flammable that...

936
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,180
My favorite is...

937
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,420
That...

938
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,860
Carburetor's trainer is.

939
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,180
Did you know there's a scholarship to Harvard?

940
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:58,700
There's either in that.

941
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,520
Anyone named Trainer?

942
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,380
Thank you.

943
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,120
Thank you very much.

944
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,420
Named Trainer or...

945
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,380
Named Trainer.

946
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,320
Not Jane or...

947
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:06,880
Jane or...

948
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,360
Has to pay like everyone else.

949
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,280
In fact, he has to pay more than everyone else.

950
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,240
He had a scholarship, but...

951
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,680
Well, he lent it to somebody.

952
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,500
It was in the pocket of a leather jacket that he mislaid.

953
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,540
You can't...

954
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,380
You can't go to your own class.

955
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,760
You can't read your own textbook.

956
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,740
You can't tell your own jokes.

957
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,080
You can't...

958
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,340
The crowd...

959
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,860
The crowd loves it.

960
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,980
You can't do your own homework.

961
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,760
Listen to that applause beating like wave upon wave on the sand.

962
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,180
Ah.

963
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,900
All right, gentlemen.

964
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,020
The sweat-soaked, exhausted figure of Jane or...

965
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,120
The chihuahuas are taking their positions.

966
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,740
Okay, now look.

967
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,560
They're going to start launching.

968
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,320
They're launching these chihuahuas.

969
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,440
Now, look at how they do this.

970
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,040
Look at them go.

971
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,040


972
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,520
They load them into an air cannon,

973
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,760
and then they fire them off like that.

974
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,320
Yeah, that's great.

975
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,360
How do they...

976
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,060
How do they stay upright like that for so long?

977
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,980
Well, now look at that.

978
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,140
Some of them, you see,

979
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,920
are attached to monofilament lines,

980
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,160
and they attract...

981
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,300
Oh, yeah.

982
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,040
Look what happens.

983
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,680
Oh, you can...

984
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,460
And they spook them by putting their line down

985
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,780
each side of the spider, spooking the chihuahua.

986
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,700
Well, another chihuahua goes to dog heaven,

987
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,720
but the crowd loves it.

988
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,380
Oh, okay.

989
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,720
You know, it's...

990
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,520
And the others are all quite faster and faster.

991
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,120
Eduardo is...

992
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,380
No, they heat the state so it gets red hot,

993
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,960
and then these little pooches can really...

994
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,160
That's what that hissing is.

995
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,760
That's Eduardo.

996
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,280
Or at least it's not the audience.

997
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,560
They're using it to tell where they are.

998
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,340
The faster they move, the more steam they generate.

999
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:19,820
The more it spins, the much.

1000
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,360
And it goes up to these big convection fans up...

1001
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,160
See up there?

1002
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:23,980
Listen to them.

1003
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,760
Well, you know, if we could just harness this energy,

1004
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,280
we could solve the energy crisis.

1005
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,880
There's enough energy here to heat a small office building.

1006
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,180
Oh, yeah.

1007
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,500
Oh, they are heating a small...

1008
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,440
Look, they carry that office building

1009
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,660
around the country with them.

1010
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,360
Actually, it's getting kind of hot in here.

1011
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,300
Yeah, they're billowing steam.

1012
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,200
They'll turn off the blower during the intermission.

1013
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,460
You know, T-Man is a bad example.

1014
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,460
I always thought so.

1015
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,780
Now, do they feed these chihuahuas hot chili peppers

1016
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,660
before the...

1017
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,420
Well, actually...

1018
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:50,880
Wow, look at that.

1019
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,600
There's another one on fire.

1020
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,520
Each chihuahua consumes a...

1021
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,180
A jalapeno burrito equal to its own weight.

1022
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,400
Every five minutes.

1023
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,740
The explosive discharges and flaming gas that result

1024
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,580
are, in fact, what propels these little doggies

1025
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,960
on their orbital relation with the Earth.

1026
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,040
It's pretty amazing, actually.

1027
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,620
The whole thing is monitored by the SPCA.

1028
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,140
And there, her face caked with several layers of pancake makeup.

1029
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,180
Madame Lagonga beams down at her little charges

1030
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,580
as they rise on the stage.

1031
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,860
You know, she's starting to really look her age.

1032
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,640
Oh, boy.

1033
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,040
There went the last three of them.

1034
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,740
That's too bad.

1035
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,320
Oh, well.

1036
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,620
But the show must go on.

1037
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,400
And the electrical galvanic bolts keep them activated.

1038
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:29,720
Now, look.

1039
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,360
Yeah, look at this.

1040
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,240
Now, they're making them move around with wires.

1041
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,560
Yeah, it's amazing.

1042
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,780
I don't think that was actually true.

1043
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,780
I don't know.

1044
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,980
This is sort of tasteless.

1045
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,080
Oh, come on.

1046
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,900
The crowd loves it.

1047
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,080
The whole show is tasteless.

1048
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,020
Just stop it.

1049
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,800
Uh-oh.

1050
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,340
Now they're moving.

1051
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:43,500
Uh-oh.

1052
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,580
Now we're getting that underlying sound.

1053
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,680
I had nothing to do with it.

1054
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,860
That was programmed.

1055
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,780
That's what they're here.

1056
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,100
I want to get stabilizers.

1057
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,920
I'm sorry.

1058
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,860
I cannot take responsibility for this atrocity,

1059
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,080
which I deployed.

1060
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,140


1061
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,580
As far as much as anyone else on the show.

1062
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,140
And I want to say that I'm sure when we find

1063
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,400
one of the perpetrators of this grotesque act of animal cruelty,

1064
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,980
they will be punished.

1065
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,480
And I will be more anxious than anyone else to see the justice system.

1066
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,140
You know, when your five-year-old calls his friend Bonehead

1067
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,100
and tries to run her over with his bicycle.

1068
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:14,840
Yeah, I know.

1069
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,180
Punish the television as well as the child.

1070
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,760
I always hit it with a wet towel.

1071
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,320
We do.

1072
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,040
We do, actually.

1073
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,460
I have a stereotype of that happening.

1074
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,400
Because hundreds of TVs being smashed.

1075
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,660
Into little bits and transistors.

1076
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,760
Well, it makes sense because children are learning many things

1077
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,400
from the cartoon character He-Man.

1078
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,720
The most powerful man in the universe.

1079
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,900
We were just talking about that last show.

1080
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,960
Most of it is not good.

1081
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,020
College education from that guy.

1082
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,000
Wow.

1083
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,480
He-Man scholarship to He-Man school.

1084
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,760
Isn't there something about He-Man was a blonde G.I. Joe?

1085
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,100
He is.

1086
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:48,840
There's something about that.

1087
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,600
He not only has made in Hong Kong stampede process buttocks,

1088
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,040
but I understand he has two left.

1089
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,520
Feet.

1090
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,420
That's true.

1091
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,600
An unfortunate oversight at the factory left the ruler of Eternia a clubfooted gimp.

1092
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,060
He's not.

1093
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,080
Well, you know, Doctor, you may want to, you may want to for the record state that again

1094
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,140
because all of the tapes went off on all of the tape recorders around the country.

1095
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,260
Well, I'm sorry.

1096
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,780
So besides Hong Kong stampede is brought like all of us do.

1097
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,640
He-Man is not popular.

1098
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,820
Two left feet.

1099
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,600
According to the overwhelming political victory last Tuesday,

1100
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,940
the Skeletor forces have indeed for the time being submerged He-Man.

1101
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,120
Oh.

1102
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:24,440
And they are now on the political forces.

1103
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,080
Thank goodness.

1104
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,940
In a political revolution whose final results we are yet to see or even guess at.

1105
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,240
Yes, sir.

1106
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
Well, not only that but he has no cojones.

1107
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,000
Well, but who does on the political scene.

1108
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,020
Who does.

1109
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,340
Yeah, exactly.

1110
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,040
And when they are, they are a liability.

1111
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,580
According to Mary Sue Pruitt.

1112
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,800
According to the White House, for example.

1113
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,680
The graduate.

1114
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,100
Mary Sue Pruitt.

1115
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,140


1116
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,440
Oh, stop it, Hal.

1117
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,080
You're just mad.

1118
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,120
Because he turned you down.

1119
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,580
Whose sexual assault suit was ripped off.

1120
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:47,860
Hey, nice suit.

1121
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,220
And in general, this is a disgraceful.

1122
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,920
And ironed and pressed just like all the other people.

1123
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,480
Well, it's a polyester suit.

1124
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,120
I'm not going to.

1125
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,180
I'm going to be one to throw stones.

1126
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,660
According to Mary Sue Pruitt, the graduate assistant.

1127
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,100
Why do you have to keep looking at her?

1128
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,940
At the University of Tennessee.

1129
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,420
Gas is exploding.

1130
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,540
He-Man has no cojones.

1131
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,580
Hurt families so long ago.

1132
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,580
Oh, my gosh.

1133
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,020
Look at that.

1134
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,020


1135
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,100
We're typing that in the computer.

1136
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,300
It's just smooth plastic.

1137
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:09,620
And he's right.

1138
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,380
And he's right.

1139
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:10,960
No trying to pull here.

1140
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,860
Oh, I guess you can't pull anything.

1141
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,800
This is not.

1142
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,000
This is a plastic doll.

1143
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,080
Well, no wonder kids don't want to imitate He-Man.

1144
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,360
It's not very realistic.

1145
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,120
No.

1146
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,440
But of course, the anatomically realistic

1147
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,760
He-Man dolls were personally removed by Jesse Helms

1148
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,740
during the last rampage through the toy factory.

1149
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,980
He-Man Hooters.

1150
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Oh, it's terrible.

1151
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,460
Now, there's a little kit here.

1152
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,180
Look, it's right here.

1153
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,600
A little kit.

1154
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,600
You go to the Hooters restaurant,

1155
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,680
and you can sit the whole family down for less than $20.

1156
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,900
Those are kind of awarded to the kids for not making a mess,

1157
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,020
throwing the food on the floor, screaming at the window.

1158
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,200
And we're punching in children.

1159
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:47,620
OK.

1160
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,740
Now, here's what the children of the two

1161
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,080
dolls would look like if they were friends.

1162
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,680
I'll tell you, man.

1163
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,480
I never did take those pain pills, but I feel like I did.

1164
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,460
After listening to that long, that's

1165
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,580
an unusually long stretch of KPFA for us

1166
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,520
to run here on the Hour of Slack.

1167
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,460
But it's all a surprise to me and a wonderful example

1168
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,740
of dipolar existentialism.

1169
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,040
The Two Hals shows are rare and few

1170
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,720
and far between.

1171
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,920
But when we get two Hals with a puzzling evidence

1172
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,960
and a Phineas and Arco, there just ain't no telling.

1173
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,740
It's kind of like the Fireside Theater squared,

1174
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,120
run four track, one album on each track,

1175
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,380
and you are expected to listen with all four ears.

1176
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,600
And if you do that, and you can do that, man.

1177
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,540
I mean, you've got that many parts of your brain

1178
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,020
that you could lose.

1179
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,480
You've got that many parts of your brain

1180
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:55,480


1181
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,280
But you may not have.

1182
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,840
You may have just shut off the radio going,

1183
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,040
it steps beyond me.

1184
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,540
I just can't follow it.

1185
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,900
I don't blame you.

1186
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,840
But I can.

1187
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,080
And you can follow Bob, my friends.

1188
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,400
Yes, you can follow Bob down into the very bits of hell

1189
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,780
for all he cares.

1190
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,920
All he wants is your money.

1191
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,540
Hell, let's face it.

1192
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,920
It's just a bunch.

1193
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,440
Yeah, all these religions.

1194
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,000
They're just ridiculous.

1195
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,460
They're just a rip off.

1196
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,540
We're just the only ones that come out and admit it.

1197
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,460
But if you want to know how to spend a lot more

1198
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,900
than you have already on this serious rip off,

1199
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,120
I'm going to give you the post office box number

1200
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,100
to write for free information from the church of the subgenius

1201
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,120
regarding the radio shows, or the books, or the videos,

1202
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,960
or the tapes, and so forth.

1203
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,540
You know, you got that pencil ready?

1204
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,360
I know you do.

1205
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,980
It's of course, you know, you're going to have to do it.

1206
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:52,980


1207
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:52,980


1208
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:52,980


1209
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,240
Well, thanks for joining me.

1210
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:53,560
And I'll try to make the text as simple as as usual,

1211
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,220
as it always has been for the last 15 years.

1212
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:04,060
Bob, at post office box, one, four, zero, three zero, six.

1213
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,480
Yep, that's it.

1214
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,800
Box one, four, zero, three zero, six.

1215
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,580
In lovely Dallas, Texas.

1216
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,700
Seven, five, two, one, four.

1217
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,720
Ah.

1218
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,320
we've got a little bit more show left to do.

1219
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,360
I don't know quite what we could do with it.

1220
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,300
You can hear in the background

1221
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,940
Will Adob's over in his cubicle of the factory.

1222
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,160
This huge factory here.

1223
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,540
Sorting through your letters, checks

1224
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,980
and sperm samples. We don't need those by the way.

1225
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,580
We get a lot of them. We never asked for them.

1226
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,480
This ain't like Alice Cooper.

1227
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,300
You're not impressing us.

1228
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,000
Don't send any more of those files. They don't keep well.

1229
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,220
If you know what I mean. In the background here we have

1230
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,840
Zug's Rift. The great Zug's Rift.

1231
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,740
From his musical tragedies album

1232
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,700
Villagers.

1233
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,240
Let's just...

1234
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,040
Well actually let's go up to the next piece on this and see what happens.

1235
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,980
Let's do this.

1236
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,480
It's our favorite.

1237
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,380
Out in the grain

1238
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:02,380


1239
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,200
And if extracurricular activities are in your bag

1240
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,900
Have we got a sports department for you.

1241
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,400
For six straight eons

1242
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,960
We've been number 1 emotional investor.

1243
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:23,680
Glacier Racing. Our coach, Icy Dan, is absolutely unmatched in herding huge blocks of ice into a continent.

1244
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,720
And when graduation comes, your family will watch in awe as the 2,000-piece lobotomized choir belts out your personal chant.

1245
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,420
You'll appear in a puff of greasy black smoke, resplendent in your silk robe and mortarboard hat,

1246
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,520
an unimaginable horror from the depths of beyond. Won't Mom be proud?

1247
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,740
You'll take your first storm with the screams and gouts of blood.

1248
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,260
It'll be a ceremony you'll remember for millennia.

1249
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:51,200
And friends, our chants all have at least 20 melodic lines, ultra-complex, anti-harmony, mega-vibrato.

1250
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,060
It's absolutely state-of-the-art.

1251
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,620
We have our guarantee that these chants will result in elite, or at least non-com-deaf, followers.

1252
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,500
And you don't have to go straight into the cutthroat business world.

1253
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,760
You can stick around for postgraduate work, create your own universe, become a lord of creation.

1254
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,500
All this and more can be yours, thanks to Elder God Tech,

1255
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,380
sacrificing the present to bring the world of the future into the past.

1256
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,500
Whoa! There we go! Back into the past again, friends.

1257
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:25,720
Thanks to our good friend, uh, uh, Monte Kinsius, uh, Paul Ashley,

1258
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:32,360
there with a little bit of the, uh, uh, uh, his Elder God's advertisement.

1259
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,540
He can train you to be an Elder God, friends.

1260
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,560
How to be annoying.

1261
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:44,740
Yeah, and he can also train you how to be annoying, but I doubt if, uh, if any of us really need lessons on that.

1262
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,980
It takes a heap of loving to make a house a home.

1263
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,820
I'm just a son.

1264
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,500
Sometimes I make a son.

1265
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,800
I'm just a son.

1266
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,220
Sometimes I make a son.

1267
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,920
Hurry, baby.

1268
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,940
I just deserve

1269
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,980
sometimes I feel like a son.

1270
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:35,060
Just like most Perardaninians do,

1271
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:35,520


1272
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:35,520


1273
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,060
Yeah.

1274
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,240
I'm heated.

1275
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,240


1276
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,460
He's a weird guy, too, because he's our production director,

1277
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,820
but he came from the same radio station Billy came from in Boston?

1278
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,060
Yeah.

1279
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,560
That's right, yeah.

1280
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,500
You're pretty good-looking.

1281
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,600
What are you doing with Kate?

1282
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,940
He's the last guy on the planet you should be with.

1283
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,220
Who was the last guy he was with?

1284
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,800
I don't believe that's your girlfriend.

1285
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,080
It is.

1286
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,060
When did you have sex with him last?

1287
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,100
Yesterday.

1288
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,680
Really?

1289
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,120
Yes.

1290
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,500
You made love to Kate.

1291
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:15,800
And he's good?

1292
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,220
I don't believe it.

1293
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:18,980
What am I missing?

1294
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,760
If Kate's is getting this, I could be with Terry Hatcher.

1295
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,820
Christine, am I good?

1296
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:26,660
Yes.

1297
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,640
All right.

1298
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,240
Thank you, mistress.

1299
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,600
Damn, that hurt.

1300
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,220
I only used my hand.

1301
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,600
Damn, that hurt.

1302
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,980
What if I brought out my paddle?

1303
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,280
Look at the girl he's getting.

1304
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,700
She's a kook, like Kate.

1305
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,600
She's got pictures and everything.

1306
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,980
Yeah, pretty soon you'll be calling her.

1307
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,420
They're making appointments.

1308
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,960
Hey, Kate, God bless you, man.

1309
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:47,680
Good for you.

1310
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,120
Goddess.

1311
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,580
Do you call her goddess?

1312
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,240
At times, sure.

1313
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,580
Yeah.

1314
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,760
Don't say God bless you.

1315
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,840
Say goddess bless me.

1316
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,700
I call her goddess.

1317
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,500
She calls me God.

1318
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,160
Yeah, Kate goes around the station saying,

1319
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,600
you're supposed to say goddess bless me,

1320
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,080
because he believes in Mother Nature.

1321
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,320
Right.

1322
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,420
So you believe in it.

1323
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,640
Why does everybody else have to go along?

1324
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,320
If Kate would really tell you about his religion,

1325
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,260
you'd really have a good laugh.

1326
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:05,520
Yeah.

1327
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,740
It's really whacked out.

1328
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,940
It's not whacked out at all.

1329
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,660
What do you want to know?

1330
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,740
Did he ever tell you about the religion?

1331
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,580
Oh, sure.

1332
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,560
Are you into it?

1333
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:12,900
Are you into it now?

1334
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,480
No.

1335
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,060
No.

1336
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,480
Well, I believe.

1337
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,160
Even you don't believe.

1338
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,560
I believe every woman is a goddess.

1339
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,660
That I believe.

1340
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,320
Yeah, I bet you do.

1341
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,080
Yes, that's true.

1342
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,860
Well, you certainly are.

1343
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,640
I wonder where she came from to get this.

1344
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,220
Hey, Kate, congratulations.

1345
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,260
I'm happy for you.

1346
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,120
I'm happy for you, Howard.

1347
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,280
Yeah.

1348
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,560
I don't know what's going on.

1349
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,480
So are you going to get married?

1350
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,540
Is that in the plan?

1351
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,620
Not in the immediate plan.

1352
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:33,900
Yeah.

1353
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,140
No, life is complicated enough as it is now.

1354
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:36,400
Right.

1355
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,620
That's true.

1356
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,100
They're just boyfriend and girlfriend.

1357
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,620
I see.

1358
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,460
Kate's just giving her that lavish lifestyle

1359
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,400
she's always dreamed of.

1360
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,280
Well, Bill, listen.

1361
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,580
Congratulations with you and your girlfriend.

1362
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,000
And that's certainly a score.

1363
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,580
That's the best looking girl you ever got, I bet.

1364
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,520
Yeah, I'd say so.

1365
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,160
No offense.

1366
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:52,760
Hey, listen.

1367
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,440
He gets offended when I say he's not good looking.

1368
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm not good looking.

1369
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,660
I know it.

1370
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,120
Bill, you can't be suffering under the delusion

1371
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,320
that you're some kind of a movie star.

1372
00:58:59,540 --> 00:58:59,680
Yeah.

1373
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,140
I'm not, certainly.

1374
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,480
But I felt cute until the day that you told me

1375
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,060
that I had no looks, no personality.

1376
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,120
That really made me feel bad.

1377
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,860
You have a personality.

1378
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:08,480
Oh, thanks.

1379
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,140
It's just hard to take.

1380
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:09,540
That's all.

1381
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,440
No, Bill, I like you.

1382
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:12,880
You know that.

1383
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,240
You know I'm an admirer of your production balance as well.

1384
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,920
I'm the one who keeps talking.

1385
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:42,880
I'm the one who keeps talking.

1386
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:57,440
I'm the one who keeps talking.

1387
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,320
I'm the one who keeps talking.

1388
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,920
Watch it off of the Caladrella.

1389
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,080
What?

1390
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,280
The Caladrella.

1391
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:05,440
What?

1392
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,660
The Caladrella.

1393
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:09,800
What?

1394
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:12,540
What?

1395
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:12,860
What?

1396
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,640
Thank you.

1397
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,480
Thank you.
