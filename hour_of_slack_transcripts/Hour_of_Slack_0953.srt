1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,060
I'm alright, I'm alright

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,780
I'm alright

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,400
No, no you're not alright

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,800
You're exhausted

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,080
That thing around your neck

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,040
I could help a bit

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,320
I could carry it for a while

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,740
No

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,160
I could carry it

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,400
Are you propositioning me?

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,580
Share the load

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,660
Share the load

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,240
Get away!

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,400
Can I get a praise bar?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,780
Praise bar!

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,760
Ah yes

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,560
Dear friends, we're back

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,680
to X-Day

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,740
for this show

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,200
We've also got a new song by

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,740
El Queso

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,980
who is heard in the background

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,820
Yes, yes, yes friend

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,980
X-Day

25
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,300
The great celebration at Brushwood

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,440
in far rural mysterious

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,060
western New York State

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,880
where the subgeniuses go to

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,700
await the saucers

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,160
prophesied by their great slack master

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,760
J.R. Bob

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,260
Bob

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,600
Bob

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,140
Bob

35
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,580
Bob

36
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,280
Bob

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,480
Bob

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,640
Bob

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,720
Bob

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,720


41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,780
Bob

42
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:26,940
Bob

43
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,100
Bob

44
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,160
Bob

45
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,160


46
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,360
Bob

47
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,460
Bob

48
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:27,480
Bob

49
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,580
Bob

50
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,580


51
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,840
Bob

52
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:27,840


53
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:27,840


54
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,080
Bob

55
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,080


56
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,080


57
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,100
Bob

58
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,200
Bob

59
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,200


60
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,560
Bob

61
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


62
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


63
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


64
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


65
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


66
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:28,560


67
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:29,960
Bob

68
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,100
Bob

69
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,100


70
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,100


71
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,780
Bob

72
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,140
Bob

73
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,500
Bob

74
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,680
Bob

75
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,060
Bob

76
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,540
Bob

77
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,520
And now friends

78
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,760
The title music

79
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,840
from the video

80
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,300
Da Subdel plain

81
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,860
I gotta ask for help

82
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,040
I didn't grow up dark

83
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,960
I don't really care what sounds like that

84
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,320
Oh, here it is.

85
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,400
What is that, a movie on top of that mountain?

86
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,560
Just look at these wonderful cinematic selections.

87
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
Here's the birth of Stang.

88
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,880
We'll be running Dobbs and Deleastes.

89
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,760
And Snowfire, the story of a wild study no one could take.

90
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,460
And other great, great Stang flicks.

91
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,380
Yeah, but that doesn't play until 3 a.m.

92
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,380
It's really stupid.

93
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,400
Yeah, we put it at 3 a.m.

94
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,380
It is stupid, but that's part of the point.

95
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,760
That's part of the point.

96
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,680
Just part of it, folks.

97
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,380
Just part of the point.

98
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,440
Now let's make a call.

99
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,660
Your mind is not my mind.

100
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,060
Don't forget that.

101
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,020
My mind is not your mind.

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,180
They should have 24-7 Love Genius Radio.

103
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,760
They should.

104
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,220
I would volunteer to be one of the DJs on that show, on that station.

105
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,820
Let's all get my radio broadcasting.

106
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,300
And you would just listen to 24 hours of this show?

107
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,340
Oh, yeah.

108
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,840
No, 24 minutes.

109
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,260
Oh, 24 minutes.

110
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,360
Oh, 24 hours.

111
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,860
24 hours, seven days a week.

112
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,440
24 planets.

113
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,260
That would be tough.

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,660
I'd have to have some time off.

115
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,280
24 rings around...

116
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,140
Lots of coffee.

117
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,820
Around the head of the caller.

118
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
Okay, we could call this caller.

119
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,000
And this caller would serve as part of the great radio team.

120
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,680
The fantastic 24-hour.

121
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:54,920
They're firing up the motor.

122
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
And they're watching the show 24 hours a day.

123
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,960
Oh, the great team of Buzzing Evidence.

124
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,040
Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Howell.

125
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,780
24-7 on KPFA in sub-Berkeley.

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,920
What about this new song you ask about Prairie Squid, you say?

127
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,400
By the El Queso All-Stars?

128
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,600
You're my angel in a bucket, my darling in a pail.

129
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,400
And I'm writing you this letter from the lonesome county jail.

130
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,260
They say that it's unnatural.

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,380
To love you the way that I did.

132
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,240
They call it a crime to spend all my time.

133
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,020
Six inches deep in a prairie squid.

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,320
So I send you this reminder of a heart that beats for two.

135
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,320
And I hope you're doing all right in the refrigerator.

136
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,640
You've got plenty of room in the bucket.

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
So I'm guessing that you'll be okay.

138
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,060
Cause when I get out and back into you.

139
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm hoping you'll still feel the same way.

140
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,940
Hoping that you'll feel the same way.

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,920
My darling, this letter is sealed with my tears.

142
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,060
But as Bob is my witness.

143
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,980
I swear I'll return to your many loving arms.

144
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,700
Angel in a bucket.

145
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,980
I want you.

146
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,440
Angel in a bucket.

147
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,780
I need you.

148
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,860
Angel in a bucket.

149
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,040
I can't live without you baby.

150
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,360
Angel in a bucket.

151
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,560
Angel in a bucket.

152
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,040
Kind of kick a little something past you for the G's.

153
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,280
And make a few friends as I breeze through.

154
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,880
You know it's two in the morning.

155
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,480
And the party's still jumping.

156
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,840
Because my old lady ain't home.

157
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,580
The bitch is in the living room and getting it on.

158
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,600
And they ain't leaving till six in the morning.

159
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,840
What you want to do?

160
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,300
I got a pocket full of rubbers.

161
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
And my homeboys do too.

162
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,920
So turn out the lights.

163
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Shut the doors.

164
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,480
But we don't love them whores.

165
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,180
G. Gordon Gordon dear friends at 7X Day.

166
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,840
Before that the El Queso All Stars.

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,700
She's got the friends but she needs a location.

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,760
He's got a local but he needs her supplies.

169
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,860
Her friends have supplies so they all get together.

170
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,740
Now everybody's welcome at the party tonight.

171
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,280
It's time to redefine the new school group.

172
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,420
Or two-tone suits hanging by the door.

173
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,880
Super Orgy Portal Party.

174
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Super Orgy Portal Party.

175
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,160
Super Orgy Portal Party.

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,480
Super Orgy Portal Party.

177
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,160
You know I actually went to one of those Bob Dobbs DeVivals.

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,900
Yeah there was one last night. It was a great time.

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,180
I shouldn't have said DeVivals.

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,600
One of the X Days but.

181
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,380
Oh X Day wow.

182
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,840
After the original X Day.

183
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,820
Like everything before it was a drill.

184
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,700
And everything after it was like the second year was double X Day.

185
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
And then there was triple X Day.

186
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,860
Yeah well here's the thing.

187
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,120
We don't know what year 1998 will really be.

188
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,300
Because the conspiracy calendar is messed up.

189
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,640
Right.

190
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,320
You know.

191
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
So you know any day could.

192
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,780
You know the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

193
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,740
That's just saying that the world may well end tomorrow for all we know.

194
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,500
You don't know.

195
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm fairly confident.

196
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,440
You may die tomorrow.

197
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,460
The story that I heard at you know approximately 7.05 on X Day.

198
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,640
Was that Bob Dobbs when he received the secret message from the X's.

199
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,240
He wrote it on a bar napkin.

200
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,760
But the actual date is if you turn 1998 upside down it's 8661.

201
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,020
So that's the actual year they're going to come.

202
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,940
So we're still supposed to go to Starwood.

203
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,540
The latest theory I heard was.

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,860
Until 5,000 years from now about.

205
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,320
The latest theory I heard was 2017.

206
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,380
Because of.

207
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,580
Because Ivan Stank thinks he's going to live that long.

208
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,120
No because 1984 came 19 years too late.

209
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,740
Mmm.

210
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,020
When the president started saying war is peace last year.

211
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,780
We knew that means it must really be 1984.

212
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,800
Radio Synesthesia on WCSB in Cleveland.

213
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
With Dr. Bob Dobbs.

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,480
Dr. Sinister.

215
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,580
Before that the super orgy corner party thing is by the Planet Smashers.

216
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
But now little Theodore.

217
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,220
Live at X Day.

218
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,900
And now the ultimate song about pink life.

219
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,160
Get up out of bed.

220
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,500
Sour on my head.

221
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,800
Drinking down a cup.

222
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Trying to wake up.

223
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,360
Driving across the town.

224
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,320
Feeling like a clown.

225
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,720
Some guy's in my lane.

226
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,720
Heard a bullet through his window pane.

227
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,300
Pulling to the lot.

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Goddamn boss has got my favorite spot.

229
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,260
Greeting everyone.

230
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Trying to act.

231
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,740
Trying to act dumb.

232
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,900
I don't belong here.

233
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,000
But then of course the question is then where?

234
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,000
Where?

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,420
The

236
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm plagued by one great doubt.

237
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,300
It's become what my life's all about.

238
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,480
Mind game dude like Maté,

239
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,480
If I had done that I wouldn't have to do this.

240
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,640
If I had done that I wouldn't have to do this.

241
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,980
If I had done that I wouldn't have to do this.

242
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,980


243
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,980


244
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,980


245
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,980


246
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:52,980


247
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,020
Friends, I wish we had the rest of that song.

248
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,580
Little Theodore, live at X-Day.

249
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,580
You can get more about that at littletheodore.com.

250
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,320
And now back to Puzzling Evidence with Dr. Howell and Philo,

251
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,960
a debriefing after 7X Day.

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's see, what else happened that was exceptional and remarkable?

253
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,960
Well, there was the auction, of course.

254
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,920
The auction.

255
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,220
For subgenius youth outreach.

256
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,160
That is correct.

257
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,040
And Howell and I were the subgenius youth outreach recipients,

258
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,120
senior division, of course.

259
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,840
Yes, our cabin was for youthful types like Sir Guy Dua,

260
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,780
who was also in our cabin, one of the three snorers of distinction.

261
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,780
I found out later they put us all together for a specific reason.

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,660
The snorwood.

263
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,980
That's right, the snorwood factory.

264
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,120
They had this wooden snore device, snore capturing device below the chamber.

265
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,200
This is one of my favorite movies.

266
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,380
Come on, you guys, be quiet.

267
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,260
I want you to watch this.

268
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,640
Okay, all right.

269
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,740
Howell fell asleep again.

270
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,680
This is the part where Ivan Stang takes over the world.

271
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,720
A thousand experiments, a thousand failures,

272
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,520
and then, at last, the great wonderful day.

273
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,940
Stang.

274
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,940
It's just the great wonderful day.

275
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,480
The last little mixture of drugs.

276
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,200
But why, why do it?

277
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,580
Stang.

278
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,820
Just a scientific experiment at first.

279
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,040
That's all.

280
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,380
To do something no other men in the world have done.

281
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,280
But there's more to it than that.

282
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,160
I know now.

283
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,080
It came to me suddenly.

284
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,960
The drugs I took seemed to light up my brain.

285
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,940
Suddenly I realized the power I held.

286
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,480
The power to rule.

287
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,900
To make the world...

288
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,220
To make the world grovel at my feet.

289
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,300
We'll soon put the world right now.

290
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,960
We'll begin with a reign of terror.

291
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,360
A few murders here and there.

292
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,600
Murders of great men.

293
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,960
Murders of little men.

294
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,660
Just to show we make no distinction.

295
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,300
It might even break a train or two.

296
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Just these fingers around a signalman's throat.

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,860
That's all.

298
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,980
So where's my frog, Stang?

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Let's go with it.

300
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,860
Stang.

301
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,380
Stang.

302
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Where's my frog, man?

303
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,360
You want that award again, don't you?

304
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,440
The Hey Stang Award.

305
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,280
Hey Stang.

306
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,740
Hey Stang.

307
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,480
See my butt plug, Stang?

308
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,060
Uh-huh.

309
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,680
Uh-huh.

310
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
I snore all night.

311
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,040
And I'm like this in the day.

312
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,920
Uh-huh.

313
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,840
Hal can actually snore before he goes to sleep.

314
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
It's like as he's beginning to enter his sleep cycle,

315
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,820
the snoring begins.

316
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,420
But the second or third night,

317
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,540
I was able to obtain some ear...

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,120
Some ear things.

319
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,580
Some ear muffs, all right.

320
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,680
Ear plugs.

321
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,080
All right.

322
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,540
Give a plug for those muffs.

323
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,940
Dying.

324
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,300
I couldn't even hear the fan.

325
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,220
I couldn't hear anything.

326
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,100
I could just hear my breathing and the...

327
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,700
The fans, he refers to, were specifically imported by Philo,

328
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,120
not to cool the room down, but just to make noise,

329
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,280
a white noise that would ideally muffle all the snoring

330
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
into one rattling roar.

331
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,220
We had three machines.

332
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,020
We had three fans that blew a vortex.

333
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,400
We had three machines.

334
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,280
That was enough to just...

335
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,360
It often blew the frap smoke away to silence the shrill beeping

336
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,900
of the fire alarm, which would be set off by the clouds

337
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,400
of punching frap smoke.

338
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,620
We had one fan whose only job was to blow the smoke past

339
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,460
the fire alarm before it would set the fire alarm off.

340
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,980
But it did also provide a secondary purpose,

341
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,260
and that was to keep the wind blowing across my...

342
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,180
My...

343
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,540
Ugh.

344
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,660
Ow.

345
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,040
Ow.

346
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,700
That hurt.

347
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,080
Oh, don't snap it like that.

348
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,920
That's not gonna do anybody any good.

349
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,460
So we had three fans positioned that blew a vortex,

350
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,260
about a 30 to 40 mile an hour circular wind inside our snoring chamber.

351
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Okay, I got it.

352
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh, there we go.

353
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,040
Sorry.

354
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,220
What?

355
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,300
Oh, there she goes.

356
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
This is Lady Time going by, trying to remember what show she's listening to.

357
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,660
I'm admitted that you have a drug problem.

358
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,340
I lost my drugs twice today.

359
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,480
Twice today, if it were not for the power of Bob and the love of subgenii,

360
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,180
I would be frap-less.

361
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,760
I lost my frap.

362
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,420
Twice.

363
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,940
And why?

364
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,520
And why?

365
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,280
Drugs.

366
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Because the frap took your mind.

367
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
No, it wasn't a frap.

368
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,940
It was a false drug.

369
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,740
It was the false marijuana.

370
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,720
Oh.

371
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,460
This stuff here.

372
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,660
It's not frap.

373
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,220
That's why it took my mind.

374
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,960
It's...

375
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,460
It's...

376
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,400
It's false drugs.

377
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,140
You don't wanna...

378
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,200
You don't wanna smoke it.

379
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,640
Maybe throw my sunglasses in.

380
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,560
The fire is...

381
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,440
It made you lose your other false drugs.

382
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,020
It made me lose my real false drugs twice.

383
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,820
Not once, but twice.

384
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Fool me once, shit on you.

385
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,340
Fool me twice, fuck you.

386
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,960
My mind is not my mind.

387
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,300
I still ain't been to the big party, but I suppose that if I did I'd have a good time.

388
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,000
Lots of folks I see doing it regularly, and they tell me that it feels just fine.

389
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,420
Time to redefine the new school group, or two-tone suits scattered on the floor.

390
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,980
Super orgy porno party.

391
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,200
Super orgy porno party.

392
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,240
Super orgy porno party.

393
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,600
Super orgy porno party.

394
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,360
I no longer wish to preach to the choir.

395
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,100
If I'm going to be reduced to preaching about things that we are all well aware of,

396
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,180
then I am going to be preaching to others besides you illustrious folk.

397
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm going to have to go out there into the world, make a goddamn fool of myself, and preach the word of Bob, aren't I?

398
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,260
Well, if that's what it requires, then that is what it requires.

399
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,100
But I will admit this.

400
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,620
I won't go gently into that good night.

401
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,720
I will, however, fly high and happy aboard the pleasure saucers on that fateful day, whenever it may be.

402
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,920
And I've heard that it might not be this year.

403
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,980
I'm hoping it will be, but it might not.

404
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,100
But whenever it is, even if it's just myself, it could be two other people, it could be three other people, it could be four other people,

405
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,780
it could be four thousand other people who board the pleasure saucers with me, I will board those saucers.

406
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,080
I will board those saucers.

407
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,680
And I will do it with the knowledge that my consciousness is clean,

408
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,780
that I have slacked off to the fullest of my ability and comprehension,

409
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,900
and that I have lusted and hated in an entirely satisfying way.

410
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:10,520
Ladies and gentlemen, I may be young, but I have never seen something so slack-producing in all my born days.

411
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,020
I can only hope that I have many, many born days to celebrate the slack further,

412
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:22,500
and I can hope that you too celebrate your slack until the very day you die and shut up like hell.

413
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,260
So, go out there, stay, watch the bands, whatever, enjoy the puri and interest, get drunk, smoke the frob, I don't care.

414
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:39,720
I don't mind. Just know that on that fateful day, 7 a.m., July 5th, you will be saved.

415
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:06,300
Friends, here's to the beautiful, happiness and safety of the children of the Ivory Coast expect

416
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,180
you live life in a way as worth it, if only for your refrigerator and your love.

417
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,960
To serve the people, it is to you, who open up.

418
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:36,480
And now, for your edification, your bewondermint, your bafflement, your, finally, your slack,

419
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:46,980
I proudly in the name of J.R. Bob-Dob present to you, a little Theodore and a babushka!

420
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,840
Not always sure what the point is, but we press on anyway.

421
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,780
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.

422
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,680
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.

423
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,460
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.

424
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,540
I want an ugly girl who thinks that's the way to be.

425
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,580
I want an ugly girl who'll make you jealous if you just wait and see.

426
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
Ugly girls must be lonely.

427
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,800
An ugly girl would love you only.

428
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,460
Ugly girls may not have many hearts to have, but ugly girls have got just as many parts.

429
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,920
I want an ugly girl who's not scared that the paper may.

430
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,640
I want an ugly girl who'll bring you back to a loving friend.

431
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,460
I want an ugly girl who's not scared that the paper may.

432
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,720
I want an ugly girl who'll make you proud if you didn't read.

433
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,640
I want an ugly girl who's sure to walk all over the place.

434
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,940
Ugly girls deserve happiness too.

435
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,520
An ugly girl would take the world of you.

436
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,520
Ugly girls may be easy, but ugly girls don't have meaning.

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,400
I want an ugly girl who can tell you all about pain.

438
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,500
I want an ugly girl who's intelligent, all of me saying.

439
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,440
I want an ugly girl who's not scared that the paper may.

440
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,520
I want an ugly girl who looks like a profane.

441
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,460
I want an ugly girl who'll take her out and start the road.

442
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,440
Now I thought I'd sing something pretty and refined about something special.

443
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,480
I want my family to know what sex and life ought to look like.

444
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,080
Come on, girl, you've got pain and you've got it.

445
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,080


446
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,300
You've got pain and you've got it all inside of you.

447
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,780
You've got pain and you've got it all inside of you.

448
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,780


449
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,780


450
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,780


451
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,820
You took care of everything else you can do now that I'm mad.

452
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:58,820


453
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,300
Não sei porque você quis me.

454
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,480
Por que ela esta curtando as boyfrey.

455
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,340
You let her go like a wirerikig madou real cover for some Pour Reç upperc family.

456
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:14,440
You aspire to be a quick dinner on my plate

457
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,280
But we're content to wait until the time came up

458
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,340
So when I came home one night hungry

459
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,320
There you were waiting for me

460
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,220
That beautiful cheese was running down your side

461
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,340
Those wonderful beef jalapenos A and B

462
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,400
Did you ever think about me?

463
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,420
Did you ever think about me?

464
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,460
Did you ever know you're my burrito?

465
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,140
I ate you late last week, yeah

466
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,540
And though you passed right on through me

467
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,100
They are still the wind between my cheeks

468
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,260
Yeah

469
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,880
Did you ever know you're my burrito?

470
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,540
I ate you late last week, yeah

471
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,860
And though you passed right on through me

472
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,320
They are still the wind between my cheeks

473
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,040
One more time, everybody, now!

474
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,740
Did you ever know you're my burrito?

475
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,360
I ate you late last week, yeah

476
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,720
And though you passed right on through me

477
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,300
They are still the wind between my cheeks

478
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,380
You're still the wind between my cheeks

479
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,920
Oh, the wind between my cheeks

480
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,100
Oh, fly, fly

481
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,180
Escape into the sky

482
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,980
Offending all that you pass by

483
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,960
Thank you, thank you

484
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,280

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,260

of the old revolt from all he reached a middle height and at the stars which are the brain of

at a horse auto

506
00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:01,160
but all of this took place in Lake campsite

507
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,520
last month of its last several işi

508
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,640
due halfellas

509
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,520
deutsch now

510
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,400
two

511
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,520
fact

512
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,560
who see

513
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,280
This is a blithe Doc Ellis of the Lymph Node Institute.

514
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:32,020
Tonight, I would like to talk to another audience besides you, the cells of this great beast that is our church, our rock, and our deceiver.

515
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,080
I would like to address that scruffy guy laying on the floor of that strange room.

516
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,280
And you, the skinny girl in the back seat who can't remember where the car is headed.

517
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,580
You, my captive audience.

518
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,500
Your proximity to this broadcast is no accident.

519
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,180
Bob's is a strange and frightening bedotted countenance which comes unto you likened to the angry bum in the alley.

520
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,200
Though he may befoul you and rob you in unexpected ways, you also gain from his violation.

521
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,280
For Bob is the center of a giant reciprocal force.

522
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,560
And though he befouls and robs, he also blanches and misplaces.

523
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:29,540
So creating as he destroys and obeying the first law of thermodynamics which states that energy can only be converted from one state to another but cannot be created or destroyed.

524
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,500
I cannot stress this enough.

525
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,020
Bob, Bob is a very lucky man and we're with the whole briny claws scuttling bit.

526
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,760
Elliot, the question Bob has for you tonight is...

527
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,560
How would you like to be a man?

528
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,960
How would you like to bust one of those claws of yours open and taste your own succulent meat?

529
00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,240
Because whether you know it or not, you have been living on borrowed time since July of 1998.

530
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:09,140
And this brief foray of yours to the happy side of the luck plane is both a warning and an inducement.

531
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,320
The church of the subgenius, no less than Bob Spear,

532
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,280
lanced to the core of this world is the only religion that just wants to befoul and rob you.

533
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:29,400
Your brain, life, soul, etc. are yours to keep or at least hold onto for as long as you can.

534
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,100
The other religions are imperfect imitations or precursors depending on how you look at it.

535
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,100
But however you look at it, this is the only church that works for you.

536
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,620
While we're on the subject,

537
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,280
to be honest for once,

538
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,140
I too was deeply wounded when July 5th, 1998 rolled around

539
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:57,660
and I was denied the spectacle of my unsaved friends and loved ones tortured by the indignity

540
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,740
of the surreal death of my own personal design.

541
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,200
Yeah, I had big plans and Bob just pissed them away.

542
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,340
But we're well past that now.

543
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:20,840
Right past that into the frozen, shrieking, steel death trap.

544
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,080
Okay, okay.

545
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,780
Well, I know I see people and they ask me,

546
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,700
how did the institute fall into the sway with the church?

547
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,480
Well, it was almost inevitable.

548
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,820
When you deal in incalculable margins as we do,

549
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:50,420
naturally when it came time to select a trans-intuitive meme conveyance device,

550
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,420
we chose the one with the nice pointy smile.

551
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,660
That, and it does attract a somewhat higher quality sample of the gene pool.

552
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,600
Of course, as in the usual population, about half the samples are fruitless,

553
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,820
but for some reason far more vocal about it.

554
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,900
The apathy and ennui that supernatural protection can lead to,

555
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,540
for some is that last layer of jade that forces their heads to sink into their torsos.

556
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,000
However, and listen closely because this is how we make our money,

557
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,420
the other half, instead of being merely acceptable, as in the population at large,

558
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,440
is extra ordinary.

559
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,120
And I tell you,

560
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,460
the thing I love about the subgenius mind, almost without exception,

561
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,580
is that the extra ordinary ones think that they are purposeless,

562
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,160
and the fruitless ones think that they are extra ordinary.

563
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,640
We've been working on that squirt package almost from the beginning.

564
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,160
But, more than just an easy access to an unquantifiable demographic,

565
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,400
the church, quite frankly, is the most powerful opiate at our disposal.

566
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,100
And, of course, the church itself is the most powerful opiate at our disposal.

567
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,160
Triple your money back guarantee.

568
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,120
Because everything has a price.

569
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,940
So pay up if you won't wake up,

570
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,440
and get your soma that sweet, sweet slack while you still can.

571
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,440
I don't have to tell you what this church does for the mutant population at large.

572
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,540
The jolly factors have not stopped rising since Bob was first shot in the 80s.

573
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,040
These jolly factors, of course, cannot rise forever,

574
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,520
but try to enjoy the flow,

575
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,460
and fatten up your nintel iphs.

576
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,880
For, perhaps, leaner days,

577
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,940
when the inevitable ebb sucks you dry.

578
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,020
So, take it for granted,

579
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,400
but also enjoy the decadence of your easy dismissal of plenty,

580
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,880
an infinite regress of self-referential onanism.

581
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,100
And then, in the rapidly approaching global American Christian theocracy,

582
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
you will finally have an opportunity to appreciate all the things that you have.

583
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,940
All the associative spice that the church has added to your collective stew.

584
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,680
Yes, when the big squeeze comes,

585
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,460
a good laugh, or how about a sincere smile,

586
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,080
will be at a premium.

587
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,340
And when all of those chemicals you pour into your gullet are cut off,

588
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,220
you will find that your memory is a lot better than you think.

589
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,080
That's the good news.

590
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,100
As for the bad news, well, let me put it this way.

591
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,060
As you try to sell your money,

592
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,360
you slip away in your cell,

593
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,220
away from the stench and pathetic vacant murmurs

594
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,900
of those not so well connected as you.

595
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,140
Beneath the incessant squall of monotone Bible passages

596
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,720
echoing off of concrete and steel,

597
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,740
day and night,

598
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,580
well, at about that moment,

599
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,640
you, weary traveler,

600
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,800
will have some place to go.

601
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,400
That funny thing Stank said that time,

602
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,040
that comic panel ad,

603
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,120
etched on your eyelids,

604
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,960
that distant twinkle of a Rudy Schwartz ditty.

605
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,900
Whatever it is,

606
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,620
it is one last place they cannot touch.

607
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,080
It won't save your life,

608
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,780
or ultimately your sanity,

609
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,160
but it might save your soul,

610
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,840
which will then return to the quagmire

611
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,020
from whence it issued,

612
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,620
pure and potent,

613
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,580
to reinfect the fibers of the core.

614
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,640
So, when the whole operation goes belly up,

615
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,480
and the books are burning in the street,

616
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,260
and the wickas are swinging from the street lamps,

617
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,800
you will be that lucky one,

618
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
whistling your way to your martyrdom,

619
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,780
that will unnerve them and their kind forever.

620
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,620
Or at least until they wipe out

621
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,220
the first 90% or so of the mutant population,

622
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,100
then they will undoubtedly lose their zeal,

623
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,100
and the 10% that remains can begin

624
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,780
infection of the meat side

625
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,020
with their latent yeti gene,

626
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,620
just like they did about 600 years ago.

627
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,520
The time to have your head up is now.

628
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,740
The time of fire and glass

629
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,060
will be the time to duck, silly goose.

630
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,140
So, when those durable and self-replicating thought viruses

631
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,040
envelop your fevered brain,

632
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,380
try to remember to break off a little something

633
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,940
for that man, Bob.

634
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,020
This is for real.

635
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,520
Not like that.

636
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,040
Okay, I got something.

637
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,400
Hasta pronto!

638
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,940
Okay.

639
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,980
Okay, flop it in the back.

640
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,640
Wow, this guy.

641
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,480
Somebody cried.

642
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,220
Somebody cried.

643
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,220


644
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,060
Somebody died.

645
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,560
Died.

646
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,920
Someone was born.

647
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,380
Died.

648
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,020
Died.

649
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,720
I got to die.

650
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,960
Yeah.

651
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,960
I got to die.

652
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,460
Hello.

653
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,240
Lock me in the door, boy.

654
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,920
Lock me in the door.

655
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:14,840
Lock me in the door.

656
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,960
It is a test.

657
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,060
Obvious.

658
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,280
Yet you still ask.

659
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,220
We are not the same universe.

660
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
We are gone.

661
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,520
Same universe.

662
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,780
We are gone.

663
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,480
Same universe.

664
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,140
We are gone.

665
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,660
This time.

666
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:44,960
We are gone.

667
00:38:45,960 --> 00:39:08,400
We are gone.

668
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:37,700
contain Mia like the battle who can't fix yellow.

669
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:37,780
as Ariel

670
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:37,780


671
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:37,780


672
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:37,780


673
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:37,780


674
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:37,800
scan

675
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,900
me

676
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,260
it

677
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,280
me

678
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:05,260
acid corpse at x day and my friends the swinging love corpse is mixed with the amino acids and

679
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,760
Carter LeBlanc in an unholy mess and then of course we got to stock up on the subgenius special

680
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,260
meals they had they were MRE meals show until you guys were doing that the subgenius MREs will be

682
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,720

Eaton Hall and watched the staying it's this video projected on the giant screen let's go back in time

684
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,520
hey did you have a nap that day how in the rain huh I had a nap I don't know maybe I did it is

685
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,000
that the one where sister what's-her-name came in and pelted us with flowers in the morning

686
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,540
which what day was that they all blurry to one another because we would sleep in the day and

687
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,800
stay awake at night I'd be awake

688

689
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,700
all the things that are calling the show continues

690
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,600

B.O.B.

698
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,960
Boring Old Bastards

699
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:55,260
24 hours a day see now that's what's been going on for many years that you don't realize this show is going on 24 hours a day it's just these are the only two hours you get

700
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,880
plus they give you the new Israeli surplus gas masks

701
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,720
I get the other 22 hours those are really the best

702
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:14,020
No more will you have to endure the stench of the outhouse you can wear this subgenus Israeli surplus gas mask for all your stinky jobs

703
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,440

yes yes they've got a special brand new Israeli subgenus surplus gas mask

705
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,160
is it non-mask and waterproof

706
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,300
it relieves you of those stinky stinky gases

707
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,700
well what if the stinky gases overflow in in the lost gas lines

708
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:33,700


709
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,380
Hey, not to worry.

710
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,680
It's all rubber with plexiglass eyes.

711
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,560
Oh, that's cool.

712
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,280
G. Gordon Gordon has requested the song

713
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,700
You Guys Really Fucking Suck.

714
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,260
We know that one.

715
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,160
We practiced that one yesterday.

716
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,280
Sort of a bossa nova.

717
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,640
You guys really suck.

718
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,360
You really suck.

719
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,000
You really suck.

720
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,540
You really suck.

721
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,920
You really suck.

722
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,260
You really suck.

723
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,640
You guyzz really suck

724
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,600
Really suck

725
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,580
You guyzz really suck a life

726
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,860
We think you stupid

727
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,220
We think your dumb

728
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,800
We think your idiotic

729
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,460
You think you're dumb! You think you're stupid! You think you're dumb! You think you're idiotic! You think you're dumb!

730
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,360
Yeah, you guys really suck!

731
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,940
You guys really suck!

732
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,400
You guys really suck!

733
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,020
You really suck.

734
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,240
You really suck.

735
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,280
You guys really suck a lot.

736
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,160
You really suck.

737
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,400
You really suck.

738
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,260
You guys really suck a lot.

739
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,900
Suddenly someone appears at the turnstile who grows to gigantical size.

740
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,720
You know, Frenchies like it, Belgians, Dutchies, Germans, Krautsies, Austrians.

741
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,400
You're talking about X-Day?

742
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,060
Crotation marks.

743
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Well, there were some Britishers who came all the way to X-Day.

744
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,820
British pantalons like it.

745
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,980
Yeah, we had Pope Phil Monty there.

746
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,680
True.

747
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,440
And his Gore-Tex bibs.

748
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,480
Also, Sister Televangela.

749
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,040
Televangela was there.

750
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,280
Who?

751
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,300
What?

752
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,620
Just many subgenius.

753
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,340
She was hotter than a $2 pistol and just as affordable.

754
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,660
Bam.

755
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,600
And she wanted to...

756
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,900
Bam, yeah, that's what a pistol does, sir.

757
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,400
She didn't like to leave her car, so she did everything from inside her car.

758
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:20,920
Thank you, ma'am.

759
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,320
Bam, bam.

760
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,740
That's who the ma'am was.

761
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,900
I liked her when she was in the subgenius.

762
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:33,920
She would auction, put her vote in at the auction with a little beep of her car horn as she sat in her car.

763
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,720
She just didn't like to get out.

764
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:36,860
Well, she didn't like to get out.

765
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,500
She didn't like to get out of her car, so she just pulled her car up close to the...

766
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,460
And all her crap was in the car, all of her food, her sleeping bag, all of her stuff.

767
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:53,160
Except when she got out of the car to jump on the finalist's bed and punch a hole in the floor with the bed leg.

768
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:53,740
Yeah.

769
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,220
It descended through the cabin.

770
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,760
Well, she is a rather robust woman.

771
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,680
A robust specimen, yes.

772
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:00,220
Ah!

773
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,880
Come here, check out that thing, eh?

774
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,740
What do you want to do with it?

775
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,520
Oh, we're doing a show now.

776
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:06,880
We're doing a show now, sir.

777
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,440
Jeez.

778
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,300
Quit trying to...

779
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,100
It's a bottomless car.

780
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,180
It's a bottomless...

781
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,820
That is some kind of bottomless show.

782
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,760
So she did.

783
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,680
She spent some time on my bed.

784
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,680
She never stops.

785
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,680
She spent some time on my bed.

786
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,460
Well, it's your duty to inculcate the younger generation's subgenius principles.

787
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,840
Stereo?

788
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:29,840
Cheerio?

789
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,060
And so I'm sure you are...

790
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,700
She asked me that all-important question.

791
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,500
Why do retail stores charge up to $160?

792
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,320
60% more for the same thing?

793
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,520
What did you tell the young lass?

794
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,800
She just keeps selling it over and over.

795
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,160
Well, I said it's because it's their job.

796
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,600
And you know what?

797
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,740
That just rolled off her back like water on a duck's back.

798
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,040
I'll bet it will.

799
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,320
I'll go to that place that only charges 68%.

800
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,900
Listen to more show.

801
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
I want to be...

802
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:06,480
Bob.

803
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,820
Sit in my little tie.

804
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,940
I want to be Bob.

805
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,240
Think everything is a spy.

806
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,720
I want to be Jesus.

807
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,780
He always looks so sad.

808
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,400
Don't want to be Jesus.

809
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,600
He must have an awful dad.

810
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,500
I want to be Bob.

811
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,800
Tell everyone about the slack.

812
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,920
I want to be Bob.

813
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,840
Let every fucking pig kiss my crack.

814
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,880
I want to be Jesus.

815
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,480
I want to be Jesus.

816
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,000
I want to be no slave.

817
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,580
Don't want to be Jesus.

818
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,020
He shouldn't stay for his claim.

819
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,860
I want to be Bob.

820
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,100
Everything is so clear.

821
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,580
I want to be Bob.

822
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,540
He shouldn't even dream anything.

823
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,920
I want to be Jesus.

824
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,420
I want to carry no cross.

825
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,000
Don't want to be Jesus.

826
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,420
Don't want to speak for no cause.

827
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,320
I want to be Bob.

828
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,800
Never have to work a day.

829
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,920
I want to be Bob.

830
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,300
I want to be Bob.

831
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


832
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,360
All eternity's a play.

833
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,780
I want to be Jesus.

834
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,940
Always trying to figure things out.

835
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,340
Don't want to be Jesus.

836
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,440
Who needs all them fucking cosmic doubts.

837
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,400
I want to be Bob.

838
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,160
Yeah, I want to be Bob.

839
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,040
I want to be Bob.

840
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,740
I'd even like it if he died.

841
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,740
Ha ha ha.

842
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,320
Woo hoo.

843
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,220
Rick's the Dick.

844
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,980
He could any day.

845
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,200
I've been lost my master but you guys told me to leave.

846
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,160
But you know what they say a solid place gets better than nothing, nothing pokes in it, and nothing can catch me sometimes.

847
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:01,460
You say by your name.

848
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:01,460


849
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,240
In my head.

850
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,400
Bring on the Plexus Hustlers!

851
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,720
Well, this has been a pretty organized anarchy, hasn't it?

852
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,700
Friends, that's disgusting.

853
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,120
How come...

854
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,740
Well, no, I don't want to ask.

855
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:31,740
I remember one time Sterno, Pope Sterno, stood up here in X-Stage Life in 1998,

856
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,480
the conspiracies, 1998, and said,

857
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,200
why aren't you people out there in the field fucking?

858
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,540
Why aren't you all in one giant group?

859
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,440
This is disgusting.

860
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,020
Somebody said, why aren't you?

861
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,480
Friends, you know, sometimes we have to get real.

862
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,980
But I don't want to.

863
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,040
Fuck that shit.

864
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,020
Fuck that shit.

865
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,000
I was actually looking to see if there was anything really pithy.

866
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,160
Oh, yeah, there is actually.

867
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,880
There is actually something really pithy on here.

868
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:10,880
I have something important to say about magic and prayer and faith.

869
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,180
Friends, you know, most of us are not especially superstitious.

870
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,560
We've grown out of those silly old superstitions.

871
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,240
We just believe in J.R. Bob Dobbs and the arrival of the exes on July 5, 1998,

872
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,920
whenever that happens to come.

873
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,780
We don't believe in the silly religions, you know,

874
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,540
their silly evolution and creation crap.

875
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,000
We know.

876
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,920
We came from the Yetis test tubes and stupidly freed the humans

877
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,560
and interbred with them like fucking idiots.

878
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,180
And now, look, we're not doing what Sterno said.

879
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,480
And even he wasn't either.

880
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:56,620
But there is, there actually is magic, real live magic, I believe.

881
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,580
There is miracles happen.

882
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,980
Now, I don't mean the miracle of being on acid and looking at a piece of dirt.

883
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,780
And going, wow.

884
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,140
That's a miracle too.

885
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,320
I'm not putting it down.

886
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,480
I could go into this.

887
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,860
I have this whole rant about enlightenment, which I will spare you.

888
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:20,320
It's probably still on alt binary slack from the last devival.

889
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,120
But there is magic.

890
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,980
And there is incredible, wonderful magic.

891
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:31,460
And the magic is that so many people can believe such bullshit.

892
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,720
That in itself.

893
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,400
Is so, such beautiful magic.

894
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:45,060
The fact that they can believe is more important, is more weird to me than what they believe.

895
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,780
I studied kooks and crackpots just as I'm doing right now at this very moment.

896
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:01,360
And it's not, every one of them has some slightly different variation on their own,

897
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,720
that weird science fiction we call religion.

898
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,420
But there is the miracle of their belief.

899
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,740
And which can overpower sickness.

900
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,660
It really can.

901
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,820
And can kill an ox at ten miles away from jealousy.

902
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,860
If you are truly an attuned over man.

903
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,480
My friends, there is hope.

904
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,800
There is hope.

905
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,460
You could eventually become that over man.

906
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,620
As soon as those aliens get here and do all of our work for us.

907
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,700
That we do.

908
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:33,700


909
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:33,700


910
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:33,700


911
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,020
We have elected to take the easy way out.

912
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,040
Concentrated Guru Pee.

913
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,260
This is dried Guru Pee that we burn.

914
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,140
We burn this Guru Pee and it oxidizes into our mucous membranes.

915
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,480
And we imbibe the wisdom of the Gurus through this.

916
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,320
Is that what makes your nostril hairs grow?

917
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:00,980
Yeah.

918
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,680
Hey what are you doing?

919
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,460
Got a super bud?

920
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:22,860


921
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:22,860


922
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:22,860


923
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:22,860


924
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:22,920


925
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:22,920


926
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:22,920


927
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,020
That is the Har policial thing.

928
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,320
Is that a good thing?

929
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,320


930
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,320


931
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,800
the stick Survival.

932
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,020
You can say it all.

933
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,020


934
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,020


935
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,400
Sorry.

936
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,160
sir it's not like that.

937
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,800
Porta party

938
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,860
Super artsy

939
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,600
Porta party

940
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,360
My boss is gonna kill me

941
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,220
I always missed out on that stuff

942
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,700
I'm always repairing something

943
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,860
Or changing film

944
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,580
When all the fun stuff happens

945
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,280
Well, you were conveniently away

946
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,220
From the first aid area

947
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,680
I'm always out of film

948
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,400
When Bob shows up

949
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,780
Well, that's just

950
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,280
If I had more help

951
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,620
Then I could be there

952
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,120
When those saucers didn't

953
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,800
Yeah, you had plenty

954
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,200
Of exasperated help

955
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,900
There are people

956
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,100
Throwing flinging their arms

957
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,160
Screaming where is Stan

958
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,980
When we need him now

959
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,640
You're throwing away

960
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,080
Amputated arms and legs

961
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,720
Trying to figure out

962
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,440
What to do next

963
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,400
Calling, you know

964
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,040
Involving local community people

965
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,400
And yet

966
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,460
While we're under

967
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,500
State of orange alert

968
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,080
It was pretty weird

969
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,400
Weird indeed

970
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,660
My friends

971
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,280
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

972
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,820
And on the radio

973
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,880
Siniseasia

974
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,720
Show

975
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,780
With Dr. Sinister

976
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,340
Before that

977
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,320
Super orgy

978
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,240
Porno party

979
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,100
Is by

980
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,980
The Planet Smash

981
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,400
Smashers

982
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,280
And now

983
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,500
From 7X Day at Brushwood

984
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,760
A Pope S. Lilith

985
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,000
So, after all that

986
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,360
Are you guys up for a little song?

987
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:43,520
Yeah!

988
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,600
Okay, this one

989
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,780
Actually, I'm going to need

990
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,040
A little help from you guys

991
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,260
But don't worry

992
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,280
This is pretty easy

993
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,000
All I need you to do

994
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,920
Is to sing along

995
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,140
During, not during the chorus

996
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,080
But during the main part

997
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,780
I'll cue you

998
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,700
Ba dum bob

999
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,140
Ba dum bob

1000
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,960
Ba dum bob

1001
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,300
Ba dum bob

1002
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,980
Ba dum bob

1003
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,820
Ba dum bob

1004
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,840
Ba dum bob

1005
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,320
Here, you guys

1006
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:09,960
Keep on going

1007
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,000
Ba dum bob

1008
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,980
Ba dum bob

1009
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,340
The times they are changing

1010
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,400
And things are getting grim

1011
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,280
Oh, Bob

1012
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,820
The X's are a missing

1013
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:27,980
And our odds are getting slim

1014
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,600
Oh, Bob

1015
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,960
Sure, I could give up

1016
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1017
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1018
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1019
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1020
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1021
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1022
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1023
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1024
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1025
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1026
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1027
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1028
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1029
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:32,960


1030
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:42,020
and let my hopes go flat. I really got to ask you though, where's the slack in that?

1031
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:54,260
Bob, ba dum, Bob, ba dum, Bob, ba dum, Bob. The pigs have us outnumbered. The conspiracy has won.

1032
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:04,320
Uh-huh, uh-huh. We're in a losin' battle before the fight's begun. No fun.

1033
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:12,260
Well, I could get suicidal and make my brains go splat, I really got to ask you though...

1034
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,660
...where's the slack in that?

1035
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,780
Bob, ba dum, Bob, ba dum, Bob, ba dum, Bob.

1036
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,020
No matter the temptation, I don't care what they think.

1037
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,120
I'd rather be subgenius than wind up pink.

1038
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,360
Cause Bob so gives me gumption and Connie flips my crown.

1039
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,600
And I'm not about to let them bastards get me down.

1040
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,580
Da-dum-dum-dum.

1041
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,960
I don't need to fight no battles or weigh down with chagrin.

1042
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:53,500
No way, no how, as long as I have with me

1043
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,400
Dob's everlasting grin.

1044
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,360
And sure, I hate the normals, I got that all down pat.

1045
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,500
But I'm not exactly looking for normal combat.

1046
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,000
And I'm sick of preaching and chewing the fat.

1047
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,780
I really got to tell you though,

1048
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,560
mmm, slack is where it's at.

1049
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,480
That's that.

1050
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:23,520
That's it.

1051
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,160
Woo!

1052
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,460
Thank you everyone!

1053
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:27,900
Urdu.

1054
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:33,160
When they retranslate the Urdu back to English, it just leaves something out and it looks so funny.

1055
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,160
Then we also viewed Director Stang's new film, Dob's Edeliastisies.

1056
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,460
And, uh...

1057
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,840
Which I have a copy of ready for the next subgenius.

1058
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,440
And when that tricycle quad comes after you, you know what'll happen.

1059
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,640
And bug porn is also showing.

1060
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,160
Bug porn.

1061
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,180
Which is sort of a remake of the reproduction cycle movie.

1062
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,880
And an excellent, excellent, funny, funny movie.

1063
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,760
And excellent taste too.

1064
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,040
See, now we should have a subgenius film festival where everything shown would be subgenius.

1065
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,320
Right, right. Instead of nothing that we show being subgenius, everything we show will be subgenius.

1066
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,660
And it continues to rain.

1067
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,780
Oop, okay, there we go.

1068
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,880
So I have my screen ready, my projector, my... Everything's ready.

1069
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,900
Where are we gonna do this subgenius film festival?

1070
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,160


1071
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,000
Tomorrow night?

1072
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,800
Tomorrow night? Well, where though?

1073
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,840
At your house?

1074
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,180
At Ginger's house.

1075
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,660
They have a backyard.

1076
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,920
You can always see the neighbors peeking through the fence at your favorite stuff.

1077
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,920
Jim neighbors and others peering over the fence can disconcert you.

1078
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:37,940
Golly!

1079
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,420
You're trying to do something and these geeks are gawking over the fence at you.

1080
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,600
And laughing in an unseemly way.

1081
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,280
Gawking and leering and frottering, frittering away.

1082
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,960
It's because as X-Day gets closer and closer, people don't worry about the social normay.

1083
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,360
They just want to be in the same place.

1084
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,000
But we got past X-Day once again.

1085
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,800
And there goes Mr. Hamilton and there goes Mr. Burr.

1086
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,340
You're getting further away.

1087
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,560
So we're safe for at least another year.

1088
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,440
I guess so.

1089
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,980
We have to go back in time now, folks.

1090
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,720
It's 420 all over again.

1091
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:19,660
That background music, friends, that I've been using is from a band called Felonious Bosch.

1092
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,140
And you can get more information about them from www.feloniousbosh.com.

1093
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,140


1094
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,160
F-N-B-O-S-H dot com.

1095
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,460
B-O-S-C-H.

1096
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,840
F-N-B-O-S-C-H dot com.

1097
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,540
Felonious Bosch.

1098
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,020
Great.

1099
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,660
You'll be hearing more about them.

1100
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,560
And friends, we're at the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1101
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,260
Let me give you a post office box.

1102
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,700
This time let's use Cleveland Heights P.O. Box.

1103
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,460
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1104
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:52,740
44118.

1105
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,120
All right.

1106
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,320
We're going to start the show.

1107
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,660
And as always, check out subgenius.com.

1108
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,680
Share the load.

1109
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,460
The load.

1110
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:05,160
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

1111
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,180
My mind is not my mind.

1112
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:18,100
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

1113
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,240
Come on you poor ass singers and your big dick sling.

1114
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,240
into chocolate.

1115
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,880
It's about the exact buy-you-dentДаe.

1116
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,680
R-O.

1117
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,300
B-O- Nu-ue,

1118
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:46,820
D-e-N...

1119
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,440
Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao.

1120
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,020
My mind is not my mind.

1121
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,400
My mind is not my mind.
