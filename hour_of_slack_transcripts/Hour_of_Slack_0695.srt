1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
Well, I hear my train a-longin', hear my train a-hangin', hear my train a-longin'.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:22,220
Ah, yes, dear friends, welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Watch.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,460
Do you have a strange taste in your mouth?

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,880
Is there an accurate flavor in your mind that won't go away?

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,080
Do you believe the silence that's coming soon is gonna take you away like a big river?

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,940
You do believe it too, do you?

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,200
It's said when the wind blows that way, the plutonium storms are gonna come.

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,200


9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,800
The less likely to cause lesions in the skin.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,520
The Iron Man!

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey, hey, hold it down, Dave.

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,660
Shh, humans.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,520
Humans, man.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,280
Uh, yes, dear friends, as Einstein's secret orchestra and lonesome cowboy Dave

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,900
champs away in the background,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,180
we're back in Dallas.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm back in Dallas.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,940
I said I was gonna stay at Brushwood Campground

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,200
and the Iron Man.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,600
I didn't know until the saucers came, but I had to return.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,740
For now.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,380
But join me, won't you?

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,780
And we'll both return to fabled Brushwood Campground via the magic of sound recordings.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,300
And also we shall voyage back in time to myth-shrouded Cleveland,

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,460
city of mystery astride the flaming river.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,780
The Burnt Testicle City.

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,200
Where Einstein's secret orchestra and lonesome cowboy Dave

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,440
and Stang's secret radio station can be heard.

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,560
And offer great rewards for adventurous risk-takers.

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,480
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,080
Uh.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,980
He thought he smelled something or someone burning.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,660
It was.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,240
It was the smell of flesh.

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,640
And he remembered it was so many years ago.

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,220
His own grandfather caught himself afire that day.

37
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,960
Dreaming in a bed.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,860
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,940
Goodbye, Grandpa.

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,560
Goodbye.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:23,960
Goodbye.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,820
So much work to do setting Gramps on fire.

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,660
And it's hot in here in Dallas, friends.

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,460
It's very hot.

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,400
The A.C. is on high.

46
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,700
But so is the sun.

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,960
And I must get off.

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,420
And you must get off.

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,460
And we will get off, friends.

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,200
Wait till you hear some of these fantabulous recordings

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,020
from X-Day and Starwood and various bands

52
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,780
who have showered us with great material.

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,580
We have the Pufferdome and Starwood Devivals.

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,320
We've got Little Theodore at XX Day.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,100
We've got Hallie DeFestern, the wonderful chick singer.

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,200
We have a new, sort of a pagan comedian

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,120
named Loki E. Coyote from wickabilly.com.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,740
And let's see, Maggie Pearson, E.J.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,500
And over here on the cassettes, why, oh, friends, look.

60
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,040
We have Global.

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,220
Village Idiots.

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,000
That used to be Tri-State Killing Spree, live at XX Day.

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,740
Lust in Space, live at XX Day.

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,400
Clyde Lewis' Ground Zero show.

65
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,720
The Firesign Theater.

66
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,520
The Firesign Clones.

67
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,000
And ESO Radio.

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,660
And, of course, the beautiful Friday Jones scene here on slide three.

69
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,300
Thank y'all.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,060
You don't have to be a Texas redneck.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,540
To sell your soul to Bob.

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,620
Though it helps.

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,280
You can be a Yankee.

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,180
You can be a Yank-er as well.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,320
You know, Bob didn't say we had to save everybody.

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,760
He said we had to get everybody's money.

77
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,580
Right.

78
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,440
Now, I was thinking, I heard once that if there was a man who had a lot of money,

79
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,800
and then there was a woman, an old lady who, like, had this Social Security check,

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,060
and it was like, maybe she had like five or ten dollars.

81
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,380
And she wanted to contribute to the church.

82
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,040
Who does Bob love more?

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,540
The woman who works hard to give that small amount of money that she has?

84
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,380
Or the rich man?

85
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,700
Who does Bob love more?

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,160
I imagine Bob is probably hanging out with the Sultan of Brunei and Bill Gates right now

87
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,660
while we're asking that question.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,680
I mean, sure, of course, the little old lady may have more slack,

89
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,540
may understand Bob's message better,

90
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,920
and perhaps that 25 cents to her means as much,

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,820
as that rich man's grandchildren do to him.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,520
But it doesn't mean as much to Bob.

93
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,360
That's right.

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
Because Bob's not a stupid preacher.

95
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,340
You don't want the kind of preacher that's, you know, that's going to prove himself.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,320
I mean, you know, well, actually, what can I say, Bob?

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,660
This is called the church of the subgenius.

98
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,200
And it doesn't matter in this religion if you're smart or dumb.

99
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,900
It's not the subgenius.

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,640
It's the intelligence that counts it all.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,700
Bob's been saying all along it's the common sense, sense of humor,

102
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,460
and dollars and cents that count.

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,700
And would you rather be smart these days or lucky?

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Which is going to get you more dates?

105
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,020
Which is going to get you more luck on dates?

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Well, money, of course.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,520
Well, money is not everything if you're not lucky.

108
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,560
Luck is everything, whether there is money or not.

109
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,740
Whether you've got brains, money, or anything.

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,820
Luck, obviously, is...

111
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:04,780
And what Bob preaches is that if you follow the path of least resistance and let your instincts pull you towards the slack,

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
then your luck will improve.

113
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,420
And you won't have to work as hard in order to gain the riches.

114
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,700
Bob isn't like some commie that wants everybody to be equally poor all over the whole world.

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,300
He wants every... It's just the opposite.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,680
He wants everybody to be equally rich.

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Beyond imagining, but without working.

118
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,700
Without any work at all.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,260
Perfect slack.

120
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,340
Perfect achieving-ness without even trying.

121
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,100
So it's smarter to be lucky than lucky to be smart, right?

122
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Am I getting this right?

123
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,660
I don't know if I...

124
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah, who cares how smart you are if you're lucky?

125
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,480
Okay.

126
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
Ignorance is bliss.

127
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,500
Okay. I'm just trying to...

128
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,560
Why do you think we call it subgenius?

129
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,100
You know, if it was for some kind of smarty pants people, they could go join Mensa.

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,060
And follow H. Ross Perot or some brilliant fellow like that.

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,840
Okay.

132
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,460
Damn it.

133
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,780
I discovered the church in 1981.

134
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,340
I was reading a copy of Weirdo No. 1, the Robert Crown...

135
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,180
Robert Crown.

136
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Robert Crown.

137
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,400
And it said, are you abnormal?

138
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,520
Then you are probably superior to everyone else.

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,460
And that to me said something so important because nobody had ever given me an affirmation.

140
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,500
About being such a fucked up weirdo.

141
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,080
And I thought that it was a bad thing until I found this damn church.

142
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
Damn church.

143
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,260
And like most of us, I wouldn't even be alive today without having had this fucking church in my life.

144
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,280
Keeping me going for 18 goddamn years.

145
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:38,820
Woo!

146
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,180
Awesome!

147
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,600
I just sit here watching squirrels.

148
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,140
They have much more fun than me.

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,620
Sometimes they run around all day in circles.

150
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,900
They fight and squabble then they lick their wounds.

151
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,920
At least they seem to have a purpose.

152
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,320
My mind's always clogged with leaves.

153
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,680
Like silly stupid advertising jingles.

154
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,620
And theme some TV shows I do not like.

155
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,820
I must not go out the front door.

156
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,760
I could get hit by a car.

157
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,300
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling.

158
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,600
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling.

159
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,180
There's perfect safety high up in the tree.

160
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,700
I know I'm bad to just sit here.

161
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,540
I should not be so afraid.

162
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,880
But once outside I'd have to choose a direction.

163
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,140
It might be the wrong one so I'll stay here.

164
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,020
I'm not afraid of the squirrels.

165
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,840
They tell me of self-improvement.

166
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,720
And someday I could even have a job.

167
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,100
Then I would have become just like the squirrels.

168
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,040
I don't see how I could accomplish that.

169
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,300
First I'd have to choose a direction.

170
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,400
Like which tree I should start to climb.

171
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,860
They all seem to be up to the challenge.

172
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,840
I just take whatever's given me.

173
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,240
So I'm okay here just watching squirrels.

174
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,100
Though the soundtrack could be much improved.

175
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,040
Those silly stupid advertising jingles.

176
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,860
And some TV shows I do not like.

177
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,280
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

178
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,120
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,260
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

180
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,340
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

181
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,080
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

182
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,520
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

183
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,980
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

184
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,820
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

185
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,320
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

186
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,280
Wah!

187
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,240
Wah!

188
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,300
Amazing, dear friends.

189
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,100
Little Theodore and Babushka

190
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,460
live at X-Day.

191
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,720
So at X-Day,

192
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,320
there was a question and answer period

193
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
and somebody said,

194
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,080
why Dallas?

195
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,540
And G. Gordon Gordon said,

196
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,360
well, if you were going to give the state of Texas an enema,

197
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,220
Dallas is where you would insert the nozzle.

198
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,560
And then some idiot said,

199
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,040
why Sherman, New York?

200
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,060
And we all said,

201
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,180
duh!

202
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,060
And really, that's what the church of the subgenius

203
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,900
is all about.

204
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,960
The moment when everybody can just agree,

205
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,200
duh!

206
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:08,900
Duh!

207
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,620
When they go,

208
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,900
well, what does that Bob thing mean anyway?

209
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,340
And when all you have to do is go,

210
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,340
duh!

211
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,160
Then I could shut up.

212
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Job would be a lot easier.

213
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,500
Don't we need...

214
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,720
You almost forget you're drifting miles and miles.

215
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,640
Yeah, that's funny.

216
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,320
Doesn't it feel just completely real in here, guys?

217
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,660
I mean, more or less.

218
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,000
I mean, it's a little bit disorienting,

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,260
but it feels just like down is that way, right?

220
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,280
Doesn't it, Dave?

221
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,580
Is there anybody that's besides me

222
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,020
who feels like down might be anywhere else but there?

223
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,800
And the air, right?

224
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Take a deep breath.

225
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,900
See, it's just like real air.

226
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,660
Yeah.

227
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,640
Yeah.

228
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:06,820
Yeah.

229
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah.

230
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,380


231
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,200
Yeah.

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Yeah.

233
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


235
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,620
Yeah.

236
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:08,880
Yeah.

237
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


238
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


239
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


240
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


241
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


242
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


243
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


244
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:08,880


245
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,020
Yeah.

246
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,120
Come.

247
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,340
Come here.

248
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,340
The voice of the sand.

249
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,820
The sacred sand of Cape Canaveral calls to you.

250
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
Come here.

251
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,920
The voice of the sand.

252
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,620
And now as Rev Chas leads the procession of the Rocketeers

253
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
across the field,

254
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,740
we wonder what these young people are going to do.

255
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,700
Will this be another barn?

256
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,880
Yes.

257
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:38,880


258
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,580
down immolation and the likes of Heaven's Gate and Waco mixed together?

259
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
Or will these doctors learn to cooperate, live, love,

260
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,260
and leave Earth together? We can only wait and see.

261
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,220
I think it's just too soon to tell right now, but

262
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,940
there's a great deal of tension in the air, a great deal of sweat,

263
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,940
a lot of heat. This could be the

264
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,900
big one. And here come the rear guard aliens.

265
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:29,520
I have a device in my nasal cavity which I believe is navigating this vessel now.

266
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,700
All I can see through the inside of my

267
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,500
sinus is it looks like there's a monitor.

268
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,200
And yes, yes, right before, let me get the, right there, my tinea gland.

269
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,900
Oh, John, that's right, that's my tinea gland.

270
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,440
Don't let anything happen today. It's known.

271
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,620
It's the only thing between us and total fatness of outer space.

272
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,200
And don't let Bob's pipe go out. It's the only thing between you

273
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,980
and believing everything on TV.

274
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,200
It's also the only thing between you and believing

275
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,880
everything on TV.

276
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,020
Bob says, which would be just as bad, believe me.

277
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,760
I did, look at me.

278
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,980
Hold it right there.

279
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, glad to. Now I think I'll hold it over here.

280
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,280
Oh, boy, it's nice out.

281
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,200
Yes, I think I'll leave it out.

282
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,680
Hey, hey, look, fellas, fun's fun, okay, but I've got to find a place to stay.

283
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,060
It'll be night soon. I'm tired.

284
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,520
Aw.

285
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,740
I'm lost.

286
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,140
What's the matter with that dude?

287
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,720
I want to go to bed.

288
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,500
Oh, my bony boy in the Estonian.

289
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm tamed for you.

290
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,280
You're asleep, leaning up against the windfall.

291
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,380
I was but a mere prat then.

292
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,540
I'll never forget the time a snake slithered into my wife.

293
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,560
I was but knee-high to a merry grasshopper then.

294
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,280
Never saw the woman again.

295
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,040
Oh, no, no, that's all very interesting,

296
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,120
but the sun is going down.

297
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,640
Oh, no, no, you're all confused.

298
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,360
The horizon is moving up.

299
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,920
Hey, hey, hey, listen, come on, you guys.

300
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,960
Help me, please.

301
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,180
I know, I know.

302
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,760
Let's stand him on his head.

303
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,440
Hey, hey, hey, put me down.

304
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

305
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,380
Now you see, now it's morning.

306
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help!

307
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,920
Oh, he's no fun.

308
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,200
He fell right over.

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
In the heart of a city that has no heart,

310
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,200
there's a building where only the stool pigeons come to roost.

311
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,340
Step in the elevator, press 13, then use the stairs.

312
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,960
At the end of the hallway, there's a frosted glass door.

313
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,660
Oh, you pervert!

314
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,780
I didn't tell you to go in there.

315
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,000
Turn left.

316
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,040
See that door with the bloodshot eye on it?

317
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,540
It's not a psychic.

318
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,180
It's not an oculist.

319
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,720
It's a dick.

320
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,720
America's only detective.

321
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,760
He's ready for action.

322
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,840
He's ready for adventure.

323
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,860
He's...

324
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,780
Nick Danger, third eye.

325
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,880
Hello.

326
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,300
Hello.

327
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,700
I want to order.

328
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,860
I want an anchovy to go and hold the pizza.

329
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,600
Anchovy?

330
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,560
Yes.

331
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,460
A little flat thing with eyes.

332
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,980
I don't care what you look like.

333
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,200
You're wasting my time.

334
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,000
I spell my name D...

335
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,280
Oh, uh, the way it's spelled.

336
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,120
Danger.

337
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,580
What?

338
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,400
I've been working really hard,

339
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,020
but I finally had a peaceful night passed out in my file cabinet.

340
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,640
I just finished my biggest case.

341
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,440
A case I like to call

342
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,660
the case of the...

343
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,600
The case of bourbon.

344
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,320
I don't remember exactly how it ended,

345
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,320
but I know it began something like this.

346
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,440
Ah.

347
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,580
My favorite.

348
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,000
Old plane wrap.

349
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,520
Aged on the shelf.

350
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,120
Like me.

351
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,620
Uh-oh.

352
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,960
Uh-oh.

353
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,720
Uh-oh.

354
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,200


355
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,240


356
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,340
Uh-oh.

357
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,500
Uh-oh.

358
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,700
Uh-oh.

359
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,000
Uh-oh.

360
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,720
Uh-oh.

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,860
Uh-oh.

362
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,120
Uh-oh.

363
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,160
Uh-oh.

364
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,760
Don't hang up!

365
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,720
I couldn't hang up.

366
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,840
You see, I've been hung up on this fortune cooking ever since I could remember.

367
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Remember what?

368
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,800
What were we talking about?

369
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,720
Me.

370
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,660
Nancy.

371
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,580
Nancy.

372
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,000
You.

373
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,780
My heart began to beat like a wet hamburger.

374
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,900
This daemon short-ordered me before, so I knew I had to play it tough.

375
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,560
What do you want, baby?

376
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,540
Big tips?

377
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,940
Oh, Nicky, Nicky, I really need you this time.

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
It's the snakes.

379
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,740
The stench of magnolia's the old man.

380
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,040
and his desires, the script, the background music.

381
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,540
I'm scared!

382
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,440
Oh my gosh!

383
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,120
Where are you, Nancy?

384
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,200
Page three, the Van Pedderancey mansion, interior, night.

385
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,160
You say, don't turn the page.

386
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
Don't turn the page, baby.

387
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm on my way.

388
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,100
What?

389
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,720
Not to touch the tiny blonde women!

390
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,540
That is the law!

391
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,660
We're not the enemy!

392
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,220
Not to...

393
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:10,940
Huh?

394
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,920
Not to breach the airlock!

395
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,860
That is the law!

396
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,500
Never to breach thy moon pants!

397
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,840
That is the third commandment.

398
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,700
To covet not thy neighbor's rights.

399
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,220
To covet not thy rocket ship.

400
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,880
And if you retrieve the tenth commandment, if you retrieve any alien life forms,

401
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,160
they must be quarantined, no matter how sexy they may appear to be.

402
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,660
Praise God!

403
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,300
Praise God!

404
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,580
That is the law!

405
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,900
We are not men!

406
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,060
No, we're just not man enough.

407
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,720
But no.

408
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,220
We got the little laugh, squid suckers.

409
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,420
It just sticks to the roof of your mouth right, you know?

410
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,680
Yes, but now for a limited time only, with just a small amount of your own sputum, your own Jolly juices,

411
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,320
and some policeman's feces and a can of tomatoes, you can whip up a beautiful feast that'll probably fascinate everything.

412
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,100
I think it's...

413
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,880
Wait a minute.

414
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,840
The studio's filling up with water.

415
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,520
There's a lot of rats in here, man.

416
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,540
Wait a minute.

417
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,120
There's a lot of rats in the room right now.

418
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,500
That's okay.

419
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:25,960
Bent?

420
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,680
Bent?

421
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,440
Bent?

422
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Come out here, Bent!

423
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,640
Get the rest of the rats.

424
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,960
Shoo them away, Bent!

425
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,120
Come on, Bent!

426
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,280
Come on, little Bent!

427
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,900
We were always nice to you.

428
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,420
We always shared our corn with you.

429
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,260
Where the hell is he?

430
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,560
I don't know.

431
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,640
Is he in your hat?

432
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,240
Is he in your hat?

433
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,840
No, he's not in my hat.

434
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,200
I think...

435
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,520
Oh, dear.

436
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,560
Is he in your moon pants?

437
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,780
No, he's not in my moon...

438
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, he has to be in the cylinder here with us somewhere.

439
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,040
Is he in your breasticolaries?

440
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,400
Can you mind if I just put my...

441
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't think so.

442
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,500
Come, just let me put my hand down there and see if...

443
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:56,760
Oh, yeah.

444
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,560
You'd better check.

445
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,080
I better...

446
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,120
Let me check inside of your moon pants.

447
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,560
Okay.

448
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,180
You just...

449
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,660
Yeah, here's...

450
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,680
Oh, let's see.

451
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,220
Okay.

452
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,600
No, this doesn't feel like Bent.

453
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,540
This isn't it.

454
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,620
This isn't it either.

455
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,340
Gee, there's a lot of things in your moon pants.

456
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,040
But none of these things feel like a rat.

457
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,660
Well, this...

458
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,240
No, this isn't a rat.

459
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,740
It doesn't have any whiskers.

460
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,660
Hey, come on, baby.

461
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,340
That's my hamster you're talking about.

462
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,720
You have a whiskerless hamster in your pants.

463
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,360
No, no, no.

464
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,820
That's just from some of the burns.

465
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,620
It's just...

466
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,940
I had a lot of surgery, too.

467
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:32,940


468
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:32,940


469
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:32,940


470
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,160
Oh, you have a lot of things down there.

471
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,660
Don't you think it's kind of a magnification?

472
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,320
It shouldn't be, do you?

473
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,160
Yeah, well, yeah.

474
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,100
I mean, everything in here is uniquely different.

475
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,060
It's quite amazing.

476
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,300
Yeah, that's the draw, isn't it?

477
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,580
I mean...

478
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,920
It's better than Noah's Ark, except instead of two of everything, there's just one of

479
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,200
everything in your moon pants.

480
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah, just one of me and one of you.

481
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,940
Let me see if he's down there in your...

482
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,740
Come on.

483
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,660
Just let me get under by you.

484
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,040
Let me just see over there.

485
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,760
No, I don't think he'd fit down there.

486
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,500
Down there?

487
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,540
I don't think he's down there.

488
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,140
I better feel something.

489
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,160
No, maybe he's in my shoes.

490
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:02,880
Did he?

491
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:02,940
Did he?

492
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,120
I think he's better keep my hand there for a little bit longer, because in case...

493
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,340
What if he appears on your barstool, please?

494
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,660
Yeah, he might.

495
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,040
You might have to grab him.

496
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
He might leap out somewhere.

497
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,860
Yeah, I don't want to go checking anywhere else until I check this area really good,

498
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,400
you know what I mean?

499
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Yeah, maybe I should start, you know...

500
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,360
Helping me.

501
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:19,980
... squeezing.

502
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,440
Yeah, you could probably help me.

503
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,120
I should very...

504
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,620
You know, in case he's hiding somewhere under one of these things...

505
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah, make sure they're sticking up real high, because you know...

506
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
Yeah, maybe I should try and squeeze them out.

507
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,860
Yeah, I should help you with that.

508
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
Yeah, I should probably help you with that, too.

509
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:32,860
He should be able to...

510
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,800
He could be...

511
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,340
Ben!

512
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,580
I'm just sad, but that's just the way it got set up.

513
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:47,700
We can't help it if we have to lie our asses off to get the rest of the cavemen to bring

514
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,260
us food.

515
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,800
Not sad!

516
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,320
That's just a joke, by the way!

517
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,740
That's not too frat!

518
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,040
That is the law!

519
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,880
Yeah.

520
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,780
Actually, Ken Kesey.

521
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,280
He said that was the only sin was fretting.

522
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,820
Well, that's not true.

523
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:17,380
We came up with 365 more that are in Revelation X, and I double dog dare anybody here to try

524
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,240
all 365 of those sins and report back on us and send the pictures.

525
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,500
They're very creative.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,580
Oh, hell, it's this girl's piano.

527
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,420
How do you...

528
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

529
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

530
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:32,840


531
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh, and I'm just damn sorry about this!

532
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,500


533
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,500


534
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,500


535
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,500


536
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,500


537
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,200
Sorry isn't a word.

538
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,120
This is just not fair.

539
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,860
Not to not be funny for half a second.

540
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,500
That is the law!

541
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,940
We are not men!

542
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,660
Never to say anything uncool!

543
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,460
That is the law!

544
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,200
We are not men!

545
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,220
Oh, never to have a funny haircut!

546
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,760
That is the law!

547
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,140
We are not men!

548
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,820
Never to a chasing fox!

549
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:02,820


550
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,180
the secretary around guests and co-workers.

551

We're going to report you.

552
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,940
That is the law.

553
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,380
We're never to go to work without

554
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,220
makeup and a nice dress.

555
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,920
That is the law.

556
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,420
We are not men

557
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,680
not to sniff

558
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,840
the visitor's legs and

559
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,520
crotchets.

560
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,460
That is the law.

561
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,820
Also, we are not men

562
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,080
not to snuffle up

563
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,280
drink guests.

564
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,240
Fuck the law. We will snuffle up

565
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,320
drink from the street.

566
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,060
We will go on all fours.

567
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,100
We will fornicate

all we really need.

569
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,780
We will eat flesh

570
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,040

571
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,880
junk food.

572
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,540
Fuck the law.

573
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,460
We are not men.

574
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,900
One jackal laughing in the distance.

575
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,280
One is mad.

576
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,980
One has overdone the psychogenic

577
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,560
routine.

578
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,140
Uh-oh.

579
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,040
Uh-oh.

580
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,000
There must be some kind of

581
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,540
way out of here.

582
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,220
There's too much

583
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,920
confusion.

584
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,940
I can't get no relief.

585
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,960

587
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,120

589
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,060

591
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,880

But don't worry about me.

681
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,860
I won't get hooked.

Don't worry about me.

683
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,120

It felt so good.

685
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,220
I knew it would.

Just like they said.

687
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,720
And maybe one day I might, who knows, try it again.

688
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,220
I did it all by myself.

689
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,580
And you know what?

690
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:28,860
What?

691
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,080
It was easy.

692
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,000
Easy.

693
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,860
Real easy.

694
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,220
Well, I used a sock to tie it up.

695
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,460
And when my thing popped out, I slid it in real slow.

696
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,460
Oh, well, it went a little.

697
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,560
It felt kind of weird.

698
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,220
But when it all was in, it felt so good.

699
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,300
I could stare at my shoe for like 10 hours.

700
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,480
But it was 10 hours.

701
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,080
Whoa, yeah!

702
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:25,900
Ah, said I do it every day.

703
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,500
Look, that ballerina thinks my Girl With Luv was in love.

704
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,480

707
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,900
Especially when a girl gets hurt.

708
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,820
Is that how you feel?

709
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,720
Well, that's something I do.

710
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,080

718
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,200

719
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,040

00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,440

One more time

723
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,160
She's in her time

724
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,240
She's in her time

725
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,780
Well, you're a mystic sister and you've been through puberty

726
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,620
And you think you might be pagan and you want community

727
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,920
You meet a sex magician who tells you how it will be

728
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,820
He claims the door is locked and only he has got the key

729
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,540
He calls himself an elder but he's only 33

730
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,780
He's got merry me, he merry parts your legs to bliss and be

731
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,680
He says you best get used to it, it's part of the religion

732
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,560
You think he might be full of shit but you're a trusting pigeon

733
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,660
He takes you to a circle and the priest gives you a shovin'

734
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,560
Says we like polyamory and lots of carnal lovin'

735
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,400
So if you fuck my friends and me we'll let you in our coven

736
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,260
And if you want some family we'll put one in your oven

737
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,680
Which war? Twitch lore

738
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,520
Which war? Pitch score

739
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Which war? Pitch gore

740
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,820
Is he a lady conqueror or just a soldier in a witch war?

741
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,480
You think we get enough grief from the right-wing critics?

742
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,900
We shouldn't have to fight each other like some feral creatures

743
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,000
I hear there's trouble brewing with the voodons and the wiccans

744
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,640
They're sacrificing values and they're sacrificing chickens

745
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,740
And some folks scam the new age kids because they're easy pickets

746
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,600
A bunch of pagan characters right out of Charles Dickens

747
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,200
I thought that being pagan meant we all should get along

748
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,260
And that every path has value and there is no right or wrong

749
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,540
But every time there's power there's no right or wrong

750
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
There are those who try to grab it

751
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,080
Like someone comes along and takes a whackin' lorry cabot

752
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,940
Some other pool shoes pack like Elmer, but out huntin' wabbit

753
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,800
They wind up comin' off like Luke Costello and Bud Abbott

754
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,080
Which war? Pitch score

755
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,040
Which war? Pitch gore

756
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,000
Which war? Switch gore

757
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,340
Yo, I ain't no carnivore, I got no stomach for a witch war

758
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,980
I knew a couple women who were married to each other

759
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,600
And they were polyamorous and soon they found another

760
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,780
And then a jealous friend of one of the third woman's exes

761
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,540
Started a fight with her and she said,

762
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,580
I wanted raisin' bad juju and castin' nasty hexes

763
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,440
So everybody got to see what power over sex is

764
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,160
Rippin' at each other like Tyrannosaurus rexes

765
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,840
And it harmed none too as you will, must be the only law

766
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,760
And if you got a problem with that stickin' in your crawl

767
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,780
Well maybe you're a power monger tryin' hard to squeeze us

768
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,540
And you will not be welcome here until your witch war ceases

769
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,340
Cause everybody must be free to do as he, she pleases

770
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,020
No matter if they worship Satan, Buddha, Bob, or Jesus

771
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,520
Which war? Pitch score

772
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,420
Which war? Switch gore

773
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,120
Which war? Pitch score

774
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,400
I can't take it no more, you better stop it with the witch war

775
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,960
Oh yeah, which war? Are you a big predator?

776
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,000
Which war? Now tell me, what's it all for?

777
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,940
Which war? Hey, who's mindin' the store?

778
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,320
Now I can't take it no more, I got no stomach for a witch war

779
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:25,940
I can't take it no more, I got no stomach for a witch war

780
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,520
Hey, who's mindin' the store?

781
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,180
Hey, who's mindin' the store?

782
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,960
Hail Bobby Sarlassie, the king of Ethiopia

783
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,820
Now that's the emperor of Ethiopia

784
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,320
Hail Ethiopia!

785
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,320


786
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,940
Emperor Bobby Sarlassie, mentor of all the wagon and behind

787
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,700
All the bobbies and slobbies and left-behinds

788
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,000
And you're all gonna be left behind pretty soon

789
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh yes, Dave, I hope you're right about their behinds

790
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,160
Friends, what we just heard

791
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,140
Well, this in the background is

792
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,880
Einstein's Secret Orchestra at XX Day, the Friday afternoon jam

793
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,160
And the song we just heard, Witch War, is by Loki E. Coyote

794
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,540
I'll say that again, Loki E. Coyote

795
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,580
Who's sort of a pagan comedian, I guess you could say

796
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,840
I met him at Starwood

797
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,520
And you can visit their website at wickabilly.com

798
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,300

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,840
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there

803
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there

804
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,760
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were there

805
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:17,140
Before that, friends, we heard Maggie Pierce and E.J. with that song about heroin one more time

806
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,640
Maggie Pierce and E.J. were also some folks that performed at Starwood, which I met

807
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,740
And here is their contact info

808
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,800
Maggie Pierce and E.J. P.O. Box 41056

809

That's 41056

810

Philadelphia

811
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,420

One word, MPEband at AOL.com

815
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,380
Maggie Pierce and E.J. friends

816
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:07,160
And now back into delving deeper and ever deeper into subgeniusdom

817
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,320
From the recent devivals

818
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,300
The devivals

819
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,300


820
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,300


821
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,300


822
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,300


823
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,880
of new

824
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,960
any means necessary.

825
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,820
We will kill hate, we will silence censorship,

826
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,460
and we will burn fire, we will fuck sex,

827
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,740
death to death, killing and taxes, dear friends.

828
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,600
Kill them all, let Bob sort them out.

829
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,600
And you know, some people get worried

830
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,580
about that violent sounding part of it,

831
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,300
but you know, as Dr. Legume said,

832
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,040
to make an omelet, you gotta break a few eggs.

833
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,220
Well, to make the kind of omelet that Bob Dobbs is making,

834
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,340
it's gonna take a hell of a lot of scrambled brains

835
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,160
on drugs, my friends.

836
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,840
And many of you have probably heard of the New Age theory

837
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
about the 100th monkey.

838
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,920
They never mentioned the 100th Manson.

839
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,000
They never mentioned the 100th

840
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,280
Legume.

841
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,100
They never mentioned the 100th Bob.

842
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,420
Because friends, when you release your inner child,

843
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,680
sooner or later, your inner Charlie Manson

844
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,880
is gonna want out too.

845
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,320
And we are composed of many selves,

846
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,360
and it's a good idea not to take

847
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,320
any of your selves too seriously.

848
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,120
But seriously, there is a solution,

849
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,320
and that solution is fuck them if they can't take a joke.

850
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,080
And you think that would be enough, friends,

851
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,740
but the conspiracy has this secret weapon,

852
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,440
that invisible monster that lives up in the sky.

853
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,780
87% of Americans believe in that invisible monster

854
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,700
that'll kick their enemy's asses if they kiss its ass enough.

855
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,900
And yet, their so-called God is so pathetically weak

856
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,300
that apparently it has to be defended by illiterate little old ladies.

857
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,020
And that little old lady's against assholes like me.

858
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,140
What kind of a pussy ass God is that?

859
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,520
Seem like he'd be able to kick my ass himself.

860
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,640
That's why we do say, we still say,

861
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,080
war on God, dear friends.

862
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,860
War on any God that's worried about us,

863
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,100
making war on him.

864
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,900
Oh, yes.

865
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,120
Friends, we're just like any other religion.

866
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,140
It's not that we love Bob all that much,

867
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,560
and said we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell.

868
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,560
They may be the most controversial band in America.

869
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,480
They pack out concert halls from Tokyo to Los Angeles,

870
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,740
and their stage presence is nothing short of sensational.

871
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,040
I've seen

872
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,880
The Bramflex

873
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,500
in concert,

874
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,060
and I've briefly interviewed members of the band on my broadcast,

875
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,340
Talk Back with Bob Larson.

876
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,420
I've taken a lot of criticism for not condemning everything

877
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,380
The Bramflex

878
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:31,840
does.

879
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,340
Well, I've taken the position that even though I may not completely agree with

880
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,040
The Bramflex,

881
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,440
according to Philippians 1, I must praise God wherever Christ is preached,

882
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,320
even if I don't approve of the methodology.

883
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,820
Praise the Lord, the best of the admonitions.

884
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,420
Praise the Lord, the best of the admonitions.

885
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,060
Sometimes I wish God would give me a Holy Ghost machine that I'd blow your head on.

886
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:01,220
There's some new words that are being described very blatantly.

887
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,480
Let me give you an example.

888
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:08,520
In the lyrics of songs, when you hear them sing about engine, motor, or machine,

889
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,660
they're referring to sex.

890
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,100
When you hear them sing about funky, they're referring to sexual odors.

891
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,640
When they sing about groovy, they're talking about the position of intercourse.

892
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,500
When they sing of get off, they're singing about the goal of lovemaking.

893
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,680
And when you hear them talk about, sing about groupies,

894
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,660
they're talking about rock prostitutes.

895
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,000
I am a groupie.

896
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,120
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm church welcome

897
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,200
to this evening's show.

898
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,200


899
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,240
This evening's keynote speaker, Dr. P. Ellis.

900
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,720
Thank you.

901
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,820
Thank you.

902
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:44,860
Yeah, good.

903
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,340
Thank you.

904
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,780
Thank you.

905
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,640
Thank you.

906
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,460
Thank you.

907
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,240
Thank you.

908
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,420
Thank you.

909
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,860
Thank you.

910
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,740
Thank you very much.

911
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:00,660
Quote.

912
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,760
Balanced we, he sometimes, if DDT,

913
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,620
this all of us, teacher,

914
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,780
a turns and think system,

915
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,120
and look, the space,

916
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,100
and hope Bush, all idea,

917
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,880
as to acts can so.

918
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,520
I'm offering nations competitiveness blessed.

919
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,640
We his, I you.

920
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,140
We real know.

921
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,600
Don't like it when you see one.

922
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,560
You know and I know,

923
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,840
Hollywood is the next four years.

924
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,800
Death for Bush and his helpmates.

925
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,720
We have been the leaders of the Reagans.

926
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,680
I'm not used to going in front of the problem.

927
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,080
I am the future.

928
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,620
You know, and I will be a threat as well.

929
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,900
We are leaders of the American public,

930
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,280
to be called the Soviet Union's demise and collapse.

931
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,000
Experience is a family and family values,

932
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,040
and I will be a better tomorrow.

933
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,000
One learns every day.

934
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,180
Experience is a great teacher.

935
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,460
By experience, you learn.

936
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,020
I have made good judgments in the family.

937
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,080
He is the head of an evil empire, which we don't even suspect.

938
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,760
And while he's telling us that we can conceivably live to be 130,

939
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,880
it will be a world on a slave planet

940
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,100
where we literally have to sift the uranium sand off of our food,

941
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,780
off of our peanut butter and jam sandwiches.

942
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,240
That's right, copper top.

943
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,680
That's right, copper top.

944
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,920
That's the word to describe it.

945
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,980
To a metallic overture.

946
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,560
What does that mean?

947
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,740
Copper top.

948
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,020
What kind of an insult is that?

949
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,760
That means we're human batteries, baby.

950
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,040
We're all, you know, can't you hear it?

951
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Did you hear that drilling?

952
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,580
Yeah.

953
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,160
Yeah.

954
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,580
That's right.

955
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,160
The mechs, they're digging up babies next door

956
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,220
to use them as battery storage, like in that movie.

957
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,780
They dangled the truth right in front of us

958
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,640
and make us pay $6.50 to go see it in a theater.

959
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,520
Well, I think what is happening here...

960
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,540
And they're just laughing at us.

961
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,240
What we know is happening down there so far,

962
00:47:59,260 --> 00:47:59,980
but it's not really...

963
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,300
It's not really a joke or anything, is that...

964
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,220
Do you remember in...

965
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,800
What was that British sci-fi movie

966
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,100
where that thing from that ant planet,

967
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,820
that evil insect planet,

968
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,340
was buried in the subway?

969
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,060
Yeah.

970
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,040
They claim there's some sort of...

971
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,660
Five million years to Earth.

972
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,520
Yeah, five million...

973
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,060
They claim there is something down there

974
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,180
they're trying to find that is very big and metallic

975
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,260
and they don't know what it is.

976
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,660
They think it might just be a water line,

977
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,240
but it's down further than...

978
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,220
It's an old Martian spaceship.

979
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,720
It could conceivably be.

980
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,640
Emanating dreams of our...

981
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,400
Our archetypal...

982
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,740
Well, Dave, what happened...

983
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,720
Archidelia...

984
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,020
Hey, Dave, why did they shut up...

985
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,400
Why did they shut up...

986
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,960
Hans Christian Andersen?

987
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,600
No, Pete Conrad's mouth.

988
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,000
Pete Conrad?

989
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:42,920
Yeah, what's the deal?

990
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,920
Ask Dr. Quiter-Mass.

991
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,660
Pete Conrad had started a company

992
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,280
for people to buy tickets to go into space.

993
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,220
Mm-hmm.

994
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,820
And he was building a ship to do it.

995
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,360
Now, Pete Conrad is the third man to walk on the moon

996
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,680
and he spent three months in Skylab.

997
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,280
He's a type three man.

998
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,980
Did you ever read...

999
00:48:59,980 --> 00:48:59,980


1000
00:48:59,980 --> 00:48:59,980


1001
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,820
Did you ever read his, like, book,

1002
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,300
Three Man Man?

1003
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,440
No, he died in a motorcycle accident.

1004
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,680
He's 69 years old.

1005
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,640
He's 5.5.

1006
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,420
Just quote,

1007
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,080
he died like he lived, quote,

1008
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,660
in all your national, you know,

1009
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,520
1984-ish magazines there.

1010
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,480
Yeah, sure, right.

1011
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,140
But I'm sorry, nobody...

1012
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,260
They silenced him, man.

1013
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:16,880
I'm convinced.

1014
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,180
He must have known somebody.

1015
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,980
He knew a lot.

1016
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,620
Did you ever read his book?

1017
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,020
And he was a smartass.

1018
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,900
That's the problem.

1019
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,460
He knew a lot and he was a real smartass.

1020
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,740
See, there you go right there.

1021
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,820
They hate a smartass.

1022
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,920
Yeah, NASA, they really hated him.

1023
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,680
Remember in school they used to tell you that?

1024
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,040
Everybody hates a smartass.

1025
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,200
That was the message the government was giving us

1026
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,120
even when we were drinking them little milk cartons.

1027
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,620
That's why we had to start a religion for smartass,

1028
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,920
for those who had been smartasticated.

1029
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,020
Yeah, he kind of had definitely a subgenius.

1030
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,740
The dumbasticated ones, they hate us so,

1031
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,380
they hate us smartasses.

1032
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,960
I don't blame them.

1033
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,160
If I was a dumbass, I'd hate smartasses.

1034
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,560
Yeah, love doesn't like hate and hate doesn't like love.

1035
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,060
I love that.

1036
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,140
If you read Stalin's love letters

1037
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,580
and Adolf Hitler's memoirs to Eva,

1038
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,220
you will find this strong current of love-hate

1039
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,320
is now getting weird.

1040
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,020
Damn, there it was right there in front of me.

1041
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,800
It was like a little...

1042
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,600
Oh, man, it was another insect.

1043
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,700
We got incoming.

1044
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,240
Incoming.

1045
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,060
You know what they do?

1046
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,860
They are messengers from another dimension.

1047
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,360
You know, insects, when you see them

1048
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,640
and they look at you kind of strange.

1049
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,200
And here it is.

1050
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,780
Which dimension are you calling from?

1051
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,600
Oh, I disconnected it.

1052
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,420
Oh, poor little bug.

1053
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,360
Didn't really mean to do that.

1054
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,100
Well, if you're listening on the internet...

1055
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:50,680
Oh, my God.

1056
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,020
Oh, hey, let's do this right.

1057
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,640
We'll do a proper devival opening, friends.

1058
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,020
Now, I don't want anybody...

1059
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,120
I don't want anybody...

1060
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,020
to feel all nervous or self-conscious

1061
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,320
or anything like that,

1062
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,440
but if you could just bow your heads

1063
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,280
for a solemn, extremely serious,

1064
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,120
ponderous, full-of-oneself,

1065
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,840
thinks-God's-talking-to-you-only moment of sacred noise!

1066
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,260
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!

1067
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,120
Praise God! Praise God!

1068
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,720
Oper Excitement!

1069
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:34,720


1070
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:34,720


1071
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:34,720


1072
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:34,720


1073
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:34,720


1074
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,000
Hey, we're going to play a song now?

1075
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,400
Jesus.

1076
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:37,840
Yeah.

1077
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,900
What are we doing?

1078
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,580
Plastic Surgery!

1079
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,100
Plastic Surgery!

1080
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:45,740
No...

1081
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,500
It's about Plastic Surgery.

1082
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,480
Next one, next one.

1083
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,080
Next one's about plastic surgeries.

1084
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,100
Not this one, but the next one.

1085
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,040
Not this one, but the next one.

1086
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,260
Ready?

1087
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,760
One, two, three, four.

1088
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,240
Tonight, my students are lost

1089
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,120
I don't have a dream to shout

1090
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,560
I can feel without a doubt

1091
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,440
That sometimes life

1092
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,880
Believes that I cease to care

1093
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,800
Being isn't always there for

1094
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,060
Moon and sun and rather

1095
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,060
Red and blue and the thumb

1096
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,480
My eyes do see for

1097
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,200
Perfectation

1098
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,200


1099
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Meditation

1100
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Meditation

1101
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,700
When the senses confine me

1102
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,580
I'm addicted, please

1103
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,320
I don't know who I know

1104
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,120
And see that there is not her

1105
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,760
To be tired

1106
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,700
And mute

1107
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,600
Trying to escape

1108
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,100
And I'm not sure

1109
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,780
How you suffer

1110
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,300
Living in suicide

1111
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,980
With these itchy pads

1112
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,740
Of the upset eye

1113
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,280
Meditation

1114

1122
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1123
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1124
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1125
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1128
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1129
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1130
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1132
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1133
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1134
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1135
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520


1136
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,520

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,940
Meditation

1139
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,080
The global village jakiś complicated.

1140
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,080


1141
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,640
Man.

1142
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:25,020
Dear friends at XX Day, I believe the previous X Day they were known as Tri-State Killing Spree.

1143
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,880
A bunch of crazy women is what they are.

1144
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,080
Global Village Idiots.

1145
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,940
Uh, yes.

1146
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,500
Uh, yes.

1147
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,200
And what else?

1148
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:48,000
We also heard a little bit of the rants of Dr. P. Ellis from the WREK Subgenius Radio Show.

1149
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,760
And the information contact on Dr. Ellis' CD of rants.

1150
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,360
There's all kinds of things on that.

1151
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,960
Here's the address for Bob's Slacktime Funhouse and the Lymph Node Institute.

1152
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,000
Got your pencil ready?

1153
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:08,180
That's P.O. Box 670-540.

1154
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:19,920
That's Box 670-541 Marietta, Georgia 30066.

And, uh, where are we?

1160
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:40,820
Where are we?

1161
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,140
Oh, oh, wait.

1162
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,860
Um, actually, I need to also give credit for the Bran Flakes.

1163
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:52,900
I played a little stretch of, uh, called, uh, Praise the Lord from the Bran Flakes.

1164
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,700
The Negative Land-like edit band.

1165
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,300

00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,360
Uh, yes.

1177
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,300
And you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack from the church of

1178
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,220
the Subgenius.

1179
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,900
Subgenius Foundation Headquarters is located at...

1180
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,740
Got that pencil ready?

1181
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,440
Uh, that's Box 140306.

00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:50,760
Oh, the romance of numbers and, uh, of course, that's also www.subgenius.com.

1185
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:56,200
And friends, subgenius has no zero in it.

1186

1191
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,760
Refuse to know how to play the instruments.

1192
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,820
Uh, yes.

1193
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,840
But, um, I've got to get this show finished up.

1194
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,500
And let's switch over.

1195
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,040
What is this?

1196
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:53,180
Lost in Space was another band that performed at XX Day.

1197
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,140
This was season one beyond tomorrow.

1198
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,720
These very lives in your gravity

1199
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,640
into the first take of music

1200
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,540
from the extremes of comprehension.

1201
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,500
Lost in Space.

1202
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,220
Producators.

1203
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,100
The vitamin for the space rock.

1204
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,420
That's me, baby.

1205
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,400
You will do as I do.

1206
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,300
Cause I'm your intergalactic

1207
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,180
fantasy.

1208
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,500
You're all those

1209
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,660
entities.

1210
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,620
Must be all

1211
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,180
of the same.

1212
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,520
Sexiest man in the galaxy.

1213
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,620
Sexiest man in the galaxy.

1214
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,160
Lust in space, everybody.

1215
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Welcome to the sex goddesses.

1216
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,420
And say it's coming.

1217
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,060
Ah-hoo-ga.

1218
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,420
Ah-hoo-ga.

1219
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,780
The end is near. It's all right.

1220
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,260
Ah-hoo.

1221
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,480
Ah-hoo.

1222
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:22,760
Ah-hoo-ga.

1223
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Are you a flirt?

1224
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,960
An exhibition?

1225
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:34,400
A pianist?

1226
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,500
Do you like showing your body to strange men?

1227
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Have you ever fantasized about

1228
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,980
deflowering a male virgin?

1229
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,120
Then come to Brushwood

1230
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,620
the weekend of July 5th, 1998.

1231
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,260
See thousands of nude yeti in their natural habitat.

1232
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,140
Pay only a small admissions fee

1233
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,620
for the spectacle of a lifetime.

1234
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,900
And the end of a civilization.

1235
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,620
It's the X Day drill.

1236
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,220
But this time,

1237
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,280
it's not a drill.

1238
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,700
I wish.

1239
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,020
Oh, thank you, Friday, ever so much.

1240
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,100
But friends, you have actually been listening to

1241
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,540
all recordings from bands that were at the

1242
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,780
Brushwood campground events.

1243
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,700
Subgenius event X Day.

1244
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,680
XX Day, I should say.

1245
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,680
And the ace event, Starwood.

1246
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,140
You...

1247
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,840
Well...

1248
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,180
Yes, we try to share what we can,

1249
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,780
although maybe it's...

1250
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,480
You had to have been there kind of thing.

1251
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:37,980
I don't know.
