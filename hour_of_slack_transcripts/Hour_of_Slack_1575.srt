1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Free Cha-Cha children Babylon

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,620
Let them be

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,180
I said to let children Babylon

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,640
She would never say where she came from

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,820
The subgenius power of

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,560
Stay tuned for the PR news

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,240
Then next up, Bob and the subgenius power of

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,240
I never miss it

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,460
Yeah, right

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,120
From PR news in Washington

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm killing everyone

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,620
on the internet

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,580
After destroying more structures

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,480
Dollar Tree, Family Dollar

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,400
Dollar Tree, Family Dollar

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,900
Family Dollar Tree says

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,460
Dollar Tree, Family Dollar

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,100
But the mule just doesn't get it

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,360
At least 10 people are denying

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,900
it's PR news in Washington

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,700
What's your name?

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,380
Bobby

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,620
Party's moving to Bobby's house, everybody

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,600
Come on!

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,860
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,740
Come on!

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:19,940
Come on, come on!

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,020
Up there, my child

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,360
There dwells the one true God

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Who created all living things

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,880
The true God at the moon?

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,680
No end to the earth

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,320
Bob is fill-in-the-blank

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,180
I am Bob

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,300
I'm not Bob

36
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,440
You are Bob

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,520
We are all Bob

38
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,680
We are all Devo

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,520
We are Bob

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,220
Bob will protect you

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,620
Bob is protecting the genetic race of the human race

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,620


43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,320
future. Let him. Let him into your life. Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you. He must

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,580
protect you. He has to protect you. Jehovah One says Bob will protect you. One dollar for salvation.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:10,320
One dollar. He gave life to you and to me. Pray to him, Antillia. He will listen to your prayers.

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,660
I can't believe the weird things that people get in their heads and start teaching.

47
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,120
J.R. Bob Dobbs, known among salesmen as the saint of sales. It's actually a mystic sales ability.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:34,180
Bob was given powers and has been given messages all along by alien entities, intelligences

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,940
in outer space or maybe all around us that are

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,220
literally fingered.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,200
of the stark fist of Jehovah One, alien space god from some sin galaxy.

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,340
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,380
Get to the stage now to soothe the crowd.

54
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,500
Bob can save me from the enemy.

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,120
Bob Dobbs came to town to set you free. He came to now to set you free.

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,300
You got no business.

57
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,500
You got no business being sick. You got no business being embodied. You got no business

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,420
living out of sin. You got no business living without sight.

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,200
Fortunately, this is the one true church.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,480
Bob protects me from demons and I got a lot of them.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,140
Bob will protect you.

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,540
'll make you fully healthy.

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:59,340
Oh, the toxins are accumulating, everyone can see that this is so.

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:09,240
Your ulcers and anxieties are stinging you like bees from head to toe.

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,300
The brain of how it died to will keep us right along.

66
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


67
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


68
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


70
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


71
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


72
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,300


73
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,980
But no one wants to take the pain to its source.

74
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,760
You feast upon flesh and then you see the curse.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,580
Pause for a moment to reflect upon the evils that you cause to flow.

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,020
Through your sacred bowels and then as others have you will repent.

77
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,340
I know.

78
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,840
For I have come to halt this cycle of death.

79
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,360
I shall proclaim the truth until my final breath.

80
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,200
Behold the master cleanser.

81
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,760
Behold the master cleanser.

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,800
Upon your life depends your purity and sanctity.

83
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,200
Cleanse your body and be free.

84
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:28,000
Simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify.

85
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,620
They'll stitch you up with fishing line and shoot you full of dope until you blow.

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,500
Only I can light your path if only you will have the strength to go.

87
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,320
Back to the root, the fruits of the earth.

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,860
Eat them in.

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,220
Eat them in peace and know the soul's true worth.

90
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,560
Behold the master cleanser.

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,080
Behold the master cleanser.

92
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,000
Upon your life depends your purity and sanctity.

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,520
Cleanse your body and be free.

94
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,760
Simplify, simplify.

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,440
Be free.

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,440


97
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,860
Ham

98
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:55,720
I know that you're there waiting.

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:55,760
Everything that happens in your life is real.

100
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:55,800
Today.

101
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:55,800


102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:55,800


103
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,180


104
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,960
Thank you.

105
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Thank you.

106
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Thank you.

107
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:34,780
Thank you.

108
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you.

109
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,220
Thank you.

110
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,660
Thank you.

111
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,580
Thank you.

112
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,740
Thank you.

113
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:36,820
Thank you.

114
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Thank you.

115
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,760
Thank you.

116
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,320
Thank you.

117
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,940
Thank you.

118
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,600
Can you feel it?

119
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,940
The warm, tingling sensation?

120
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,360
That's just the medicine working.

121
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,600
Just the medicine.

122
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,520
Oh yes dear friends.

123
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,660
And that was...

124
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:47,920
...the...

125
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:55,060
Well we had a couple of new songs by new artists that we have not played on our...

126
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,640
Well actually that last one we just did, Antidote, was by Pilgrim Speakeasy.

127
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:10,200
We played a few years back, I think, and they've got a new album called Freak Deco, I think.

128
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,180
That's Pilgrim Speakeasy.

129
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,600
What we just heard, before that there was another song.

130
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,260
A song about getting right with Bob, you might say.

131
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,720
If you wanted to interpret it that way.

132
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,460
Called The Master Cleanser.

133
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,660
And the person doing that was David Morrison.

134
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,680
We heard doing a guest vocal on one of those Rudy Schwartz project songs.

135
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,580
The new album.

136
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,120
The one about moist towelettes, I believe.

137
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,160
He's the guy selling the moist towelettes.

138
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,500
Before that, some collages by The Large, me, and Fernandin Andy.

139
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,580


140
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,580


141
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
They leap Murr.

142
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,140
Me by the way is Reverend Ivan Stang.

143
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,120
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack, which is a subgenius radio show.

144
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,740
One of three actual broadcast shows.

145
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,120
The other ones being Suzy the Floozy's Bob's Slack Time Funhouse in beautiful WREK Atlanta.

146
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,960
And Puzzling Evidence, the longest around show since 1982 on KPFA and Berklee.

147
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,140
And both of those are online and archived forever.

148
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,280
And hundreds, thousands of shows you can download.

149
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,840
This is Hour of Slack number 1575.

150
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,140
And we've got some news and things.

151
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,780
Accent on the things.

152
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,140
There's probably going to be one thing calling in pretty soon.

153
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,760
Oh, on the previous show.

154
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,080
Joel played a song by...

155
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,300
Bunny Whaler about...

156
00:16:49,300 --> 00:17:00,160
Apparently it's about when Bobby's overzealous subgeniuses insist on loaning you things and

157
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,960
you take it reluctantly, but they want it back.

158
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,720
But you put it with your stack of 40,000 other books and TV shows and movies that people

159
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,560
said you'll die if you don't get into them.

160
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Bobby loans.

161
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,000
That's what they call it.

162
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,080
That's what they call it.

163
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,600
It was that...

164
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,820
Bunny Whaler was singing about Bobby loans.

165
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,700
My hearing isn't real good, but I could hear that clearly.

166
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,420
And boy, do I know what bunny means.

167
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,740
Boy, sure do I.

168
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, I don't hear you.

169
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,220
There.

170
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm sorry.

171
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,260
I certainly do understand Bobby loans.

172
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,880
Because usually when they give you that thing that's so precious to them and you have no

173
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,180
interest in whatsoever, it has a way of either getting lost or broken.

174
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,760
Well, like I say, it ends up in the stack of the other things.

175
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,980
Bobby's insistent.

176
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,860
Bobby's insistent on loaning you even though you didn't want them or ask for them.

177
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,280
Right.

178
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,440
Right.

179
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,600
I mean, I love the Bobby's, but...

180
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:52,880
Me too.

181
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,680
Well, I mean, I love their membership dues.

182
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,980
I adore their adoration.

183
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,440
Yeah, there you go.

184
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
Well, we've been very, very busy getting ready for our two respective festivals.

185
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,000
It is kind of weird that the...

186
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,540
The...

187
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,860
The...

188
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:25,220
The rather rough and down and dirty X Day Festival, that's the one I started organizing

189
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:32,080
under Bob and my lovely bride, or actually the queen, princess to whom I'm consort, Princess

190
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,180
Wee, runs the Starwood Festival with a lot of other people.

191
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,240
But she's one with her butt on the line, she and neighbor Joe.

192
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,400


193
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,620
But not lonesome cowboy Dave, who's just...

194
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,320
Sitting at home alone, playing with his weasel, talking to his friends from outer space as

195
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,800
usual, sending the wrong signals to the commanders in Velvet Zone 3.

196
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,080
Ah, what a lerf.

197
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,160
You better...

198
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,520
Only I...

199
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,480
Yeah, you better...

201
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,780
I better what?

202
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,800
You better live.

203
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh, I better be sorry, I thought.

204
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,860
No, no, you better...

205
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,360
No, you better...

206
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,380
No, you better...

207
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,760
You better live at least until next week, because we're going to try to deliver you

208
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,260
to the station next week.

209
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,440
We're also delivering Dr. Howell to the station next week.

210
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,760
That means I have to pick him up at the airport at dawn on Saturday.

211
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,100
At dawn?

212
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,640
Yeah, Saturday morning.

213
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,420
Like a bushel of potatoes.

214
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
It'll be an easy flight for him.

215
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,580
It's 10 o'clock in California when he leaves, and somehow it's 6 o'clock in the morning

216
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,280
when he lands here, only four hours later.

217
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,360
That's what you call a rave.

218
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,180
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

219
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,740
Yeah, it does.

220
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,260
It was actually a pretty good one.

221
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,740
Normally, it takes him eight hours to get here, because he has to have a four-hour stopover

222
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,200
in DeLuca, Ohio or someplace.

223
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,000
God, what a...

224
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,660
God's taking place here.

225
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,380
God's awful.

226
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,080
Well, or Chicago Airport, which is Orlando, which is even worse.

227
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,760
Well, I remember...

228
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,940
Chicago, Orlando, remember?

229
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,120
Yeah.

230
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,900
The shoe repair...

231
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:10,920
No, it's...

232
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,340
Oh, yeah.

233
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,340


234
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,340


235
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,340


236
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,340


237
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,340


238
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,340


239
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,080
The repair, that's it.

240
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,760
Oh, yeah.

241
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,060
We all have a little bit of toughs and tangles in certain parts of the universe, but we don't

242
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,060
want to stay in mesh there too long, because once you lose your hair, you can no longer

243
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,020
communicate freely.

244
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,220
You're charged too much.

245
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,340
Well, that's why I haven't had a haircut since 1990.

246
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,000
Actually, I had a haircut this morning by Princess Wee, but she just trims around the

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,920
back of my neck.

248
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,000
It's her favorite.

249
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,460
There's tiny bits.

250
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,140
She loves that.

251
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,940
Sometimes you get a girl move with the ponytail.

252
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,340
Yeah.

253
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,740
Like, you know, like you lose your shoulders, like, you know...

254
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,220
I can be a beautiful girl if I want to.

255
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,060
There's nothing wrong with me being a beautiful girl.

256
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,440
I had to explain that to my grandsons.

257
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,160
They were going, you have long hair like a girl.

258
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,980
And first I was going, no, no, I have long hair like Tarzan, Conan, pirates.

259
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,020
And pirates are the only one they even heard of.

260
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,980
So I finally just came out.

261
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,320
I just went, it's because I'm a beautiful girl.

262
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,340
And then I rubbed my bristly white beard against their faces and tried to kill them.

263
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,420
They were like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

264
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,420


265
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,820
Grandpa is a girl.

266
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,100
Grandpa is a girl.

267
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,220
Grandpa is a girl.

268
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,340
Yes, he tried to explain that he had long hair like a wizard, you know.

269
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,460
Gandalf.

270
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,100
Yeah.

271
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,900
My name is Gandalf the Black, and I'm the one's going to bring you some slack.

272
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,200
Apologies to Rita Graymore.

273
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,860
Well, the rhyme shows...

274
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,740
If I see me another hobbit, I'll make him flop out his little long hairy foot and I'll

275
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,260
chop it.

276
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,860
Well, have you heard of this?

277
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
That they found a race of hobbits.

278
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,620
As far as new humans are concerned.

279
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,040
Oh, yes.

280
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,180
Homo floresiensis.

281
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm very familiar with them.

282
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,740
Cute little...

283
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,700
Upright forensics.

284
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,180
Upside what?

285
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,320
Homo floresiensis.

286
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,300
They were found on the Isle of Flores.

287
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,880
Oh, I thought they were like flowery.

288
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
And they were pre...

289
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,820
Another...

290
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,300
Yeah, they were kind of like midget or homo erectus.

291
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,820
They were pretty primitive.

292
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,300
Homo erectus.

293
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,080
We've already talked...

294
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,560
Do we talk about the hot, hot illustration in National Geographic when those guys were

295
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,940
discovered?

296
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,040
It showed a little Homo floresiensis woman from behind.

297
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,040
You couldn't see her face.

298
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,540
Yeah, we said this last week.

299
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,020
Yes, I think so.

300
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,520
Are we getting old or something?

301
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,660
Forget it.

302
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,040
No, I don't remember.

303
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,920
Was Homo floresiensis tatas remarkably lovely or something?

304
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,300
Well, from behind, it was like a very small human female.

305
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,280
Now, if you looked at her in the front, that would be a little bit more...

306
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,280


307
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,320
It's kind of spoiled the effect because she's kind of chimpanzee-faced.

308
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,400
But there was a full-sized Homo sapiens coming around the entrance of the cave.

309
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,600
You couldn't help but speculate as to was this going to be love or war or both?

310
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,700
Why not both?

311
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,760
Well, mark my words, they're going to start playing around with the DNA they've retrieved

312
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,880
from these little skeletons, and they're going to start making all kinds of funny things

313
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,180
like Planet of the Apes-type monkey people.

314
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,480
That's wishful thinking on your part.

315
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,620
Of course it is.

316
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,440
I wish.

317
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,980
Well, you know...

318
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,880
Actually, you know what we're forgetting?

319
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,860
No?

320
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:26,220
According to Dobbs' prophecy and wishful thinking, in about a week and a half or something, we'll

321
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,540
be able to create any life forms we want on our own planets because we...

322
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,040
Oh, no joy.

323
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,320
Because we gave Bob his due and, you know, just ordering a button isn't enough.

324
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,600
Having that little cloisonné pin and being in a subgenius Facebook post.

325
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,600


326
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,240
That's not going to save you, friends.

327
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,600
But I'll just...

328
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,780
You can look and see.

329
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,560
I don't know.

330
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,360
When Bob says Trump, I say how high.

331
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,480
And he must be pretty high.

332
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:02,520
Did you know Princess Wee went to the same private junior high-type middle school that

333
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,120
Trump did?

334
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,060
No.

335
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,380
That's just remarkable.

336
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,820
Well, we've been cleaning out our basement, and she found a note that was passed to her

337
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,900
in junior high.

338
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,620
Yes, it was folded in that special way that girls fold notes that they pass in study hall,

339
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,840
where you make a long column and then you fold an angle and twist it all up and fold

340
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,720
it inside itself.

341
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,560
Yeah.

342
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,300
Makes a little tiny nice little neat square.

343
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:34,340
Well, the note says, to rough, which starts with a big R and then increasingly small Rs

344
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,460
to indicate that it's rough.

345
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,780
Hi.

346
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,760
How's you on this beautiful Tuesday?

347
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,560
Tuesday afternoon.

348
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,340
Just fine and dandy, I hope.

349
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,280
Ah, got spring fever?

350
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,340
Don't worry.

351
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,020
So does everyone else.

352
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,120
Rough.

353
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,380
Something tells me you'd better stay out of parked cars here.

354
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,840
Schaefer's driving me crazy.

355
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,540
So is Jim.

356
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,740
Oh, what a study hall, I'll tell ya.

357
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,580
Donnie's in here.

358
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,180
He's so cute.

359
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,800
Donald Duck.

360
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,540
Donald Duck has arrows pointing to the word Donnie.

361
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,200
That's his nickname from now on.

362
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,200
Was Donnie the one that was so cute or Tim or Jim?

363
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,080
No, it's Donnie that's so cute.

364
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,320
Oh.

365
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,660
How do you know it was Donald Trump though?

366
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,660
Well, they called him Donald Duck for nickname.

367
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,360
Well, yeah.

368
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,220
They called a lot of people that.

369
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,060
My ex-father-in-law's original name was Donald Duckamacki and they had to change it to another

370
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,780
name because they laughed at it.

371
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,700
Okay, well you just-

372
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,480
It was not an American name.

373
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,740
Yeah.

374
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
It was Donald Duckamacki.

375
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:41,660
You know, Donald Duckamacki.

376
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,500
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

377
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,580
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

378
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,280
But you know, you really can't just write this so I'm going to finish reading it.

379
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,760
And so it's Donald Duck.

380
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
That's his nickname from now on.

381
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,860
Well, not much more to say except goodbye.

382
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,780
Ready.

383
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,560
P.S.

384
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,200
Stay away from JB's too.

385
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,380
Here for your own good.

386
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:08,000
That is written to the letter and read to the letter for you from me.

387
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
JB's meaning JB's.

388
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:09,720


389
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,300
Did you guys bar and tent at the time?

390
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,420
I have no earthly idea.

391
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:14,700
No, that was at P.S.

392
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,920
This is from junior high, P.S. 273 back, you know, in another century ago.

393
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,720
P.S. 273, you did go with Donald Trump.

394
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,140
Yes.

395
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,860
I mean, you dated him.

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,380
Yes.

397
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
No, she didn't date him.

398
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,600
Did you?

399
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,880
Well.

400
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,660
Did I?

401
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,840
I, I-

402
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,480
And by the way, he's the best date.

403
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,180
He is the richest date.

404
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,900
He will show you the best time you've ever had.

405
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,720
And by the way, he's the greatest.

406
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:39,720


407
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,460
Did I tell you he's the greatest?

408
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,420
Oh, and by the way, by the way, he's, he's absolutely the greatest.

409
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,220
And that's it.

410
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,640
That's it.

411
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,580
Who else can say that they're the greatest?

412
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,980
Well, uh.

413
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,160
There's only one greatest.

414
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:00,240
Friends, if you're frustrated about your choices in this election year, there's a, there's

415
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,360
a button you can wear that says it's a red, white, blue, and it's red, white, and blue,

416
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,300
and Dobbs headed.

417
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,900
And it says, don't blame me.

418
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,600
I voted for Bob.

419
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,700
And if you were to look at any of the many subgenius Facebook pages and scroll down a

420
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:27,020
little bit, you'll find my, uh, post showing how that thing looks and where to find one.

421
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,800
Uh, it's, it's very, it's, it's a, it's an American product.

422
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,220
Actually it says it's imported on there.

423
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,700
It's funny.

424
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,940
Yeah.

425
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,120
Bob.

426
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,320
Don't blame me.

427
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,400
I voted for Bob bright button and you can buy them in a 10 pack away.

428
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:41,940
Wow.

429
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,920
You can get 10 more when you could, but you, you probably were interested.

430
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,360
Yeah.

431
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,780
I suppose that way.

432
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,260
Yeah.

433
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,280
But most people who voted for Bob weren't interested in didn't really.

434
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,100
And when you said button at first, I thought it was, there was a button you could push

435
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,600
and they would all go away.

436
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,740
That's what I was hoping for.

437
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,300
I didn't know it was a button that you had to wear.

438
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
Dream on.

439
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,100
I think we have another one that says kiss me.

440
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,100


441
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,740
Kiss my butt.

442
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:14,200
And that's the one I'd like to wear proudly on the 4th of July on the anniversary of our

443
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,380
presidency of our, of our individual independence from the Soviet, uh, from the mustard people,

444
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,460
the mustard gas making people.

445
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,100
Yeah.

446
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,440
So would you wear that button on your butt or on your chest?

447
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,060
Forehead pin it right to Bob today's forehead.

448
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
No, it's two and a half inch button.

449
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,000
It's pretty big.

450
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,900
No, that will hurt.

451
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
I don't want anything to hurt.

452
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,440
My Dave first, you give him and Dr. Legume some Jaeger Meister and then Legume does it

453
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,760
today.

454
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:43,560
No.

455
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,700
And then he, then he cuts off, then he hypnotizes Dave into cutting off his long ponytail.

456
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,660
No, no.

457
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:57,600
Then Legume gets drunk and sews his own lips shut imitating Andrew the impaled, but doing

458
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,420
it without surgical needles using a hat pin or something.

459
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,840
Then you fall asleep standing up, leaning against a tree.

460
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,620
Oh no.

461
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,080
With your forehead against a tree.

462
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,440
No.

463
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,260
You fall asleep standing up.

464
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,600
That was one of Dr. Legume's X days and we're getting ready for X day, man.

465
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm packing the van and making swag and I made the brochure, which I, you can, you can

466
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,000
download from the, uh, 19 X day Facebook page.

467
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,000
Coolers fully onster blaster.

468
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,580
Everybody's getting ready to get hip stone to the actual and final end of this planetary

469
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,160
sphere.

470
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,360
Uh, this.

471
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,960
I'm going to make a spherical, this rotund adventure, which we're forced to have since

472
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,840
how many million years has it been?

473
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,320
This thing's been going on like this.

474
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,320
Well, this'll be my 21st X day.

475
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,260
Uh, let's hope it's not another drill.

476
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,600
Last year was 20, a 19 X day.

477
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,100
This is 20.

478
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,280
No, this is 20 X nine 21 so that the, you're right.

479
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,720
This will be my 21st X day and let's hope it's not my 21st X day drill.

480
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,420
But actually my very first real X day.

481
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,600
And so now X day is old enough to drink.

482
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,980
That's right.

483
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:22,000
X day, X day events are now 21 years old and that means, uh, although they've been eligible

484
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,440
to be drafted and fight for capitalism and die for capitalism since X days were only

485
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,860
18.

486
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,040
Now X days being 21 years old can also drink.

487
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,660
Isn't that big of the government?

488
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:35,880
Wow.

489
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,520
That is better than going to the dentist and getting removed and stuff.

490
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,920
Especially when you think of the time, the time problems and going back 21 years, you

491
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,940
can never really tell.

492
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:54,160
I know it's been discussed every before every X day that maybe X day already did come and

493
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,980
this is a time compression of everything that's gone afterwards.

494
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,620
When people don't know that they're actually in the saucers and they've already escaped

495
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,160
will this world they're in into existence.

496
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,640
Right.

497
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,900
And don't even know it.

498
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,580
Right.

499
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,700
They can't imagine anything better than their crummy apartments.

500
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,140
So that's what their escape vessel has looked like since the real 1990.

501
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,620
Right.

502
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,500
And that's the kick-leg, the zoom-bangy.

503
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,840
But that would be true of me too, because I didn't really detect any serious change

504
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
in what the conspiracy calls 1998.

505
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,960
We're just hoping this is the real 1998.

506
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,040
We'll find out.

507
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,680
That's seven o'clock in the morning.

508
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,560
But what if we don't want it once and for all?

509
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,640
Yeah.

510
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:35,640


511
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,740
That's the worst thing that comes for real.

512
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,960
Well, we've done entire shows about that now, haven't we, lonesome cowboy Dave, after

513
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,460
X day?

514
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,720
Yes, but it is something that must be considered.

515
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,180
It's not like it's something to be taken lightly.

516
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,340
It's to be taken very heavily and ponderously indeed.

517
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,840
Well, there's also the problem of suddenly every subgenius gets his own Death Star or

518
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,100
her own Death Star.

519
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,480
How many of them are going to be coming after me?

520
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,500
A lot more than last year.

521
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,480
The fact that they got their own Death Star, they won't get over their anger at me.

522
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,880
Oh, well, he did arrange for us to get this Death Star, but that was really Bob's doing.

523
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,560
Anybody could have done that stupid show.

524
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,640
I could have done a lot better.

525
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,920
If I ran a business ever in my life, I'd be running it a lot better than that Stang guy.

526
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,420
Well, how doesn't it know that you're not Stang entirely in reality and that you're

527
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,480
one of the Bobbies who thought he was the Stang who could do that?

528
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


529
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


530
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


531
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


532
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


533
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


534
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


535
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


536
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,480


537
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,860
I could have done the show ten times better and somehow assumed the personality of the

538
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,640
actual Stang.

539
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,380
Well, why not both?

540
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,980
And here's the sorry thing.

541
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,100
Facebook decided that I couldn't be named Reverend Ivan Stang.

542
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:57,600
Some computer way in the darkness there talked to another computer and it went, wait, that

543
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,120
Google account of that one guy and this Facebook account by Doug Stang.

544
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,180
That's the same guy.

545
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,260
One of them's fake.

546
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:16,120
And they decided that the Doug Smith human street name was the real name and that they're

547
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,220
prejudiced against people of my descent.

548
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,580
But that's not even a real name, is it?

549
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,500
Subgeniuses.

550
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,720
Right.

551
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,140
Yeah, Doug Smith.

552
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,440
That sounds very likely, doesn't it?

553
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,100
Oh, that sounds like a real name.

554
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,400
Sure.

555
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,520
I can even check into hotels.

556
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,100
I mean, that's not even a real name.

557
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,220
That's a fake as sound a name.

558
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,820
And then you throw in my middle name, which has religious connotations.

559
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,240
It just sounds it's too perfect.

560
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,220
Christ.

561
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,380
Yeah.

562
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,660
Yeah.

563
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,420
Douglas Christ, the the Redeemer Smith.

564
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:51,180
No, I'm actually I'm named after St. Claire, the Claire, the saint of patron saint of television

565
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,040
of all things.

566
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,980
It's true.

567
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,540
It's true.

568
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,460
I'm sorry.

569
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,360
That tickled the wrong.

570
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,700
You don't say patron saint of television.

571
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,080


573
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,080


574
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,080


575
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,080


576
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,400
Don't you remember?

577
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,400


578
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,400


579
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,560
We killed her long ago.

580
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Don't you remember?

581
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,140
We stood her up against the wall and there was a firing squad made pies.

582
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,360
And it was on YouTube, and that's what killed television.

583
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,380
Pie bombardment.

584
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,060
I have a lot of friends who don't watch any television, but I get the impression that

585
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:31,080
they watch another YouTube thing every 15 minutes because that's how often they post

586
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
those links to subgenius.

587
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,760
genius pages.

588
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,940
Well, I thought there was going to be a huge war

589
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,300
on the internet between the macrocephalics

590
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,480
and the microcephalics.

591
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,900
Yeah, it's called the election, dude.

592
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,200
I think we know where the microcephalics

593
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,280
are

594
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,080
heading. To the voting

595
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,640
booths!

596
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,740
You mean

597
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,800
the tiny heads versus the big heads?

598
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,840
No, it's the tiny hands versus

599
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,680
the big heads.

600
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,740
The teeny tiny handed people.

601
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,060
They have such

602
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,760
little hands, but they don't need

603
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,000
very big hands for what they do in the bathroom.

604
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,220
Little people with Micronesian

605
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,520
feet and soft hair.

606
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,780
The thing they handle with their little

607
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,080
hands in the bathroom, it's as little as their hands.

608
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,720
Even a little.

609
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,780
Magically delicious.

610
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,560
Ew!

611
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,160
Hey, Reverend Fox,

612
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,400
God, why do I do that?

613
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,660
Reverend Foe? No, it's Reverend Fox.

614
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,540
That's right, Reverend Fox.

615
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,960
F-A-U-X is spelled Fox.

616
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,220
Yeah, F-A-U-X is spelled Fox.

617
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,700
Fox.

618
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,020
He's going to be at X Day, but he mentioned today that he's

619
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,680
close,

620
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,200
turn your radio off, everyone who's sensitive.

621
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,140
He says he self-identifies

622
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,340
as a ladies' room toilet.

623
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,100
Hmm.

624
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,560
Hmm.

625
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,080
I cursed him

626
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,540
for putting that image into my head.

627
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,920
And then he said,

628
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,660
you're a bigot.

629
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,620
You're just a bigot against

630
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,800
ladies' room toilets.

631
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,800
Well, it's an anti-sexual remark.

632
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,020
Yeah, exactly.

633
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,740
You think that all of a sudden, all those

634
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,400
hot, sexy thoughts you've had

635
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,460
turn into actually being a toilet.

636
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,180
Right, you stop and get realistic

637
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,600
for a second, and then you go,

638
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,380
ugh, large mammals.

639
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,020
Mmm.

640
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,920
Well, you can call them mammals

641
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,240
if you like. I prefer to

642
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,720
prefer, I prefer

643
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,320
to call them... You do?

644
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,520
That must kind of tickle.

645
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,180
I mean, yes, it's fuzzy.

646
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,280
I prefer to call them

647
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,140
Pryterisops.

648
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,420
Pryterisops.

649
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,940
I don't know.

650
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,520
Were those the ones that

651
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,400
looked like rhinoceros?

652
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,220
No, that was Tricerocop

653
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,820
from, uh,

654
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,060
what was that movie, Kung Fu

655
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,340
something? That's a great

656
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,620
80s movie. We had Tricerocop

657
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,300
and Thor and

658
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,100
Wotan and Hitler and

659
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,860
Oh, yeah, I remember Hitler.

660
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,380
Barbarians.

661
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,220
Riding dinosaurs. It was

662
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,660
very similar to Iron Sky.

663
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,860
Yes.

664
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,820
But different. It was in 1980s.

665
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,420
It way predated Iron Sky.

666
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,460
Iron Sky, Dave, is a movie about

667
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,300
Nazis on the moon while

668
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,920
Sarah Palin is president.

669
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,480
You would love it.

670
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,560
There is nothing better than that.

671
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,380
You would love this movie, Iron Sky.

672
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,360
It's directed by a Finnish guy

673
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,400
and it was crowdsourced.

674
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,240
You know, internet funded, I think.

675
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
And they're doing it. There's a sequel to it.

676
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,700
The trailer to the sequel shows

677
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,640
a flying saucer

678
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,300
landing in the hollow

679
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,440
Earth, which looks kind of

680
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,500
prehistoric but has Atlantis in it.

681
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,380
She lands on a flying

682
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,320
saucer there and comes out and she's greeted

683
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,580
by a clone of Adolf Hitler

684
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,780
riding a Tyrannosaurus.

685
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,080
That's the trailer for Iron Sky 2.

686
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,440
Is he also wearing a suit of armor

687
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,780
and carrying like a flag?

688
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,080
Oh, and by the way,

689
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,580
speaking of movies,

690
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,660
I didn't get a call from my son today

691
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,440
even though in our time zone

692
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,180
it's Father's Day because

693
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,440
my son is working on his very

694
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,500
first feature film.

695
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,660
Wow, I can picture that.

696
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,360
It's a low budget thing.

697
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,180
Somebody called him up and said,

698
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,980
we need a director and our director of photography

699
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,820
was about to quit this

700
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,960
low budget but well written

701
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,760
mystery project

702
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,660
because we didn't have a director.

703
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,680
And he said we should hire

704
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,620
you as a director.

705
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,560
And so my son has got,

706
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,320
I think they start shooting

707
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,540
about the same time the world ends.

708
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
July 5th.

709
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,460
Wow.

710
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,920
Well, do we just hope they shoot the right people?

711
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,040
As the world ends, you know,

712
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,220
it's not going to be easy.

713
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,760
When that red carpet rolls out,

714
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,140
there's going to be a lot of hot feet,

715
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,100
so to speak.

716
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,700
Not for the subgeniuses.

717
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Well, I mean, the day is, the day is, you know,

718
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:00,660


719
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:00,660


720
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,440
it's leading up to the, to the, to the primal rupture moment.

721
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,640
Subgeniuses might have hot feet.

722
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,080
It looks, I mean, this campground where we gather

723
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,780
to meet the aliens is in southern Ohio.

724
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,220
My legs are on fire.

725
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,820
Yeah.

726
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,940
It might, it might be hot.

727
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,840
The last two X Day drills, it was cool.

728
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,800
It was, it was very nice, actually.

729
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,460
Great weather.

730
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,300
But the first two that we had there,

731
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,940
it was hot.

732
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,060
It was a freak heat wave all over the whole country,

733
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,740
one of them.

734
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,600
The other one had a tornado everywhere except the campground.

735
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,200
Right.

736
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,200
And power was out everywhere except the campground.

737
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,400
And only the subgeniuses had, for instance,

738
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,240
ice or phone chargers.

739
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:45,860
Right.

740
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,580
And we had to, we had to not tell anyone

741
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,720
when we went into town,

742
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,980
because then the townies would all have invaded the,

743
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,100
the campground and, well, it'd be like Walking Dead or something,

744
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,920
you know, the walkers would just, you know,

745
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,700
they'd come after us.

746
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,440
They're slow, but they're numerous.

747
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,760
And they make those groaning sounds and stuff like that.

748
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,120
So much like real life.

749
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,180
Blech.

750
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,780
Blech?

751
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,700
What do you mean, blech?

752
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,440
Blech.

753
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,840
Princess.

754
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,240
We have, we have one of those wife-husband things

755
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,860
where I got to Netflix and a lot of people,

756
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,720
including my daughter, had said,

757
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,280
you ought to watch that show Walking Dead.

758
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,540
You'd probably really like it.

759
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,760
You really might try it.

760
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:28,900
Yeah.

761
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,480
And, and one day I did.

762
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,580
Now I'm on episode, no, I'm on season four.

763
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,120
And Princess, we won't even, if I listen to,

764
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,840
if I watch it, I have to wear headphones.

765
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,460
Because just the sounds make her sick.

766
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,960
Anyway, what I'm saying is it's a, it's a metaphor

767
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,380
for just being an aware person walking around in life today.

768
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,340
Because I often see people shuffling down the street

769
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,040
and think, walkers.

770
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,780
Sometimes it's because they're very old

771
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,200
or very poverty stricken or very diseased.

772
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,300
But I don't remember seeing walkers as frequently as I do now.

773
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,760
Yes, I do too.

774
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,080
I must agree with that.

775
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,640
And as a metaphor for an incidental occurrence in society,

776
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,200
I must agree sociologically 100%.

777
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,520
That's the way it's stinking up.

778
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,280
Well, George Romero's second Living Dead movie,

779
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,400
Day of the Dead.

780
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,680
Dawn of the Dead.

781
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,020
Dawn of the Dead, which took place largely in a shopping center.

782
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,120
That was the most, that was when most of us realized,

783
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,660
oh, this isn't just a horror movie.

784
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,900
This is the horror movie of real life.

785
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,520
Yeah.

786
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,760
Because a shopping mall full of walkers

787
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,720
and a shopping mall full of Americans,

788
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,460
there's hardly any difference.

789
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:46,860
Yep.

790
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,520
There you go.

791
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,920
The dumbing down, man.

792
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,500
It's begun.

793
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Although I'll tell you, I think the,

794
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,480
I think the big smackdown has started.

795
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,420
The big smackdown?

796
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,300
I'll bet that you've,

797
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,500
I'll bet that like me,

798
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,300
you've been wondering for about a year now,

799
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,000
how come they haven't,

800
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,020
how come they haven't pulled out all the stuff they know about Trump?

801
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,180
I mean, some of us knew who he was since the 80s.

802
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,220
And that guy's got more nasty,

803
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,060
there are more ridiculous, stupid clips of him talking

804
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,000
than, that have not yet been brought out.

805
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,020
And there's a lot of lawsuits and a lot of stuff that,

806
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,480
it's like they, the media and the,

807
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,720
the Democrats have been sitting on this for a year now.

808
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,880
And I was, I've been thinking,

809
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,060
I know that there's just the,

810
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,780
the drama in human need dictates that the smackdown will come.

811
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,180
And I think it's, I think we're starting to see it.

812
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,980
Right. But they say,

813
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,140
I think we are starting to see it, yes.

814
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,380
They saved all those burned bridges for the,

815
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,140
for the last.

816
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,780
Right. After the convention.

817
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,120
Well, I noticed in the pain dealer,

818
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,360
there were some comments to that effect.

819
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,280
And even in the local small town newspaper to which I subscribe,

820
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,100
there were some comments.

821
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,340
It sounds like it's something's brewing that this is going to happen soon.

822
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,820
Well, it's what's brewing is they're just going to take the lid off the stuff.

823
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,320
They've been keeping back because it'll be so much more dramatic a month before the election

824
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,400
or the day before the election,

825
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,880
when they come out with the really,

826
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,460
really bad pictures.

827
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,000
Well, and clips and recordings for the convention and people and go.

828
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,340
Well, a lot of people saying,

829
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,100
well, it's good that it doesn't matter because Hillary's going to be in jail.

830
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,100
She's going to be executed for treason.

831
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,500
She's under indictment already.

832
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,400
I just keep this.

833
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,740
The media just won't talk about it because they're all in her pocket,

834
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,560
especially Fox News.

835
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,040
They become so socialistic and liberal.

836
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,620
The minute that evil woman started bad mouthing him.

837
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,440
That's when I was.

838
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,640
I knew that Fox News was just a rhino.

839
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,740
Fox News.

840
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,980
That's just nothing but a rhino.

841
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,560
Well, at least there's some kind of nostril going on there.

842
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,220
We could only wish and hope that there were like third nostrils in the foot in the land,

843
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,120
not in a foot.

844
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,420
Well, I have a lot.

845
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,860
There are a lot of my friends that have still keep thinking it's performance art.

846
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,340
There's no way this guy could be serious.

847
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:18,800
No kidding.

848
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,680
But wait a minute.

849
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:29,160
He's got a lot of 30% of the people out there believe everything he says because it's the things they most wanted to hear.

850
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,360
They say that he says the things everybody is thinking, but they don't know everybody.

851
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I know one person who's not thinking the same things that he's saying.

852
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,440
That's you and me.

853
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,800
Oh, you're another one.

854
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,360
Well, there's two.

855
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,680
How about you, Princess?

856
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,920
We were you thinking that we need that we needed to.

857
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:57,760
Basically, make make up, make every one of a different who's not of the approved religion wear a special badge, maybe a little crescent or something.

858
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,800
No, like a yellow star or something.

859
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,340
No, thanks.

860
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,560
No, I think you don't.

861
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,880
Oh, you just think the Muslims are just all peaceful.

862
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,160
Like I told you, you just don't.

863
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,000
It's like their lived hearts are deliberately stupid.

864
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,860
That's what stupid is spelled with a T.

865
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:17,900
And I don't.

866
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,620
I don't care what you know what I'll say.

867
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,580
Have you?

868
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,020
You're stupid.

869
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,040
I got I've actually gotten.

870
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,260
Well, I love it.

871
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,920
I love it when somebody calls somebody else stupid.

872
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,320
And when they say you're stupid and they misspelled both words.

873
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,000
God, I love that.

874
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,260
That's what you know.

875
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,220
Browsing the Internet is worth it.

876
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,520
When you run into your stupid, both words misspelled and they're not.

877
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,700
How do they usually spell them?

878
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,160
I'm curious as to how you can misspell your stupid.

879
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,000
You're stupid.

880
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,400
Why?

881
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,200
Oh, you are.

882
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,600
Oh, S.T.U.P.E.D.

883
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,360
Oh, P.I.T.

884
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,440
You're stupid or you're stooped.

885
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,780
And of course, you know, they know sometimes a lot of people stupid.

886
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,460
Yes.

887
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,720
Then there's the other the other practice of rather than leaving out an apostrophe,

888
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,900
adding an apostrophe to before every S.

889
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,680
Whether it's possessive or not, you know, just.

890
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,860
And we don't want to be possessive.

891
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,540
I can't stand it.

892
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:29,060
But that's the way they're so they're they're spelled publicly around here and many other places, too.

893
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,620
It's become a common parlance.

894
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,540
And you want to avoid common parlance is where we can.

895
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,580
They look like the gesture in the Batman movies.

896
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,360
Common parlance is due.

897
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,400
The gesture.

898
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,220
Wait a minute.

899
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:42,640
Wait a minute.

900
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:42,900
Wait a minute.

901
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,980
Was there a gesture in Batman?

902
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,600
Was that like the less the Joker wannabe?

903
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,140
I think he's messing with our brains.

904
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,540
Yeah, I think it was something to do with Larry Flynn.

905
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,900
OK, was it the one played by Cesar Romero or by Don Rickles?

906
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,440
Don Rickles.

907
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,100
OK, now there was the Riddler that was played by.

908
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,100
What's his name?

909
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,400
The other mimic dude who had in parentheses before his name, presumptive erstwhile.

910
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,160
I don't know.

911
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,400
I don't know.

912
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:13,400


913
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,460
You know, there's some kind of water bound name like that, like like Christ wagon or

914
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,640
dingleberry or something that made more sense.

915
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,160
Batman's archenemy dingleberry.

916
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,060
And then.

917
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,980
Could you do dingleberries voice very softly so nobody can hear it?

918
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,880
Go ahead.

919
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,880
OK.

920
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,980
Yeah, I am.

922
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,800
Dingleberry.

923
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,720
Barry.

924
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,940
No, I can't do it.

925
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,880
Robin, Robin, click to the bat pole.

926
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,000
No, Master Wayne, don't take young Dick with you if it's to be dangerous.

927
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,380
You know I love young Dick, or Grayson, or whatever his name is.

928
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,180
Robin, you know, the boy in the tight.

929
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,020
Well, the boy in his underpants with those green underpants he runs around in.

930
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,300
His legs, oh my God, I love them.

931
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,480
Now, about that bat pole, Robin.

932
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,880
Let's slide slowly down that and climb into the Batmobile.

933
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,660
And after a little while, we'll take off and fight this Dingleberry character.

934
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,400
I can hardly wave, Batman.

935
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,000
You know, most of the Batman movies have been really stupid.

936
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,220
And the one with Robin was the worst.

937
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,020
They kept Robin out of it.

938
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,440
They kept it wisely until the fourth of that middle Batman series.

939
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,540
I like the Chris Nolan Batman ones.

940
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:51,160
Some people don't, but I can discount their opinions because they're not on Facebook enough.

941
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,740
I hate them all.

942
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,580
With a vigorous, robust passion that will not be requited.

943
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:03,440
I can't stand superheroes, whether it's Batman, Plastic Man, Superman, any man or woman.

944
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,000
I hate them.

945
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,160
I don't know.

946
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,340
They give me the skivvotch.

947
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,000
Well, did you?

948
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,160
Did you ever read the comic books when you were a kid?

949
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,300
Yes, I did.

950
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,500
I think that's where the movie started.

951
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,680
Didn't you wish they'd make a movie of that stuff?

952
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,780
No.

953
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,520
Oh.

954
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,960
About three quarters of the way through the comic books, I wanted to think about how much I hated them.

955
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,160
Just think of, like, what's Superman's real name?

956
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,060
Clark Kent.

957
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:29,740
Clark Kent.

958
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,060
And the Daily Planet.

959
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,460
Superman?

960
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:31,820
Please.

961
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,280
I had this vigorous, robust fear and hatred of the Daily Planet.

962
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,400
The Daily Planet.

963
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,980
Every time I read it, I'm like, oh, my God.

964
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,140
Scenes.

965
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,760
They would show scenes.

966
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,720
I'd be a little jealous of them talking to Perry White or whatever.

967
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,180
Yeah.

968
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,360
Great Caesar's ghost.

969
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,380
I'm turning into Hal already.

970
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,940
Hal's coming soon, and I'm getting the pre-vibes off Hal.

971
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,480
Well, I remember on a recent program, a recent hour of Slack, you included bits from the movie Hail Caesar.

972
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,540
Yeah.

973
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,300
Where can you get that?

974
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,280
Now, that's the kind of stuff I like.

975
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,000
Well, that's the Coen Brothers' most recent motion.

976
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,060
It's a movie about making movies in the 40s.

977
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,240
And it's a really, really funny movie.

978
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,380
You would love it, Dave.

979
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,600
The bad guys in it are communist Hollywood writers.

980
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:31,260
And the actors they pick to be the gang of Hollywood communist writers are so perfectly typecast.

981
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,080
It's like walking into a real-life room full of communist writers.

982
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:35,880
It is.

983
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,680
It is.

984
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,500
It's just such a...

985
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,000
And it's funny.

986
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,900
You know, it's actually a very, very...

987
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,060
I mean, hey, it's Coen Brothers.

988
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,760
Come on.

989
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,980
You can't go wrong with those guys.

990
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,480
But yeah, the scene where the rabbi just goes,

991
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,980
The reason you're confused, young man, is that both these men are all screwballs.

992
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,440
Like, ah, I know how he feels.

993
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,700
Well, he's a god of love now.

994
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,480
Your god doesn't love anybody.

995
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,260
Oh, incorrect.

996
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,560
He likes Jews.

997
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,220
That was a...

998
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,560
Great.

999
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,900
Great little scene.

1000
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,260
I just had to share it so that...

1001
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,020
Regardless of his...

1002
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,800
Regardless of his parentage.

1003
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,140
Yeah, right, right.

1004
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,780
Yeah, the Christ, regardless of his parentage.

1005
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,120
It was beautifully written.

1006
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,740
A little six-minute scene.

1007
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,080
Yeah.

1008
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,500
So, you know, that's a movie that you can find out...

1009
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,320
It's out now in the red box and here and there.

1010
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,260
Oh, boy.

1011
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:34,900
I'm so...

1012
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,760
I was so stupid.

1013
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,420
I missed it.

1014
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:36,900
I'm sorry.

1015
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,760
Well, I haven't gone to a...

1016
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,580
I didn't realize how I'd heard of it before.

1017
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,660
I haven't gone to a theater to see a movie in about two years now.

1018
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,520
Mm-hmm.

1019
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
We didn't go to the movies.

1020
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,480
We watched them at home.

1021
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,960
And consequently, our theater, our neighborhood theater closed.

1022
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


1023
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,180
Yeah.

1024
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,400
So did the bookstore.

1025
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,120
The bookstore closed, too.

1026
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Because everybody was, you know, downloading their books.

1027
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,200
We did go there and we bought books.

1028
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,840
We can't say that we didn't patronize our bookstore.

1029
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,820
I had to drive 30 miles to a bookstore the other day.

1030
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,240
And I had to drive 30 miles to a music store where they had actual musical instruments.

1031
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,660
Because now the musical instrument stores in this area are all like you walk into this empty room

1032
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,420
and the guy got, well, they're all online.

1033
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,720
Come on over by the screen here and I'll see what we can find for you.

1034
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,520
No, man.

1035
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,100
I wanted to put my hand on a guitar.

1036
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,440
I wanted to look at it and, you know, smell it and everything.

1037
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,540
I didn't want to go and look at an internet guitar.

1038
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,360
No.

1039
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:35,500
No.

1040
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,680
Picture of a guitar.

1041
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,580
You want to see a guitar?

1042
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,940
Dave, Dave, come on now.

1043
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,400
People don't play guitars on a guitar anymore.

1044
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,820
They play guitar on their phone now.

1045
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,420
You don't need a guitar.

1046
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,040
You get it.

1047
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,000
I've got a guy.

1048
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,480
Want me to turn on Garage Band?

1049
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,000
I'll play a bunch of riffs.

1050
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,340
No, we don't have time.

1051
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,420
Yeah.

1052
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,900
We'd be like Fart Piano anyway.

1053
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,540
We'd get too.

1054
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,380
Exactly.

1055
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,120
Fart Piano.

1056
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:04,080
Now, speaking of which, at X Day, well, we thought Doctors for Wotan were going to play.

1057
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,620
That was the band that Philo.

1058
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,980
I started and then we dragged other people in like our current wives.

1059
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:19,600
But Philo and Mrs. Drummond, Chaosmic Bobcat, can't come to X Day because they're moving.

1060
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,300
They'll be coming to every X Day after that.

1061
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:23,960
Wait.

1062
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,480
Oh, God.

1063
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,280
I hate saying that.

1064
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,320
Forget I said that.

1065
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:26,680
Anyway.

1066
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,900
So, Princess, we can't have Doctors for Wotan, but we can have Poo Water Towel, which is

1067
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,820
the name of the thing in our basement right now.

1068
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:42,300
Now, and the band that Princess Wee and I formed every time we have a song to do.

1069
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:42,580
The Mando Retardo Band.

1070
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,100
Well, I wish that the Mando Retardo Band could be there, but you'd have to be there.

1071
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,600
Yes, I'd have to be in fully, I'd have to be in trim, limb, limb, pim, bim, bim, fighting

1072
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
condition too.

1073
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:57,960
Yeah.

1074
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,180
Yeah.

1075
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:05,200
And Dave, well, our listeners don't know, but Dave was in the hospital a couple of weeks

1076
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,560
ago.

1077
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:05,820


1078
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,220
But he's better.

1079
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,540
He's been set back.

1080
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,300
They told him he had to stay home and take his pills.

1081
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,600
He's on the mend.

1082
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,760
But it was a physical, this time it was a physical problem.

1083
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,340
It wasn't the usual thing that puts Dave in the hospital, where he comes out with that

1084
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,360
stained white gown that he wears for five years afterwards.

1085
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,220
That's how most people saw Dave.

1086
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,940
And they don't even know where it came from.

1087
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,800
I'm wondering if they're using like, you know, quote, new, unquote, weapons.

1088
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,380
What's the crease doing on the top of my forehead now?

1089
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,060
Where did this come from all of a sudden?

1090
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,200
Don't blame me.

1091
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,620
I voted for Bob Button from the last election.

1092
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,480
Remember when like you impended to your forehead?

1093
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,920
That's where the crease comes from.

1094
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,380
Oh, you mean the old age stuff?

1095
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,760
No, no, not the old age stuff.

1096
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,120
That's something completely different.

1097
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:05,160
I'm talking about a fresh new crease that shows no sign of going away and no rhythm

1098
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,500
unknown.

1099
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,960
Meaning in the last hundreds or encumbrance.

1100
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,460
Was that a crease that was done over a trepanation hole?

1101
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,200
It looks like that.

1102
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,260
Yeah, like a trepanation, like it was a poorly done trepanation.

1103
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:24,260
You could find a palm and forehead reader to read your lifeline on your head, your headline.

1104
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,360
I was hoping there would be some sort of opportunity like that.

1105
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:28,800
Sure.

1106
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,800
At Starwood.

1107
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,960
Oh, yeah.

1108
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:31,360
Yeah.

1109
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,640
Lots of people will read your phrenologists or all over.

1110
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,560
There's like three or four.

1111
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,160
Phrenology workshops, right?

1112
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:37,900
Minimum.

1113
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,900
That's coming back in style, right?

1114
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,360
Mm-hmm.

1115
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,380
Alternate medicine.

1116
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,200
Head bump feeling.

1117
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:43,940
Mm-hmm.

1118
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,160
You can tell who's got criminal tendencies just by looking at the bumps on their head.

1119
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,240
Well, that's what Les Cargo thought.

1120
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:56,640
Does everybody have enough of these criminal bumps to make a good diagnosis?

1121
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,540
Oh, good old Les Cargo.

1122
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,180
I remember him well.

1123
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,200
Did you go to junior high with him, too?

1124
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:03,980
Yeah, I did.

1125
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,220
Princess Wee gets around.

1126
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,240
She is famous.

1127
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,620
He's eating snails with Donald Rumpel and whatever his name is.

1128
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,880
How did you meet Donald Trump?

1129
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,240
Was he from Cleveland Heights originally?

1130
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,000
Princess Wee isn't from Cleveland Heights.

1131
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,960
Or Warren or Broadview.

1132
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,140
Oh, she went to a fancy schmancy private school for rich kids, just like Trump did.

1133
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:34,360
But Trump, he likes to say he went to military school.

1134
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,800
Actually, he went to a correctional.

1135
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,660
He went to a correctional institution for wayward rich boys.

1136
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,300
Mm-hmm.

1137
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:47,620
But no, before he got kicked out of the junior high, that's how Princess Wee got that letter passed to her, warning her about him.

1138
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,240
Right.

1139
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:48,920
Yeah.

1140
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,100
It really said Donnie was cute?

1141
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,180
I thought that it said Jim was cute, and then the Donald Duck thing was, oh.

1142
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,640
No, no, it was Donnie that was cute.

1143
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,180
He's so cute.

1144
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,420
That duck he wears on his head, it's just so charming and cute and sweet.

1145
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,580
Ha ha ha!

1146
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:15,260
Okay, we have to think about going in about a minute, because I do have one Rudy Schwartz project song.

1147
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:16,680
Full frontal plug.

1148
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,680
I think it's been very silly lately, and I would like to offer my sincere kudos to the most recent things.

1149
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,080
Some of them I thought were just quite engorging.

1150
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,360
They certainly turn into brain worms.

1151
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:35,160
You should have heard Princess Wee last week warbling Ted Cruz's mouth.

1152
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,660
Now, the radio listeners didn't hear Ted Cruz's mouth.

1153
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,480
They heard a different Rudy Schwartz song.

1154
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,900
The internet version has Ted Cruz's mouth at the very end.

1155
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:47,660
Yeah.

1156
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:57,360
So, we must go now and play this opening cut from Full Frontal Klugman, which features a famous star doing a guest voice on it.

1157
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,100
Yee-haw!

1158
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,080
Mr. Klugman?

1159
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,060
Well, no.

1160
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,460
No, but someone almost as...

1161
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,160
Lumpy.

1162
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,300
Let's see.

1163
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,620
Which one of these machines would that be?

1164
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,620
Klug, klug, klug, klug, klug, klug, klug.

1165
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,200
Okay, good night, Dave.

1166
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,540
Good night, Mom.

1167
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,960
See you, Dave.

1168
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,580
See you soon.

1169
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,600
Keep care of your bosoms, lady.

1170
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,860
Give you a little kiss on the forehead and tuck you in and tell you a story.

1171
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,540
The end.

1172
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,660
Fresh Hoganberry Pie.

1173
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,300
Complete sexual satisfaction.

1174
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,060
Full Frontal Klugman.

1175
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,800
Superior handling and fuel economy.

1176
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,420
Full Frontal Klugman?

1177
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,860
Similar squirrel calls fetch $25 on eBay.

1178
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,120
Full Frontal Klugman.

1179
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,180
Heavy industrial lubricants.

1180
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,960
Residue.

1181
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,200
A 50-foot cylinder of living muscle tissue.

1182
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,140
Supply.

1183
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,380
Boarded by pitchfork-shaped trestles.

1184
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,380
Are you listening, Grandma?

1185
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,380
Full Frontal Klugman.

1186
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,180
Walter Brennan with a generous bifurcated reservoir tip.

1187
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,200
That's for puke from people like you.

1188
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,400
The Rudy Schwartz Project presents Full Frontal Klugman.

1189
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,740
Available now from DC Jam Records.

1190
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,300
I'll flash my cock if you burn your draft card.

1191
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,500
Rondo Hatton was a friend of mine.

1192
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,520
You're no Rondo Hatton.

1193
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,640
You don't show me what you're doing.

1194
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,040
B-O-B.

1195
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,500
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1196
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:52,760
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1197
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,840
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1198
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,340
But if you truly love Bob.

1199
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,280
And want some of this.

1200
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,900
And want some of that slack back to rebound to you.

1201
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,860
You should go to subgenius.com front page.

1202
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,360
Or especially the radio page.

1203
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,320
Or the catalog store pages.

1204
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,720
And help out financially as best you can.

1205
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,080
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty.

1206
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,740
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1207
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,660
But some of you still have jobs.

1208
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,980
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1209
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,000
Even if it's only once a month.

1210
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,600
From enough of you.

1211
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,980
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1212
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,300
All we're saying is that

1213
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,760
Blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1214
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,360
We also take checks and money orders to

1215
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,240
Subgenius Foundation.
