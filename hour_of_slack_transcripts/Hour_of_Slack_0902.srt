00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
When the Security Council of the United Nations met Bob Dobbs in New York,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,920
radio faced the task of broadcasting its historic sessions.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,580
Few listeners had the time to devote to a meeting of six or seven hours.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,520
This station therefore prepared a specially condensed version.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,140
The subgenius hour of swag.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,400
The tape was then edited down to our show.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,380
It was then re-recorded and finally broadcast at night

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,320
when the largest audience could listen.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,960
The program became so popular that the station was requested to release it to the United Nations

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,940
so that they could broadcast it themselves, thereby providing another source of income.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,860
For the value of radio time is judged by the amount of goods it sells to the public.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,300
This is independent radio in a democracy.

That's all, that's pretty dumb.

Bob?

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,540
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende, Limor.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,060
After sterilizing all of the little children by the fire

49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,340
and making sure that they were safe,

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,820
and making sure they'd never make babies with big orange heads like them,

51
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,720
we commenced to sing a song.

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,700
Old Uncle Floppy was the head clown,

53
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,240
and believe me, the children just loved him.

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,960
The sores were still bright and burning,

55
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,940
and there weren't very many things they could say.

56
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,680
Many of the tongues had been removed.

57
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,140
But he was... Uncle Floppy was so great.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,040
He was so great.

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,980
Everybody loved Uncle Floppy.

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,260
He talked about Bob and the Church of the Subgenius.

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh, he...

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,520
He talked about the law, or whatever that...

63
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,180
He talked about...

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,260
And they hit each other and threw pies,

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,860
and then knocked each other down,

66
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,900
and they were little and funny, and...

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
And they sang in a cacophonous sound.

68
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,880
It was like the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz.

69
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,360
Oh, a troll.

70
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,840
It kept you from talking.

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,500
That was the best thing about it.

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,320
Those clowns, they just...

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
They kept you from...

74
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,640
Hanging on, man.

75
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,860
From having to talk.

76
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,760
They just filled everything up...

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,440
They stopped you from believing, man.

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,780
...with fun.

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,580
That's what's wrong with you now, man.

80
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,240
The cork's out.

81
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,540
You're evacuated.

82
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,960
All the belief is gone, man.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,860
You've got no more belief left to go.

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,440
Come on, buddy.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,640
Buck up.

86
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,800
There's just three more miles.

87
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,660
Bob said,

88
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,340
Believe me out of it, dude.

89
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,940
Bob said a lot of things that didn't make any damn difference to anybody.

90
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,860
He was a liar then.

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,760
He's a liar now.

92
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,820
He's just perfected his lying arts.

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,860
His ability to deceive and confuse.

94
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,660
But he was honest about it.

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,480
I suppose if you bold-faced lie,

96
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,220
and then you confuse and deceive behind the scenes,

97
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


98
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


99
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


100
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


101
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


102
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


103
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


104
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


105
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


106
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,220


107
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,340
and then you say,

108
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,460
I didn't say that's what you're doing,

109
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,200
then say you're not,

110
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,160
because it's like the lion's sister in the mountain,

111
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,960
and the two of them were stuck together at the mid-drift hemispheres.

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,640
It's like that.

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
But if not, it's...

114
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,860
Well, no.

115
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,440
I mean, often, when he was a salesman, he always just dressed his best.

116
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,000
But when he would go out and preach,

117
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,620
he had the word liar written in thick magic marker across his forehead.

118
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,580
But nobody paid attention to that, man.

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
They looked at his shoes, man.

120
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,940
They were so shiny and bright.

121
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,280
No, they thought that was part of his message.

122
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,460
They thought that was what guaranteed that he was telling the truth.

123
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,880
That's serious.

124
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,100
Because he was the one guy that had liar written across his forehead.

125
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,940
It guaranteed the laughs.

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,260
It kept the small force going.

127
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,420
It'd make things bright.

128
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
But no, no, man.

129
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,340
It was the shoes.

130
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,920
Do you remember?

131
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,400
They were shiny.

132
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,280
No matter what he did, though,

133
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,340
he kept losing ratings to Rush Limbaugh.

134
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,120
Yeah, and he kept on...

135
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
They just...

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
They went for the subtle approach,

137
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,940
rather than the direct, honest approach.

138
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,840
And then after the third year, he kept on gaining...

139
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,320
Dishonesty.

140
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,340
...radium, and then he was more dishonest.

141
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,420
And the next thing you know,

142
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,020
he had taken over the clear channels all over the places.

143
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,240
He was the one.

144
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,040
He was the one, man.

145
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,740
The big, big, big one.

146
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,060
I...

147
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,060


148
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,380
Speaking of big ones,

149
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,060
I was looking through some article in some paper

150
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,760
about local radio stations,

151
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,840
and it turned out that they were all owned...

152
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,620
All 20 or so stations were owned by only three different people,

153
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,740
who also are the same ones who own that many stations...

154
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,540
The Puppet Meister.

155
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,460
...in every city...

156
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes.

157
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,300
...in every town,

158
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,880
in every planet.

159
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,660
We know who the puppeteer is.

160
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,960
It's Rupert, baby.

161
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Rupert is the puppeteer.

162
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,120
You know, man.

163
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,760
He pulled the strings.

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,920
He make the man dance.

165
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,660
No, if you know his name,

166
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,160
then that's not the puppeteer.

167
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,740
That's only one of the puppets.

168
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,080
For his name shall not be named,

169
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,020
his name shall not be known.

170
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,020


171
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,940
Somebody owns Rupi.

172
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,780
You can't follow the strings up that far.

173
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,680
No, man.

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,320
It'd be easy to cut them if you could.

175
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,500
If you'd like to know the real truth,

176
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,740
the strings go on beyond this planetary sphere.

177
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,180
They go way, way, way, way out there.

178
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,420
Well, they're very sophisticated,

179
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,360
because now they have puppets that can work puppets.

180
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,700
You see.

181
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,720
You don't know how many puppets down the line you are.

182
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,620
There's not...

183
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,900
Notice, you're not running a marionette right now.

184
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,080
Can you fly this plane and land it?

185
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,500
Shirley, you can't be serious.

186
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,840
I am serious.

187
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,360
And don't call me Shirley.

188
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,840
I am Shirley.

189
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,180
We're all Shirley, aren't we?

190
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,400
I am Shirley.

191
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


192
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


193
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


194
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


195
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


196
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


197
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


198
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,700
I am Shirley.

199
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,260
And I am Shirley?

200
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,120
Oh, my gosh.

201
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,940
Oh, my goodbye,

202
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,160
Steve.

203
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,060


204
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,060


205
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,060

207
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,180
You are listening to the voice of Lemuria Radio Service.

208
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,280
Attention. May I have your attention please?

209
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:23,100
This regularly scheduled program has been interrupted to bring you the inaugural broadcast of the voice of Lemuria Radio Service.

210
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:33,800
My name is Captain Willard Vroom, commander of the Lemurian airship Spirit of St. Elmo, the flagship broadcasting platform of the voice of Lemuria.

211
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:44,360
Currently cruising at 65,000 feet above the Pacific Rim, the Spirit of St. Elmo is beating this broadcast into conspiracy occupied territories.

212
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:53,080
The voice of Lemuria Radio Service brings you information and entertainment unavailable in conspiracy controlled media outlets.

213
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,560
This lack of worthwhile news and music should be evident to all but the most dim-witted mass media consumer.

214
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:09,360
You have been consistently lied to and force-fed bland idiotic fare in the form of pop culture and infotainment.

215
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,760
Many are the forces that would keep you ignorant and bored.

216
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,820
Heartless, soulless corporations grubbing for yet more money.

217
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,040
Sinister, vampire-like government entities seeking to further their hidden agendas.

218
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,080
Cags, and other things that are not in the system.

219
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,860
Flesh-fattened, Texas-based religious cults attempting to expand their sales of t-shirts and marital aids.

220
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,800
All of these groups would deceive you to achieve their own twisted goals.

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,340
But no more.

222
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,560
The voice of Lemuria is now available to bring you the true sounds of liberty.

223
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,640
We offer you the unvarnished truth about the nature of reality and how you can use it.

224
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,180
Break the bonds of ignorance and satisfy your own wants and desires and twisted needs.

225
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,800
The voice of Lemuria can help you achieve all of this.

226
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,380
Lemuria represents the last unsullied territory in this area of the cosmos.

227
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:10,440
It is the final hope for all those who realize that the general situation has gone way past what can be considered tolerable.

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,240
The voice of Lemuria offers you truth and hope through information and entertainment.

229
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
But enough of that for now.

230
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,100
I'll be back later with further information.

231
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,980
For now, just sit back, relax, and enjoy.

232
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm a man of the world.

233
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
I was born in the land of war.

234
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,700
I try to be a hero.

235
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,780
But the warriors let me wait.

236
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,880
Maybe...

237
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,180
...I was wrong.

238
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,440
Maybe...

239
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,500
...they can arrive.

240
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,580
You are listening to the voice of Lemuria Radio Service.

241
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,140
Lemuria Radio Service

242
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,240
Lemuria Radio Service

243
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,160
What the hell are you looking at?

244
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,160


245
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,180
Lemuria Radio Service

246
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,180


247
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,180


248
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,180


249
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,180


250
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,180


251
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,560
My TV is a watchin' me.

252
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,780
My TV is a watchin' me.

253
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,060
L. Ron Hubbard is a messin' with me.

254
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,340
The bats are flyin', baby.

255
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,260
Can't you see?

256
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,520
All the CBS I is watchin' me.

257
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,160
I never ever had a problem.

258
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,160


259
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,160


260
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,820
need my lithium, baby, can't you see?

261
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,860
Oh, yeah.

262
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,660
My TV is watching me.

263
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, my TV is watching me.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,360
You know, a solar flex ain't nothing but a very expensive hat rack, baby.

265
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,140
Oh, and my goal in life is to be picking my nose on TV because my TV is watching me.

266
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,740
I can't find my remote.

267
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,400
I can't find my remote.

268
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,360
I don't know where it's going.

269
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,080
My TV is watching me.

270
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,260
I see Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie.

271
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,260
Malcolm X is a hat.

272
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,780
Martin Luther King is a street.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
My TV is watching me.

274
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,620
I was a branch of Missouri and I was hooked on phonics.

275
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,700
My name's Carbuncle Jones and I'm supersonic.

276
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,040
I see the one, two, three faces of Bob.

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,620
I see the one, two, three faces of Bob.

278
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,380
Bob and the replacements.

279
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,980
Bob the subgenius.

280
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,860
Bob.

281
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,980
Bob.

282
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,700
Bob on three pieces.

283
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,480
Everybody sing.

284
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,800
My TV is watching me.

285
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,960
My TV is watching me.

286
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,280
I got Latter Day Saints messing with me.

287
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,120
They knock it on my door.

288
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,280
Won't let me in.

289
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,740
My TV is watching me.

290
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,140
Well, the outcasts will be heard.

291
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,680
You gotta speak the truth.

292
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,300
Make the weak and the greedy.

293
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,160
It's crap in their pants.

294
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,020
Oh, we can.

295
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,480
The greed of crap in your pants.

296
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,500
Oh, my TV is watching me.

297
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,140
Break me my lithium.

298
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,660
Break me my lithium.

299
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,120
My TV is watching me.

300
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,480
My TV is watching me.

301
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,540
My TV is watching me.

302
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,800
Take your eyes off of me, man.

303
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
Take your eyes off of me.

304
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,020
I have seen the beach I've been dreaming of.

305
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,580
You said it!

306
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:01,740
You said where to go.

307
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,100
You hadственно, babadum, chinala!

308
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,380
My harder words of love yourself sleep on the line,

309
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,000
no, you, who's that mother fucker you're notON

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,940
oh, Christ!

311
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,220
pathetic man!

312
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,200
fino!

313
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,540
You had your activate that love during sex.

314
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,780
That sexy facultum!

315
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,880
team of technical wizards are still in the process of fine-tuning the St. Elmo's high-powered

316
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:29,560
equipment to bring you the optimum in broadcasting quality. Similarly, once the expansive broadcast

317
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,220
studios and luxurious guest quarters have been fully refurbished, we will be expanding our

318
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,140
repertoire of entertainment and information to the finest level attainable, including original

319
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:48,180
musical programming, the trenchant and biting political commentary of There He Is, and perhaps

320
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,960
even trained chimpanzees on roller skates. For now, we are proud to present nostalgic entertainment

321
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:02,780
from yesteryear, from the classic radio serial genre, Porgy and Mudhead in High School Madness.

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,120
Porgy, die above.

323
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,300
Porgy, die above.

324
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
Like me?

325
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,580
Just a student like you.

326
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,100
Just a student like you.

327
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,540
Hey, doll, come and get it. Your clam cakes are getting damp.

328
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,020
Ten-four, Eleanor.

329
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,480
Whew!

330
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,860
Defoliating a victory garden certainly

331
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,120
works.

332
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,860
It works up an appetite.

333
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,740
You sit down, Father, and dig right in.

334
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,860
That's right. This afternoon, I'll be able to start digging the pit. If I can get some

335
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,460
work out of that boy of yours, I can have the bunker finished by election day. Where

336
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,520
is Porgy, anyway?

337
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,180
He's up in his room, helping Parson and make it to bed.

338
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh, Porgy! Oh, Father! Oh, Father! Oh, I can't! Oh, I can't talk about you!

339
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,340
You can't! You can't come in, Mother!

340
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,260
He's so good with the servants, Frank.

341
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,120
Stop calling me.

342
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,460
Stop calling me, Fred. My name's Adolph.

343
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,500
Bob's away, Dad.

344
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,560
Morning, Mom.

345
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,240
Oh, hot dog!

346
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,340
Roast cakes again.

347
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,660
Heavy on the 30-weight, Mom.

348
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,900
Don't! Don't eat with your hands, son. Use your entrenching tool.

349
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,080
Oh, gee, Dad, I'm just trying to save time.

350
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
It isn't every day a guy graduates from high school.

351
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,240
How many times have I heard that before?

352
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,920
Well, you boys fight it out among yourselves.

353
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,820
Okay, Mother.

354
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,600
Oh, my God!

355
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,140
Oh, my God!

356
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,100
Oh, my God!

357
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,100


358
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,980
I've got to dress for my bridge club.

359
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,540
Gee, Mom, isn't that bridge built yet?

360
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,420
No, son.

361
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,340
And it won't be until free hands on both sides of the big ditch

362
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,100
can press the same button at the same time.

363
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,140
Okay, Dad, I give.

364
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,260
Oh, boy, can I eat my breakfast now?

365
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,740
Only if you stay out of trouble, boy.

366
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,880
Your shenanigans could cost me this election.

367
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,260
Oh, come on, Dad.

368
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,520
No Irishman can stop you from getting the big dog killer this time.

369
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,700
You're a natural.

370
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,860
Don't wolf your food.

371
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, oh, there's Mudhead.

372
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,060
Congratulations, here I come.

373
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,460
So long, Dad.

374
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Keep flying.

375
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,320
Oh, that son of mine.

376
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,000
He's not your son, Fred.

377
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,260
Stop torturing me, Ethel.

378
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Come on, step on it, Mudhead.

379
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh, I'd love to, Porgy, but I got my two toes through the floorboard already.

380
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,340
Well, okay, then we could take the shortcut through Frogtown.

381
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,460
All right, we could stop off at Pops and dig some jugs.

382
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,980
Some what?

383
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,980
Oh, that Louise Wong's got a balcony you could use Shakespeare from.

384
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,280
Oh, not now, Mudhead.

385
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,480
They need me at the last meeting of the Philatelist Club.

386
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,920
I didn't know you were an oscillator.

387
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,500
Aw, creepies, Mudhead.

388
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,580
Where's your school spirit?

389
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,780
That's in the rumble seat.

390
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,320
You want to snort?

391
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,820
Oh, very funny.

392
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,560
Snort, who is it?

393
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,900
Gee, everybody at Moore Science High has an extracurricular activity but you.

394
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,040
Well, then will Louise count?

395
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,900
Only to ten, Mudhead.

396
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,660
You know, that's just it.

397
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,500
Just what?

398
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,220
Well, we're the leaders of tomorrow.

399
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,840
Yeah, but it's today.

400
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,260
Well, yeah, but what are you going to do tomorrow after we graduate?

401
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,960
Oh, well, I thought maybe I'd go out and find a bunch of guys.

402
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,460
That's like all around.

403
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,100
What?

404
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,900
I'm going to pick up a couple of girls.

405
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,660
Oh, is that all you think about picking up things?

406
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,200
Golly, Mudhead.

407
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,440
Don't you remember what Principal Poop put down at the pep rally yesterday?

408
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
Principal Poop?

409
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,700
P-E-P-E-P.

410
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,520
Moore.

411
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,180
Pep pills.

412
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,340
Pep pills.

413
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,240
Pep pills.

414
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,240
Pep pills.

415
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,140
Pep pills.

416
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,760
Pep pills.

417
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,180
Pep pills.

418
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,580
Pep pills.

419
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:06,960
Pep pills.

420
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:06,980


421
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,500
Pep pills.

422
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,660
Pep pills.

423
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,280
Pep pills.

424
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,520
Pep pills.

425
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,980
Pep pills.

426
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:08,980


427
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,060
Pep pills.

428
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,660
Yeah!

429
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,920
Pep pills!

430
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,660
Say something.

431
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,940
Thank you, fellow kids.

432
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,980
Quiet.

433
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,240
In addressing for the assembly this morning,

434
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,180
Thank you.

435
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,160
Thank you.

436
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,820
I am recalling the words of the founder of Moore Science High School,

437
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Yucaipa Heap,

438
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,100
who pressed the first bricks with his own hands.

439
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,660
Who cares?

440
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,940
familial

441
00:19:52,340 --> 00:20:11,080
There's some bas société, and that's quite far away, but you know it.

442
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,360
Okay, so come on, kids.

443
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,220
Line up, sign up, and re-enlist today.

444
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,100
Because we need more schooling for more students for more science high.

445
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Thank you.

446
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,860
So you see, Mudhead, it's like the pooper said.

447
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,720
Said, with counter-subversive educational priorities the way they are,

448
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,560
well, it really helps our side to re-enlist.

449
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,380
Is that what you're going to do?

450
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,280
Oh, hell no.

451
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,820
Right after I graduate, I'm going to cut the soles off my shoes,

452
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,180
sit in a tree, and learn to play the flute.

453
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,820
Hey, look, buddy.

454
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,520
Watch it.

455
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,440
Where are you going to graduate from?

456
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,660
Holy Mudhead mackerel.

457
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,360
More science high.

458
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
It's disappeared.

459
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

460
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,120
One, one, dollar, dollar.

461
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,080
Isolation, seclusion, paranoia.

462
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,820
Always looking over your shoulder to see if you're being watched.

463
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,080
And always keeping alert.

464
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,160
Waiting for your chance to finally make contact.

465
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,320
These are the anxieties I know firsthand,

466
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,160
because I was a cultist for the ATF.

467
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,040
From actual court testimony and declassified government records

468
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,320
comes the unusual story of Joseph Mama,

469
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,300
undercover agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

470
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,880
This is the real-life drama of Agent Mama,

471
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,920
who for nine fantastic years served America from deep within

472
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,400
one of her most feared and notorious cults.

473
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,260
I was a cultist for the ATF.

474
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,500
I was a cultist for the ATF.

475
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,560
When you pose as a cultist for the ATF, you're on guard constantly,

476
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,940
always wondering if the church leadership suspects you.

477
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,500
You can never relax, never forget who you are and what you do.

478
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,320
You must always stay alert, so you never make a slip,

479
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
never do or say anything wrong.

480
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,140
This is all part of my nine years as a cult member

481
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,480
in the dreaded Church of the Subgenius.

482
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,240
In a moment, you will hear one of the many stories

483
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,860
from the files of Joseph Mama,

484
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,360
undercover agent for the ATF.

485
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,560
And now, a story based on the real-life adventures of Joseph Mama,

486
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,160
undercover agent for the ATF.

487
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,200
When you're an undercover agent for the ATF,

488
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,360
you live the life of a spy.

489
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,980
You trust no one, tell nobody what you're really doing,

490
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,240
not even your own family.

491
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,580
And hanging over you every minute is the threat of exposure,

492
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,060
of being found out.

493
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,100
You know what that can mean, so you stay on your guard.

494
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,520
But still, you can't cover everything.

496

T

504
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,160
the station tonight. Joe, when are you going to come to your senses and break away from

505
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,700
this horrible outfit and... Mama, Mama. And move back home with the rest of us? Mama,

506
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,460
we've been through all this before. But those people are crazy. That man who was here, his

507
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,880
hair was wild and dirty. He looked dangerous. I'm a seitan or whatever his name was. I'm

508
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,560
a seitan. Ivan Stang, was that his name? Yes, that was it. Stang. Are you sure? Are you

509
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,740
sure that was his name? Yes, I'm sure. Joe, you're not in some kind of trouble, are you?

510
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,080
Trouble? Of course not, Mama. I gotta go now. I'll be calling you later. Bye.

511
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,800
Ivan Stang, Mr. Big himself. I didn't know what had brought him to town, let alone to

512
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,520
my parents' place, but it had me worried. Stang was a self-proclaimed sacred scribe

513
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,500
of the church. He had written many of its most bizarre teachings. The idea that the

514
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,800
subgeniuses were persecuted by some sort of conspiracy. The notion that church members

515
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,720
were masterminds.

516
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,920
The idea that the church was a race destined to rule normal human beings. The mad dream

517
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,460
that Bob Dobbs would one day rise from the dead to take over the world through revolution

518
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,200
and murder. These were all theories from the twisted mind of Ivan Stang. Church prophet,

519
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,960
leader, and executioner all in one. I showed up at the station at 9 p.m. It was a community

520
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,500
radio station that the church had paid off to play their brainwashing radio series. How

521
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,420
Americans could actually listen to that crap made me sick.

522
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,700
But I had to play the part. Three men were waiting in the conference room. Dr. Howe and

523
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,060
St. Jane are hyperclites, I knew, but the third one was a silent stranger with long,

524
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,920
stringy hair.

525
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,500
Joe, glad you could make it. We've been trying to find you all evening, man.

526
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,780
Hey, Howe. I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't get home until early this morning, and Mom

527
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,640
almost forgot to relay the message. Oh, hey, Jane, how's it going?

528
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,460
It was going fine until yesterday afternoon.

529
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,220
Yesterday afternoon? What happened?

530
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,500
Uh, Joe, this is Reverend Stang. He flew in from Dallas last night.

531
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,020
Ivan Stang? The Ivan Stang? Well, of course. It's an honor to meet you, sir. I've always

532
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,260
wanted to. I listen to your show all the time. I think you're great. You really get the word

533
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,540
of Bob out to the masses.

534
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,440
You better shut up and listen carefully. Brother Stang is here on important business. Very

535
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,140
important business.

536
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,440
Yeah, Joe, or Brother Mama. We had a bit of a setback yesterday. You were...

537
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,480
You may want to take a seat at the end of the table.

538
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
What's this all about?

539
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,860
Brother Mama, you said something about getting home early this morning.

540
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
Yeah, so?

541
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,540
Are you sure you even went home?

542
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,760
What do you mean?

543
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,780
Puzzling evidence was waiting outside your home all day in a parked car. He just phoned

544
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,680
and said you still hadn't shown up.

545
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,700
Hey, look, what's this all about? What difference does it matter what time I got home? And what's

546
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,640
the idea of having puzzlers spying on me?

547
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,440
That's enough, Brother. Just calm down. There's no reason for you to get excited.

548
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,320
I'm not excited about a few questions. Unless, of course, you've got something to hide.

549
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,280
Why all of a sudden the interrogation? Everyone knows the work I've done for the church.

550
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,440
Perhaps we know only part of the work you do, Mama.

551
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,700
Janeer, I'll handle this if you don't mind. Brother Mama, since I know you're wondering,

552
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,460
let me tell you why I'm in town. There seems to be a plumbing problem here. We've been

553
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,980
experiencing a few leaks of information. My job is to find that leak and plug it.

554
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,420
I don't get it. What does this have to do with Mama?

555
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,420


556
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,420


557
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,420


558
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,420


559
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,560
I'm getting to that. But first, tell me what you know about Dobstown.

560
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,460
Dobstown community? Why, it's a private compound. The subgenius church finances to indoctrinate

561
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,360
and brainwash new abductees. Since it's across the border, the government has limited jurisdiction,

562
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,080
of course. Then again, if they knew what we did to the young women and children there,

563
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,140
they'd close us down in a heartbeat. But we're careful. No messages get in or out.

564
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,220
Who knows about the stockpiling of weapons?

565
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,420
Just me, Brother Howe, and you.

566
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,900
Well, and Jane or Hypercleets. And of course you. We didn't want to give the government

567
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,500
any legal grounds to cross the border. But if they had found out about the stolen army

568
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,140
weapons, that would provide them with just such an excuse.

569
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:03,440
Exactly. Only four of us knew. And yet, all four of us have unquestioned loyalty to Bob's

570
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,680
church.

571
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,520
I don't get it, Stang. What are you driving at?

572
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,820
Just this. At 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Dobstown was raided by the ATF and all our

573
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,000
weapons confiscated.

574
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,400
Now they're holding members who have been in the area for years. They're not even in

575
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:14,500
the area.

576
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,580
They're just a bunch of people who they claim want sanctuary from the church. Before you

577
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,360
know it, civil suits will be filed and who knows what other problems will arise as a

578
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,400
result of this raid. All because someone got information about our stolen weapons.

579
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,200
I was caught off guard. I hadn't heard about the raid. I needed time to think. The three

580
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,160
of them sat there, watching for my reaction. The heat was on. I could feel it.

581
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,760
Of all the lousy luck, how did they find out?

582
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,280
We were hoping you might know, Brother.

583
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,400
I sure wish I did. I'm a little bit scared. I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to the

584
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,580
hospital.

585
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,680
I don't see what could have possibly gone wrong.

586
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,980
It would almost seem as if the ATF had been tipped off about it.

587
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,740
Tipped off? No one knew about the weapons except the four of us. Tipped off by whom?

588
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,540
Tipped off by you, you dirty rotten rat.

589
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,100
Now wait a minute, Jaynor.

590
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,820
Mama, the evidence at the moment seems to bear him out.

591
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,140
Evidence? What evidence?

592
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,700
Puzzling evidence. And the process of elimination. It seems highly unlikely that Jaynor Hypercleets

593
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,340
or Brother Howell would be traitors.

594
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,700
They've been in the church for years, almost as long as I.

595
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,700
Well fine, but why pick me?

596
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,440
You're the only other person that knew anything about the guns, and that's the excuse they

597
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,340
used for the raid.

598
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
So I'm elected, eh? Is that it?

599
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm afraid so, unless we get different information from those still under arrest. Meanwhile,

600
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,180
you'll check in at the Bandito Hotel with puzzling evidence. He'll stay with you until

601
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,840
we get all the information necessary to make our decision.

602
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,320
Stay with me? You mean guarding me, that's what you mean, isn't it?

603
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,320


604
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,620
Yeah, you could call it that. Puzzling evidence will be guarding you.

605
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,500
Puzzler and I checked in at the Bandito Hotel about an hour later. I was on the spot and

606
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,360
I knew it. But I did have one advantage. I knew Stang and the others were only guessing.

607
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,280
They had no real proof of my connection with the Bureau. If I could manage to slip a red

608
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:13,240
herring, some other fall guy... A plan began to shape. Somehow, I had to contact the ATF,

609
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,880
and fast.

610
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,960
I got my chance when Puzzler took one of his all-too-rare showers. I waited until he had

611
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,160
the water running, then I eased the phone off the hook very gently and dialed the Bureau

612
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,500
number.

613
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,440
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Toll Free Tip Line, Agent Jackson speaking.

614
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,540
Would you like to turn in a gun owner anonymously?

615
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,860
This is Agent X-1.

616
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:43,860


617
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:43,860


618
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,020
I'm Agent X-1. I'm an assistant to Sergeant X. I'm the head of the

619
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,240
S.Y.Z., the Dobbs Town business.

620
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,940
Oh, you! Sorry we couldn't warn you. They got a shipment of bazookas, so we had to move

621
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,060
in on them. Where are you now?

622
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,420
At Bandito Hotel, Room 417. Look, I need to make contact tonight.

623
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,420
Okay. Where?

624
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,460
Downstairs in the Bandito Grill in about an hour. Puzzling evidence will be

625
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,340
covering me. It'll have to be smooth.

626
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,580
Check. Bandito Grill in one hour. We'll get to you. Be careful now.

627
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,840
Hey, Puzzler, what's the three-letter word for disease-carrying rodent that you use in

628
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:13,840


629
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:13,840


630
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:13,840


631
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,060
that resembles a large mouse.

632
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,800
Hey, how should I know?

633
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,380
Three letters resembling a large, dirty rodent.

634
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,080
Hey, maybe it's the ATF.

635
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,080
Yeah, good guess.

636
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,920
But the first letter is an R.

637
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,420
Oh, gee, I don't know.

638
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,700
I hate those things.

639
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,620
I hate puzzles.

640
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,580
Look, you don't really think I work the lousy ATF, do you?

641
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
It ain't up to me, Joe.

642
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,580
All I'm doing is making sure you stick around

643
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,120
until they make up their minds.

644
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,200
After that, well, I do what they tell me to.

645
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,960
Well, I'll find out tomorrow.

646
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,040
How about something to eat?

647
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,520
You got sandwiches or something?

648
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,840
The grill's open downstairs.

649
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,180
We can get something good there.

650
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,200
Who's buying?

651
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,880
I'll buy.

652
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,120
Well, as long as it's still in the hotel,

653
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,340
I don't see why not.

654
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,620
Wait a second.

655
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,720
37 horizontal.

656
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,660
Slang term for a gullible person who is easily fooled.

657
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,420
Four, five, six letters.

658
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,500
Forget it, Joe.

659
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,700
I don't know nothing about that stuff.

660
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,900
Oh, wait, I got it.

661
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,780
S-U-C-K-E-R.

662
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,500
Sucker.

663
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,300
Okay, puzzler, let's go.

664
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,120
The crossword puzzle was only a blind.

665
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,640
I had folded a piece of notepaper underneath it.

666
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,180
Along with working the puzzle,

667
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,760
I scribbled some quick instructions

668
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,960
to pass along to the bureau

669
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,960
if they were able to make contact.

670
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,560
It was all up to them.

671
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,620
It was a late supper crowd

672
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,840
and the grill was about half full when we walked in.

673
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,580
I took a booth in the corner and ordered some food.

674
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,100
I looked around, trying to spot my contact.

675
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,240
No luck.

676
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,720
Several minutes passed.

677
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,900
Then some blonde number

678
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,720
with a dress so tight it looked painted on

679
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,980
decided we were available.

680
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,060
Hiya, boys.

681
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,980
Mind if a lady sits down?

682
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,060
Why, sure, baby.

683
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,740
Just slide right in beside me.

684
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,020
Nah, you're too anxious.

685
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,480
I'm gonna sit over here by Mr. Woman Hater.

686
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,200
Where do you get the woman hater idea?

687
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,800
How'd you act like it?

688
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,720
You're unfriendly.

689
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,620
You know, you remind me of a fella I saw in the elevator.

690
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,660
He thought he was so cool,

691
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,680
but all the time he was X, Y, Z.

692
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,280
You know, his zipper needed examining.

693
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,200
Oh, I see.

694
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,880
Hey, the music's on.

695
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,020
Stop.

696
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,920
Anybody got some spare change?

697
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,020
Why, sure, baby.

698
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,120
What you wanna hear?

699
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,480
Play some Devo.

700
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,980
I'm crazy about Devo.

701
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,060
Sure thing, darling.

702
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,420
Okay, honey, it's Agent X, Y, Z.

703
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,280
Are you from...

704
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
Sally Dean, Washington office.

705
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,840
I just got transferred here.

706
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,340
What's up?

707
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,340
Plenty.

708
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,940
They've got this goon on me

709
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,720
until they decide whether or not I work for the Bureau.

710
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,780
Hold still.

711
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm slipping a paper into your pocket.

712
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,220
Got it.

713
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,420
He'll be back in a second.

714
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,360
Most of the instructions are on the papers.

715
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,240
Tell them to use Agent Jackson for the frame-up.

716
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,860
My guard will...

717
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,480
We'll recognize him.

718
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,780
Jackson for the frame-up.

719
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,160
Check.

720
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,260
If they stick the coffee shop from 7 o'clock on,

721
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,600
they should intercept Jayner.

722
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,060
The meeting isn't till 8.

723
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,740
Right.

724
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,460
And good luck.

725
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,040
Well, well, well.

726
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,000
Joe Mama.

727
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,780
Uh, Jayner?

728
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,280
Where's Puzzler?

729
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,940
And who's this chick you're with?

730
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,020
She ain't with him.

731
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,920
She's with me.

732
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,240
What are you doing here?

733
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,620
I live upstairs, you blockhead.

734
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,700
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

735
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
This is your hotel.

736
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,880
Where were you just now?

737
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,160
Feeding the jukebox.

738
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,220
What's eating you?

739
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,440
Get rid of the broad.

740
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,620
Now, hold on.

741
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,060
What's coming off here?

742
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,020
Hey, I bet you're a cop.

743
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,340
A plainclothesman.

744
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,940
I said beat it.

745
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,840
Why, sure.

746
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,640
Sure, officer.

747
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,340
I don't know these guys.

748
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,340
I've never seen them before in my life.

749
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,160
You didn't have to do that, Jayner.

750
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,820
He was just having some fun.

751
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,260
You were given an assignment.

752
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,980
Now get up to your room and stay there.

753
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,120
Both of you.

754
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,980
Yeah, but...

755
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,220
Come on, Puzzler.

756
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,960
He's frothing at the mouth already.

757
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,400
He probably has some date of his own to meet down here.

758
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,620
I wonder what the...

759
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,660
Poor guy looks like.

760
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm gonna see you go down, Mama.

761
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,600
You and that smart aleck mouth of yours.

762
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,780
Sounds to me like you've got a personal axe to grind.

763
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,120
I always thought the church came first.

764
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,000
I wonder if you're as dedicated as you pretend.

765
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,780
Why, you, I oughta...

766
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,220
Give my love to what's-his-face.

767
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,820
Toodle-oo.

768
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,820
Jayner was a rabid hate-monger.

769
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,120
He carried a sullen, sadistic hatred towards the entire world.

770
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,560
Even the other cult members detested him.

771
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,340
That's what I was counting on,

772
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,980
because I had picked St. Jayner Hypercleans as my fall guy.

773
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,120
Kids, I'm afraid I've...

774
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,800
I've lost the most precious thing there is to me.

775
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,020
My personal slag.

776
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
Our children gather around.

777
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,000
The older girls come closer.

778
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,840
The ones who are starting to sprout.

779
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,240
Are you missing your slag, brother?

780
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,480
Have you no slag?

781
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,580
Well, praise Don.

782
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,400
Don brings slag.

783
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,020
To the slagless.

784
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,160
If you down in your mine or your quarry

785
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,520
have not enough slag,

786
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,180
why, R.L. Don Glodds will bring you slag.

787
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,840
Smooth.

788
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,880
And he will teach you the story

789
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,460
of the emists from outer space

790
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,360
who will come down to Earth

791
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,320
and slay you.

792
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,080
Save all those who spent their $31.

793
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,220
Oh, yes.

794
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,920
Praise Don.

795
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,200
Praise Don.

796
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,620
Don will let you play with your thermometer in the rain,

797
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,320
unlike Bob Dobbs,

798
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,420
who'll let you stand in hackneyed and short.

799
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,900
He's the kind of man who visited his block...

800
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,760
What was in that stuff?

801
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,680
Is that stuff or is it just something else?

802
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,580
Oh, that's that stuff.

803
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,540
We are Bob Dobbs, soldier.

804
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,000
Ain't it?

805
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,180
He ate it?

806
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,160
He ain't it.

807
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,980
He can't...

808
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,460
He can't...

809
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,060
He can't step thinking and hang down it all the time.

810
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,380
It just goes like bah.

811
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,480
It gets into your brain and then it just scrambles everything up.

812
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,180
Thank God we're into dawn now

813
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,520
and forgot that evil slagmeister Bob.

814
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,320
Trying to heal, you know,

815
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,280
those who've been brainwashed by the Bob cult.

816
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,120
Those who...

817
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Are recovering.

818
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,300
Those poor people.

819
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,120
Recovering cult addicts.

820
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,880
Bob!

821
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,420
Bob!

822
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,560
Bob!

823
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,560
Are you hurt?

824
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,280
Bob!

825
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,640
Bob!

826
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,300
Hi.

827
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,360
You faker.

828
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,660
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

829
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,080
It's a time space warp.

830
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.

831
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,740
I don't suppose anybody really does.

832
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,940
We've seen some strange things tonight.

833
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,320
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.

834
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
God only knows where they came from.

835
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,880
Jenny and...

836
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,580
And Beth!

837
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
The vortex took them.

838
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,100
Just...

839
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,580
Just took them away.

840
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,220
Welcome to Sub G Sci-Fi.

841
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,960
When last we left our heroine,

842
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
Severia Yeti Blood,

843
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,980
she had pursued her nemesis, Lord Niki,

844
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,600
into the very bowels of the great starship,

845
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,360
Dobstown.

846
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,440
Give it up, Lord Niki.

847
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
There's no place left to run.

848
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,560
Never.

849
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I'll hunt you Yeti until you're extinct.

850
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,340
I will have order.

851
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,220
Do you hear me?

852
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,280
Order for the billions and billions of star systems.

853
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,720
Order and discipline.

854
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,760
I've fallen for your conspiracy tricks often enough

855
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,500
to know you are full of crap.

856
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,840
You are not a clone of Carl Sagan.

857
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,120
You're an evil agent of the conspiracy.

858
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,020
But what will you do now?

859
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
I've magnetically fixed the luck plane in place.

860
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,200
All the odds are against you.

861
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:46,960
Permanently.

862
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,880
Typical conspiracy thinking.

863
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,820
How will your evil machinations ever hope to defeat...

864
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,220
this?

865
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,380
Good God.

866
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,720
That's the very pipe of Bob Dobbs.

867
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,920
How did you get it?

868
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,540
Sent $30 to the Reverend Ivan Stang.

869
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,300
You idiot.

870
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,420
How else would I gain access to the one true pipe?

871
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,340
Let me smoke from it.

872
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,020
I beg of you.

873
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,560
You disgusting conspiracy peon.

874
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,260
You don't smoke the pipe of Bob.

875
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,500
You let the pipe smoke you.

876
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,600
Don't do it.

877
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,140
If you fire that in here, you'll destroy the ship.

878
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,280
What makes you think that's not exactly what I intend?

879
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,940
You conspiracy fool.

880
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,340
But you also destroy the space fighters

881
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,160
led by Nikki Deathchick

882
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,280
that are even now surrounding the ship.

883
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,200
Commander Deathchick can take care of her squadron.

884
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
Worry about your own miserable hide.

885
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,940
Why are you doing this?

886
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,960
When we could rule the universe together.

887
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,280
I'll tell you why next year.

888
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,640
The Exists will definitely come to Brushwood

889
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,100
and rupture us all the way to Planet X.

890
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,160
You subgenius fools have been saying that for years.

891
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,320
Don't you realize you've been duped?

892
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,140
You must be insane to believe in that charlatan Bob.

893
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,760
That's exactly what a pink boy like you would say.

894
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,180
Now eat hot plasma bolts.

895
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,740
In a small way, I pity Lord Nikki.

896
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,820
He simply wasn't willing to pay the price

897
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,060
to find out what he really thought.

898
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,280
Tune in next week for more subgy sci-fi.

899
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,680
Ab-by the Bishop.

900
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,220
Bob Dobbs.

901
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:35,660
Velva.

902
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,940
Slug.

903
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,560
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

904
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,780
Through Bob off Eclipse at Dobbs Town.

905
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

906
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,000
Velva.

907
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,140
Slug.

908
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

909
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,320
Through Bob off Eclipse at Dobbs Town.

910
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

911
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,940
Through Bob off Eclipse at Dobbs Town.

912
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,360
Thanks.

913
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,920
This is low income students.

914
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,740
Some low-income students are encased in rock on public lands in Colorado.

915
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,360
These little creatures are poised to wreak havoc.

916
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,460
They say it violates the state constitution, creating a black market for...

917
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,760
Thanks.

918
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,540
And now back to the second act of our story based on the real-life adventures of Joseph Mama,

919
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,960
undercover agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

920
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,860
I was a cultist for the ATF.

921
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,940
Jayner followed us to the elevator to make sure we returned to our room.

922
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,660
What he did after that, well, I can only guess.

923
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,560
Puzzler and I turned in.

924
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,620
I lay there for a while, thinking, as I had done many times before.

925
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,680
This cult wasn't just operating in South America or Europe.

926
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,280
It was here in the USA, in my own country.

927
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,240
I had grown up and never even heard of the Church of the Subgenius

928
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,520
until...

929
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,880
I worked for the ATF.

930
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,040
Now it was all I heard about.

931
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:39,160
Child abductions, mind control, drugs, armed shipments, revolutionary plots, the whole rotten mess.

932
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,640
It was all here in my own backyard.

933
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,180
Most of the world knows nothing of the Subgenius Church.

934
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,060
Those who do think it's some kind of joke or religious satire.

935
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,680
Well, the only ones who are laughing are the subgeniuses themselves.

936
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,700
While the rest of society sleeps, the Church busily goes about laying the groundwork for their bloody takeover.

937
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,520
The so-called...

938
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,100
The so-called X-Day, where every non-cult member is eliminated in a general massacre.

939
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,920
The only thing between the subgenius and their sick goal was me.

940
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,580
And the ATF.

941
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,380
It was just before daybreak when the knock came at our door.

942
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,880
What's that? Who's there?

943
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,620
You better answer it and find out.

944
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,120
Who could it be at this hour?

945
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,840
Good morning. Glad to see you're up.

946
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,020
Brother Stang.

947
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,460
Joe Mama, have a seat over there by the window.

948
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,500
We have some talking to do.

949
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,940
Puzzling evidence? You can go back to bed. This doesn't concern you.

950
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,320
Sure. Whatever you say.

951
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,700
Let us review the facts of this matter again.

952
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,860
Now? This time in the morning?

953
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,600
There's nothing as truthful as a drowsy witness.

954
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,460
We've proved that often enough at the Subgenius Foundation.

955
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,320
Suppose we turn the lamp just so.

956
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,920
But it's in my eyes.

957
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,980
Exactly. Just another little technique of the Foundation.

958
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,480
We've just lost a very important tool in our lives.

959
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,560
We're in our fight against the conspiracy.

960
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,500
We seem to have a traitor in our midst.

961
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,800
I'm sure you're eager to help assist us discover that traitor so we can carry out the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

962
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,760
Lean back, Joe. Relax.

963
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,940
Look into the light. There's nothing to worry about. Is there?

964
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,720
The questioning went on and on. Stang was clever. Very clever.

965
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,680
He reworded phrases and used trick questions.

966
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,640
But when he finally turned off the light and left, I felt fairly certain I hadn't given anything away.

967
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,140
Not that I was any closer to being in the clear.

968
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,900
That would depend on what happened outside the coffee shop between 7 and 8 in the evening.

969
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,280
Well, it's a quarter past 7. I guess we've got plenty of time to eat.

970
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,300
And still make the meeting by 8 o'clock.

971
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,980
Yeah, plenty of time. How's the crackers?

972
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,480
It don't matter. I'm so hungry I could eat a three-pound steak.

973
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,940
Careful now. That would be normal food.

974
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,660
Yeah? Wait till we get there.

975
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,620
I'm sure we'd take over and see what we feed then.

976
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,740
No share-in-share like, brother?

977
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,460
Not for those corporate yuppies. We'll be the big shots then.

978
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,780
All us guys who've done the dirty work.

979
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,920
What about the redistribution of the wealth? The slack for the common man?

980
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,480
Ah, phooey. That's dogma for the dupes and you know it.

981
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,040
We'll be the guys with the limos and harems.

982
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,060
Anyone who don't like it will be, bang, zoomed off the planet.

983
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,800
You know something, puzzler? You and I think exactly alike.

984
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,000
I kept talking to Puzzler as we ate our meal, but all the while I kept my eye out for Jaynor.

985
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,180
I knew his habits. He always left early for the 8 o'clock meeting, but when 7.30 came, there was still no sign of him.

986
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,960
I began to sweat. Finally, I spotted him leaving the hotel and crossing the street right in front of our window.

987
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,560
Look, there's Jaynor, leaving for the meeting. We better get going soon ourselves.

988
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,960
Jaynor? Oh yeah, there he is. Looks like he's running to a friend.

989
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,360
Yeah. I've seen that guy before.

990
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:03,440
Me too. Can't remember where, but he obviously knows Jaynor. Well, maybe not. Looks like he's just getting a match.

991
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,640
That fellow's doing a lot of talking, though.

992
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:15,160
Probably another fellow that lives in the... No, wait. Now I remember. That's the guy who picked me up once on a handgun violation. He works for the ATF.

993
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:22,780
What, him? Oh, you must be mistaken, Puzzler. He's a friend of Jaynor's. Look, he's shaking hands with him and pounding him on the back.

994
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,640
I ain't mistaken. His name's Jackson, and he's ATF.

995
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:26,640


996
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,260
How come he's so friendly with Jaynor?

997
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,460
I don't know, but I'm beginning to wonder.

998
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,780
Why? What's to wonder about? Jaynor's the guy they're looking for. He's the stool pigeon.

999
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,080
Oh, there must be some other explanation.

1000
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,160
That match business is just a cover-up. I bet he handed a report or something to Jackson right then.

1001
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,340
Or took something from him.

1002
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:55,400
That's it. A payoff. For stooling on Dobbs Town. Look, Joe, you saw it too. I ain't imagining it. You'll back me up, won't you?

1003
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,900
All right, if you insist I will.

1004
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:07,240
It was eight o'clock when we showed up at the deserted warehouse. Stang, Hal, and Jaynor were already there, waiting. We went inside.

1005
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,520
You're late, Mama. What's the matter? Afraid to face the music?

1006
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,780
I've got nothing to hide. Like I told Stang at this morning's, uh, discussion. Well, have you come to a verdict?

1007
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,380
Uh, Joe, our lawyer got in to talk to some of the prisoners from Jail.

1008
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:32,440
They say they followed procedure completely. There was no way any information could have leaked out of that compound.

1009
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,280
They figure it was a tip-off. A tip-off from the outside.

1010
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,780
Then we're right back from where we started. Nowhere.

1011
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,420
Nowhere? You're the only one it could have been. What more evidence do we need?

1012
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,360
You call me?

1013
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,980
Stay out of this, evidence.

1014
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:54,980
So I get selected on nothing more than a wild guess. All the work I've done for Bob, the speeches, the publicity, the under-the-table stuff.

1015
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,520
All that doesn't mean a thing.

1016
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,360
It's a matter of security. For the good of the cause itself. Don't you agree with that principle, brother?

1017
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,980
Why, of course I agree with it, but, uh...

1018
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,100
Hold on a second. I've got a question here of my own I want to ask.

1019
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,640
You're only here on assignment. Nobody's interested in hearing your stupid little question.

1020
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,740
Oh, I think they might if they heard it.

1021
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,240
Yeah, we can deal with you after we've dealt with the traitor.

1022
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,060
But I'm not the traitor, I tell ya. I'm...

1023
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,960
Jaynor! Who was that guy you met outside the hotel a few minutes ago?

1024
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,320
The guy you were so friendly with.

1025
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,320
I don't know and I don't care. This is more important.

1026
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,380
Jaynor's right. This is hardly the time or the place to...

1027
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,000
The guy's name is Jackson. He works for the ATF.

1028
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,780
The guy who wanted the match?

1029
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,680
Yeah, the guy you talked to.

1030
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,880
Never seen the guy before in my life.

1031
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,500
Then why'd he shake your hand?

1032
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,480
How should I know? I just bumped into him.

1033
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,340
When he bumped into me, he arrested me. But when he bumps into you, he pats you on the back.

1034
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,840
I'd like to think there's another explanation, uh... Jaynor.

1035
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,780
But you gotta admit, it looks a little fishy.

1036
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,160
He commented on the weather. Small talk. Nothing more.

1037
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,340
He gave you something, too. What was it?

1038
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,440
Nothing. That's a lie. Search me if you want to.

1039
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,000
I think that's a good suggestion under the circumstances, if you don't mind.

1040
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,760
Go ahead, check me. Because they're lying. Both of them.

1041
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,840
I only know what I saw, Jaynor. I didn't think twice about it until Puzzler recognized the man from ATF.

1042
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,780
Come to think of it, it was Jaynor who accused Joe from the very beginning.

1043
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,780
Almost like he had it in for him.

1044
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,560
Of course he did. He was trying to cover up his own game.

1045
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,220
This is ridiculous. Everyone knows that-

1046
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,960
Quiet, Jaynor. What's this in your coat pocket? An envelope?

1047
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,040
That's not mine. I-I never put it there.

1048
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,540
No, of course you didn't. The Tooth Fairy did. Bet you know what's inside it, too.

1049
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:48,000
It's money. All hundred dollar bills. Got something going on the side, Jaynor?

1050
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,000
It's a frame-up. Somebody planted it on me. We've gotta get to the bottom of this and find out who's-

1051
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,600
Silence, Jaynor! That's an order!

1052
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,960
We've listened to your advice enough already. Brother Mama, it seems we owe you an apology.

1053
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,780
Not at all, Brother Stang. I'm just glad I found out the truth.

1054
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,540
I'm happy I can go on devoting my life to Bob and the Church of the Subgenius.

1055
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,500
Thanks for the movie, Joe. I'm glad you're not sore at me for not taking your side earlier.

1056
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,240
Not at all, Puzzler. You were only doing your duty, just as we all should.

1057
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,940
I'll make it up to you, honest.

1058
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:29,560
Hey, why not let me treat you to dinner? I owe you one. And the grill's just across the street. It looks like it's still open.

1059
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,240
No thanks, Puzzler. Think I'll grab a taxi and get back home.

1060
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,680
Maybe next time, then. I wonder what they'll do to Jaynor.

1061
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,720
Oh, excommunicate him, probably. Beat him up and run him out of town, perhaps.

1062
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:49,060
I wish they'd let me do the pounding. The way he always called me Dumbo. And all the time he was working for the ATF.

1063
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,060
You just never know, Puzzler. You just never know.

1064
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,940
Joe, it's a body!

1065
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,980
Yeah, let's get out of here before that cop comes. Pardon us, please. Hey, excuse us. We gotta get through.

1066
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,320
Joe, that was Jaynor.

1067
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,040
It was Jaynor.

1068
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:15,080
He couldn't take it. He couldn't face the disgrace of being kicked out of the church. He took his own life.

1069
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,540
Maybe. But then again...

1070
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,920
I didn't know if Jaynor had dripped or jumped or whatever else out there.

1071
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,780
I don't know for sure. But I do know that Stang left town that same evening.

1072
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,540
As Dr. Howell put it, his work here was finished.

1073
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,400
I left Puzzler and walked along the street, alone. I felt sick.

1074
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,460
Maybe Jaynor deserved what happened to him, but I never planned on putting him in that kind of spot.

1075
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:50,680
I tried to push it all out of my mind. An undercover agent can't afford feelings any more than he can afford friends or family.

1076
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:59,520
My one main objective was still safe. I was on the job. Still a cultist for the ATF. I walked home alone.

1077
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,940
In a moment, Agent Mama will return with some closing comments about cults.

1078
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:20,120
This is Agent Mama. Many of these stories are based on actual events that occurred during my nine heart-stopping years as a cult member for the ATF.

1079
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,520
Although the names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, all events did take place as depicted within the continental USA.

1080
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:34,820
Our country, America, must be kept strong, must be kept free of the pestilence of unwanted cults.

1081
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,100
We, who love this country, must constantly be on the guard against these traitors.

1082
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:48,720
The Founding Fathers never envisioned the use of mind control techniques or brain-altering drugs used by today's sinister cults.

1083
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:57,200
That's why we, the ATF, must assume extra-constitutional powers to eradicate these weeds from America's sacred soil.

1084
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,680
Join us each and every week as we continue our crusade.

1085
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,440
This week's program is dedicated to real-life hero Boston City Councilman Ken Reeves,

1086
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:17,160
who, after hearing an anonymous phone tip, activated local police authorities and banned the subgenius cult from recruiting in his fair city.

1087
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,000
The ATF salutes Ken Reeves and other real Americans for protecting our communities.

1088
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:29,420
Featured in tonight's story were Joseph Mama as Agent Mama, Ivan Stang as Reverend Stang, and Janer Hypercletes as Janer.

1089
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:35,220
Tonight's cast also included Craig Mitchell as Puzzling Evidence, Nicky Michaud as Mama's Mother,

1090
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:41,760
Jeff Howe as Dr. Howe, Wayne Aiken as Agent Jackson, and Willie Gordon as Agent Sally Dean.

1091
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,460
Your announcer is Gary Evans. This is the Blue Network.

1092
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,140
If you want to make it easy...

1093
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,460
And you want to take a hike...

1094
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,640
Then you'll get an Eagle Tail.

1095
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,920
And you'll always know you're right.

1096
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
It's the life and better...

1097
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,520
Better together!

1098
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,160
Mellow, mellow brew, Eagle Tail.

1099
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,820
Never afraid!

1100
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,680
It's the better, better brew for you and you and you and you.

1101
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,620
It's the better, better brew for you and you and you and you.

1102
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:16,340
Uh, yes, my friends, I should probably explain why that, uh, uh, production there, uh, by Reverend Kirsteiner sounds...

1103
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,820
The way it does.

1104
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:28,080
For various reasons, um, it, uh, ended up being recorded inside of a tent at Brushwood...

1105
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,840
At around 12 noon on July 5th, 1998.

1106
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:46,320
Uh, long time listeners should understand, uh, what that implies, and, uh, perhaps why your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, said...

1107
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,400
Sounds the way he does.

1108
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:54,000
That, uh, why certain other subgeniuses had to fill in for the parts of the original subgeniuses.

1109
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,140
Uh, yes, ee-ha!

1110
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,800
But the show must go on.

1111
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,300
Uh, um, please wait a little longer while the show is ridiculously followed like earlier in the show.

1112
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,300


1113
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,300


1114
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,300


1115
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,300


1116
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,520
But you should know, uh...

1117
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,160
I am remarkable.

1118
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,160


1119
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,260
Uh...

1120
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,560
And unique.

1121
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,260
Uh...

1122
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,000
She's a champion, in a way...

1123
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,080
Thanks.

1124
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,080


1125
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,180
You're welcome.

1126
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:46,320
Say what you want, sex.

1127
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,580
The amino acids.

1128
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,100
It's.

1129
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,620
Dear parent, this is.

1130
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,820
According to USA Today, I'm more alarmed than ever about the quality of our children.

1131
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,700
They're at an all-time low.

1132
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,500
For example, here at Arizona State University, science and math are dead last.

1133
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,260
According to USA Today, I'm literally staggering throughout America.

1134
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,120
The good news is, it just keeps getting worse.

1135
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,260
It just keeps getting worse.

1136
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,420
It just keeps getting worse.

1137
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,500
It just keeps getting worse.

1138
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,520
Oh, bad, bad, bad.

1139
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,460
And there's so.

1140
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:50,140
There's so much more bad to be had at www.subgenius.com.

1141
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:55,760
That website will tell you about the living church.

1142
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,480
If it's money you want, we'll send that to Post Office Box 2.

1143
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,080
Well, this is where you can write to the business office.

1144
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:12,040
Post Office Box 204206, Austin, Texas.

1145
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,340
877-78720.

1146
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:22,960
I just got back from a trip to visit the beautiful new Austin facilities,

1147
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:29,760
which are run by Jesus and his wife, his beautiful wife, Mary Magdalene.

1148
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,500
It was so great to see that busy operation down there.

1149
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:41,980
And friends, if you have tapes you want us to hear in Subgenius Land or CDs or whatever,

1150
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:50,140
send them to me, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, at Box 181417.

1151
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:57,220
That's Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1152
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,220
44118.

1153
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,500
And praise Bob.

1154
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,360
Oh, and now more of this.

1155
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,520
This orangutan has clothes.

1156
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,360
No one likes it.

1157
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,520
This chimp clean and well-groomed.

1158
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,080
But it's no bonobo.

1159
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,220
But how can we prove that we can measure an animal's problems?

1160
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,040
Well, you can study these gentle red giants.

1161
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,040
But how can we know they are looking at themselves?

1162
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,580
Very few certainly do.

1163
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,780
One of the reasons they're so sociable, they do each other to play.

1164
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,100
This is monkey dolphins.

1165
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,220
Tourists are allowed to enjoy watching them.

1166
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,600
The Bahamas are the best place in the world in the wild in action.

1167
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,540
Each dolphin has its babies of their mothers.

1168
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,500
So it's no language too.

1169
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,580
Many dolphin scientists picking the nose recognize themselves in social lives.

1170
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,640
But one slightly drains.

1171
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,380
So what?

1172
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,820
All great apes are looking after their loving tourists.

1173
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,140
It's possible to encounter others.

1174
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,800
Some scientists may not be able to speak, but does seem to be talking to his friends.

1175
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,320
He's been taught to reply using words.

1176
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,640
The scientist performs some odd tasks.

1177
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,520
Can you get the refrigerator?

1178
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:32,320
So these animal brains are probably the easiest to see.

1179
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,280
They look manipulating termites.

1180
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,740
Since then, the males even have ties.

1181
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,200
They are fun.

1182
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,720
But our closest relative is an experience you'll forget.

1183
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,680
It's here.

1184
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:44,680


1185
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
You want to spit on you.

1186
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,120
Good. That's a wonderful thing.

1187
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,440
Pick a lesbian.

1188
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,080
Suffering 80 years out of her body.

1189
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,360
She's all gone.

1190
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,040
Oh, why are you so late?

1191
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,620
Oh, Jesus.

1192
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,680
Ready? Put down.

1193
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,320
Oh.

1194
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,220
Well, it landed softly for coming out so hot.

1195
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,700
It didn't go but about 15 feet after it landed.

1196
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,420
That's a good one.

1197
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,340
Samantha Dundee, Nemo.
