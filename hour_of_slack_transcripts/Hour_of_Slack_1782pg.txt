No, no, no.
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your subs adjusted.
We're having operating difficulties,
which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.
We have such a wonderful life.
So wonderful life.
We have such a wonderful life.
We have such a wonderful life.
No trouble.
Get set and get going.
Amen.
Recording.
Everything's going fine.
No trouble.
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
Bob?
Bob?
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.
With Pat,
and Mr. Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.
Before the sermon,
a message concerning Bob Dobbs,
living avatar of slack,
and saint of sales.
On planet...
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?
Do people think you're...
strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track.
Are you abnormal?
Then you are probably better than most people.
Yes.
Your time shall triumph.
Now at last the step-by-step process is revealed.
This is it.
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging hell.


Stand up and fight for your own life.
Stand erect for your own abnormality.
Bob is a way of life to millions.
Yet half of them don't even know it.
He's the one true living slack master
with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.
He is the one real shortcut to slack.
Now see another dimension.
The power of slack.
The power to take your attention on your TV.
Yes, fear the star-fist of removal no longer.
Become physically attractive overnight.
Attain status, luck, prosperity
by blowing them off!
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.
To explore new ways of going over the edge!
And coming right back.
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.
To turn conspiracy and kind of personality disorders around.
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.
That will fool normals and get you sex.
Oh yes, dear friends, this hour of Slack number 1782 is actually a rerun of hour of Slack number 44.
From the year of 1986.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The story so far.
In the beginning, the universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry.
And been widely regarded as a bad thing.
A bad move.
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god.
Though the Jatrovatid people of Veltvodil 6 firmly believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arcle Seizure.
The Jatrovatids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the Great White Handkerchief.
Are small blue creatures.
With more than 50.
And with more than 40 arms each.
Who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
However, the Great Green Arcle Seizure theory was not widely accepted outside Veltvodil 6.
And so one day a race of hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought.
To calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life.
And that is...
The universe and everything.
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated and eventually announced that the answer was in fact 42.
And so another even bigger computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was.
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so amazingly large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet.
Particularly by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface.
Totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.
And this is very odd.
Because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge.
Nothing that ever happened on Earth could possibly have made the slightest bit of sense.
At the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.
And the only native Earth people to have survived the demolition are now being shot at.
Behind a computer bank on the lost planet of Magrathea.
Along with their strange companions from Beetlejuice.
Who are currently singing an ancient Beetlejuice death anthem on the very sensible grounds that they are about to die.
This is what the computer bank is about to do.
It isn't the cough that carries you off.
It's the coffin they carry you off in.
And the
Toothpaste.
The





The saw that blinks like a lamp.

The giant.
This can't be the real Bob.
It's just a flat two-dimensional head made of dots.
A thousand miles across.
Boy, he's putting that pipe in a backwards universe now.
With a gigantic time-warp black hole pipe.
Boy, that was horrible.
I've never done it before.
never been smoked by dogs. Oh, we're back
in Rock and Roll Hell now.
Oh no, is this Rock and Roll Hell?
Oh man, I always get stuck
here at two in the morning.
Rock and
Roll Hell.
Get down, party,
shoot up, pray to Satan.
Rock and
Roll Hell.
Yeah, yeah.
Rock and Roll Hell.
Go out and kill some kids tonight.
Rock and Roll
Hell.
Rock and Roll Hell.
Beating, destroy.
Destroy your life.
Satan
and Rock and Roll Hell.
Rock and Roll.
Sex, drugs, and alcohol.
DJs on this show.
Corruption.
Vigilance.
Here is a special editorial.
Doctors for Bob supports
the Parents Music Resource Center
in its efforts to
read Rock and Roll Hell.
Hell yeah, man.
We're having about eight
kegs of the bull down in Hell
tonight.
A giant kill party by the
flaming lake of Brimstone.
We feel that today's teenager
has too many other pressures
without having to worry about
hate.
Hate.
Hate.
And now for the subgenius
emotional hour.
It's all emotional hour.
Devil-worshipping teenagers
stole my pill.
And all the gas you want.
Awesome on bonds.
You can moat.
If that's what floats your boat.
Hey, you.
I'm talking.
You listening?
You listening?
Or you can pout.
Or you can break out.
Get up.
Get out.
Come on, step on.
Step into it.
Step into the flea.
Girl, do what you please.
Cause you ain't no twit.
You ain't no twit yet.
Step out of your clothes.
Girl, step into.
You'll be the latest hit.
The latest hit.

Yeah.
It's about time to let my hormones wake up.
Put off the homework.
Let's put on the mail.
Don't wait a second, cause you'll stay in limbo.
I give my old stuff to my sister, that bimbo.
When I wear underwear, I'm liberated.
It's like the movies, M-I-P-G or X-rated.
I've got a lot of stuff.
I feel just like a virgin in these clothes.
I hold my belly button.
Limp won't show.
Step into the sleaze.
Start being a tease.
Hey, you ain't no nerd.
You ain't no nerd yet.
Step into the street.
Put guys into heat.
Be a little flirt.
A little flirt, yeah.
Wanna get to dress up.
Move around and prance.
Wanna get you.
Right up.
All my fans will dance.
They'll try to fight it, cause this is really you.
Just burst your lips and flare your nostrils, too.
I must be dreaming.
This is just too cool.
Cause in real life, I wet my lips and then I drool.
I really love living the life I wanna.
It feels so good to be a prima donna.
Step into the street.

Start being a tease.


Step into the sleaze.
Girl, do what you please.
Now you're not a wimp.
You're not a wimp, yeah.
Step into the lights.
You know it's all right.
If you wanna frip, you can frip, yeah.
You can take your mind where it wants to go.
Tell the boys to come, or tell the boys to blow.
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream, I can make my life be like a man.
You're not a wimp.



Step into the sleaze, girl, do what you please, cause you ain't no twit.
You ain't no twit, yeah.
Step into the beat, put guys into heat, you're the latest hit.
The latest hit, yeah.
When I start to strut, I wanna squish my nose.
My body really sweats, but hey, that's how it goes.
I'm in a world like Glamour Girl, it's simple.
I'm never going back to clear a sill and pimples.
You can take your mind where it wants to go.
Tell the boys to come, or tell the boys to blow.
Blow!
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream, I can make my life be like a magazine.
Be like a magazine.
Be like a magazine.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
You can be like that.
You can be like that magazine, I suppose.
This is the horrible Madonna parody.
I might as well tell you what's going on here, friends.
This is gonna be a real hip show.
This was real cool a few months ago, I suppose.
Madonna parody.
This is a parody here from Reverend Bleepo Abernathy up with the Hour of Slack show in Boston.
A little bit before that and after this, the Serious Abuse radio show from the Rat Cave, dear friends.
We'll be going back to that.
Mommy asks, oh, Dobbs head.
Silly pills, Bob Slack.
I want my pills.
Some devil works for me.
Give me your pills.
Bob pills.
Bob pills.
Bob slack.
Bob, give me pills.
Bob.
Yes, that's the misconceptions of many subgeni.
That's your typical pink boy pretending to be subgenius.
Yes, he paid his $20.
His money was green, but he was still pink inside.
Yes.
It's a pathetic thing to watch as he tries to quote all the slang that he got.
Hey, pull the wool over your own eyes, guys.
Hey, yeah.
Yeah, you'd pay to know what you really think.
Yeah, like repent and quit your job and slack off.
Yeah, and do something to them if they can't take a joke.
What was that?
Let me open it back up here.
Oh, wow, man.
Are we punk rock, man?
I thought it was punk to talk about Bob.
I thought it was like cool or something to talk about Bob.
Hey, we ought to hassle the clerk at best because she's a capitalist, man.
Hey, you believe in anarchy, man?
Well, if you don't, I'm going to kill you.
Kill you.
Kill you.
Kill you.
We'll show you punk rock.
You thought it was hair and clothes.
You thought it was like big spikes and bracelets and leather and stuff.
Yeah, you thought punk rock came from a record company.
You thought wrong.
You thought it was like-
You are God participating in himself, just me.
Man, this guy's-
Wow, this guy's a real problem.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.




Stop it.
Hey, he's a-
This is for Derparsam for sure.
They find more dominance when tomorrow becomes today.
Responsible for this?
Hey, I hear the caller who stole my-
All right, enough of this silliness.
Yes.
Say goodnight, Stank.
Ah, yes, friends.
I'm all hooked up and ready to answer your questions.
Now, we've been getting letters and phone calls from noble subgeniuses out there asking,
Reverend Stank, how can I be more subversive?
How can I be of more service to Bob in bringing down the conspiracy that enslaves us?
And friends, I'm afraid that that is entirely up to you.
Now, the conspiracy will tell you how to be.
You can be more subversive against it, so we sure won't.
But I can give you one helpful hint, friends.
There's nothing wrong with looking normal.
If you want to be more subversive, friends, you don't have to show off about it.
If you wear a uniform, like a high fashion punk haircut or leather and spandex and whatever,
unless it's really extreme, friends, you're just playing along with the conspiracy,
joining a conformity of nonconformists.
You're labeling yourself as someone who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about,
because you're going to follow a predictable pattern, one that they've co-opted already.
But what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway, friends?
Bringing down the state? Blowing up polluters?
Nay, nay.
That only kills people, friends, and gets you in jail to boot.
It's stupid, but not stupid in the right way.
Bob said, Bob said,
Thou shalt kill none but me.
Unless they're literally about to kill you or if they insult your ancestors.
That's what Bob said.
And, you know, there's nothing wrong with technology, friends.
We don't need to subvert technology.
After all, only technology is the only thing we've got to clean up the mess we already made.
So who are we trying to subvert?
The Republicans?
Friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing intellectuals.
It doesn't mean anything.
All it means to most of us is
patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism, friends.
Every yard a kingdom.
Every child and dog a serf.
It doesn't matter what party is in control
as long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.
I mean, as political systems go,
the U.S. is one of the least evil.
Just as Jesus is okay,
it's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street
who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.
Work is one of the main ones.
That's how you're really controlled, friends.
You have to work for someone else to make a living.
Now, the subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.
But that's the rub and the bub, my friend.
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.
It's a whole background attitude.
The conspiracy is an attitude.
An attitude of hatred for anything weird.
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.
Now, some strange things are bad.
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange ones.
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend,
so they can catch you, make you look like a kook in front of millions.
Now, history proves that every time you overthrow something overnight,
ditch some old government, what replaces it always ends up just as bad.
We have to break that cycle, friends, and this isn't anarchy we're talking about.
Anarchy is just another political system, just like atheism is just another religion.
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone at your own pace, casually, but with alertness,
to subvert the attitude of hating everything weird.
Remember, leftists are just as guilty as rightists in this respect.
And you don't go out subverting by being an obnoxious Bobby and forcing weirdness down the throats of normals
who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.
That just makes them hate weirdness more.
You should seduce them with abnormality, my friend.
You have to break them in a little at a time.
It depends.
And you can't indiscriminately hate all normals,
because that only proves that you are a normal yourself,
because you don't understand yet that half of what you call normals are actually weirder than you are.
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you wanna be just like someone on TV?
Oh boy, it's so terrible that what you said you'll see
is nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV.
But that's anarchy!
You're a cowboy that has to stay up late and drop the walls
at the médico!
For so many times I can't remember them all
And I say, who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV
I think I'll be a teddy boy
I think I'll be a hunk
I think I'll be a tough guy
And I think I'll be a punk
I might just be a fashion star
All dressed in pretty rags
Open my house across the other side
And walk around in drag
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be?

Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV
Oh yeah
Do you like to live just like a rock
In the middle of the sea?
Do you want to suffer by yourself
In a pool of lead for misery?
Do you feel like a saint in artist's clothes
With a rosary in your hand?
Do you want to be free?
Do you see life and dough
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?
Would you rather push the buttons
And be feared by all humanity?
Or perhaps you'd like to be above
Do you want to be stupid just like me?
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV
Who do you want to be today?
This is N1A
Who do you want to be?
Just like someone on mobile TV
Hey man, who
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
To use my own super cool studly self as an example,
now in person I don't really appear like a mad prophet of the airwaves.
I very deliberately look like an innocent computer whiz or something.
If a policeman stops me for speeding, I look like a regular citizen.
And part of me is.
And so he doesn't look in the trunk to see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies of subgenius pamphlets
to hand out to grade school kids, which I am.
Get away with murder this way, friends.
And that time the Secret Service came to my house.
They took one look and said, oh, he's just a poor humorist.
He isn't building bombs.
Not physical bombs, nay, my friends.
But.
Me and perhaps many of you are from that 1970s post-hippie nihilistic generation more or less.
And aside from not working for a living,
I and perhaps you are still that same devious hippie.
Not a commie, nay, not a pinko, but a soldier for slack.
A warrior against the conspiracy of the normals.
And so.
And so.

And so.



And so.
And so.
And so.







They'll recoil in fear and jealousy to see a free man or woman.
But for latent subgeni who are ripe to be saved,
you are setting a good example to be weird in your own way.
Achieve slack in your own life, my friend,
and those who are worthy will turn toward it as towards a beacon as a moth dives headlong into the flames.
There.
They're not trying to steal your slack or to imitate you, but merely to see what is possible.
Then and only then will they learn to pull the wool over their own eyes.
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends.
They have to just stumble upon Bob in their own sweet time.
And I'm not saying be yourself.
Quote, unquote.
There are too many yourselves.
You might end up being your own conspiracy normal lynch mob self.
You must try to try not to achieve the development of your Bob self.
That in you, which is Bob-like.
And there is no rule book for this, my friend, except the one you make and the one that you buy from Bob.
Praise Bob!
Hooray!
Help me, somebody!

Down you go!

It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.
It's not just the doorway to doom.
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.
Shout salvation and fight in Jesus.
You'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.
Not off.
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.
In his back pocket.
Just you try it.
Bob is a clump of mud.
Bob is a tape recorder.
Bob is things that don't always run.
Bob is masking tape.
Bob is a ballpoint pen.
Bob is a rooster.
And Bob...
Bob is a hen.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I don't have any more of that.
They're saying I don't have pope bottles.

They're squirming.
Wow.
They're trying to tell me where I'm going.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
We want Bob.
Where's Bob?
We want Bob.
Right now.
We want Bob.
Okay.
Bob's probably not going to be here in physical manifestation.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Where is Bob? He's everywhere. Check yourself and feel if you're Bob Glenn and make sure it's overactive like it's supposed to be.
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.
Now wait a minute. No, wait a minute. I love that area.
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained with an expert.
Men of vision, men such as you, Doctor, gathered here exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.
Well, there you have it.
Nothing more.
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such we can accomplish wonders.
Like any other church, the Church of the Subgenius has divine tenets, divine rules, divine orders.
The first rule of the Subgenius Church is, too much is always better than not enough.
Can I get it too much?
Can I get it too much?
What is it always better than?
What is it always better than?
Praise God.
Praise God.
Hello, Paul.
Welcome to the End Times.
In today's End Time essay, we will be covering the difference between the boyfriend and the
bloody head of larger society itself.
And the last is, of course, the most important.




As seen here in our first slide, the bloody head of larger society goes on forever.
There is no end, and there's no use resisting.
Look at those heads fall in slow motion.
Just beautiful.
Just bouncing down the celestial stairs.
Yes, dear friends, those are the things I want to tell you about today.
The road not taken, or parables about the less traveled path.
Ha!
Snarly.
Bob gives you the bulldozers you need to pave your own path.
Ignore those gray suited hippos and those ferret-faced fashion clones or kill me.
You gotta stand up.
You gotta stand up now and you gotta stand up for us.
A peace which is under hell.
Stand up is made illegal.
Don't let them whitewash your subcontinent mind.
Fancy doodads and gadgets just like the 50s.
Some of you think I'm talking revolution.
Hey, if we're supposed to be moving ahead, we're supposed to be moving forward.





Well, I am.
But not stupid revolution.
Do machines get smarter as people get dumber?

That's exactly the way they want you to behave so they can have an excuse to mount their
gun turrets against all the supposed fringe group cyborgs.
Oh, no, no, now come on.
Keep those thoughts to yourself.
They're just one step ahead of you.
Blam!
You shouldn't depress anybody.
Blam!
You'll be seen as a downer spreading bad karma.
What's the matter?
You think I'm a maniac?
Huh?
You think I'm a downer?
A crybaby?
A paraloid?






You think I'm a downer?
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Subtranity, maybe you don't think it's fine for you to run around
perfectly free to go home?
Go on.
You're not going to be something you call the downer, are you?
Too many.
And it's too many to support and lead.
You need to change your individual.
Even if it's three years of permanent leave, I don't think that would help you get a good
job.
Oh, but don't bomb us out.
We want to have fun.
You just watch that softcore porno soda commercial and work your boring job.


It'll be fine.




If it comes back to find we've turned in just another click, another waffle, not
feel dwarfed to get behind and find an excuse to snuff everyone who's not lying.
In any case, we found hospital evidence for the charge of secret ceremonies involving
the downer, from Blackbird and Browning.
Well?
Hello, there.
I'm Sarah, the Clown.
All you do to make me dance is press my button down.
I need practice.
I'm going to try my best.

Oh, dear friends, and now we come down near the end of an hour of slack
with this song, this offensive song from negative land.
I must admit, this is just really disgraceful.
Friends, that P.O. Box you can write to for more information
about the Church of the Subgenius and its publications is Bob.
Friends, you can write to Bob at P.O. Box.
