00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,980
We are not men.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
We are Devo.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,340

55
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:14,700
D-E-V-O Dan did that. I bet you were wondering. The song is called Hey Homo and I think it's from the album Are We Not Dan? We Are Gaucho.

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,340
There's an interesting history of D-E-V-O Dan at D-E-V-O Dan.com.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:30,280
I was alerted to the marvels of D-E-V-O Dan by our friend Reverend Robin Mountain Boy who will probably see at the devotional here in Cleveland at the end of August.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,700
She and her music can be found at RobinRenee.com.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:46,480
Lee Murr did the intro for this hour of Slack number 1219 which is mostly music this time with bits of 12X Day live shows mixed in.

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,340
But now, a public service message from Lee Murr.

Norrell Prep.

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,440
There's a new happy hour in America. It's called O-R-G.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:02,000
Hello, I'm Tony Perkins. According to a new D-C-R-O-F-I study, adults who don't go to church during their childhood are more likely to be happy later on in life.

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,280
Kids who never went to church are very happy now. Of course, this is nothing new.

66
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,960
So, if you're looking for service with a smile, try O-R-G.

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,640
D-E-V-O Dan

All these quibbly bars

Love is there

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,040
It's the one with the high line

82
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,580
That shines on the top of the world

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,840
That burns and gleams in the twilight

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,460
It's clearly the one with the high line

85
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,220
It's nada

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280

Love will never change

88
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,020
It's nada

89
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,700
Always will be

90
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,500
It's the one with the high line

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,160
That rains on the coast like fire

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,400
It's clearly the one with the high line

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,080
It's clearly the one with the high line

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,440

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,440


96
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
Bye.

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,460
Bye.

98
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,020
Bye.

99
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,140
Bye.

100
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,820
Bye.

101
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,940
Bye.

102
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,720
Bye.

103
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,480
Bye.

104
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,920
Bye.

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,460
Bye.

107
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,340
Bye.

108
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
Bye.

109
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,420
Bye.

110
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Bye.

111
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,460
Bye.

112
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,680
Bye.

113
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,460
Bye.

114
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,440
Bye.

115
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,980
That's a joke,

116
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,820
and your mathematics,

117
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:04,900
Yes.

118
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,560
Uh-huh.

119
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,840
I don't know too much

120
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,520
about a sergeant,

121
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,140
but I got a hunch.

122
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,740
I don't think

123
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,320
I made a mistake.

124
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,700
Yeah.

125
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,480
What do you think?

126
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,220
No such thing.

127
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,480
Marijuana.

128
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,160
There's no such thing

129
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,440
as a bad machine.

130
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,720
as enough.

131
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,520
Caroline the birds and bees research stopped Tony Perkins doing lines stop answers to embarrassing

132
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,300
questions new technology reduces information directly through shame and embarrassment.

133
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,100
As a cult we've done away with strangers by taking the birds and bees research we need

134
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
more there's no such thing as enough.

135
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,520
My church is the church without Christ.

136
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,240
I am a member and a preacher to that church where the blind don't see and the lame don't

137
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,540
walk and what's dead stays that way.

138
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,620
What church you belong to?

139
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,520
You boy there.

140
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,620
I said what church you belong to?

141
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,580
Church of Christ.

142
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,860
Well ask me about my church and I'll tell you it's the church that the blood of Jesus

143
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,980
don't foul with redemption.

144
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,000
Listen here I'm gonna take the truth with me wherever I go.

145
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm gonna preach it to whoever will listen I'm gonna preach that there was no fall because

146
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,220
there was nothing to fall.

147
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,560
No redemption because there was no fall and no judgment because there wasn't the first

148
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:22,860
two.

149
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,320
Nothing matters but that Jesus Christ was alive.

150
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,840
Hazel listen here Hazel I found it.

151
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,040
What do you want?

152
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,340
I found it the house where they live.

153
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,880
You shouldn't ought to hit me Hazel it were nothing I done that you should have hit me.

154
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,520
I only thought it was a three but I found it and I'll take you there if you want.

155
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,360
I know where they live.

156
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,200
I live there now.

157
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,520
See?

158
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,740
Know where they live?

159
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,840
But if you didn't know and I told you then you'd know now.

160
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,640
Oh get out of here.

161
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,560
All he can do is hang around and make a fool out of himself.

162
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,940
He don't know whether he's coming or going.

163
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,760
He ain't nothing but a shiftless crazy boy.

164
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,500
If Jesus Christ had redeemed you what difference would it make to you?

165
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,680
What difference would it make to that crazy boy?

166
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,160
There's no peace for the redeemed.

167
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,880
If they was three.

168
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,580
Three crosses there and Jesus Christ hung on the middle one that wouldn't mean no more

169
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,180
to you or me than the other two.

170
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,100
What you need is something to take the place of Jesus.

171
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,540
Something that would speak plain.

172
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,340
Now the church without Christ don't have a Jesus but it needs one.

173
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,800
It needs a new Jesus.

174
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,680
One that's all.

175
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,680
One that's all man without blood to waste that don't look like any other man so you'll

176
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,580
look at him.

177
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,180
Give me such a Jesus.

178
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,100
I got him.

179
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
I mean I can get him.

180
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,120
Him you've seen him yourself.

181
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,180
Him that I showed to you the new Jesus.

182
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,820
I'll get him.

183
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,880
I'll get him for you Hazel.

184
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,760
You look at me and you look at a peaceful man.

185
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,200
Peaceful because my blood has set me free.

186
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,660
Everybody's got a Jesus.

187
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:14,660


188
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:14,660


189
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:14,660


190
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:14,660


191
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,860
They've got a daily express point of view.

192
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,460
Everybody thinks the world is out to get them and they think it through.

193
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,100
And common sense kicks in and the intelligent among us see the truth through the dim but

194
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,380
everybody else still gets the daily express.

195
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,620
I've got this theory and I hypothesize.

196
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,160
As brains get in but there's a moment in time.

197
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,660
There's not a single time.

198
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:44,660


199
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:44,660


200
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:44,660


201
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:44,660


202
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,880
When people instantly are all of a mind

203
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,300
But that's quite understandable

204
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,500
When you're confronted with the horrors of news

205
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,260
Your mind is saturated, bleak and confused

206
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,140
It's black and white, simplicity is the fuse

207
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,460
And the easiest to blame

208
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,380
It's the things everybody's got

209
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,880
A daily express point of view

210
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,720
Everybody thinks the world is out to get them

211
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,440
But they think it's true

212
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,080
And common sense kicks in

213
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,840
And the intelligence among us see the truth through the tin

214
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,480
But everybody else still gets the daily express

215
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,060
After five seconds then clarity comes

216
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,880
Judgment appears about the earlier ones

217
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,800
That their solution wasn't really well done

218
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,420
But some people are left behind

219
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,420
And they're not alone

220
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,300
And they're the people who were never a tongue

221
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,200
They've got opinions solidly set in stone

222
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,000
They've got ideas that are molded from bone

223
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,740
And they're the readers of the daily express

224
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,720
Cause everybody's got a daily express point of view

225
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,540
Everybody thinks the world is out to get them

226
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,240
But they think it's true

227
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,920
And common sense kicks in

228
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,660
And the intelligence among us see the truth through the tin

229
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,400
But everybody else still gets the daily express

230
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
The daily express

231
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,880
The immediate rush is an imbalanced push

232
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,700
That they think without thinking and you're on a note

233
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,040
The bit is the page of these papers

234
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,340
The day of the kid might pick any opinion at all

235
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,800
It's the ultimate plan

236
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,780
It's the measure of man to accept

237
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,020
That things don't get resolved in a push

238
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,000
And about this time you accept

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,640
The first thing in your mind

240
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,540
That please for the daily express

241
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
When you're confronted with the horrors of news

242
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,220
Your mind is saturated, bleak and confused

243
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,040
It's black and white, simplicity is the fuse

244
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,180
And the easiest to blame gets blamed

245
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,800
Everybody's got a daily express point of view

246
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,660
Everybody thinks the world is out to get them

247
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,360
But they think it's true

248
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,980
And common sense kicks in

249
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,780
And the intelligence among us see the truth through the tin

250
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,380
But everybody else still gets the daily express

251
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,380


252
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,380


253
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,360
But everybody else still gets the daily express

254
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,140
But everybody else still gets the daily express

255
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,320
But everybody else still gets the daily express

256
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,740
But everybody else still gets the daily express

257
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,580
Reverend Diva Schematic of the band The Attery Squash

258
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,440
sings The Daily Express.

259
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,900
Actually, a not quite finished preview of their new CD.

260
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,380
I'm trying to somehow get them to the devotional

261
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,120
someday.

262
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,200
You can learn more about them

263
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,600
and even see some videos at

264
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,560
myspace.com slash theatterysquash

265
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,660
Attery has two T's in it.

266
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,440
Before that, a nice clip from Wise Blood.

267
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,360
And now, back to 12X Day.

268
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,460
Five minutes till fairy tale time!

269
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,980
Oh yes, the fairy tale theater that we promised.

270
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,660
You see, these tales are written by our own Reverend Back It On Up.

271
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,300
They are classic fairy tales.

272
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,000
And by relating them here during this special broadcast,

273
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,860
you will learn the eternal principles which underlie them.

274
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,120
Okay, well, we're getting ever closer

275
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,700
like Achilles' staggering tortoise to fairy tale time.

276
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,480
How wonderful it's going to be when we tell the

277
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,780
Two minutes to fairy tale time.

278
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,960
Incredible fairy tale.

279
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,700
This has to be timed delicately.

280
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,960
It's like a NASA launch.

281
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,160
When the stars are right, you shall hear these

282
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,920
stories.

283
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,380
We have interpreters.

284
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,340
I'm one of them.

285
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,400
Each interpreter will do a different fairy tale.

286
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,880
So who goes first, Nikki?

287
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,540
Is that you?

288
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,560
Then, ladies and gentlemen, now Nikki Deathcheck will tell the first of the three trenchant

289
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,260
fairy tales of Reverend Back It On Up.

290
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,520
Just by way of a quick introduction.

291
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,120
I'll slack.

292
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,100
I'll slack as a breeding ground for just the most insane people you can possibly imagine.

293
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,440
Kooks, subgenius kooks, and kook baiting is something that is widely practiced on alt-slack.

294
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,700
In the last several weeks, Reverend Back It On Up has presented us on alt-slack with some

295
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,540
amazing fairy tales regarding specifically one of these kooks.

296
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,580
So the first fairy tale, so gather around children.

297
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,800
It's fairy tale time.

298
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,400
The first story is called The Princess and the Pea, and that's P-E-E.

299
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,420
Uh-oh.

300
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,920
There once was a handsome prince who had $30 laying around, so he decided to buy himself

301
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,700
a princess for a couple of hours.

302
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,840
He searched the phone book under princesses, but nothing seemed right.

303
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,260
He Googled it, but came up short.

304
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,200
So he sent out word via Craigslist that he was looking for some princess action, and

305
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,780
within a day, a line of princesses had formed up.

306
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:08,780


307
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,560
He looked at the line and saw a little girl, and she was sitting outside his door.

308
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,820
Some were curvaceous, and some were lanky.

309
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,880
Some had big feet, and some had Adam's apples.

310
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,140
Some smelled like garlic, and some had five o'clock shadow.

311
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,400
But at the end of the line was a creature so obscene that he could not believe she was

312
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,280
really a princess.

313
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,880
An angry purple ogre with the greasy crust of what looked like flecks of mashed potatoes

314
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,940
and chili in her hair.

315
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,900
Her face red with rage.

316
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,140
Her lips were spattered with spittle.

317
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,300
Surely you are not a princess, said the prince.

318
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,040
Well, I don't work, and I don't cook, and I don't clean my house, and I feel entitled

319
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,520
to everything.

320
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,240
What would you suggest I am, replied the harpy.

321
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,140
Fair enough, said the prince.

322
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,100
But in his heart, he was not sure.

323
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,980
So he devised a test to determine if the princess was sincere.

324
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,640
He led her into his castle and pointed to a sack of mattresses.

325
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,880
Sleep there tonight, he said, and in the morning I will let you know if I have chosen you to

326
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,560
be my princess.

327
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,640
Beneath the mattresses he had cleverly hidden a turnip.

328
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,220
He went to his bedroom but could hardly sleep that night for anticipation.

329
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,840
The princess climbed to the top of the stack of mattresses, but she overshot the far end

330
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,440
when heaving her mammoth leg up and fell over the bed and onto the floor, busting her lip.

331
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,060
She climbed up again, but she got distracted by the flickering of a television set across

332
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,640
the room and slipped off again, bruising her knees.

333
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,000
Someone else should be doing this hard labor for me, she grumbled.

334
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,400
But the idea of a prince paying all her bills and buying her noodles and sauce packets for

335
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,760
the rest of her life fortified her with the strength to keep trying.

336
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,460
By her sixth try, she made it to the top without bashing her nose or whacking her funny bone.

337
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,080
By then, her bladder was crying out for relief, but she didn't feel like climbing back down.

338
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,240
What the hell? It's not in my bed, she said, and she snored the night away in satisfaction.

339
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,400
The next morning, the prince found the princess looking somehow even worse than she did when

340
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,080
she first arrived.

341
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,300
Only a princess's delicate skin would be so damaged from spending the night on a turnip,

342
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,120
he declared, and heaved her into his arms to carry her off to his chamber.

343
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,460
I want the thirty dollars up front, said the princess.

344
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,280
I don't give it up for free.

345
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,780
But my love, last night while you were sleeping I bedded the other applicants and sent that

346
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,860
thirty dollars to Bob.

347
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,120
Hey, what's that smell? Is that you? he replied.

348
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,060
The princess stormed off in a rage and in her blind fury accidentally slipped, and she

349
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,680
fell into his piranha mode where she was devoured within minutes.

350
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,400
And that is how Bob saved the handsome prince from almost having intercourse with Schizebeck.

351
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,140
The end.

352
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,540
And now the second story will be read by Susie the floozy.

353
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,940
I shall endeavor to.

354
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,340
This is called The Three Little Pinks.

355
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,800
Once upon a time there were three little pinks who escaped from the asylum to seek

356
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,240
their fortune in the world.

357
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,540
All throughout the springtime the little pinks played in the field, seething and obsessing

358
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,560
and deluding themselves.

359
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,660
And they dined upon sodium-rich noodle and powdered sauce packets, and they watched television,

360
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,400
and they gazed at the moon and drooled and their imaginations ran wild.

361
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,720
It was a good time to be a little pink.

362
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,680
By September the days had become shorter and the weather cooled.

363
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:42,280
And one of the little pinks, Porkle, suggested to his brother and sister that they build

364
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,980
their homes for the coming winter.

365
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,560
But his sister, Strips of Bacon, would have none of it.

366
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,620
I want to dance the night away in a purple sheet, she said.

367
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,640
There will be plenty of time later to build my home.

368
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,240
Someone else should tell me how to build it.

369
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Someone else should do it for me.

370
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,700
Jesus should do it for me.

371
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,920
Good luck with that.

372
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,680
To punctuate her point, she farted and giggled and collapsed in the grass out of breath.

373
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:16,460
Likewise, his brother, Reverend Mistress Blue Boring, was busy rewriting the dictionary.

374
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,820
I never get far with my project, he moaned, because whenever I get up to the ease, the

375
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,940
universe speaks to me and I eat the entire thing and I have to start over.

376
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,680
It's my afflictivation and I lamentify most grieverishly.

377
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,640
But I have envisioned a house and it has never been done before, which is manifest in the

378
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,500
vastness of my mind, and this shall be enough to protectivate me should any wolfmen or zomboids

379
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,720
arise to eat my brainicles.

380
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,440
Considering this, Porkle realized that he himself had inspired some of the greatest

381
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
fortresses ever erected.

382
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,160
And he was filled with confidence that if he just showed up in an existing house, he

383
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,320
could proclaim himself the owner and move right in.

384
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,660
So all of this was a dream.

385
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,220
Autumn turned to winter and the three little pinks froze to death.

386
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,180
A spacecraft bearing thousands of alien insects who spoke a clicking language landed next

387
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,020
to their remains and their carcasses were torched in furious alien flames to become

388
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,480
the salty cured main course of the annual feast of clickmas.

389
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,120
It was their greatest contribution to the world.

390
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,940
The end.

391
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,440
Next we have Dr. Hell and then followed by Reverend Potter Nostril.

392
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,780
And now, kiddies, it's time for the third fairy tale.

393
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,600
This one entitled Schizobec's New Clothes.

394
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,080
Schizobec was sitting on the throne when the phone rang.

395
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,200
It was her social worker.

396
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,520
With good news.

397
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,660
Your personality test results are in.

398
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:12,220
You scored very low on social skills and being interesting, but you aced blithering small talk.

399
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,980
You are fit to work in any corporate office.

400
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,500
Oh no.

401
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,880
She did not have anything appropriate to wear.

402
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,260
So she ate a Snickers bar and with chocolate all over her face waddled over to her local Walmart

403
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,860
to outfit herself.

404
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,940
She stood in the entrance, wide-eyed and slack-jawed, a thin streamer of drool on her

405
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,760
chin, gawking at the TV guides.

406
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:48,760
In the shadows of the children's flammable one-piece pajama department lurked a devious

407
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,120
manager oppressed by the policy specifying a quota of mentally challenged employees.

408
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,220
He saw his opportunity.

409
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,500
And twisting his handlebars, he looked at the TV.

410
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:01,680
He saw her mustache.

411
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,320
He slipped over to Schizobec and took her by the hand.

412
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,620
Hello, beautiful, he hissed.

413
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,680
Today is your lucky day.

414
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,840
I have a job for you.

415
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,060
Do you know what a job is?

416
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,160
I don't want to print things on my own paper and I want you to describe the job to me and

417
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:31,460
I don't want to talk to Mexicans and I want candy, wailed Schizobec, spittle-spraying the

418
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,940
manager's jowly face.

419
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,600
And I don't want to pay for a uniform.

420
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,120
You give it to me.

421
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:43,580
The manager could see that Schizobec would complete his entire quota for mental defectives

422
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,500
single-handedly, but he could not give her a uniform or Walmart would dock his pay.

423
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,300
Suddenly, Dobbs whispered into his ear and a cunning plan came to him.

424
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,440
He held out his empty hands to Schizobec and, waving them around, he said,

425
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,440
This is the uniform for you.

426
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:12,780
Elegant, slimming, not that you need it, purple and flowy, bathrobe-like.

427
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:19,140
In this uniform you will feel as if you were hula dancing in your own backyard or hiding

428
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,440
under the bed from thunderstorms.

429
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,440
But beware, others will envy your uniform so much that they will pretend you are wearing

430
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,560
nothing at all.

431
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,900
Do not heed the jealous ho-dogs.

432
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:41,440
Just wear it and wiggle your sexy body with pride whenever you catch someone staring.

433
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,920
Schizobec was overjoyed.

434
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,180
What a day.

435
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,840
And so the manager gave her a register key and her new uniform.

436
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,400
And before he knew it, a naked white potato sat plopped on a stool behind register five,

437
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,920
gobbling Snickers.

438
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,740
And wiping her hands in the folds of her elegant uniform.

439
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,420
And Walmart won the Smiling Simp Award at the annual Pointless Awards ceremony.

440
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
The end.

441
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,280
Our concluding fairy tale is the story of Schizzerella.

442
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,900
Schizzerella is a woman who is a womanizer.

443
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,380
Schizzerella sat amid the muck and filth of her run-down Alabama shithole, stalking

444
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:41,460
the Internet for something banal and off topic to post to her favorite newsgroups, when she

445
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:48,420
came across a post about a fancy ball hosted by Prince Stang, which all the ladies were

446
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,820
attending.

447
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,520
She extracted her hefty finger from deep within her nostril, examined her findings, and made

448
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,920
up her mind to attend.

449
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,160
Just because I haven't been invited, and I seem unwanted, and nobody likes to deal with me,

450
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:12,660
and I don't have a job, and I'm an absurdly gyrating blob who attempts to force my inarticulate and uninteresting blah, blah, blah on everyone,

451
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,820
doesn't mean I can't be kept from attending this party.

452
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:25,360
Good luck with that, she gurgled, and paused to pick off a crusty piece of rice-a-roni that had dried to her favorite zebra applique sweatshirt.

453
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,400
The San Francisco treat, she mumbled, eating it.

454
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,780
A fancy ball is no place to wear your everyday purple tarp,

455
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,460
so Schizerella flung wide the doors of her closet and stared at the mess of shit within.

456
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,660
One pair of khaki pants from her brief employment at Papa John's,

457
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,240
four sizes too small and stained with pizza sauce.

458
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,640
Seven frayed and dingy veils, holes rotted through the mouth area,

459
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,460
as if from a chemical burn.

460
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,400
One potato sack from her days as a dancing potato in the supermarket,

461
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,460
which bore the words, Idaho's best, in red block letters around the middle.

462
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,380
Nothing seemed right.

463
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,600
Suddenly, Jesus appeared, and the strains of kung fu fighting filled the room.

464
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,700
I see that you are in need of help, Schizerella, he said.

465
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,700
I love all of my father's creatures.

466
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,560
Blessed are the pathetic.

467
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,020
For they shall inherit a ride.

468
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:33,800
And with a wave of his magic wand, he transformed a turnip into a coach.

469
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,560
And the scuttling cockroaches that darted around on the sticky linoleum into horses.

470
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,880
And a blow-up love doll into a coachman.

471
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,720
Shazam, screamed the Lord, and did some of his favorite dance moves.

472
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,040
What about my clothes, wailed Schizerella.

473
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,620
Who is going to get me?

474
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


475
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


476
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


477
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


478
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


479
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


480
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


481
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:54,620


482
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Who is going to provide me with the new clothes?

483
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,380
She winced at the recollection of the last time someone had given her new clothes,

484
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,280
the painful embarrassment of the handcuffs,

485
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,780
and the cold leather seat of the police car under her naked buttocks.

486
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,520
Well, damn, said Jesus.

487
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,800
Blessed are the pains in my ass.

488
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,860
For they shall inherit a stunning new wardrobe.

489
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,000
And with a waggle of his finger,

490
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,620
her stained and wretched purple tarp was transformed into a glittering,

491
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,260
spring ball gown.

492
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,100
And the crusted mat of her hair was transformed into a full head helmet

493
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,620
with goggles and a dark tint.

494
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,420
What about my body odor, Schizerella griped.

495
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,140
But even the Son of Man could do nothing about that.

496
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,200
So she set out in her turnip coach, driven by Mr. Moldy Valve,

497
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,260
her enchanted coachman.

498
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,180
And eventually she rolled up onto the ball.

499
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,120
Prince Stang and his men in waiting,

500
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,920
were at the gate when she arrived.

501
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,620
She tumbled out of her turnip coach,

502
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,860
clomped up to the prince and said,

503
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,340
Well, I see it is time for that party again,

504
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,600
and I'm here for that party,

505
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,420
and I have a blues tape by Eric Clapton,

506
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,060
but somebody's going to have to pay the entrance fee for me,

507
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,620
because I don't have benefits,

508
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,360
because Mexicans took my job from good, hard-working American people

509
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,120
who don't have time to be printing out their own job applications.

510
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,320
I mean, if you're into that kind of waste of time,

511
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,840
maybe you should try watching The View.

512
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,380
There's a recipe on there for tuna casserole,

513
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,100
but you can watch it on the internet.

514
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,100


515
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,100


516
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,460
You can replace the tuna with noodles,

517
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,320
and the noodles with mashed potatoes,

518
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,940
and that's just as good as long as it's not soupy.

519
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,880
Good luck with that.

520
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,860
But Prince Stang could only shake his head sadly.

521
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,880
You missed the ball, Schizzarella.

522
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,300
It ended a week ago.

523
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,700
How long did it take you to get here from Alabama

524
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,160
by horse-drawn carriage?

525
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,960
And why are your horses so small and scuttly?

526
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,660
Schizzarella went wild with rage.

527
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,680
She flailed and thrashed so violently.

528
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,340
She was so angry that she staggered out into the road,

529
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,020
where she was run over and killed by a cart full of Amish girls

530
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,940
on their way to Atlantic City.

531
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,080
Buzzards picked her to pieces,

532
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,940
and the next heavy rainfall washed her bones into the gutter.

533
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,800
The end.

534
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,560
On the streets and streets have become more mundane.

535
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,140
Even when your tremendous forms take you to sleep,

536
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,660
you get seaweed stealing on you when they're the same.

537
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:47,660


538
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,620
theilleroo spitring tutto al salto over you.

539
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,040
Sir discovered that,

540
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,040


541
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,040


542
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,080
I'll take him by the nose.

543
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,380
Thank you.

544
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,040
Thank you.

545
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,740
Thank you.

546
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,260
Thank you.

547
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,040
Thank you.

548
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,480
Thank you.

549
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,180
Thank you.

550
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,480
Thank you.

551
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,360
Thank you.

552
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,140
Thank you.

553
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,240
Thank you.

554
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,540
Thank you.

555
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,200
Thank you.

556
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,560
Thank you.

557
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,560


558
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,560


559
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,560


560
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:48,580


561
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:48,580


562
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,060
Going Under, a Devo song covered by Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm, from his

563
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,060


564
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,000
his album called blank which I believe you can only get directly from him

565
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,500
Wilhelm stall helm at hotmail.com he was handing him out at 12x day I keep mine

566
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,400
in my love bucket fill her love bucket no point big brownie point the love

567
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,260
bucket love bucket one bucket bucket with my pocket

568
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:39,100
so while since I stayed I guess I sure believe maybe next year will be better than the last

569
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,360
I still remember the last thing that Bob said

570
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,800
now the drills go by so fast

571
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:53,980
you

572
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,840
wish she would

573
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,940
the smell of the boys and of normals

574
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:39,420
and the feeling that they all can't help but sit in my face

575
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,520
with my third eye I look across the mill

576
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,880
to see he exists on their way to burn this place

577
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,040
you

578
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,160
and it's one more day up in the saucers

579
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,880
and it's one more night in brushwood

580
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,240
if saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie

581
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,900
maybe I could

582
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,120
na na na na

583
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,000
na na na na

584
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,100

na na na na

586
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,780

587
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,400
na na na na

588
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,460
na na na na

589
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,240
na na na na

590
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,560

591
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,380

na na na

595
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:38,880


596
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:48,040
I've crisp as mug and mentioned sometime after two AM

597
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,460
making numb

598
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,460
nowb

599
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,220
ta

600
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:01,080
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower

601
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,380
Makes you talk a little lower

602
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,600
About the day that we take over

603
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,360
It's been a while since X-Day

604
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,220
And I guess I will believe

605
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,460
Maybe next year will be better than the last

606
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:28,280
I can remember all the times I played the hourglass

607
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,200
And wished my wish would make it come to pass

608
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,420
So it's 6.59 on board the saucer

609
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,420
But it's 7.01 in Brushwood

610
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,200
I have a dream

611
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,200


612
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,720
I have never made it to an X-Day

613
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,260
I guess I should

614
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:05,580
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

615
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,960

620
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,920
Yeah

621
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,500
That touching song was by our friend

622
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,580
Reverend Oroboros Rex

623
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,480
of our beloved Hour of Slack playing station

624
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,120
WEFT in Champaign, Illinois.

625
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,500
What's next is an excerpt from the audiobook

626
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,160
of Terry Pratchett's novel Men at Arms

627
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,500
although this section is about dogs at arms.

628
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,200
Terry Pratchett's novel Men at Arms

629
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,200


630
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,200


631
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,420
who is a man who has been in the guild

632
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,480
Oh dear me no

633
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,280
These are dogs that have been

634
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,440
He lowered his voice

635
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,880
Bad dogs

636
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,060
Bad dogs?

637
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,720
Bad dogs

638
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,380
You naughty boy

639
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,700
Give him a smack you bad dog

640
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,760
muttered Gaspode

641
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,640
Like some horrible litany

642
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,880
Every dog you see here right?

643
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,020
Every dog run away

644
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,120
Run away from his or her actual owner

645
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,640
Is that all?

646
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,060
All?

647
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,300
All?

648
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,860
Well of course you ain't exactly a dog

649
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,040
You wouldn't understand

650
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,880
You wouldn't know what it was like

651
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,100
But Big Fido he told him

652
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,160
Throw off your chalk chains he said

653
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,740
Bite the hand that feeds you

654
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,960
Rise up and howl

655
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,440
He gave him pride said Gaspode

656
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,320
His voice a mixture of fear and fascination

657
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,480
He told him

658
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,080
Any dog he finds not being a free spirit

659
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,340
That dog is a dead dog

660
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,440
He killed a doberman last week

661
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,300
Just for wagging his tail when a human went past

662
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,100
Angua looked at some of the other dogs

663
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,580
They were all unkempt

664
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,180
They were also in a strange way

665
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,240
Undog-like

666
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,800
There was a small and rather dainty white poodle

667
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,960
That still just about had the overgrown remains of its poodle cut

668
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,020
And a lapdog with the tattered remains of a tartan jacket still hanging from its shoulder

669
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,320
But they weren't milling around or squabbling

670
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,340
They had a uniform intent look that she'd seen before

671
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,020
Although never on dogs

672
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,760
Gaspode was clearly trembling now

673
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,740
Angua slunk over to the poodle

674
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,540
It still had a diamante collar visible under the crusty fur

675
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,680
This Big Fido she said

676
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,120
Is he some kind of wolf or what?

677
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,460
Spiritually all dogs are wolves said the poodle

678
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,220
But cynically and cruelly severed from their true destiny

679
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,340
By the manipulations of so called humanity

680
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,640
It sounded like a quote

681
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,320
Big Fido

682
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,360
Big Fido said that?

683
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,420
Angua hazarded

684
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,760
The poodle turned its head

685
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,480
For the first time she saw its eyes

686
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,660
They were red and mad as hell

687
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,480
Anything with eyes like that could kill anything it wanted

688
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,840
Because madness, true madness

689
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,620
Can drive a fist through a plank

690
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,280
Yes

691
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,640
Said Big Fido

692
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,300
He had been a normal dog

693
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,980
He'd begged and rolled over and heeled and fetched

694
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,960
Every night he'd been taken for a walk

695
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,400
There was no flash of light when it happened

696
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,980
He'd just been lying in his basket one night

697
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,900
And he'd thought about his name which was Fido

698
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,380
And the name on the basket which was Fido

699
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,240
And he thought about his blanket with Fido on it

700
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,220
And his bowl with Fido on it

701
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,880
And above all he brooded on the collar with Fido on it

702
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,200
And something somewhere deep in his brain had gone click

703
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,000
And he'd eaten his blanket

704
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,280
Savaged his owner

705
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,300
And dived out through the kitchen window

706
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,780
In the street outside a Labrador four times the size of Fido

707
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,920
Had sniggered at the collar

708
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,080
And thirty seconds later

709
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,120
Had fled whimpering

710
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,100
That had just been the start

711
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,260
The dog hierarchy was a simple matter

712
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,840
Fido had simply asked around

713
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,520
Generally in a muffled voice

714
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,060
Because he had someone's leg in his jaws

715
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,720
Until he located the leader of the largest gang of feral dogs in the city

716
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,620
People, that is dogs

717
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,280
Still talked about the fight between Fido and Barking Mad Arthur

718
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,020
A Rottweiler with one eye and a very bad temper

719
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,360
But most animals don't fight to the death

720
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,620
Only to the defeat

721
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,580
And Fido was impossible to defeat

722
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,060
He was simply a very small dog

723
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,140
A small fast killing streak with a collar

724
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,760
He'd hung on to bits of Barking Mad Arthur

725
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,460
Until Barking Mad Arthur had given in

726
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,840
And then to his amazement

727
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,340
Fido had killed him

728
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,480
There was something inexplicably determined about the dog

729
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,000
You could have sandblasted him for five minutes

730
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,100
And what was left still wouldn't have given up

731
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,180
And you'd better not turn your back on it

732
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,800
Because Big Fido had a dream

733
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:45,940
Completelylength

734
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,680
The Dog complemented his r sociales

735
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,040
But the tomorrow was only one

736
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,400
And could have forced aupported

737
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:06,040
To Tell you these stories

738
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,640
When our lives

739
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,320
I can take the luxury

740
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,300
From the state of the air

741
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,960
But it ain't a slave

742
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,840
And I seem to realize

743
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,740
We can't depend on

744
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,760
All our other love and cards

745
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,080
Such an individual

746
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,300
We have many other days

747
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,100
Trying to call attention to

748
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,020
All the little silver waves

749
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,880
We can't let the leverage in

750
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,640
By the very end instead

751
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,480
Made it cozy and bitter

752
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,580
Then they blessed

753
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,760
Their control

754
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,360
Brought us down

755
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,380
From within

756
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,220
We were caught

757
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,740
In their web

758
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,200
No way out

759
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,200
Was somewhere

760
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,860
And we were the scientists

761
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,840
Thinking of the common mind

762
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,720
Never drowsing on their mind

763
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,420
And we swiped the fear

764
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,080
With a broad sensory

765
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,940
Then it hit us very

766
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,880
Many a day they have found

767
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,640
This is a flip around

768
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,320
Forming of a story

769
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:01,820
So we write

770
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,340
On the ground

771
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:02,960
Now we call

772
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,240
Our chance

773
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,340
To be the best

774
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:03,720
We will never

775
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,300
Rushing away

776
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,700
Another day

777
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,100
And it's over

778
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:27,020
We will never

779
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,740
Say goodbye

780
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,180
Till we find

781
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


782
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


783
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


784
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


785
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


786
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


787
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


788
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


789
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


790
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


791
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,180


792
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,220
We can't

793
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,240
We means

794
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:45,240


795
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,340
One thing

796
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:46,440
Let it be

797
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:46,960
Every minute

798
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,680
It should

799
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,160
We believe

800
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,160


801
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,160


802
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,480
Matter all the time

803
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


804
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


805
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


806
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


807
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


808
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


809
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


810
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,860
To be a

811
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,160
Paranoid, because I'm the underbite.

812
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,740
We have social media, special programs, negative days,

813
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,420
triple-times and balances, triple-talking human race,

814
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,200
and now it's all about the protest.

815
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,140
There's the essence, where my choice,

816
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,100
we've been talking about the boss.

817
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,720
Trouble From Within, a new song from Rural War Room,

818
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,320
and our old, old friend, St. Byron Werner,

819
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,900
and his partner, Donovan Suit, at RuralWarRoom.com.

820
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,880
That's part of a new album by them called

821
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,640
The Flaming Yawn.

822
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,020
Before that, we heard some of the audio book

823
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,920
of Terry Pratchett's Men at Arms.

824
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,560
This has been Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius,

825
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,540
which you can learn everything about at subgenius.com.

826
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,260
The background music behind the credits here

827
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,940
is by Reverend Ron Slabe's Pyrosonic,

828
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,040
the album Pyrotopia.

829
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,860
You can find more of that at myspace.com slash pyrosonic.

830
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,400
music.

831
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,920
And now for our farewell cut,

832
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,700
an amazing mix of the songs of Genius Lullaby

833
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,340
by the late Chaz Smith and ESO,

834
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,740
recorded during his Swamp Radio show on WCSB Cleveland.

835
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,380
Praise Bob.

836
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,960
¶¶

837
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,100
¶ And dream of flying high

838
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,500
¶ On July 5th next year

839
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:44,980
¶ Go to sleep

840
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,300
¶ And dream of flying high

841
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,240
¶ On Lullaby

842
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,860
¶ Did you all see this?

843
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:52,860


844
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,920
And dreams that Bob has now

845
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,340
Sex goddesses and spirits

846
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:06,760
Shall guide your way

847
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:11,060
The smiling face of Bob

848
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,480
Will keep you safe till you're sick again

849
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,020
A sex goddess is born

850
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,920
Go to sleep now

851
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,280
By counting sheeples

852
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,260
Follow foals

853
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,340
To the hell they build

854
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,820
Follow blob

855
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:39,080
Go to sleep now

856
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,880
And dream of times when we

857
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,900
Will meet to sing

858
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,080
And praise the name

859
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,000
Of God

860
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,340
Now begin swaying back and forth

861
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,360
Sex goddesses and spirits

862
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,080
Shall guide your way

863
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,280
The smiling face of Bob

864
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,580
Will keep you safe till you're sick again

865
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,620
A sex goddesses and spirits

866
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,980
Shall guide your way

867
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,000
The smiling face of Bob

868
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,800
Will keep you safe till you're sick again
