1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:27,300
The Hour of Slack, dear friends, and we're back at the 7X Day Drill, and the puzzling

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,740
evidence show after the drill, with Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond, and we have Little Theodore,

3
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,840
and Reverend Carter LeBlanc, and Jesus Christ, and the amino acids, and Acid Corpse, plus

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,760
Reverend Lee Burles, and this music by SoSoDotta, it prays buh-uh-buh.

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,680
Oh, slack!

6
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,120
Oh, yes, dear friends, I can scarcely believe in myself, but we are out of here.

7
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:13,800
We're on our way to Ohio again, and 21X Day at Wisteria Campground, and WCSB, and finally

8
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,660
the Slacker Mansion.

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,300
So, in the meantime, we're presenting you with recordings from previous X Days.

10
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,280
This was from 2004, and it features all of the same people.

11
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,340
People who will be at 21X Day.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,360
Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond, yours truly, and many more.

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,240
Praise Bob.

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,820
Yeah, what's all this?

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,040
Keep back there.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,320
Keep back, me?

17
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,540
You know who you're talking to.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,100
Come along there, come quietly, unless you want me to put the handcuffs on.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,840
Stop where you are.

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,540
You don't know what you're doing.

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,660
I know what I'm doing, all right.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,140
Come on, get out of here.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,940
Lock him up!

24
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,240
All right, you fools.

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,560
You brought it on yourselves.

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,280
Everything would have come right if you'd only left me alone.

27
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,500
You've driven me near madness with your peering through the keyholes and gaping through the

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,120
curtains, and now you'll suffer for it.

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,980
You're crazy to know who I am, aren't you?

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,780
All right, I'll show you.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,040
I'll show you who I am, and what I am.

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,740
It was horrible.

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,860
We're through being cool.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,440
We're through being cool.

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,700
Eliminate the bosses and their slaves.

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,900
Yeah!

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,140
We're through being cool.

40
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,820
We're through being cool.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,980
Train the way to should be stuck in a tank.

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:48,760
Huh?

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,160
Train the way to try to drive you back.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Smash them!

45
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,460
We're through being cool.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,020
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,840
We're thrilled being cool.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:15,400
Well, it all started when we arrived at Reverend, no, it actually started when we arrived in Cleveland.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,320
I think.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,540
Yes, I arrived in Cleveland, too.

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,120
You arrived in Cleveland on Thursday, and I arrived in Cleveland on Wednesday.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,240
I drove separately from the airport.

53
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,420
This is me and Prince's me driving along to Cleveland.

54
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,780
You drive through a little tiny bit of Pennsylvania on the way from Ohio to New York.

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,140
Now you see the way the country looks with these barns and hay fields and so forth.

56
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,960
Very rustic and rural.

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,100
Western New York.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,580
New York State.

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,060
And crossing Pennsylvania.

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:03,380
Don't forget about all the Amish individuals, that extreme right-wing paramilitary religious cult.

61
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,200
Yes, we should pay homage to the Amish.

62
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,340
Those Amish, I kind of like those.

63
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,600
Did you see their special clothes and outfits that they wear?

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,300
Well, I was aware of the.

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,340
They've got these tight pants they wear that are short-legged and with suspenders.

66
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,840
But a special kind of leather suspender.

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,700
They don't use belts.

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,100
They have suspenders on.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,200
And then the girls wear these little bonnets and the special colored not fancy dress.

70
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,580
Yes.

71
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,680
Where is that?

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,840
That's in New York.

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,080
You're telling me this happened at the end of the world?

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
That happened on weird dresses?

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,280
It's in Western Pennsylvania and Western New York State.

76
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,160
I also put on a weird dress and participated in a drag contest.

77
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,180
Philomena.

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,240
And there he was.

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,320
You all want to know what happened.

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,400
Wincing and mincing at the subgenius drag ball which preceded the end of the world.

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,840
Oh.

82
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,540
So you guys turned into San Francisco.

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,360
Yes.

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,100
Yes, just when you thought you got away from San Francisco and were actually going to do

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,360
something not related to gender blur.

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,560
What an unpleasant surprise.

87
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,540
It follows you all the way out to Brushwood.

88
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,580
I wonder why we think we're doing so well.

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,740
But it was kind of fun because I had a chance to get in touch with my feminine side.

90
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,160
He certainly did.

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,160
I think I had when you sort of seen him mincing and sashaying around the...

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,740
Ivan Stang as everybody knows there at the end of the world.

93
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,940
Oh, Ivan Stang was dressed in a burqa as an angry Iranian woman.

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
In a burqa.

95
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,800
And I was dressed in my pink outfit with matching pink lounge pants.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,960
And it was excellent.

97
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,700
Just wonderful.

98
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,020
Meanwhile, the girls drag kinged it up with fake mustache.

99
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,100
And suit suits and so forth.

100
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
Well, there's video somewhere out there.

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,740
Yeah, there's video.

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
Dr. Howell.

103
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,400
I present to you a great man, Dr. Howell.

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,660
The keeper of church secrets.

105
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,140
Today we have a wonderful ceremony in store for us.

106
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
It is important.

107
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,100
As Bob embraces...

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,440
He's not having any fun.

110
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


111
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


112
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


113
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


114
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


116
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


118
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


119
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


120
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


121
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,440


122
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,120
The Karni and the knowledgeable subgenius must endure, indulge in and withstand the

123
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,800
embrace of the conspiracy that we explore the viewpoint of the opposite sex by being

124
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,620
that person and letting our inner nature come forth.

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,100
Who will be next to show off his or her magnificence?

126
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,860
Does that not have any sign of it?

127
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,580
Here we are.

128
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,000
My name is Bob Karni.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
My name is Helge and I want to have intercourse with your eyeball.

130
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Ah yes, the eye socket to me theme.

131
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,560
You may have seen the Miss America contest.

132
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,400
They always ask the girls, you know, what are your plans?

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,080
And they always say they want to work with troubled children or be a brain surgeon.

134
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,000
Or unless they lose where they get to be a stripper.

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,340
And now we have, I'm not certain I know the name of your identity.

136
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,240
You better tell them.

137
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,860
Philomena.

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,760
Philomena Drummond.

139
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,700
And she is just as cute as a Junebug, as they say.

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,000
A little simpering perhaps, but in the spirit of things, certainly.

141
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,700
What's it like to be an overwoman?

142
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes, what's it like to be an overwoman for a change?

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I just don't know.

144
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,600
It's silly or something, I don't know.

145
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,320
Well, he's just flowing with the spirit.

146
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,100
He's just a spirit of the occasion.

147
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,280
Anything else?

148
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,860
Go pee!

149
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,020
Oh dear, well, that's the problem with women.

150
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,740
They have to go pee every few seconds.

151
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,140
But we forgive them readily, we do.

152
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,780
Alright, who is next?

153
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,520
I was drinking these all day.

154
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,340
I passed out.

155
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,460
I woke up in a dress.

156
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,540
And I was told to come up here by those who call themselves my friends.

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,520
And introduce myself as Sexy Mortis.

158
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,220
I'm throwing up right now.

159
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm coming for you, girl.

160
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,660
Oh my.

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,040
Well, we can only imagine what will happen off stage, inflamed by the passions of this event.

162
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:42,340
Here's someone who appears to be a devotee of America's national pastimes.

163
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,240
You're winning!

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,600
Yeah!

165
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,600
Just so you all know, I am a pitcher and not a catcher.

166
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,080
An important distinction.

167
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,520
You know, and every year I come here, this is actually technically, this is my sixth X-Day.

168
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,360
And every year I come here, and I come here believing.

169
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,140
Not just wanting to believe, I come here believing the saucers will arrive.

170
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,380
July 5th, 7 a.m.

171
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,920
The saucers are gonna be here.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
We're gonna be swept up.

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
We're gonna be caught up.

174
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,580
We're gonna be...

175
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:30,580
sucked into the conceptual orifices of pan-galactic uber-thought beings.

176
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,600
Projections that will gratify our every urge.

177
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,980
We're gonna be taken away from all this shit.

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
It's gonna finally happen in every single year.

179
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,180
I don't even fucking get up at 7 a.m.

180
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
Because you know what?

181
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,080
I know in my gut they didn't make it.

182
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,440
Again.

183
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,560
And what happens?

184
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,000
I have become utterly disillusioned.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,960
I walk away from this going, you know, that was a hell of a party, but god damn it, we didn't get the saucers.

186
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,860
And I find myself struggling with this.

187
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,700
How can I continue to involve myself in an organization that continually lets me down?

188
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,280
It's not like I get sex from the church, you know?

189
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,820
It's not like I get nothing.

190
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,840
It's not like I get money from the church.

191
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,680
It's not like I get friends from the...

192
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,500
Well, okay, actually I have gotten granted a lot of friends out of this.

193
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,740
But regardless, the thing is, is there's this issue of doubt.

194
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,860
There's this, why am I doing this?

195
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,320
Why am I putting myself through this?

196
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,020
And why do I even waste my time with this?

197
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,600
And the thing is, is that's a gift.

198
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,420
That's a gift.

199
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,820
Because, I mean, ask Heisenberg.

200
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
Ask Goodell.

201
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,000
Ask Schrodinger.

202
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
Ask fucking Einstein.

203
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,460
The universe floats in a haze of quantum indeterminacy.

204
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,480
Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law, you know?

205
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,320
I mean, I, yeah, I don't know, I was quoting the Thelemites and all that shit.

206
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,800
No, the thing is, is the universe fluctuates and floats in a haze of quantum indeterminacy.

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,640
That means that you will never know.

208
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,820
Because it just might not work out that way.

209
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,540
It's called, it's called relativity.

210
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,100
It's called improbability.

211
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,300
It's called, you know, it's, it's called slack.

212
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,660
Because you know what?

213
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,820
You don't need to know.

214
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,940
I see babies cry.

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,460
I watch them grow.

216
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,060
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.

217
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:08,500
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world.

218
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,120
Hey, yeah, maybe it's a wonderful world.

219
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,600
Burp.

220
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,460
And sob.

221
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,220
And Connie.

222
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,120
But we're stuck down here on this slack-forsaken planet.

223
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,000
God damn it.

224
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,880
And I have a few beefs with a deity named Yahweh One.

225
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,960
Lord, I really want to know.

226
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,700
Why did you make the mosquitoes?

227
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,780
The richy bites can really bring me down.

228
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,660
And why did you make the flies and cockroaches?

229
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,100
And other nasty bugs and birds around?

230
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,780
And tell me, why are humans so fucked up?

231
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,920
And why do they want to blow us all up?

232
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,200
And why do they hate each other when they're so much like each other?

233
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,540
I want to know.

234
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,120
Yeah.

235
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,060
What's going on with the weather?

236
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,020
I'm always oh so hot or very cold.

237
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,900
It seems it's always raining or snowing.

238
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,400
And tell you, Lord, it's getting pretty old.

239
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,800
And tell me, why are pinks all so fucked up?

240
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,760
And why are they trying to blow us all up?

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,000
And why do they hate each other when they're so much like each other?

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,360
I want to know.

243
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,660
Yeah, I really wonder just what you were thinking.

244
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,620
How could you let them go so far astray?

245
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,740
You must have been down on the corner drinking.

246
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,500
And that's why they're all so fucked up today.

247
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,060
Now I know.

248
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,140
That's why they're all so fucked up.

249
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
And that's why they're about to blow us all up.

250
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
And that's why they hate each other when they're so much like each other.

251
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,480
And now I know.

252
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,600
Yeah.

253
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,920
Now there were some scary looking people there, but then there were some beautiful people.

254
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,840
And you were there.

255
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,080
And you also.

256
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,720
And you.

257
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,200
And you.

258
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,260
And you.

259
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,740
And you.

260
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,940
And really you were.

261
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,800
But not you.

262
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,580
And you know, but I learned there's no place like home.

263
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:37,980
Yes.

264
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,260
There's no place like home.

265
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,980
Except Brushwood.

266
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,340
Except, but Brushwood is our home now.

267
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,780
That's true.

268
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,580
Could you imagine living out there in one of those little special living places under the trees at Brushwood?

269
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,420
Yes, one could live out there under the trees and watch as Magdalene paraded by in her finery.

270
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,800
She came by several, I became Magdalene's official clothing approval person.

271
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,160
Yes, I think we all did.

272
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Each day she came in and paraded her vineyard.

273
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:15,320
She had various and numerous outfits in front of me in various states of dress and undress, I might add.

274
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,820
Very thoughtful of her.

275
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,600
Very thoughtful.

276
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,000
Reverend Mary Magdalene, the wife of Jesus.

277
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,540
Yes, and a great sub-Jesus and a great American.

278
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,380
And Jesus was beaten severely.

279
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,180
Yes, they always do abuse our Lord at these affairs.

280
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,440
Yes.

281
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,040
Nikki, I think, was drunk and high one night and decided to come up with this thing.

282
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,800
None of us have seen Passion, but we're going to try and reenact it.

283
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,680
They're all the same.

284
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,940
They all have the same story.

285
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,580
I read the comic book.

286
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,600
We wrote down the Station of the Cross, but then we lost the piece of paper we wrote it on.

287
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,520
So we don't even have that as a guideline.

288
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,000
But we do know the first thing that happens is that Jesus is condemned.

289
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
And we're going to have you do that part in the stage.

290
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,160
And then I'm just going to walk down the road from the stage to the frocks and just walk down the road.

291
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,020
And then I'm going to have people beat me and spit on me and yell at me.

292
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,900
And then I fall once or something.

293
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,520
So why are you doing all the makeup and get up?

294
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,760
Doesn't that happen every year anyway?

295
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
Well, I don't know.

296
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:26,580
The fate of this so-called king of the sub-geniuses, his fate has been left up to his people.

297
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,260
The pathetic rabble, underclass sub-humans, whatever you...

298
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,280
Or is it the Jews? I can't remember.

299
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,940
Sub-geniuses, Jews, one of those things with a J in it.

300
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,980
Sub-geniuses, alright.

301
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,440
You sub-geniuses decide his fate.

302
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,520
I wash my hands of it.

303
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,480
Where is my pilot?

304
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
Burn it!

305
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,320
Burn it?

306
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,540
No, burning things against the law in the Roman Catholic Church in this particular alternative universe.

307
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,880
Lock him! Lock him!

308
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,660
Sex-wise is a murderer, a rapist, and a sub-genius.

309
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,420
That's true.

310
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, well, he was going to be executed.

311
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,540
He should take my place.

312
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,920
Okay, we're going to crucify somebody.

313
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,860
It's either going to be this obscene, disgusting murderer, this crackhead,

314
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,640
who's raped and pillaged, he's actually stolen all of your cars, raped all of your daughters,

315
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,000
and your wives, and your moms, and your dads,

316
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,280
or you can either crucify him, or as they used to do in ancient America,

317
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,120
you can instead crucify this guy who talks about peace all the time and smokes pot.

318
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,940
Kill him!

319
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,360
I thought so.

320
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,100
Oh, by the way, he also promotes free sex and says women are equal.

321
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,000
Kill him!

322
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,820
I thought that would do it.

323
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,280
Where's your God now, eh, Jesus?

324
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,640
Let us trick him!

325
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,160
Make him fall!

326
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,460
Oh, how legit!

327
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,140
Death to the king of the...

328
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,200
...genius!

329
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Special effects.

330
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm going to break your legs with my blood.

331
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,780
Dead!

332
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,540
Let him be sprayed with pink fake blood rather than bright red fake blood.

333
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,180
What do you have to say to yourself?

334
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,360
I'm going to buy scum!

335
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,100
I have my own stick. Is this one okay?

336
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,700
Okay, now scum!

337
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
That's a golf club!

338
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,720
He's allergic to golf clubs!

339
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,840
I will take your cross!

340
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,120
Bring out the gasoline!

341
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,600
He stole his dollar sign and he's got his wallet too!

342
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,720
Okay!

343
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,580
It's time to strip him of his garments!

344
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,860
It is the foreskin of Jesus and it will go on sale at the Buldada auction.

345
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,040
Here it is.

346
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,780
Look at the size of that foreskin.

347
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,640
Look at the urethra hole in the end there.

348
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,300
It proves I'm Jewish.

349
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,520
This man...

350
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,620
This man has what it takes.

351
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,540
One hell of a circumcision.

352
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
Look, he's still bleeding.

353
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,480
Truly, he was the son of God.

354
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,220
I'm the funniest fellow you ever heard.

355
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,940
My mother's a virgin, my father's a bird.

356
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,380
So here's to the disciples in Galilee and fuck them all and we'll all live free.

357
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,960
Maybe you should wipe his ass.

358
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,100
James Joyce said that.

359
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,960
Well, I thought that was very successful except it seemed rather anticlimactic.

360
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,240
Weren't we supposed to like kill him or something?

361
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,540
Couldn't we put like pour gasoline?

362
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,920
Why did we stop at the 6th station?

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
Couldn't we pour gasoline on him and burn him like as a protest against the Iraq war or something?

364
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,360
Yeah!

365
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,040
No, you'd have to cut his head off for that.

366
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,060
Yeah, that's great.

367
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,140
Behead all that you can behead.

368
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,840
Blah, blah, blah.

369
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,180
The brokers and the money changers shall be snatched and ruptured and from their faces

370
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,380
shall be burnt their noses and from their loins dried the fluids of the babe and it

371
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,000
shall be gone unto drainage and my winepress shall spill over with the blood of saints and

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,640
elders and the invisible burning blood of the angels shall wash across the taverns and

373
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,920
the houses of ill women and the great library where our kept men are buried.

374
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,760
The profane tablets and ships of false wisdom and the cameras of the pornographer.

375
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:11,740
For the sins are of the number nine hundred and nine and fourscore and ten and of them

376
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:18,120
the first is the dropping of the body's voided things unto the white linens of the lamb and

377
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,900
the second is the sin of laying ye down beside the small children and the penetration and

378
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,920
rending asunder thereof.

379
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,900
And of this sin are those without number in its place.

380
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:28,900


381
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:28,900


382
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,280
This is a practice.

383
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,700
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

384
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,360
Here are lay these naked children which are unto cherubs and woes their innocence be fouled

385
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,740
by the profane and the unrepentant and those without remorse and even though they touch

386
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,380
not these babes their images of the beast enter into them the children as they sleep

387
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,800
staring into the lamp of hell which is the devil's jewel.

388
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,680
Hey everybody, put your finger in your nose.

389
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,300
.

390
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,900
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your clothes.

391
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,240
.

392
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,300
I don't know how you feel one way or another.

393
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,780
.

394
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,680
It makes you feel happy then wipe one on your brother.

395
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,080
.

396
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
Drive in your car and you're looking at your neighbor.

397
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,280
.

398
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,280


399
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,280


400
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,400
My nuggets from his nostrils like a saver in the labor.

401
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,200
.

402
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,900
Pulling, he's tugging, he's shaking on a string.

403
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,280
.

404
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,800
It's a long slimy string.

405
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,160
.

406
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,260
.

407
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,440
.

408
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,580
.

409
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,960
.

410
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,020
.

411
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,080
.

412
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,180
.

413
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,220
.

414
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,300
.

415
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,340
.

416
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,080
.

417
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,040
.

418
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,580
.

419
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,040
.

420
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,060
. . . . . . . . .

421
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:12,800
.

422
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:12,820
.

423
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:12,820


424
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:12,820


425
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:12,820


426
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,540
Hey everybody

427
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,800
Put your finger in your nose

428
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,920
Kick your butt around

429
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,940
And wipe it on your throat

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,340
I don't know how you feel

431
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,160
One way or another

432
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,600
Kick your finger out

433
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,420
And wipe it on your throat

434
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,320
guitar solo

435
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,940
Everybody's doing it

436
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,800
Everybody's doing it

437
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,240
Everybody's doing it

438
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,120
Everybody's doing it

439
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,320
Pick a burger out and wrap it on your chewing hands

440
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,760
Everybody's doing it, everybody's doing it

441
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,660
Click a burger!

442
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,460
Click a burger!

443
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
Click a burger!

444
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,020
Click a burger! Click a burger!

445
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:39,000
Dr. Drummond, did you know that recent scientific studies have proven that people who eat their boogers

446
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,900
are on the whole healthier than those who don't?

447
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,300
Because it helps stimulate your immune system constantly

448
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,460
to actually devour the stuff that your nose filters catch

449
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,640
It helps prevent disease

450
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,180
So man, you're free, man, you're free!

451
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,960
We're all free, finally!

452
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,420
Nose pickers are free!

453
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,000
So if you've been storing some up there, way up there in the front

454
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,100
Bring it all out now

455
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,520
Don't be outrageous!

456
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Pick a burger!

457
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,360
Pick a burger!

458
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,720
The conspiracy tried to make you believe it was bad!

459
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,120
Why?

460
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
Just because it's gross?

461
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,100
Is that all?

462
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,140
It's not like it tastes bad!

463
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,960
That was the last song

464
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,600
Why did they hide the camera?

465
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,340
That was the last song, Reverend Stagg

466
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,280
Please stop, X-Forgers!

467
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,900
I know you wanted to sing about the boogers, but you didn't

468
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
I know he wanted to sing about the boogers

469
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,820
Please stop, X-Forgers!

470
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,880
But this isn't a song about boogers anymore

471
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,960
This was obviously the worst day of all days!

472
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,880
We were trying to get out of boogers

473
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,860
It was the worst day, obviously!

474
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,600
Fuck Bob, fuck X!

475
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,180
Stop the X-Forgers!

476
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,240
I am Peter!

477
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:11,880
Stop them!

478
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:11,880


479
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:11,880


480
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,840
It is over. University is over.

481
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,760
Why do you ex-torture me, Bob?

482
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,240
It was obviously the worst day.

483
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:39,640
It was the day that the song once again reminded us in its full glory

484
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,260
that it absolutely, after all, refused to die.

485
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,060
Yes, it's true.

486
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,140
The song refused to die.

487
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,280
Still hasn't died.

488
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,200
Even if everyone in the world tried to kill it, that wouldn't matter.

489
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,860
Only one thing could kill the song, and that would be if the song wanted to die.

490
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,940
Oh, yeah.

491
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,620
Oh, yeah.

492
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:09,620


493
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,460
If only the song knew how bad it was, maybe it would want to die and finally give up.

494
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,680
But even though it knew that it was bad, even though it knew it hurt the audience,

495
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,120
the song refused to fucking die.

496
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,480
Oh, yeah.

497
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,720
It was just having too much fun being a bad song.

498
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
It was just having a blast.

499
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,680
The song was, anyway.

500
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,160
I don't know about the audience.

501
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,160
I don't know about the musicians or the late musicians,

502
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,620
the former musicians who once worked on the song and tried to escape the song,

503
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,940
but even when you get away from the song,

504
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,360
even when the song's been gone for years,

505
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,800
even when you thought the last time you heard the song was in Arkansas,

506
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,480
God damn it, the song that refused to die always comes back.

507
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,820
Even when you think the song that refused to die has died,

508
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,000
somebody makes some unexpected noise.

509
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,920
This song has a beat.

510
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,160
Somebody starts snoring in the trailer.

511
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,980
This song actually has a tune.

512
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,340
In a solemn moment.

513
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,760
And at that time, you know that the song has still refused to die.

514
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
Yep, it's back.

515
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,160
When somebody farts at a funeral, that's part of the song that refused to die.

516
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,320
When somebody lies to you.

517
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,960
You believe it.

518
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,840
That's part of the song that refused to die.

519
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,260
No!

520
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,720
No!

521
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,520
No!

522
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,440
When Spinks Drummond had to go to the hospital screaming,

523
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,660
that was part of the song that refused to die.

524
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,220
You have to go to the hospital.

525
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,780
When Philodrummond burst out of his mother's pussy screaming,

526
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,960
that was part of the song that refused to die.

527
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,480
I think you need to go to the hospital.

528
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,380
When he broke a string and cussed,

529
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,720
that was part of the song that refused to die.

530
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,380
Although, what do you think?

531
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,600
distancing variety of instrument from song for those who play concentricist 그게

532
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,060
But as easier to memorize and exciting that there were a number of Soviet times so you can cuss.

533
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


534
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


535
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


536
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


537
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


538
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


539
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


540
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,060


541
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,700
Theرض

542
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,780
The songs

543
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:22,940
Let's enjoy

544
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,460
There was one

545
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,460


546
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,460


547
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,460


548
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,460


549
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,740
It will but

550
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:25,740


551
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,200
it will

552
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,060
be

553
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,960
Don's

554
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


555
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


556
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


557
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


558
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


559
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


560
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


561
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


562
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


563
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,280
Shy

564
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,460
Sin

565
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,480
guitar solo

566
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,400
But wait, but wait, but wait.

567
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,760
It wasn't dead yet.

568
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,260
See and be awed

569
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,740
and thank the Lord

570
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,300
that you too were not born like them.

571
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,420
Come one, come all.

572
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,940
Do you dare to see

573
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,320
the eighth and ninth wonders

574
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,580
of the world?

575
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,240
Little Theodore and

576
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,180
a babushka!

577
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,080


578
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,260
I don't know what to do.

579
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,240
I don't know what to do.

580
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,380
I don't know what to do.

581
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,380
I don't know what to do.

582
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:22,700
I don't know what to do!

583
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,700
I spin around in circles till I think that I might fall

584
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,740
And if I take two steps in a row, I'm walking down a wall

585
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,720
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

586
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,700
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

587
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,040
The only time I'm happy when I'm sitting on the bar

588
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,100
And if I think of going somewhere I can't make it to the door

589
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
I don't know what to do

590
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,900
ooooooooooooooooh

591
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,340
ooh

592
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,300
I don't know what to do!

593
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:57,260
And so the dark side has won and evil has triumphed in the form of a tiny gene.

594
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,360
Yes, a rapacious, greedy gene that Dr. Moreau failed to remove.

595
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:11,380
A gene, a tiny code made of simple chemicals, basic chemicals common to all life all over the universe.

596
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,440
Amino acids they're called.

597
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:23,100
Yes, they exist in space in fragmented, distorted, mutated, ugly, rude, foul-smelling forms such as seen here.

598
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:36,760
However, these chemicals which are spread throughout the universe in unknown quantities can result in life from out of space.

599
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,420
Yes, life from out of space.

600
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,000
And such life can take many forms.

601
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,100
Forms pleasing to the human eye and others which we would consider monstrous.

602
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,040
Remember, to them, maybe we're the monsters.

603
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,880
Heavy, isn't it?

604
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:09,040
Friends, countrymen, subgeniuses, Brushwood, now here, the amino acids.

605
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Here are their

606
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,180
Thank you.

607
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,360
Thank you.

608
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,100
Thank you.

609
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,480
Thank you.

610
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,560
Thank you.

611
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,200
Thank you.

612
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,880
Thank you.

613
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,860
These reactions are normal.

614
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,340
Enjoy them.

615
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,280
They broke all their equipment.

616
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,360
They even broke

617
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,160
the microphone.

618
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,580
There's blood

619
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,400
and sperm

620
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,960
all over the stage.

621
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,760
Should we clap?

622
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,960
Should we clap

623
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,660
for the amino acids? Nay.

624
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,260
For the amino acids

625
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:32,820
are

626
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,060
above and beyond clapping.

627
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,820
Also, they are deaf.

628
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,100
I don't know if they...

629
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,440
Well, they couldn't mention that because they're dumb, too.

630
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,340
Yes, the amino acids...

631
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,220
The amino acids are deaf,

632
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,300
and they can't hear what they do.

633
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,860
But their blood and sperm

634
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,120
has been left here for us to analyze.

635
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,540
Perhaps they've gone back to their own planet.

636
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,280
We must now go on, yes, on, onward.

637
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,040
We must not mourn for the amino acids.

638
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,540
Nay, nor the pinks who must die,

639
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,240
nor ourselves who must continue to go back to work,

640
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,540
perhaps, someday, if the Xs don't get here.

641
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,320
But now, we should go to the Bonfils.

642
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,940
Yes, where we can burn, burn, burn, burn, burn!

643
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,160
Burn!

644
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,520
Not stored in any souls, dear friends.

645
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,840
So buy, buy, and do not share.

646
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,800
Only buy.

647
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,600
Forget sharing and niceness.

648
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,640
Remember only consuming.

649
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,520
Consuming.

650
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,300
Buying.

651
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,960
And selling.

652
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,680
Because Bob came to me in a dream, friends.

653
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,300
He looked me in the eye and he said,

654
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Stang!

655
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,940
I want you to stop buying and start selling!

656
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,020
So get out that most sacred organ.

657
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,060
Just unzip your pants, bend over,

658
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,320
and yank out that big ol' stinky wallet.

659
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,980
And exercise the tool of the subgenius that is your tongue.

660
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,360
And promise with your tongue to pledge.

661
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,100
And then back up your pledge.

662
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,640
Yes, look at that green and cabbage changing hands.

663
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,960
Yes, that is the moment of the true magic happens.

664
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,360
At that moment of transfer, energy, friends.

665
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,600
The life is the money.

666
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,900
I mean the blood.

667
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,280
Or, well, the money and the blood and the slack.

668
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,300
And the life is the money.

669
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,740
I fall mixed together with the sperm and blood on the stage

670
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,840
of the X-Day revival at Brushwood.

671
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,880
No parking except for Bob.

672
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,960
You're all married now.

673
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
We're holy men and we can say that.

674
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,180
Although also, I might add,

675
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,860
by virtue of the fact that I'm a holy man,

676
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,360
I now declare that you may, as of this moment on,

677
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,500
do anything that you want.

678
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,120
Go ahead.

679
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,220
I said it.

680
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,200
You can go ahead and do it.

681
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,360
That's the authority of the holy man.

682
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,920
You can do anything if only you will believe.

683
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,600
Now Hal, on the other hand, spent most of his time pickling in a large vat of hot water.

684
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,280
It was a spa-like treatment at Brushwood.

685
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,060
He couldn't stay out of it.

686
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,760
There was a magnet in the bottom of the,

687
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,000
it was a water magnet in the bottom of the hot tub that continually attracted Hal back.

688
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,200
Not just a hot tub, but a hot tub.

689
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,820
But a pool as well.

690
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,680
But also the pool.

691
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,440
A pool of young talent that was there.

692
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,300
And there was many, many bounteous,

693
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,840
beauteous babes that were lolling and cajoling Hal in those pools.

694
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,880
They wanted to comfort me because me and Philo and Doug wanted me to come to the stage and do rants and so forth.

695
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,140
And all Hal could do was stay in the hot tub,

696
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,660
crying like a little baby, being comforted by the beautiful young,

697
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,760
and might I add, very well built young ladies.

698
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,480
They offered much comfort, I'm telling you.

699
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:20,520
And they provided a soft, warm respite to Reverend Hal.

700
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,240
No kidding, when you and Stang left they patted me and said, there, there, it's alright.

701
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,240
They patted you all over your entire body.

702
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,200
They massaged your every muscle.

703
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,840
They gave me emphatic hugs just in the spirit of fellowship and brotherly love.

704
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,560
No, I tell you, you're a lousy one.

705
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,200
But how about those rebates?

706
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:50,400
You laugh, and that's not what was, you wouldn't have laughed had you seen the mighty Dr. Hal lolling and cajoling.

707
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,760
There wasn't time enough for me to get up and get down to the stage anyway.

708
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,940
But what about when we just brought you the microphone to the hot tub, so you could just...

709
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,340
That might have been a solution to the problem.

710
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,260
That's when we had the cardboard cutout of Dr. Hal on the stage, but his voice was coming from the hot tub.

711
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,760
He was singing that favorite song.

712
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:16,580
I did lead a round of subtenuous songs in the hot tub room in the middle of the night.

713
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,300
I didn't start them, the others did.

714
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,020
I'm sure she wonders where you are.

715
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,660
Up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky.

716
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,340
This is what Hal was saying to him.

717
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,320
He said, get out of here.

718
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,880
Before I have the time to change my mind.

719
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,680
Yeah, because you know that's what this X Day is all about.

720
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,900
Young girl, get out of my mind.

721
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,440
This is Hal redoing the Gary Puckett song from X Day live.

722
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,540
Pretty good, huh? This is of course karaoke.

723
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,500
Now we had the Hal cutout doll at this point in time.

724
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:05,420
The girls were dancing, beginning to dance, and the young ladies and women and women were all...

725
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,660
cavorting and lollygagging.

726
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,960
Some of them were quite formidable in appearance.

727
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,900
Some were gallivanting even.

728
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,380
Some were galumphing, you could say.

729
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,140
Across the stage with their mighty boots on.

730
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,260
Yes, they're... well, I won't say it.

731
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,880
Their big hobnail boots, the ones that they stomp you with.

732
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,120
Right, you wouldn't want to be on their bad side, let's put it that way.

733
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:34,800
As they soaked in the baptism of the genetically engineered Frankenwater of Brushwood.

734
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,860
H2-uh.

735
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,000
As opposed to the Weirwater, which is H2-awr.

736
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,120
Well, friends, yes, we put the un in fundamentalism.

737
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,880
And the foo in fundamentalism.

738
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,380
And, friends, but best of all, we put the ha in hate.

739
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,020
That's a new bumper sticker for you.

740
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,160
We put the ha in hate.

741
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,120
Ah, yes.

742
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,160
And, in fact, we also put the very low in love.

743
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:20,640
We can take a soaring emotion like love and just make it low and pig-wallowing sex.

744
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,920
That's true love, friends.

745
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,860
You'll pay not to really think.

746
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,940
That was another one.

747
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,780
Actually, to tell the truth, first off, let me say I'm basically stalling.

748
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,180
For the amino acids.

749
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,800
And, uh, because we want to get them on stage.

750
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,540
And get them burning up this stage fast.

751
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:54,320
Because right down the hill in the roundhouse is a mighty Dobbs icon and a mighty big pile of frop.

752
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,980
Ready to be burnt.

753
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,240
Burnt as a sacrificial offering to that man, Bob.

754
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,760
And they're not just the wood and the frop will be burnt.

755
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:04,760


756
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,600
But that which means the most to you will be burnt.

757
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,200
Your faith in Bob itself.

758
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,800
Ah, yes.

759
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,940
Praise Bob and let him go up in smoke.

760
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:25,020
So that the exes will know that at long last there's somebody down here worth evacuating.

761
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:34,740
If you're going to feel silly about fighting for the saucers, feel silly the hell out of it.

762
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,240
I like that of a metaphor.

763
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


764
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,200
Once again the King falls.

765
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,980
We kill Kennedy, everyone of us,

766
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,900
It was you and me, we kill Bob.

767
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,340
It wasn't muzzling evidence and his dentures and his gun.

768
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,900
It was we who killed Bob. Yes.

769
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,400
He was born from our own jowls, ripped from our livers.

770
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:03,760
And.

771
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,140
And, uh, spunk in our wet dreams.

772
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,240
And so we too shall destroy him like Frankenstein's monster.

773
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, wait.

774
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,660
No, Frankenstein's monster destroys Frankenstein.

775
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,280
I guess.

776
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,180
I don't know.

777
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,820
I don't know.

778
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,680
I don't know.

779
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,560
Each subgenius old lowerarchy guy had his own 16-room house.

780
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,280
It was so great.

781
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,860
And each one was a what?

782
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,980
A steel cylinder.

783
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:31,260
What?

784
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,160
We got to live in our house for like 12 seconds a day.

785
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,740
It's all.

786
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,880
Because there were so many sycophants who needed your time.

787
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,940
They called our cabin animal house because of the decaying piles of watermelon covered

788
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,700
with seething ants that finally deposited around the outside of the shower.

789
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,740
The life before.

790
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:58,060
But right across the street from us was the special private hot tub and spa which only

791
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,740
X Day's staff.

792
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,560
Could use.

793
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,760
Because the thing is so big now, folks.

794
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,900
I mean, with that many people showing up, you have to have separate areas for the, uh.

795
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,920
At least for the hygiene.

796
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,880
Yeah, the, the Finkarati go to the.

797
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,100
Ow.

798
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,580
Go to the special.

799
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:14,960
One of my brain.

800
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,540
Non-hygienic areas.

801
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,380
Suspension cable just snapped.

802
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,300
A water swimming pool.

803
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,160
There it went again.

804
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,000
The other one has snapped now.

805
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,960
That leaves your brain floating in space now.

806
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,480
Oh, you had three of them.

807
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,440
Wow.

808
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:29,840
Wow.

809
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,840
Very good.

810
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,000
Three brains.

811
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,600
You know, that's, uh, two more than most.

812
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,760
Whoa, two more popped.

813
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,160
Man.

814
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,220
This doesn't look right, man.

815
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,620
I'm not sure what's going on here.

816
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,380
Those are brains.

817
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,720
They were.

818
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,080
They started out as brains.

819
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,040
You can kind of see the resemblance of brains to them right now when you look at them.

820
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,940
Now, uh, see, they can lift up.

821
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,420
They can fly.

822
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,080
Oh, no, they're not brains.

823
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,160
They're just cheap sound effects.

824
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,100
Oh, sorry.

825
00:49:59,380 --> 00:49:59,840
Sorry.

826
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,600
I didn't know I was on the air.

827
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,500
Can you imagine if this show was on in the daytime?

828
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,560
The gigantic information engine that would boom across America.

829
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,480
Then we'd have to sell commercials and stuff like that.

830
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,000
Blanking over the information superhighway.

831
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,480
We'd have products we'd be selling on the show.

832
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,300
Yeah.

833
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,900
I saw quite a few products there, and many of them used my art.

834
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,020
Do people come to X-Day and sell all the stuff?

835
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:23,600
Your stuff?

836
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,500
At the sell, sell, sell, sell.

837
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,180
Yeah, they do.

838
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,240
They sell their stuff.

839
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,440
They sell their brawnies.

840
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,180
They sell their arms.

841
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,620
They sell their chilly winter nights.

842
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,120
They're snugly come wrapped.

843
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,180
And they sell space on their butts.

844
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,500
They sell their oil-burning miner's lamps.

845
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,000
They sell their chop, chop, chops.

846
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,180
But they all want to ingratiate themselves with the older sub-gleemies.

847
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,520
Well, that's a good thing.

848
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,540
That's what this culture for.

849
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,600
They sell their rattlesnakes.

850
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,580
They sell their bodies.

851
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,340
Now, there was one quite lovely young lady who was dancing around the fire.

852
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,520
Oops, and they spill the coffee at Pirate Cat Radio.

853
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,300
This woman was...

854
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,560
I'm really sorry to hear about that.

855
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,460
Well, the...

856
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,520
No.

857
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,240
What are you doing with that on the alley?

858
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,620
Are you talking about the Marine?

859
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,980
Are you talking about the Marine?

860
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,280
I'm talking about...

861
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,320
Yes, she was in the Marine Corps.

862
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,280
She was headed for Japan as a corporal in the Marine Corps.

863
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,600
But there she was at Brushwood dancing around unclad around the fire.

864
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,880
Hey, you need that kind of thing.

865
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,600
Yes, well, and she was quite nice.

866
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,920
You always notice if they don't have clothes on, don't you?

867
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,340
Well, they want you to notice.

868
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

869
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,500
Anyway, and...

870
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:29,500


871
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:29,500


872
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,220
Anyway, there were all sorts of folks dancing around out there.

873
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,000
Not all, so...

874
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,800
She actually jammed with the band on the Friday night, too.

875
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,920
She came up and did a song.

876
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,300
She was really quite something, and it was amazing to learn she was heading back to military

877
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,540
service after the Civil War.

878
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,380
She was sweet.

879
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,140
Yeah.

880
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,580
She was.

881
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,660
She came up, she introduced herself to me.

882
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,480
She was quite nice.

883
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,320
And I'm trying to...

884
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,600
I think her name was Lee or something, wasn't it?

885
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,940
Well, now it's all there in the record book.

886
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,320
Lee or D or B or G or K.

887
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,500
Then the great day is finally upon us.

888
00:51:59,500 --> 00:51:59,500


889
00:51:59,500 --> 00:51:59,500


890
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,140
They're all Marines are Lee.

891
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,820
It's an honorary name given to Marines after the Civil War.

892
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,620
Forget King Kong, just remember Urban Gorilla.

893
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,520
We had a beautiful female vocalist...

894
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,500
La, la, la, la.

895
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,760
...gracing our stage.

896
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,340
Woo!

897
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,700
Reverend Lee Burles had a song she wanted to share with us, folks.

898
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,640
And I'm sure it'll be better if you hear it.

899
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,740
Don't pull your love out on me, babe.

900
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,600
Oh, sorry.

901
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,120
Sorry.

902
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,400
Sorry.

903
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,200
Okay, this is the first time I've done this with an audience or whatever.

904
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,200
Yeah.

905
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,380
Can I take it off?

906
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:36,920
Can I hold it?

907
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,080
Yeah, you can take it off.

908
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,580
Take it off.

909
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,400
Woo!

910
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,300
Yeah!

911
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,120
A lady just entered the room.

912
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,660
Take your hats off.

913
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,000
Let's have some decorum here.

914
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,300
I mean, after all, we all...

915
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,120
Everybody here is a subgenius, so come on.

916
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,260
Let's tone it down.

917
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,000
This is a great day.

918
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


919
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


920
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


921
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


922
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


923
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


924
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


925
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,220


926
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,600
This is like, came to me one day.

927
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,280
It was really weird.

928
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,380
So, and...

929
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,580
Those feelings rolling like a rollercoaster.

930
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,680
Those feelings rolling like a rollercoaster.

931
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,640
Those feelings rolling like a rollercoaster.

932
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,260
The venture that doesn't end.

933
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,500
Excitement builds within the spirit.

934
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,120
A smile blossoms upon the face.

935
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,400
An understanding not spoken.

936
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,340
Spiraling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

937
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,080
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

938
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,000
Spacecrafts forgotten.

939
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,760
Space junk, the funk that makes your limbs want to move.

940
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,140
Now we're in the groove.

941
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,540
Galaxy swirling, comets burning, vibrations around us.

942
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,340
Such a great experience.

943
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,960
Going to share it with the universe.

944
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,220
How would you do it?

945
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,120
Different ways for each individual.

946
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,480
Trails created.

947
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,020
A path your own expression.

948
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,980
The journey has just begun.

949
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,320
Spiraling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

950
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:57,320


951
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,980
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

952
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,000
Spacecrafts forgotten.

953
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,180
Space junk, the funk that makes our limbs want to move.

954
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,740
Now we're in the groove.

955
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,540
Galaxy swirling, comets burning, vibrations around us.

956
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,920
So much is happening in one moment.

957
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,460
Lose your mind?

958
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,000
See what you find?

959
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,120
More than the bump and grind.

960
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,020
It's your time to follow your hints, and find more.

961
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,200
Pretend that you have finished and get all the answers.

962
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,200


963
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,200


964
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,200


965
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,900
It's just a glimpse of so much more.

966
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,020
Wondering what is the score?

967
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,460
Open your door.

968
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,840
Smiling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

969
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,320
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

970
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,400
Spacecrafts forgotten.

971
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,720
Space junk, the funk next to limbs.

972
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,440
Want to move.

973
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,080
Now we're in the groove.

974
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,960
Galaxies swirling.

975
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,240
Comets burning.

976
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,340
Vibrations.

977
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,080
Around us.

978
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,980
Creatures of Earth disperse.

979
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,300
The truth of knowledge.

980
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,800
Creation of destruction.

981
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,240
It's not fair.

982
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,120
Don't despair.

983
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,080
Baba's heir.

984
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,320
Create your own faith in your own taste.

985
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,300
Ultimate risk to make a mistake.

986
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,840
Now you know.

987
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,400
No more fear.

988
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,140
Slack is here.

989
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,600
Smiling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

990
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,180
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

991
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,880
Spacecrafts forgotten.

992
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,420
Space junk, the funk next to limbs.

993
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,220
Want to move.

994
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,800
Now we're in the groove.

995
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,680
Galaxies swirling.

996
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,980
Comets burning.

997
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,140
Vibrations.

998
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,840
Around us.

999
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,780
A beacon of light.

1000
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,440
It's quite a sight.

1001
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,660
It's okay.

1002
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,040
Let's go play with the energy that is good.

1003
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,600
An important thing to get.

1004
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,080
Let's not forget.

1005
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,920
The man with the pipe.

1006
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,560
Smoke rising high.

1007
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,120
Beyond the sky.

1008
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1009
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1010
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1011
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1012
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1013
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1014
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1015
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1016
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1017
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,180


1018
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,520
The hope to help us cope.

1019
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,800
Smiling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

1020
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,160
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

1021
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,360
Spacecrafts forgotten.

1022
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,820
Space junk, the funk that makes your limbs want to move.

1023
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,480
Now we're in the groove.

1024
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,220
Galaxies swirling.

1025
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,620
Comets burning.

1026
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,480
Vibrations around us.

1027
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,640
The spaceships have landed.

1028
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,060
The minds expanded.

1029
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,980
An indefinable being.

1030
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,420
A subgenius.

1031
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,900
Nothing else like it.

1032
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,440
Don't expect this shit.

1033
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,380
Look at what they get.

1034
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:40,120
Spiraling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

1035
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,640
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

1036
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,640
Spacecrafts forgotten.

1037
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,880
Space junk, the funk that makes your limbs want to move.

1038

Now we're in the groove.

1039

Galaxies swirling.

1040
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,760
Comets burning.

1041
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,040
Vibrations around us.

1042
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1043
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1044
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1045
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1046

00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1049
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1050
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1051
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1052
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040

00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1054
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,040


1055
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,500
Spirit is healed.

1056
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,940
An unshadowable ebola.

1057
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,060
Great meaning extreme.

1058
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,340
More to the light than what is seen.

1059
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,200
Stay away from that neat machine.

1060
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,680
You, the abnormal mechanism of impossible.

1061
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,460
Make possible...

1062
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:21,140
Spiraling out in all directions in the rays of the sun.

1063
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,660
Planets, satellites, moons, whatever you want to call them.

1064
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:29,820
Spacecrafts are gone, space junk from the funk that makes the aliens wanna move

1065
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,660
Now we're in the groove, galaxies swirling, comets burning

1066
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:41,120
Vibrations around us, spiraling out in all directions

1067
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:47,940
In the rays of the suns, planets, satellites, moons, whatever you wanna call them

1068
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:52,300
Spacecrafts forgotten, space junk from the funk that makes the aliens wanna move

1069
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:57,080
Now we're in the groove, galaxies swirling, comets burning

1070
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:06,140
Vibrations around us, vibrations around us, vibrations around us

1071
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,400
