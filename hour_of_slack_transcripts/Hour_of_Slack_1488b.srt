1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,060
That's true.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,200
We could stick around for synesthesia, but for right now, I'm going to put on this.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,360
Dave, you could probably call back later.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,900
Dr. Sinister will be here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,140
But I, in the meantime, have to take us out with some sort of music.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:25,740
And I'm playing this one just for our friend, Reverend Abnorm Nihil, from the latest Monster High movie, Freaky Fusion.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,880
Thank you, Dave.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,640
Bye, Dave.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,380
We'll see you soon.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,960
Bye.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,420
Bye-bye.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,860
I can't believe how quickly you learned to control your hybrid bodies.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,740
Well, it's like that old saying goes, hybrids make the best teachers.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,620
That's not an old saying.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,040
Oh, well, it should be.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,560
Oops.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:11,600
Oops.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:19,900
Damn.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,160


20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:20,680
Damn.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,540
Okay.

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:29,560
Okay.

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:29,600
Okay.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:29,640
Okay.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:29,680
Okay.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:29,720
Okay.

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:29,760
Okay.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:29,780
Okay.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:29,820
Okay.

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:29,840
Okay.

31
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:29,880
Okay.

32
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:29,920
Okay.

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:29,960
Okay.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This conclusion

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,960
Of freaky science

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,100
Rules and defiance

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,400
And we're out of sync, yeah

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,600
Of freaky fusion

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,820
And welcome, welcome, welcome

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:16,080
A very special edition of Synesthesia here on WCSB Cleveland at 9.3 FM

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm your host, Dr. Sinister

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,320
And we are pleased to have my special guest in the studio here

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,620
Reverend Ivan Stang, Sacred Scribe No. 1

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,720
What? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,240
273, that is

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,980
273, that is

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right, and Princess Wee Ardo, you hear here?

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,440
And as well, Reverend Baby Bear

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,340
Hello, hi, hi

51
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,720
First time here at CSB, right?

52
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,400
Hi, yes

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,800
Welcome, welcome

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,820
So, I never have anything to talk about

55
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,800
Even though I do something that tries to pass for a talk show

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,440
And I rely on people who call in at 216-687-3515

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,140
To say something

58
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,820
And get the ball rolling

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,100
But now I have people in here with me

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,400
And we could

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,120
Bounce jokes about how idiotic this whole thing is off each other

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,740
How come they don't say

63
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,120
Get the balls rolling

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,900
Are you making fun of me?

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,780
Well, you know, between the two of us

66
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,380
There might be two

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,460
I don't know

68
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,540
Now I can say all the things that I didn't have time to say on our Slack

69
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,860
I have so many things to say

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
So much things to say

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,700
But now you can't remember them

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,180
I can't remember any of them

73
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,980
Oh, they'll come back when you're not home yet

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,760
I'm not thinking about them

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,560
They'll just all come back

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,200
No, they'll come back when Dave's talking

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,820
We've got

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,660
Actually, we do have a caller here

79
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,360
I believe this is the Buddha

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,820
Hello, you're on the air

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,380
Oh, hey

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,600
How you guys doing?

83
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,060
Good evening, Buddha

84
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,920
Yeah, uh

85
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,040
Actually, I'm getting some thought

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,880
God damn, you're right, doctor

87
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,880
Jesus was a lich

88
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,540
Yeah, he was not a zombie

89
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,420
He was a lich, alright

90
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,900
Because he was not a devoid of personality

91
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,500
There's that front line thing again

92
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,480
No, he was not completely devoid of personality

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,060
He wasn't all about eating brains

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,280
And he wasn't about drinking people's blood

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,600
Or eating their flesh

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,060
He would tell people to eat his flesh and drink his blood

97
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,520
But he wasn't doing it to other people

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,200
And he brought people back from the dead

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
And his wounds were still there

100
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,840
That's the crucial point

101
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,260
Yeah, exactly

102
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,980
That's so cool

103
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,700
I was going to ask you this

104
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,320
But kind of narrow casting here

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,920
If you don't mind

106
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,740
One thing about

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Leaving the station

108
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,040
I do miss

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,180
Seeing the Reverend Stang and Princess Wee

110
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,540
You know, at meetings

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,140
You guys are missed

112
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,560
We still do have to go to meetings

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,320
That's true

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Yeah

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
But it's not court appointed

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,720
So it's not too bad

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,460
Not yet

118
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,760
We just had a station meeting last week

119
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,860
The pizza was good

120
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,420
We might see you at the Halloween party though

121
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,640
Hopefully, yeah

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,260
I would like to

123
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,380
Get together and have some chow with you guys sometime

124
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,880
Just to

125
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,860
You know, it's old farts

126
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,840
Just talk about stuff

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,900
But you can't tell who you're meeting

128
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,580
At the Halloween masquerade box

129
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,540
They're raising heavy disguise or masks

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,400
My number's still up there

131
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,840
Your number's up, buddy

132
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
You know, please

133
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,840
You know, please write it down

134
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,140
You know, I think

135
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm pretty sure

136
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,340
That

137
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,600
That

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,860
Dr. Sinister knows my last name

139
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah, I

140
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,780
We

141
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,800
If you want me to give them

142
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,440
Your number

143
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,940
I will do that

144
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,620
Oh, of course

145
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,800
He's got it right here

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,640
He's got your address

147
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,280
He's got your social security number

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,620
We know what you need

149
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
We're gonna read all that, right?

150
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,520
Other than social security number, no

151
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
But, uh

152
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I'm a semi-hermit in Euclid, Ohio, but

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,580
Favorite pizza topping

154
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,340
We know all of it

155
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,400
If you'd join the church

156
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,420
Of the subgenius

157
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,080
I'd have your

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,800
Your human street name

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Your address

160
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,040
Your credit card number

161
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,960
Birthday

162
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,780
Shoes size

163
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,340
Mother's maiden name

164
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,520
Mother's bra size

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,140
Favorite dog

166
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,640
And childhood

167
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,340
Oh, God

168
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,220
Favorite teacher

169
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,900
We know all that stuff

170
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,760
About every subgenius

171
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Baby bear is sick

172
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
What?

173
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,500
Has baby bear had her shots?

174
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,920
No, I'm a rabid bear

175
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,980
Yeah

176
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,100
Yeah

177
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,940
His temper shots are definitely

178
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,260
In the, uh

179
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,840
Hey, I'm fine

180
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
My temper's fine

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,880
What do you guys say about it?

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,300
Bud?

184
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,140
You know what?

185
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,980
I just now remembered

186
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,180
A nightmare I woke up from

187
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,880
It was either this morning

188
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Or yesterday morning

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
I had a terrible nightmare

190
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,380
That I had to kill a bear

191
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,220
And it didn't go down easy

192
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,320
I was beating it with a rotten log

193
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,260
And it was a sick bear

194
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,740
Why would you do that?

195
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,340
I don't know

196
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,180
I don't know

197
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,960
But you'll like this part

198
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,120
Right when I finally thought

199
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,380
I'd killed the bear

200
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,440
And it was a big one

201
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,160
A big brown bear, I guess

202
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,900
You killed him a bar

203
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,840
When he was only three

204
00:06:59,840 --> 00:06:59,980
A smaller bear

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,320
A baby bear came crawling out

206
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,560
And I went, oh no, he's still alive

207
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
Oh no, that's a different one

208
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,200
Oh, well

209
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
And it was scared

210
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,300
The baby bear was scared

211
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,900
And I was

212
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,820
So you killed a mama bear

213
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,300
And orphaned her cub

214
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,580
Apparently I did

215
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,860
In this dream, yeah

216
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,560
You're a monster

217
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,920
Yeah

218
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,280
I did

219
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,860
I felt terrible about it

220
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Someone in armor

221
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,560
Is gonna hunt you

222
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,340
In a video game

223
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,960
That's a video game carryover

224
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,780
It's bleeding over

225
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,700
The baby bear liked cats

226
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,500
What?

227
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,080
Cats?

228
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,440
You like cats?

229
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,240
Yeah, of course

230
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,140
Cats are awesome

231
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,520
Okay, cool

232
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,900
If you didn't know

233
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,500
I was gonna have to

234
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,080
Stand and kill you

235
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,660
Right then and there

236
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,280
You're safe

237
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,980
No, they're delicious

238
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,520
Yeah

239
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,060
Stop

240
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,220
They're great fricasseed

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, PETA, listen

242
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,080
PETA, PETA

243
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,780
Who was I?

244
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,580
I think this one comedian

245
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,300
Said, yeah, I

246
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,760
I kill a parrot

247
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,580
And feed it to a cat

248
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,360
Just need the cat

249
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,320
To piss off PETA

250
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
That's not very nice

251
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,400
No, that's not nice

252
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,000
No, no

253
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,580
Angering

254
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,500
The PETA is nice

255
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,660
That's okay

256
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,920
That doesn't bother me

257
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,460
Hopefully she was facetious

258
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,760
I think they're meaner

259
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,960
I think this talk

260
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
Has scared the hell out of my cat

261
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,800
Because she's nowhere to be found

262
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,760
Well, if you have any bears

263
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,480
Coming around

264
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,740
Give me a call

265
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,460
I know how to handle it now

266
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,500
I won't kill the babies

267
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,240
Oh, so you're not responsible

268
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,180
For the bear cub

269
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,780
That they found in New York?

270
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,540
That's right

271
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,200
Somebody mugged a bear cub

272
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,800
In New York

273
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,160
Right

274
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,960
Oh, that's right

275
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,480
I saw that

276
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,660
I saw that headline

277
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,540
And posted it

278
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,080
On the Scrub Genius Forum

279
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah, someone posted it

280
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,660
In reference to me

281
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,200
Right

282
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,700
On Facebook somewhere

283
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,280
I said, oh, no

284
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,240
And then I posted that link

285
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
Because baby bear

286
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,620
Mugged and, you know

287
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,420
Beaten to within

288
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,560
An inch of its life

289
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,020
And what was it doing

290
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,820
Running around loose

291
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
In Central Park

292
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
In the first place?

293
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,180
Hey, man, you know

294
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,880
Things happen

295
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,320
No, things don't happen

296
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
Sometimes you just

297
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,060
Get in the wrong cab

298
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,100
Those cabbies let bears in

299
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
You just get out

300
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,020
At the wrong stop

301
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,220
They just let you out

302
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,940
All drunk

303
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,280
And too much honey

304
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
Too much mead

305
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,580
I mean, seriously

306
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,220
If a bear actually

307
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,060
Got into the cab

308
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,580
You know, with a fistful

309
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,040
Of dollars

310
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,820
To pay its fare

311
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,080
Like, would you really say

312
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,280
Like, I'm sorry

313
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,180
I don't give rides to bears

314
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,760
Like, would you

315
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,660
Would you really do that

316
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,000
If you were a cabbie?

317
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,240
No bears can ride

318
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,420
No, they'd probably

319
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,060
Take the money

320
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,480
That's discrimination

321
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
Not only is it discrimination

322
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
But, you know

323
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,080
It's a bear

324
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,020
If a bear walks up to me

325
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,080
With a fistful of dollars

326
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,020
And hands it to me

327
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,440
I'm

328
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,020
I'm just gonna take him

329
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm not gonna do anything

330
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
I'm gonna hang out

331
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,600
With that bear

332
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,420
That has all the money

333
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,220
That's what I'm gonna do

334
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,020
What a bad influence

335
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,240
If a bear walked into a cab

336
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,780
That's barely possible

337
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,980
I mean, that's

338
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,640
You gotta think

339
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,240
That's New York

340
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,860
That's New York

341
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,500
That's the big apple for you

342
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,320
Yeah

343
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,780
Well, critters are

344
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,080
Wandering into cities

345
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,840
More and more

346
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,140
Oh, yeah

347
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,520
Deer walk up and down

348
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,660
Our suburban street

349
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Constantly

350
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,840
And coyotes have learned

351
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
That kitty cats taste good

352
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
And chihuahuas

353
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,860
And even mountain lions

354
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,160
Are, their habitat is spreading

355
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,440
So why not bears?

356
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,440
They've also learned

357
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,140
That American trash cans

358
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,800
And dumpsters

359
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,700
Are just filled with food

360
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,840
That we just throw out

361
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,500
Yeah

362
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,000
There's actually

363
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,500
A problem

364
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,720
There's a problem

365
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,220
With black vultures

366
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,440
In southern Ohio

367
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,700
Where they've become

368
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,740
Acclimated to people

369
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,260
And they just swarm

370
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,180
All over dumpsters

371
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,220
And black vultures

372
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,660
Are much more aggressive

373
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,720
Than turkey vultures

374
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,140
And they are not afraid

375
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,940
Of people at all

376
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,920
And they hang out

377
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,000
In huge roosts

378
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,480
At dumpsters

379
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,040
And they are

380
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,340
Kind of terrifying

381
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,560
That's been going on

382
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,020
For so long

383
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,100
Actually, Charles Manson

384
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,180
Recorded a song about it

385
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,160
Well, it didn't used to be

386
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,340
A problem

387
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,020
It didn't used to be

388
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,980
A problem in southern Ohio

389
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Actually, I was in a

390
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Black vultures are pretty rare

391
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,640
In Ohio at all

392
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,880
But they've been going

393
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,820
Farther north

394
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,120
And getting all tough

395
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,580
I've seen them

396
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,980
Flocking around my neighborhood

397
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,820
A couple of times

398
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,760
They mean mugging?

399
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,860
Just

400
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't know

401
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
What the heck they're doing

402
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
They don't

403
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,800
Migrate, do they?

404
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,700
It's just

405
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,380
Starting to get back

406
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,860
To wildlife

407
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
Black vultures

408
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,260
Don't really

409
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,300
But they also

410
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Usually only stay

411
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,860
In places where

412
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,920
They don't have to migrate

413
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,580
But I'm assuming

414
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,240
The ones that come

415
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,020
As far north in Ohio

416
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,780
Probably are migrating

417
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,640
Like turkey vultures

418
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,360
Turkey vultures

419
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,060
Do migrate

420
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,620
From the north

421
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,680
Back down to the south

422
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,260
But black vultures

423
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,020
Usually only stay

424
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,980
In an area where

425
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,400
They can live year round

426
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,180
Oh, okay

427
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,840
If you were a supervillain

428
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,320
Would you be

429
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,640
A buzzard woman

430
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,060
Or a bear woman?

431
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,640
I'm the queen

432
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
Of the vultures

433
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh, that's right

434
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,140
You're on a comic book cover

435
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm on a comic book cover

436
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Your leg doesn't look right

437
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,620
In that drawing

438
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,080
What?

439
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,360
Why?

440
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,400
There's something weird

441
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,040
About your leg

442
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
On that drawing

443
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,620
Most of those

444
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,140
Now I'm not going to be able

445
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,340
To stop seeing it

446
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,200
When you put that

447
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,800
In my head

448
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
Well, that's my problem

449
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,180
That's why I told you

450
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,240
To leave my head

451
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,200
That weird leg

452
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
On that drawn

453
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,540
Fictitious baby bear

454
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,360
Many subgeniuses

455
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
Have had their portraits

456
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,960
Drawn by Reverend

457
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,740
Suds Pasha

458
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,700
In the form of

459
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,860
Comic book covers

460
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
Bobco comic book covers

461
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,620
If you've been

462
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,260
Made into a comic book

463
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,860
Hero by Suds

464
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,260
You know you're really cool

465
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,680
Which, sorry Dr. Sinister

466
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,260
Yeah, it's okay

467
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm actually very hard to draw

468
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,160
I had to pay for mine

469
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,360
If it makes you feel any better

470
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,540
People tell me

471
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,720
You draw flies really well

472
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,700
I do draw flies, yes

473
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,900
It's a dot

474
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
With a couple of wings

475
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,020
They're pretty easy

476
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,480
Philo taught me

477
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,020
How to draw flies

478
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,260
Oh, you meant

479
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,140
Draw them on paper

480
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,340
I'm sorry

481
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,140
Yeah, Philo taught me

482
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,960
How to draw flies

483
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,260
You draw a little piece of poop

484
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,580
And then you draw flies around it

485
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,480
And you draw stink lines

486
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,980
In fact

487
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,020
In subgenius pamphlet number one

488
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,040
That drawing lesson

489
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,080
Is on the page about

490
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,740
Bull Dada

491
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,820
If you really look at that

492
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
That page

493
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,700
It is a lesson in cartooning

494
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,740
It shows action lines

495
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,940
Stink lines

496
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,820
Surprise lines

497
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,920
And flies

498
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,300
And sweat

499
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,640
Sweat drops flying off

500
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,380
You know it's like a lesson

501
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,560
Philo was teaching me

502
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,100
How to draw

503
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,760
And it was like

504
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh good

505
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Well now we have some art

506
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
For our pamphlet

507
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Stan, what kind of critters

508
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
Have you seen in your neighborhood?

509
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,720
Fort Leggett I'm talking

510
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,120
Um

511
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,020
So

512
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:57,080


513
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:27,080


514
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,420
ライ

515
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,260
It's

516
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,980
It's

517
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,820
Do I have this back?

518
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,600
It's Steve

519
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,500
That's good

520
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,980
Yay

521
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,900
Hi again

522
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,140
Keeps him off the street

523
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,180
Keeps him out of trouble

524
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,680
Unless we know where he is

525
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,020
That's all I gotta add

526
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,800
I'll talk to you later

527
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,200
Remember to pass that on to Stan

528
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,120
Will do

529
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,880
Okay

530
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,540
Alright

531
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,700
See ya

532
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,440
Bye

533
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,480
Alright

534
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,000
Sue

535
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,500
Welcome back, Dave

536
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,680
Poor Ned

537
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Is it a picco-yoon voice

538
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,860
A teeny tiny little

539
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,700
Monstral

540
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,200
More like a picaresque

541
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,740
It's more like a cigarette?

542
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,740
No, no

543
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:56,860
But

544
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,320
Not pika-yoon, pikaresque.

545
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, pikaresque.

546
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,020
Yes.

547
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,680
Like your life, Dave.

548
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,280
The story of your life.

549
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,260
I forgot the meaning of that word.

550
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,540
Pikaresque.

551
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,780
That means there's no plot.

552
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
It's just a whole bunch of kids.

553
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,320
A series of misadventures of a character known as a picaro.

554
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,880
Ah.

555
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,580
Like Don Quixote?

556
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,420
Sure.

557
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Sure.

558
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,760
Yeah.

559
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,380
What the hell not?

560
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,520
Okay.

561
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, I feel like Manuel Cervasio or whatever his name was.

562
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,040
I think I've realized there's a way to name my donks, so to speak.

563
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,900
Or so to bark.

564
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,500
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

565
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,380
Oh, I thought you were going to bark.

566
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,540
I keep thinking of our barks.

567
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,080
It is the season for howling.

568
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,720
Yes.

569
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,960
I can imagine people's Adam's apples.

570
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,500
Yes.

571
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,340
We're snuggling and throbbing like snakes and rioting like...

572
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,200
Never mind.

573
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,400
I was just like...

574
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,220
Never mind.

575
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,260
I used to think that in order to make the subgenius salute,

576
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,500
that you kind of needed an Adam's apple.

577
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,080
But Princess Wee and my daughter both proved that wrong.

578
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,980
You can kind of force it.

579
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,880
How about playing the William Teller picture on your neck?

580
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,520
You need to...

581
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,340
I'm sorry.

582
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,260
You need to abuse your larynx.

583
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh.

584
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,280
Oh.

585
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,740
I never was able to do that.

586
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,700
You learned that from Curly Howard, right?

587
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,680
The Three Stooges?

588
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,040
No.

589
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,400
He'd click his neck like that and make that little noise.

590
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
No, that's not where I learned it.

591
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,100
I have never seen anyone do that before.

592
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm sorry the radio audience don't see Dr. Sinister.

593
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Dr. Sinister just played his neck and head.

594
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,080
Every subgenius has a certain superpower.

595
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,080
A useless superpower.

596
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,680
And now we know Dr. Sinister's useless superpower.

597
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,400
One of my useless superpowers, yes.

598
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,120
He can do that.

599
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,600
We're all gifted with a useless superpower.

600
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,100
It's like the people who have the memories,

601
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,860
like they can remember like 3,000 digits in a row

602
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,240
after one second of seeing it in perfect order.

603
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,780
They used to call them idiot savages.

604
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,840
Yeah.

605
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,560
But yeah, every subgenius has some power like that.

606
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,920
My daughter, for instance, could send a fax through a phone line

607
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,020
just using her voice.

608
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,540
Like that.

609
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,680
And it would come out the way she wanted.

610
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,160
My superpower is I can type really fast with just two fingers.

611
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,880
My useless superpower is I have super belching skills.

612
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,220
No way.

613
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,920
Really?

614
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,280
Yeah.

615
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,040
My other niece has that power.

616
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,440
Oh.

617
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,720
I taught it to her.

618
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
I can do it on command, but it's not very good on command.

619
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,220
Do it, do it, do it.

620
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,160
It's better if you have beer.

621
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
You can't tell which one of us is doing it.

622
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,840
I can do that all day.

623
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
All day long.

624
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,660
Well, hang on.

625
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,320
You can't come to that skill because it gets weaker with age.

626
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,320
No, I thought you were going to say it becomes more valuable as you eat.

627
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,340
You inhale into your stomach and then they won't come out.

628
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,120
Oh, no.

629
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:06,940
Yeah.

630
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,540
You don't want that to happen.

631
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,920
So you can't have food or drink in here.

632
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,000
If I had a beer in here, I could really show you guys.

633
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,780
Oh, yeah.

634
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,940
My skills.

635
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,180
My niece, the only goth in Stangville, Texas,

636
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,340
she actually would sit in school.

637
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,460
She would emit these giant belches just to be disruptive.

638
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,460
And she told the teacher that it was a condition she had.

639
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,200
A disorder.

640
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:34,800
Yeah.

641
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,380
My sister went to open house or something.

642
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,340
And the teacher goes, oh, you know, she's doing very well despite her condition.

643
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,400
My sister goes, what?

644
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,280
Of course, the kid leaves the room real fast because she's about to get busted.

645
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,260
Well, you're not hurting him.

646
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,660
If I know my sister, though, she's not hurting him.

647
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:54,660


648
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:54,660


649
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:54,660


650
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:54,660


651
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,960
She probably backed her up and said, oh, yeah, it's really sad.

652
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,240
She just can't stop burping really loud.

653
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,900
Can you, honey?

654
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,040
No.

655
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Burping Tourette's.

656
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,200
Yeah.

657
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,940
Right.

658
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,380
Yeah.

659
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,020
She hadn't convinced her it was involuntary.

660
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,980
No, it's not involuntary.

661
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,240
It's a cute thing they learn from their pappies or their uncles.

662
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,100
And they do it and they walk.

663
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,020
And when they see him, it's a funny thing to do.

664
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,940
Oh, yeah.

665
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,660
And they burp back and forth to each other.

666
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,800
And their mothers and fathers are the real people who count in their existence.

667
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,760
Come out and they start beating the hell out of them with these big sharpened sticks.

668
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,140
Like, you know, the Pound Gang and those different tribes in Melanesia and so forth.

669
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,180
In my family, it's all the women that can burp really well, actually.

670
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:42,680
Hmm.

671
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,700
I didn't learn it from my uncle.

672
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,140
I learned it from my aunt, who's about my size.

673
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,720
You learned it from your aunt?

674
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
She's like 110 pounds.

675
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,280
And we both just burp like disgusting old rednecks.

676
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
Oh, my God.

677
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,620
Goddamn.

678
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
See, that one got stuck.

679
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,160
Can you make it through the whole alphabet?

680
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,280
Yes, but it's really boring.

681
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,200
Can you make it through the Greek alphabet, too?

682
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,220
I don't remember it anymore.

683
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,520
Alpha.

684
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,740
There you go.

685
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,440
Hey, that's good.

686
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,000
I memorized it when I was a kid so I could write secret notes to my friends, except for none of them memorized it.

687
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,260
So it didn't work.

688
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,180
Isn't that the worst?

689
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,720
Isn't that the worst?

690
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,460
When you're smart enough to come up with secret codes to write messages to your friends,

691
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,660
but you don't have any friends.

692
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,740
You have to send them messages, too.

693
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,540
They wouldn't learn it.

694
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,000
I tried.

695
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,620
My daughter went to an elementary school that was half deaf kids, and everybody learned American Sign Language.

696
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,540
I thought that was normal.

697
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:42,400
When I was a mother and father, my daughter and her kids would sit there and talk about us.

698
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,660
They'd be naughty silently to each other.

699
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,200
I don't know that.

700
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,380
I just learned the alphabet.

701
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,660
I had to wear a pig mask when they were making me do their all-day drills.

702
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,620
And stuff like that.

703
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,880
Well, Dave, you were special.

704
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,980
Yeah, I certainly...

705
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,420
I think they had a pig mask last night.

706
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,760
Well, we lost him.

707
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,740
I did.

708
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,660
He'll be back.

709
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,400
Now we need pig man to call in.

710
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,360
That pig mask is pretty terrifying, actually.

711
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,900
It is.

712
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,360
I don't even like looking at myself in the mirror.

713
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,860
Whatever happened to pig man?

714
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,440
Whatever indeed.

715
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,640
He used a blowtorch to burn the hair off of a hog carcass.

716
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,460
Pig man.

717
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:24,820
Pig man did.

718
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,680
I just love the way pig man talked.

719
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,260
You hear him on station.

720
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,880
Listen to the 50,000 pound monster in my pants.

721
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,520
WCSB.

722
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,280
I love you.

723
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,520
I love you, pig man.

724
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,500
This is a fake pig man.

725
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,980
When I'm out slinging mud, I listen to 89.3 WCSB.

726
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Cleveland.

727
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Praise pig man.

728
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,440
Praise pig man.

729
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,300
Even the fake pig man.

730
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,100
And praise fake pig man.

731
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,360
That was the fake pig man?

732
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,660
The second one was the fake pig man.

733
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,280
I could do a better pig man than that.

734
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,440
So is that just his on-air voice?

735
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,220
Or did he sound that all the time?

736
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,300
The problem is if he talks like that, he gets stuck that way.

737
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,320
No, he doesn't.

738
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,500
Did he talk like that all the time?

739
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,240
Or was that an on-air voice?

740
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,280
I think that was the way the guy talked.

741
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
Was it like a Wolfman Jack thing?

742
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,380
No.

743
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,160
It wasn't Wolfman.

744
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,800
It was pig man.

745
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,920
No, lots of people talk that way.

746
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,400
If they're pig men.

747
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,660
No, that's a monster movie we haven't seen much of.

748
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,280
Pig men.

749
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,400
Pig men.

750
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,820
Definitely the tastiest monsters ever.

751
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:36,260
I had an attractive four-teated pig woman who kind of makes out with Val Kilmer in one scene briefly.

752
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,800
He's giving her drugs and kind of taking on her little, what you call, trotters.

753
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,340
And, oh, she's hideous.

754
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
You can almost smell her.

755
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,800
Makeup jobs are good in that movie.

756
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,040
Island of Dr. Moreau.

757
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,260
You know, the funny thing is Val Kilmer now looks like one of those actors.

758
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,260


759
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,260


760
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,640
He's one of the most animal people in real life.

761
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,920
I haven't seen him in forever.

762
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,840
Because of plastic surgery?

763
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:56,700
No.

764
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,760
I don't think I've seen him since he was Batman.

765
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,740
Right.

766
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,400
He has a...

767
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,900
He had to stop acting after that.

768
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,840
They revoked his license.

769
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,900
They pulled him out of the guild.

770
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,680
They were like, nope.

771
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,860
No more.

772
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,140
Michael Keaton played Batman in that first Tim Burton movie.

773
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,780
And he's kind of...

774
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
There's a new...

775
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,260
He's way too old.

776
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


777
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


778
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


779
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


780
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


781
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


782
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


783
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,260


784
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,060
Too short to be Batman.

785
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,920
I just read about today that...

786
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,340
It doesn't matter how short you are in the movies.

787
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,300
Look at Tom Cruise.

788
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,740
He's really four feet tall.

789
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,680
Yeah, he's as tall as me.

790
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,480
There's a...

791
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:40,320
Yeah, there's a new movie where Michael Keaton plays a has-been actor who once played Birdman.

792
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,260
A superhero named Birdman.

793
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,660
That must be so hard for him to get into character.

794
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,380
The Onion thought he did a great job and kind of rescued his career by acknowledging

795
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,740
that he was, in fact, a washed-up guy who once played a superhero.

796
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,320
A lot of people are doing that.

797
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,980
John Clive Van Damme did that with JCVD.

798
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,600
You know what?

799
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,500
Actually, yeah.

800
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,940
Okay, so Michael Keaton was too short to play Batman, but you know what?

801
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,140
Hugh Jackman is too tall to play Wolverine.

802
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,560
That is accurate.

803
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,920
Way too tall.

804
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,120
Also...

805
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,420
Well, I don't even want to go into that.

806
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,800
Wolverine is a small guy in the comics?

807
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,020
Oh, yeah.

808
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,200
Yeah.

809
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,680
Oh, yeah.

810
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,280
Small and very hairy.

811
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,280
I quit reading X-Men after they went...

812
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I don't know if I'm above 10 cents.

813
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,220
I don't know that you're really missing much.

814
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,660
Wolverine had not appeared when I quit reading X-Men.

815
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,620
The Beast was the closest thing to that.

816
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,100
I love Beast.

817
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,800
Your parents' generation came up during the Golden Age of comics, and your generation

818
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,480
came up during the Silver Age of comics.

819
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,880
My generation came up during the Lead Age of comics.

820
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,400
Wah, wah.

821
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,920
Yeah, that one went over like a lead comic book.

822
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,140
I led you right to the slaughter.

823
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,040
I liked...

824
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,260
I liked...

825
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,260


826
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,260


827
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,640
I liked Michael Keaton as Batman.

828
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,260
Honestly, if I had to pick a favorite Batman of all the movie Batmans, I think I would

829
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,060
pick Michael Keaton.

830
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,360
I got sick of the Christian Bale thing really fast.

831
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,980
I couldn't handle the voice.

832
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,960
Michael Keaton could have played a great Joker, actually.

833
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,480
He could have played the Joker just as well, I think.

834
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
That's true.

835
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,220
And it's not that I didn't like...

836
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,040
I didn't like...

837
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,700
You know, it's not that I didn't like Jack Nicholson's performance.

838
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,900
It was just...

839
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,120
It was a different kind of Joker.

840
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,560
Oh, I didn't like it.

841
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,720
There's different kinds of Jokers.

842
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,260
That might be true.

843
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,380
That movie had a lot of problems.

844
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,220
I liked it when it first came out.

845
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,480
And I thought Michael Keaton did a real good job as Batman.

846
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,700
But that whole series of Batman movies kind of don't...

847
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,020
They don't hold up for me.

848
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,360
No.

849
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,460
I really like the Christopher Nolan ones.

850
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,500
Christian Bale notwithstanding.

851
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,880
He's fine as Bruce Wayne.

852
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,760
I mean, he's okay as playing the suave...

853
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,640
Well, he has to change his voice to be Batman.

854
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,140
Oh, God.

855
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,060
It's so obnoxious, though.

856
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,720
Well, it's kind of like...

857
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,540
It's a Clint Eastwood voice, really.

858
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,340
Who are you working for?

859
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Yeah.

860
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,020
Swear to me.

861
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
Hockey pants.

862
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,140
He says that.

863
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,460
That's a line in the second one.

864
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,760
That's when you know that they just...

865
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,560
I like the way Bane talks.

866
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,080
They just didn't care any...

867
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,520
Oh, Bane.

868
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,880
Oh, God.

869
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,880
I love the Bane voice.

870
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,380
Yeah.

871
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,740
What's funny is in the movie, he had a British accent.

872
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,600
And in the comic books, he has a Cuban accent.

873
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,780
Yeah.

874
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,040
He was actually like a luchador in the comic books.

875
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,280
He was of Hispanic descent.

876
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,380
But I really like...

877
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,320
I like his silly accent in the movie.

878
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,160
Although, only three-fourths of that movie is good in the second quarter.

879
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,920
I disavow.

880
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,560
And I won't like it.

881
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,360
I just can't.

882
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,900
I hate it.

883
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,380
But everything with Bane is great.

884
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,660
Well, and I guess Superman versus Batman is coming up.

885
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,080
I was born in the darkness.

886
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,560
You do a pretty good Bane for a very small person.

887
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm trying to remember my favorite Bane quote, and I can't even...

888
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,860
I wondered what would break first, your spirit or your body?

889
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,600
It would be extremely painful for you.

890
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
What would happen if I turned that...

891
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,820
Poured that mask off your face?

892
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,760
It would be most painful for you.

893
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,860
Yeah.

894
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,060
Do you feel in control?

895
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,020
Wow.

896
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,060
We are making some...

897
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,060


898
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,060


899
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,180
Some great radio, aren't we?

900
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,540
Yeah.

901
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,620
Well, it's...

902
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,500
Bane impressions.

903
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,260
Nerd radio.

904
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,480
This is...

905
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,000
We're scraping the bottom of the nerd barrel now.

906
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,800
Oh, give me a break.

907
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,540
That's all people talk about is movies and TV shows.

908
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,740
This is probably the most interesting thing they've ever heard us say on this stage, because

909
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,520
we're talking about some movie they've all seen, instead of the usual obscure stuff that

910
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,000
nobody knows what the hell.

911
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,840
But what they...

912
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:41,620
Go ahead.

913
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,420
No, you kind of...

914
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:42,800
No, I'm saying?

915
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,940
No, no.

916
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,680
No, she's saying.

917
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,500
No, I'm saying?

918
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,160
No, she's saying.

919
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,580
No, I'm saying?

920
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,300
No, she's saying.

921
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,540
No?

922
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,980
No.

923
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,280
No?

924
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,620
No.

925
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,240
Maybe we just found the secret to marketability.

926
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,040
We now have 40 listeners instead of 39.

927
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,520
Ooh.

928
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,060
See?

929
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm telling you.

930
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,160
You talk about movies and comic books, and that's all anybody's interested in.

931
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,320
Now, I...

932
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,400
Speaking of the golden...

933
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,540
Well, silver age of comic books, I did honestly quit buying comic books when they hit, like,

934
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,540
40 cents, and they kind of sucked anyway.

935
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,760
It was all ads.

936
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,920
Well, yeah, it happened at the same time as the oil shocks.

937
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,600
You know, suddenly gas went to a dollar a gallon, and suddenly comic books are 40 cents.

938
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,680
Well, I came upon a huge stash of comic books, of old comic books lately, and I cleaned

939
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,240
them up and started reading them.

940
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,260
And, well, they came from the late Jeff Rosenbaum's collection, and they were just laying around

941
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:38,200
a store that we just cleaned out, and there was a lot of 1980s Marvel and DC.

942
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,520
I never used to read DC, because I thought they were for girls, to put it, you know.

943
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:45,860
Hey.

944
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,020
I don't know how else to put it.

945
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,320
Hey.

946
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,540
Hey.

947
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,160
And...

948
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,980
You mean, like, for boy scouts?

949
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,260
So I've been reading a bunch of those real quickly, and Superman comic books, and they

950
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,180
are messed up.

951
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
They are tripping ball.

952
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,080
They are...

953
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,200
Tripping the life fantastic.

954
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,840
Yeah, they're silly and dumb, and they are...

955
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,040
But they were obviously trying for real heavy, mind-blowing sci-fi concepts, but the writers

956
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,940
weren't exactly up for it.

957
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,900
So they're just triply idiotic, which isn't necessarily bad.

958
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,280
I've been really enjoying them.

959
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,560
Almost all of them have Superman...

960
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,180
God, the...

961
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,600
Superman and Superboy trade brains, because one was flying from the future to the past,

962
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,780
and one was flying to the past to the future, and they bumped heads.

963
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,500
Okay.

964
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,980
And suddenly, Superboy is in 1980s Metropolis, and Lois Lane's wondering why he's not interested

965
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,500
in her.

966
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,220
And he's panting over the grown-up Lana Lang, who was his girlfriend back when he was a

967
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,520
teenager.

968
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,980
Meanwhile, God only knows what the grown-up Superman is getting away with back in Smallville,

969
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,680
an adult Kryptonian mind in a teenage Kryptonian body.

970
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,980
I have to imagine that Superman must be a hard...

971
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,200
It must be hard to write stories for Superman, because he's Superman.

972
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,220
Like, what's the challenge for him?

973
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,300
How do you...

974
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,700
Sneak the Kryptonite in.

975
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,140
Exactly.

976
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,840
That's what about half of them were about, sneaking the Kryptonite into the story one

977
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,740
way or another, or some long-lost Kryptonian that wasn't destroyed with the planet, and...

978
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,560
Yeah.

979
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,740
And I've heard role-playing game fans say before that, you know, if you're running a

980
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,700
campaign where your characters are all at too high a level, then it just ruins the game.

981
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,500
Right.

982
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:42,960
I'm a fan of Superman as the disapproving father of the Justice League, who's constantly wagging

983
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,480
his finger at everybody who is...

984
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,220
Isn't doing what he wants them to do.

985
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,280
That's all after my time.

986
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,240
Justice League.

987
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,100
That's like the bad company of comic books.

988
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,380
Super group.

989
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,780
The only thing that really...

990
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,580
Well, I shouldn't say the only thing.

991
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,720
That's one of the things that bothers me about the Justice League, especially the animated

992
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,580
stuff, is that it's always Batman saving the day, and it makes me furious.

993
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,560
You have, like, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter, who are awesome, and you have one of them

994
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,480
getting thrown into the other one helplessly.

995
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,980
And they, like, knock down, like, you might as well just have, like, a bowling pin sound

996
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,280
effect.

997
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,560
Like, oh, they can't do anything.

998
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,760
And then all of a sudden, Batman swoops in and saves both of them.

999
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,360
The one guy without superpowers.

1000
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,300
Yep.

1001
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,680
And he's saving Hawkgirl.

1002
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,100
This is an example of how the 1% are taking over.

1003
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,200
Is it racism and sexism?

1004
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,780
All the veterans go to the rich.

1005
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,800
Martian Manhunter.

1006
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,240
This is discrimination against Martians.

1007
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,040
Yeah.

1008
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,700
Yeah.

1009
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,060
He has cool powers.

1010
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,540
Well, you can't trust a Martian, you know.

1011
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,380
Whoa, hey.

1012
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,600
Hey.

1013
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,760
I'm sorry.

1014
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm, like, 116th Martian on my grandma's side.

1015
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,400
Well, we're all Martians.

1016
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,300
I'm a Martian octagon.

1017
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,440
According to subgenus doctrine, because this planet is Mars, and they switched place with

1018
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,780
the one that used to be called Mars.

1019
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,240
Well, it gets pretty complicated, but they used World War II as a cover for the planetary

1020
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,360
switching, because they used up the first Earth and turned it into a lifeless planet.

1021
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:22,300
And they brought the first one out from the sun, and they brought the pristine, original

1022
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,960
Mars to this orbit, and started all over again.

1023
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,340
Is the messed up Earth being cleaned up by all the cute little wallies?

1024
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,840
No.

1025
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,460
No.

1026
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:32,900
No.

1027
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,060
Well, then I don't like this fantasy.

1028
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:41,120
No, there's just two, those two robots are crawling around on the surface.

1029
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,220
I guess they're about to be joined by a robot from India or something.

1030
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,060
Yeah, there's not many people left on the original Earth, which we now call Mars.

1031
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,780
Even the robots are getting outsourced to India.

1032
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,280
You know, there's babies inside those robots, and they're probably about five years old

1033
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,720
by now.

1034
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,440
In fact, I wonder if they've met.

1035
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:05,840
The idea was they put these two fetuses in those, I don't know, the spirit and the, I

1036
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,620
can't remember the name of the other robot, but there were fetuses in those who were literally

1037
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,780
born on Mars.

1038
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:19,100
And the idea is to get them adjusted to the thin, thin atmosphere, and then let them,

1039
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,000
there's, one's a male and one's a female, and then let them meet.

1040
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,340
It'd be like that movie Blue Lagoon, where these two kids grow up in an alarm with no

1041
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,080
adults in a, you know, an isolated place.

1042
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,220
You just referenced a movie that's like older than 25 years old, so we're going to start

1043
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,140
losing listeners now.

1044
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,060
Thanks.

1045
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,580
You, um, you underestimate the average age of our listeners.

1046
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,640
You might be.

1047
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,880
You're the youngest person in the world who listens to the radio.

1048
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,960
That's not true.

1049
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,960
I'm exaggerating.

1050
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
Yeah, she doesn't listen to the radio.

1051
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,520
She listens to the download podcast.

1052
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,780
I listen to the podcast on the internet.

1053
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,280
Right.

1054
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,860
Who listens to the radio?

1055
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,760
I mean, if I had, if this station came through in Columbus, I would listen.

1056
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,340
In fact, we're probably being heard in Germany right now.

1057
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:03,880
Hi, Bucky.

1058
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,340
Hi, Tanya.

1059
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,040
Hi, Bucky.

1060
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,540
Hi, Tanya.

1061
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1062
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,580
Their flags are still on the machine.

1063
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:07,880
They are.

1064
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,640
This is, this is not, not exactly prime time for them.

1065
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,760
I think, what, it must be like 14.

1066
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,640
I think it's like 14 in the morning over there or something.

1067
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,460
They have hours.

1068
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,060
They have their all-night marathons at times.

1069
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,880
Yeah, they very often sit up and lift up.

1070
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,680
Rob, they, I mean, that other guy.

1071
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,220
They were gonna, they're big fans of this show.

1072
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,960
We know they're up real late.

1073
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,380
Yes.

1074
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,580
Or up first.

1075
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,420
There's no accounting for taste.

1076
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,180
Obviously, we know they're brain damaged and some kind of messed up hippies because they

1077
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,760
listen to Hour of Slack and Radio Sinistria and all the other shows on WSB.

1078
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
They're even worse.

1079
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,120
Some of them.

1080
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,360
I was totally normal until I started listening to these shows.

1081
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,040
Messed me all up, man.

1082
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah.

1083
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,300
Right.

1084
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,760
Sure.

1085
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,180
That's real convincing, baby.

1086
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,180
That's what I'm gonna tell the jury anyway.

1087
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,080
No, actually, my WCSB story is like I came for the Spanish language stuff and I stayed

1088
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,720
for the death metal.

1089
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,720
Yeah.

1090
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,900
That's a good description.

1091
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
That is a good description.

1092
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,540
Sounds good to me.

1093
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,900
I'm gonna go ahead and do the next one.

1094
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:11,900


1095
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,760
Okay.

1096
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1097
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1098
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1099
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1100
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1101
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1102
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1103
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:12,760


1104
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,260
I don't actually listen to much of anything on the radio anymore.

1105
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,180
Actually, it's really ironic now that I've lost my conspiracy job, I can't listen to

1106
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,100
any of my radio shows like I used to.

1107
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,540
All right.

1108
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,780
Because I would just sit there all day and listen to the most weird subversive stuff

1109
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,100
and all my coworkers would pass by me and I'd feel like I had some secret where it's

1110
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,540
just like, you don't know.

1111
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
You don't know.

1112
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,360
Now that that's gone, I don't have the time.

1113
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,980
It could be worse.

1114
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,880
What if you worked for subgenius foundation?

1115
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,680
No.

1116
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,320
You'd have to listen to this stupid radio show.

1117
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,760
It's not something you do to escape your job and cheat the boss.

1118
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,000
It's something you have to do for your job because the boss said so.

1119
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,980
It's a nightmarish hellscape.

1120
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,660
I don't want to go there.

1121
00:35:59,780 --> 00:35:59,960
Yeah.

1122
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,000
That's exactly right.

1123
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,080
Don't make me look at Bob anymore.

1124
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,680
I'm tired of it.

1125
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,800
Get this.

1126
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll have to listen back to every word of this show.

1127
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:11,960


1128
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:11,960


1129
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:11,960


1130
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:11,960


1131
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:11,960


1132
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:11,960


1133
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,340
It's some of the best I've ever heard in the previous hour.

1134
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,140
You have to.

1135
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,000
That's part of my job.

1136
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,740
If I listen back to it, I even make notes on them.

1137
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,380
I have these handwritten logs of what, in case anybody says something funny, that I

1138
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,440
could copy, cop and use again, and I do.

1139
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,580
Hey, a funny thought occurred to me today.

1140
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,240
I was at a diner having breakfast today and I see the packet of Sweet and Low and I realized

1141
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,220
there's a treble clef on there and if it's Sweet and Low, there should be a bass clef

1142
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,620
on there.

1143
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,500
That occurred to me today.

1144
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:41,960
Does it sound like that?

1145
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:41,960


1146
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:41,960


1147
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:41,960


1148
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:41,960


1149
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:41,960


1150
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,840
idle minds are the devil's playground exactly

1151
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,000
yeah listener are you one of those people who has to read every bit of print that appears in

1152
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:04,280
front of your eyes compulsively like an ocd idiot sometimes i said listeners not talkers

1153
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,880
i'm listening to it's compulsive it doesn't work if it's sometimes i don't know how many times i've

1154
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,860
read this sign saying no food or drink in main air just in the last half hour when there's nothing

1155
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,580
else to look at there's at least writing you can you can read the writing on the wall right or the

1156
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:26,360
label of the ketchup bottle yeah whenever i ate cereal when i was a kid i would always leave the

1157
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,540
box out because i would just read the box over and over again a lot of that's pretty mysterious

1158
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:38,180
to a kid yeah and what is that it prompted me to learn what uh they put what's pat pending all that

1159
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,660
weird stuff

1160
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:39,860
you

1161
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,360
A.I.

1162
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,880
it prompted me to learn what all those words were like thiamine mononitrate and bhc

1163
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,520
well some people get curious and learn and others just kind of go well i don't know what that means

1164
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:03,140
oh well that was me hmm oh well i'm somewhere in between there i got a kook letter once from

1165
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:09,760
a person who had discovered the meaning of those little c's in a circle that you see on

1166
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,680
cds and record albums and little tms

1167
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,560
and this c.c. meant it was against jesus and the tm I forget how it meant it was satanic but

1168
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,140
it had something to with satan and the illuminati

1169
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,520
yes this person had

1170
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,820
never i mean i guess they assumed that no one knew what the copyright or trademark or registered

1171
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:39,520
symbols were so it was up to him to deduce this because obviously it must be nefarious or evil if it

1172
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,640
It was, you know, something that was for sale.

1173
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,200
Maybe TM stood for the mark.

1174
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,640
I've got a good one for you, actually.

1175
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,860
There was a guy who called in.

1176
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,260
Trey Mark.

1177
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,360
I got one for you.

1178
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,160
There was a guy who called in a few years ago asking the question, why is Texas the king?

1179
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,740
Why is Texas the king?

1180
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,060
I'm going to pass around this dollar bill until you hear it.

1181
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Okay.

1182
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,000
Why is Texas the king?

1183
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,700
See the K on there?

1184
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
On that dollar bill?

1185
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,320
Uh, yes.

1186
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:10,980
Okay.

1187
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,360
Yeah.

1188
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:11,680
See.

1189
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,020
Read more closely.

1190
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas.

1191
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,160
That's where it was issued.

1192
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,280
I just happened to, I just had a bunch of singles in my pocket and one of them just coincidentally had to have the K on it.

1193
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,200
Why is, why is Texas the king?

1194
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,220
This guy called up asking.

1195
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,740
Because he thought there was some kind of a...

1196
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,020
He deduced the code on the dollar bill.

1197
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,320
Yes, he deduced the code on the dollar bill.

1198
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,500
Okay.

1199
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,300
It's, it's because...

1200
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,500
I don't know.

1201
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,160
It's because there's a, there's a black seal with the letter K in the middle and it says Dallas, Texas on there.

1202
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,660
And like, if you're playing, if you have playing, if you have playing cards, K is king.

1203
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,580
Well, yeah, but K's a lot of things.

1204
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,880
K can mean a lot of things.

1205
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,320
Yes, indeed.

1206
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:04,440
So I told him that actually it's because there's 12 Federal Reserve districts and they're alphabetical and Dallas is the 11th district.

1207
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,180
No, that dollar's not for you, Sting.

1208
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,800
Every dollar isn't for you.

1209
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm looking at my own dollar.

1210
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,980
But then the next thing that came up is I said, well, why?

1211
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,520
Well, you know, L is San Francisco.

1212
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,980
That's the 12th Fed district.

1213
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,940
Because L is the same as the recolateral lambda.

1214
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,140
And lambda is the symbol for gay rights.

1215
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,540
Right.

1216
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,780
It's like, you can, if you're, if you're delusional enough, you can make any of this stuff up.

1217
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,960
And when you hear one person say something crazy like that, then it's easy to come up with something crazy in response to it.

1218
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,060
And it's the, it's the frat from Revenge of the Nerds.

1219
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,160
Lambda, lambda, lambda.

1220
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,480
That's it.

1221
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:43,820
Wow.

1222
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,040
That's between my time.

1223
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,640
I don't know why I remember that.

1224
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,100
Too bad Mr. Sister isn't here.

1225
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,900
He could make jokes about the Federal Reserve.

1226
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,240
He was forcing me to watch the Catholic Channel on his TV.

1227
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,780
I used to watch the Catholic Channel when I was younger.

1228
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:06,040
Well, as his son watches that, actually, that's his son, that's, uh, he, he associates that with his late mom.

1229
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,820
That's a scary channel.

1230
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,040
To him, that's, uh, his... Okay, see, see.

1231
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,100
That's a channel from heaven.

1232
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,500
You just made it, you made it not, not funny.

1233
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,120
I'm just trying to make a joke.

1234
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,380
You know how many, uh...

1235
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,080
I mean, you just ruin it with all this reality.

1236
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,280
Hey, you know how many, uh...

1237
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,540
It's a shared reality.

1238
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,320
You know how many Catholics it takes to change a light bulb?

1239
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,540
No, how many Catholics does it take to change a light bulb?

1240
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:25,860
Three.

1241
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,260
But they're really one.

1242
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,220
Ah.

1243
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,520
Or Trinitarians in general.

1244
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:31,820
Mm-hmm.

1245
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,520
Yeah.

1246
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,140
Mm-hmm.

1247
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,980
Now you understand.

1248
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,500
Yeah.

1249
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,640
The mystery has been solved.

1250
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,020
I wanna cause, but...

1251
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,020
We have not solved the mystery of how many Catholics it takes to change a light bulb.

1252
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,020


1253
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,120
Oh, I still have a radio show, though.

1254
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,360
That's one mystery we haven't solved.

1255
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,000
I made up a joke that I won a prize on a radio station for.

1256
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,100
It was how many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1257
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,180
And the answer was like 982,082.

1258
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,360
982,080 to build the mass clustering shrinking device and two to climb inside the light bulb.

1259
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,280
And...

1260
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,820
Yes.

1261
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,520
Got that problem.

1262
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,040
That was...

1263
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,280
Classic.

1264
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,700
I actually got a joke, a little prize on that, except that somebody else told it and

1265
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,580
they got the prize.

1266
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,040
Oh.

1267
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:15,920
Oh.

1268
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,440
And that's why Buck Naked is not in the Church of the Subgenius anymore.

1269
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,900
Hey, we've got a new caller.

1270
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,020
He took credit for my joke.

1271
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,180
We've been told.

1272
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,620
On the other hand, he coined the term devival, not that I ever was that fond of it.

1273
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,380
And I think he invented the short duration marriage.

1274
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,320
Hmm.

1275
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,080
And he named the Hour of Slack.

1276
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,960
It was originally a little newsletter that he used to send out.

1277
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,240
Yeah.

1278
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,080
And then when I got a show, I called it the Hour of Slack and he thought that automatically

1279
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,720
made him a co-host.

1280
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,180
Well, let's not forget the fact that the whole story of Bob Dobbs...

1281
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,200
That lasted for the first 30 shows and that was it.

1282
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,620
Hmm.

1283
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,420
Let's not forget that the whole story of Bob Dobbs was stolen.

1284
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,640
The story of Bob Dobbs was stolen?

1285
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,120
Oh, yeah.

1286
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,100
Well, what wasn't of Bob?

1287
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,320
Everything Bob has was stolen, some way or another.

1288
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,860
See.

1289
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,460
See, Bob is the kind of guy who can steal from you and make you feel good about it.

1290
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,240
I mean, he can do that.

1291
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,820
He can do that.

1292
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,400
Well, I always...

1293
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:26,740
My experience with Bob, which has been mostly indirect, thank goodness, is that he steals

1294
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,900
from you and makes you feel like you were so smart to pull one over on him like that.

1295
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:32,400
Exactly.

1296
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,400
Everybody goes away feeling happy about the whole thing, but Bob is way richer and you're

1297
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,180
way poorer.

1298
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,180
Yeah.

1299
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,740
You know, I am not one to say praise Bob.

1300
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,340
I am one to say kill Bob.

1301
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,100
Well, you kind of have to do both.

1302
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,980
You can't say kill Bob until you praise him in the first place.

1303
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,600
Why would you care about killing him if he wasn't somebody you had originally thought

1304
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,880
of as being praiseworthy and then got disappointed?

1305
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,040
You let me down, man.

1306
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,540
Boy, have I heard that enough times.

1307
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,480
I used to practically worship you, man, but you let me down.

1308
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,920
Some people get their slank from mayhem.

1309
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,180
I'm sure you've encountered a few of those.

1310
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,100
Some men just want to watch the world burn.

1311
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,300
I'd rather be slaying great jazz.

1312
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:18,640
I'd rather be slaying the Aggies.

1313
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,540
Yeah, I understand that.

1314
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,620
And, uh...

1315
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,060
And, indeed.

1316
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,540
Yeah.

1317
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,960
Yes, and, and, and, and.

1318
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,200
And, and, and, and.

1319
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,980
In fact, we could just go home and do that.

1320
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,600
You could go home and and?

1321
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,080
Yes, we could go home and and.

1322
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,400
Well, we wanted to give Baby Bear a tour of the Slacker Mansion before she has to leave

1323
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,660
town.

1324
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,180
She's not staying at our house.

1325
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,280
You're gonna make me watch you play?

1326
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,080
You're gonna play Monster Hunter?

1327
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,020
No, I'm not gonna do that.

1328
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,760
I'm not gonna do that.

1329
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,280
I don't want to be a part of your sick fetish.

1330
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,540
No, no, I understand.

1331
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,660
I'm not going to, yeah, and I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let you show me how to finish

1332
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,500
Portal either.

1333
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,820
Oh, why not?

1334
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,580
You haven't yet?

1335
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,440
What?

1336
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:02,860
Of course.

1337
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,280
I played halfway through Portal.

1338
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,800
Well, you haven't finished it, I mean.

1339
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,780
No, I literally got about halfway through.

1340
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,960
It was 17 or something like that.

1341
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,680
Dang.

1342
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,260
It was too tricky.

1343
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,020
I couldn't, it took, it made my head hurt.

1344
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,740
Use the internet.

1345
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,500
I did.

1346
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,400
Oh, okay.

1347
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,020
It was still, it was still too tricky.

1348
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,680
I used the internet for, I have cheat sheets for all the main games that came out in 2013,

1349
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,540
because I have most of those games, used.

1350
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,140
It's just puzzle, it's a puzzle game.

1351
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,640
I know.

1352
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,260
Hurts my head.

1353
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,240
The whole life is a puzzle.

1354
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,260
That's why I didn't play video games until the last three years.

1355
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,020
The Spanish word for puzzle is head breaker.

1356
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,060
Right.

1357
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:39,620
.

1358
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,380
The life is enough of a puzzle.

1359
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,720
I just want, I'm into the ones that are just pure, mindless, reflexive.

1360
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:46,720


1361
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:46,720


1362
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:46,720


1363
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,460
I just want to get rid of the reflex and make you feel like you've been hitting things

1364
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,240
for a long time and finally they die and carve them up, and that's it.

1365
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,540
That's the whole thing.

1366
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,060
It's like how hard are they to kill?

1367
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,300
But the, like the writing and the setting and the, it's so good and it's so awesome.

1368
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,300
Oh, I know, I know.

1369
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,420
But well, Skyrim is really fun and interesting too.

1370
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,740
I played that for a while.

1371
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,040
Oh God, I couldn't stop.

1372
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,520
But it's like full of soap operas and dialogue and humans and I'm trying to get away from

1373
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,880
all that.

1374
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,940
So go hang out with the, if you're sick of the humans, then go hang out with the Khajiit

1375
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,020
and the Argonians.

1376
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,420
Yeah.

1377
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,960
I love the Khajiit.

1378
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,180
The cat people.

1379
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,200
Argonians are lizard people.

1380
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,260
Ah, sweet moon, Skyrim.

1381
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,040
I couldn't remember their names.

1382
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,340
Jesus, this is horrible.

1383
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,020
This is the nerd show.

1384
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,120
It's a nerd out.

1385
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,720
But you notice that at X Day, we do hour of slack on stage for like two hours.

1386
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,700
Towards the end, it always degenerates into talk and it's like, oh, I'm going to die.

1387
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:58,140
But by the end it's like there are no other videos that are but verses and things that

1388
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,140


1389
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,220
Like he knew by survive.

1390
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,020
And then we would get over that.

1391
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,060
Yeah, that's burning.

1392
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,360
Have a good fundamental email address.

1393
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,480
He's got his own shout out here.

1394
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:01,620
Well, I love their content.

1395
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,120
This can't be blocked.

1396
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,940
Yeah, the out of size format has never been so strong and so matchable.

1397
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,260
Right, like he said, I mean, that was ice high up.

1398
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:09,260


1399
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:09,700
The different levels here, it was pretty pesar não.

1400
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,760
Plenty like that.

1401
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,760


1402
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,320
Don't get me wrong.

1403
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,980
I think there have been Bento's jokes kissed something down there before.

1404
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,360
Yeah.

1405
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,580
It's a hell of a bento Job.

1406
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:16,700
Oh, obviously.

1407
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,260
Really?

1408
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,460
It's only like 30 seconds.

1409
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,020
Yeah.

1410
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,080
I hear it right now.

1411
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,380
Can't do it on the radio.

1412
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,720
No.

1413
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,360
No.

1414
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:33,160
That was why Bob lost, that was the one business that Bob did that he lost money on, Beer God and Burger God.

1415
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,640
Burger God.

1416
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,200
Both of them, because he used profanity in the ad, the main logo.

1417
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:48,480
Like, I can't, even though we're in safe harbor, I'm trying not to utter certain words.

1418
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,260
Technically, we're going to start our safe harbor for another three minutes.

1419
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,920
Right, and that's when we're going to leave.

1420
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,500
Right.

1421
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,180
Because my last blank is out.

1422
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,520
Can't you just auto bleep yourself?

1423
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,460
I do, all the time.

1424
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,100
So wait, in three minutes I can yell profanities?

1425
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,420
Yeah.

1426
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,000
Well.

1427
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,920
Only if they have, okay.

1428
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,320
Oh, there's a bunch of rules.

1429
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:13,680
What's the rule?

1430
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,360
The Miller test.

1431
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,200
The Miller test.

1432
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,480
It would have to be, for it to count as obscenity, it would have to be appealing to the prurient interest.

1433
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,520
It would have to be offensive to contemporary community standards.

1434
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:33,460
And it would have to be completely lacking in any sort of artistic or literary or scientific merit.

1435
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,720
It has to meet all three of those points for it to be considered obscenity.

1436
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,600
Boy, that's his whole show.

1437
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,580
Hey, I like to throw in educational and artistic and literary stuff from time to time.

1438
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,160
Yeah.

1439
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,100
Rules, man.

1440
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,120
The merit of it is a subjective judgment.

1441
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,800
That's your excuse.

1442
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,980
Yeah, we all do that.

1443
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,960
We all use that excuse.

1444
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,060
That's right.

1445
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,720
I'm an artist.

1446
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,920
We just really like to hear the sound of ourselves.

1447
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,500
Yeah.

1448
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,220
On and on and on and on and on.

1449
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:10,120
I didn't know that I liked to do that, but now that I've been on like 10 plus hours of show, it turns out that if you put a microphone in front of me, I'll just.

1450
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,360
I'll just start talking to my own whatever.

1451
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,100
Yeah, you'll have that.

1452
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,100
Sad, but true.

1453
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,300
Oh, well.

1454
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,560
Now I'm addicted to show.

1455
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,960
I'm sorry, listeners.

1456
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,700
Now you know.

1457
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,720
You guys got me addicted to show.

1458
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,880
That's not nice.

1459
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,180
Well.

1460
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,580
Just bad subgeniuses.

1461
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,480
The good thing is most people hate the sound of their own voice.

1462
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,060
They're scared of talking in public and for good reason.

1463
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,640
Well, yeah, sure.

1464
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,120
And I'm glad.

1465
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:35,820
Yeah.

1466
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,840
But this.

1467
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,440
But this.

1468
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,980
We are not those kinds of people.

1469
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,340
People.

1470
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:40,820
Yeah, people.

1471
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,220
Sure.

1472
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,760
But this.

1473
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,600
Well, I think that.

1474
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,740
You know what the significance of that is?

1475
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:54,200
That was the first comment on the Church of the Subgenius uttered by a caller on our first appearance on radio.

1476
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:54,600
Yeah.

1477
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,660
It's like the greatest thing that anyone could have said.

1478
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,060
That was the first reaction.

1479
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:10,100
Philo and I had been invited onto a talk show in Dallas and unexpectedly, I mean, we just sent the pamphlet out for the first time to public.

1480
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,860
And we ended up on this talk show.

1481
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:22,400
We had to come up with names, too, because we didn't want our human street names, you know, bad mouthing churches in Dallas, even indirectly.

1482
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,600
And we were very indirect in those days.

1483
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,900
But, yeah, the very first caller, after we'd been talking, being funny or whatever for a while, this guy calls in just.

1484
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,400
I'm never going to listen to KPFA again.

1485
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Well, you don't think people should invent their own religion?

1486
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,020
People.

1487
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,620
Yeah, people.

1488
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:37,940
Sure.

1489
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:38,620
But this.

1490
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,100
Oh, yes.

1491
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,680
So we it's not like we fixate on criticism and repeat it over and over again.

1492
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,640
But we do.

1493
00:50:52,720 --> 00:51:00,940
Well, I guess now that we're leaving, it can be revealed that this was not just nerd radio, but it was nude nerd radio.

1494
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,980
Now, we don't have to go on about that.

1495
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,340
I just thought I would mention that.

1496
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,440
I haven't worn pants on the air in all the 11 years I've been doing the show.

1497
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,260
So, yeah, you are listening to WCSB Cleveland 89.3 FM.

1498
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,920
And this is synesthesia.

1499
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,260
You have been listening to for the past hour.

1500
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,700
I will be here till midnight.

1501
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,340
But portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

1502
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,200
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

1503
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:34,220
Views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University or anybody with their head screwed on straight for that matter.

1504
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,220
Special thanks here to my guests in the studio tonight.

1505
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,720
Reverend Stang, Princess Wee and Baby Bear.

1506
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:40,580
Yay.

1507
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,080
Isn't he slick the way he does that?

1508
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:43,520
Uh-huh.

1509
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,560
You'd think he's been doing it every week for 15 years.

1510
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:47,940
Yeah.

1511
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,400
You'd think he had no life at all.

1512
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,400
You might be right.

1513
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,040
Thank you.

1514
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,420
You might be right.

1515
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,860
Well, thank you.

1516
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,240
The pleasure has been all mine, actually.

1517
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,600
Praise Dr. Sinister.

1518
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,420
You just took care of an hour of my two hours a week that I work on this.

1519
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,180
So, thank you for doing half my job for me.

1520
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,480
Wrecked my hour.

1521
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,260
Our pleasure.
