1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm without the biggest butt in five months when it fell 4%.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:15,360
President Obama continues to live in Ecuador where he's wanted for questioning about alleged sex crimes on Monday.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,260
Indonesian police say they found the dehydrated PR News.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,280
What is it? What's the matter?

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,160
I just had a terrible dream.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,480
What?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,480
It was blood and fire and thunder and something awful was moving in the middle of it.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,240
I could hear it roar and bellow.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,340
The Self-Genius.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,720
Power of the Self.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,220
What?

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,460
If I were to allow that to continue, he would blow every circuit in his body.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,460
That is?

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,240
That is correct, sir.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,420
Dry ass in your ass.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm not even staying. I always have batteries.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,560
And I got spare discs and I do backup and I got a little thing I stick.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,760
Well, I hope this isn't going to be one of these symposia where all we do is complain about our elderly complaints.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,740
Or is this going to be the complaining show?

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,080
Well, that's just what I was hoping it wouldn't be.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,200
We've already done that one.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,440
Everybody does.

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,580
Yeah, we did the complaining show first time.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,960
Last night were all other manner of various complaining.

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,400
Complaining, complaining, complaining.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,700
Maybe in honor of the weather, this should be the hot show.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,900
We're wine connoisseurs.

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,540
Wine connoisseurs.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,740
Whining.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,760
But we never get any cheese.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,700
Wine and cheese party.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,520
We don't get cheese.

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,520
All we get is wine.

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,960
Wine, wine.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,820
Whining.

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,600
Are you whining about whining?

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,000
Wine, wine.

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:01,440
So I almost got up this morning to come get you, Dr. Howe, so we could call our show partner, Puzzling Evidence, at the appropriate hour.

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,940
It would have been 6.30 here, I believe.

40
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,540
But he wouldn't even have picked up.

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,880
He would have seen it was us and just gone.

43
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,500
Puzzling Evidence did not answer the phone?

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,380
Well, we didn't actually call him.

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,780
Oh.

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,900
But you thought about it, right?

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
We did think about it.

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,380
Well, he should have read your.

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,020
Why didn't he pick up on my secret mental signals?

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,360
By stench of the spirit is like bone to a million slaughtered swine.

51
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,200
And in these times thy planet is wreathed in foul vapors of fire.

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,140
Hold on a minute.

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,100
The conspiracy has put a slight detour in front of us here.

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
I must change lanes.

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,000
But there are other things, other evil, dark, shadowy forces at work in this solar system of ours,

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
in this galaxy, in this corner of our universe.

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,340
I have a feeling that Negi, by imposing his twisted will upon the trajectories of Jehovah's neutrinos,

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,840
is able to deflect those trajectories.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,700
Feasibility study ended.

60
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,000
Abduction of human race?

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,940
Infeasible.

62
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,680
Warning, warning.

63
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Psychics applying the Puppers Slack have discovered secret Nazi UFO bases in the Antarctic.

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:19,980


65
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,840
The truth that President Truman never told us.

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,480
Dobbs plus his boring soul.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
The hideous Uberbrow.

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,860
They called him Wellman when he was a human.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,980
Before the Brow took over.

70
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,180
Before the Brow took over.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,920
This is what I do to the lighter deities.

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,000
Give them seconds until they slow way down.

73
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,280
Therefore,

74
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,380


75
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,800
he is a god.

76
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,500
End of quote.

77
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,220
I said, you're gonna have to get yourself in discernment here,

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,500
and be able to discern the spirit of God from the spirit of Hinduism.

79
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,880
I said, people in Haiti, I said, when the Holy Ghost hits them, they think it's Buddha.

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,600
Because Buddha hits them like the Holy Ghost hits them.

81
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,980
People in America think that when the Holy Ghost hits somebody, it's witchcraft.

82
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,140
Yes, witchcraft.

83
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,040
But when it hits those people down, they see demonic visions.

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
And the devil uses them.

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,040
Buddhism.

86
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,420
And witchcraft.

87
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,320
And the powers of the pagan gods.

88
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,220
The powers of the pagan gods produce its lines, signs, and wonders.

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,480
But I want you to know that the pagan gods and their false religions can do what they're doing in the war.

90
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,080
Bless God, what can we do with a true God?

91
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,460
With a true Christ?

92
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,880
With a true Holy Ghost?

93
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,400
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,980
Hallelujah.

95
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,500
How would God take the scales off your eyes?

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,280
And open your eyes to behold that the Lord's coming is at the door.

97
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:11,000
And that all that's happening in the world is getting us ready for Jesus Christ to dwell in the fullness of God in the saints.

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,240
That we will come forth with revelation and manifestation of the Holy Ghost.

99
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,320
Revealing Christ to the world.

100
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,620
That we will possess in our temples the very fullness of the Spirit.

101
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,520
That we'll be filled with the Spirit.

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
We'll be filled with it.

103
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,260
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.

104
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,480
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.

105
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,440
I don't care.

106
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,060
They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines and around here.

107
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,000
Call me anything.

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,140
But I'm preaching the truth.

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,380
They can talk about me and turn on this minister and say this ain't real.

110
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,220
But you let one of them hypocrites come and show where I'm wrong.

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,440
And take the Bible.

112
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
And prove that this ain't God.

113
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,040
And this ain't the Word of God to the people.

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,620
And I'll leave tomorrow.

115
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,900
Hallelujah.

116
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,900
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.

117
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,160
You say why?

118
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:06,500
Because there ain't nobody in the state of Texas and the state of Alabama, Florida or anywhere else can take the Word of God and prove this is wrong.

119
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,520
They may lie.

120
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
They may accuse.

121
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,920
They may tell all manner of evil.

122
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,180
But they cannot touch this Spirit.

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,020
They cannot touch this Word.

124
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,060
This is the Word of the Holy Ghost.

125
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,620
This is God's promise.

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
This is God's Word.

127
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,220
God's truth to you.

128
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
So when does this show start?

129
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,860
We're just warming up, right?

130
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,820
Stang's changing his batteries.

131
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,560
When the chaotic gestalt of mumbling and muttering resolves into something resembling preaching and sermonizing.

132
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,780
What is this?

133
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,420
Oh my gosh.

134
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,860
That's my tick jar, Dr.

135
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,260
Papa Joe's still out there?

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,140
Papa Joe is a gentleman and he realized there were too many docs up here.

137
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,620
He ran away in a huff.

138
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,160
Who did?

139
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,680
There he is.

140
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,200
There he is.

141
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,000
I see him down there.

142
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,540
Who are we talking about, Doctor?

143
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,900
I can't remember from one minute to the next.

144
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Papa Joe.

145
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,800
Papa Joe Mama.

146
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,240
I've told him since Gordon is leaving today.

147
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,860
Father Joe.

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,760
And he's not.

149
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,220
Father Joseph's mother.

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Yes, this will be my farewell show for this year, folks.

151
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,200
I can't tell you how damn glad I am.

152
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,900
Tomorrow at this game.

153
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,140
Yes, this is the day.

154
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


155
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


156
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


157
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


158
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


159
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


160
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


161
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


162
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,140


163
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,240
He was talking about just wanting to be in the car with the air conditioner on.

164
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,920
That's all.

165
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,840
Well, what I really want is a remote mic so I could be broadcasting from that air conditioned car right now.

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,500
A man with a heart condition really cannot tolerate these stalag-like conditions for very long, Dr. Howell.

167
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,360
The old ticker is full of slinkies.

168
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,300
It just doesn't work like it used to.

169
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,280
And the metal gets hot.

170
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,560
You can chew on any of the ticks you want from that jar there.

171
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,540
Ah, Reverend Stang Tickfar.

172
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,880
No, no, it's not rever- it's Father Joseph Mother's authentic tick farm.

173
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Don't open that.

174
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,040
That's that bottle of ticks that he collected.

175
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,120
Here they are.

176
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,540
He's got a bottle of ticks up here.

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:58,800


178
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
Can't you see them?

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Oh, I thought he said he was not a beverage.

180
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,460
This valuable science experiment will be offered at the auction.

181
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,700
There aren't even any holes in the lid.

182
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,640
How come those little buggers don't-

183
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,840
They don't need air.

184
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,460
He told me they can live without air for up to 60 days.

185
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,960
Microscopic presentation in real time.

186
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,040
Of the grappling apparatus of the tick that is used to scurf its way up your skin before it drills into your sucker butt.

187
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,420
Tomorrow at this time there will not be a performance of any kind in the cafe.

188
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,020
Instead, that is the time that has been selected for the Bobtism in the pond.

189
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:39,020
If you wish to participate in this time-honored holy ritual, the time given for it is 2 p.m.

190
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,340
Instead of sitting decorously in here and listening to us expound,

191
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:51,740
you have to go out into the squashy mud and contend with invertebrates of all kinds.

192
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,640
And receive your Bobtism from Reverend Ivan Stang himself.

193
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,120
And I will assist him as I always do.

194
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,880
Reverend Stang has actually identified a lot of the invertebrates in that pond.

195
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,780
In fact, he's about to eat a tin full of invertebrates.

196
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,800
By name, personally, I don't mean genus and species either.

197
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,580
He's already got them on YouTube videos.

198
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,300
They're bigger stars than he is.

199
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,320
He's eating a can of invertebrates right now.

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,980
We are doing a show tomorrow after the Bobtism.

201
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,100
Oh, after the Bobtism.

202
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,260
Oh, after the Bobtism.

203
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,980
Very well.

204
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,640
We'll do the soggy, mud-spattered leech prying off the show.

205
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,560
I will tell you people, in all honesty, I was prepared to be on my way today.

206
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,020
I was going to leave about 3 o'clock.

207
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,840
Air-dried leech.

208
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,660
And then Stang pulls out the contract, right, or his coals.

209
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
You've got two more shows to do.

210
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,960
Get your butt up on the stage, you old fart.

211
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,940
And here I am.

212
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,800
Well, Dr. Drummond, how did you pass the night?

213
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,300
In fitful slumber or in the sleep of a man?

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,760
In the sleep of the just.

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,300
He passed the night in two sittings in the sleep of the dead.

216
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,200
How did you pass that kidney stone?

217
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,560
At the fifth hour, you rose again.

218
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,280
It passed on its own.

219
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,140
I didn't even actually feel it.

220
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,180
I heard something get out of the bed late at night and open the door and run away.

221
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,620
It finally left the kidney stone?

222
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,360
Finally left.

223
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,300
The kidney stone of an overman is more intelligent than many mediocritons and pink bulls.

224
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,220
Although it's no braver than they are.

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:26,080
Notice that Reverend Stang is still at his unhallowed octopus feast down there, eating chunks of preserved tentacle out of a tiny can.

226
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,980
Could I see the box, the octopus box?

227
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,680
Well, they make it look rather tasty, all those little tentacles serving suggestions.

228
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,280
You don't get this.

229
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,440
You just get these little tentacles.

230
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,300
A sample on a cracker here?

231
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,100
Dr. Howe.

232
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,040
And it comes in garlic sauce.

233
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,800
That'll keep those skeeters from biting.

234
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,820
There's method in his madness.

235
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,580
There's method and madness mixed together.

236
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,200
Really?

237
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Sometimes we... never mind.

238
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,460
Going through these kegs anyway.

239
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:24,460


240
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:24,880
Ouch.

241
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,600
You're loving my wave in my mouth.

242
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:25,680
bolt

243
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,860
Any envy.

244
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,060
Amom.

245
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,320
He.

246
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,060
Thank you.

247
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,540
Thank you.

248
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,880
Thank you.

249
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,980
Thank you.

250
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,520
Thank you.

251
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,320


252
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,640
Thank you.

253
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Thank you.

254
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,180
Thank you.

255
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,980
Thank you.

256
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,820
Thank you.

257
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,940
Thank you.

258
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:40,640
We had a special guest at 15X Day, Sam Singleton, the atheist evangelist from Georgia, a friend of Reverend Susie Dufluzzi.

259
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,740
He delivered a pretty intense rant of which we played part one two weeks ago.

260
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,060
Here then is part two of Sam Singleton live at 15X Day.

261
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,400
Here I'm going to talk to the godly.

262
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,500
Godly.

263
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:06,540
Absent any evidence that your imaginary friend, this god that Abraham invented, exists,

264
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
you'll have to excuse our skepticism.

265
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
But it's okay.

266
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,620
Nobody's telling you you can't have imaginary friends.

267
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,580
Hell, there are times I wish some of my friends were imaginary.

268
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,380
But the thing with imaginary...

269
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,940
imaginary friends is they are not real.

270
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,060
You see, that's the imaginary part.

271
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,500
So you might not want to let on when you're out in public.

272
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,820
Kind of keep God to yourself so folks don't think you're a nut.

273
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,720
By all means, believe whatever you like.

274
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,760
Just don't expect real adults to trust you to look after anything important.

275
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,760
And forget about running for office.

276
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,380
Believe in imagination.

277
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,520
And leave.

278
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,860
Live a better career.

279
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:58,860


280
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,220
як is that right when you like somebody who will tell you his story.

281
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,140
I mean you should go into oneと思u to tell you who you think of him as an older man.

282
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,440
But if you think you're the other.

283
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,420
To your score, which you have no clue that your friend doesn't love,

284
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,260
you take what you just learnt from your friends

285
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,260


286
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,700
Imagine that.

287
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,440
Imagine you've ever been that guy.

288
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,200
credentialed to say this.

289
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,380
Imagine no consistent scale.

290
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,920
God and genocide, a match made in heaven

291
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:37,500
so now you got these 3.4 billion believers in the God of Abraham

292
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,820
all the Muslims and Christians and Jews

293
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,680
and instead of seeing how that gives them all something in common

294
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,500
they just fuss with one another

295
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,720
over who gets to decide for everybody else what their imaginary friend

296
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,820
Abraham's God is like

297
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,980
and what his rules are

298
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,840
and that's a whole other deal we'll get to here in a little bit

299
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,700
they may hate each other's guts

300
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,520
but they all seem to agree

301
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,300
that you can just ratify God into existence

302
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,680
that if you can get enough people to say it's so

303
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,180
it will actually become

304
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,700
something that you can just ratify God into existence

305
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:23,700


306
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:23,860
and so

307
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,020
and I say horseshit

308
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,080
what I am invoking here

309
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,780
is the time honored right of the minority

310
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,640
to ridicule the majority

311
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,980
the sacred standing of the tormented

312
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,620
to mock their tormentors

313
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,660
so if you can't abide me speaking

314
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm spanking holes in God's underpants

315
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,440
I got six words

316
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,280
brother Sam don't give no refunds

317
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,180
the godly been pushing me around my entire life

318
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,640
excuse the hell out of me if

319
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,160
while they take my lunch money I crack wise about their superstitions

320
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,580
you played a hand that's dealt you

321
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,420
you have to godly say to me they say

322
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,040
they say

323
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,820
well brother Sam

324
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,860
who the fuck do you think you are to be sacrilegious

325
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,160
sizing other people's traditions and beliefs

326
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,460
you see that's one of those offensive questions

327
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,680
the only way to answer it is defensively

328
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,320
so I generally start by explaining my qualifications

329
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,560
how my entire heritage amounts to nothing but

330
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,000
a great dismal swamp of godly traditions and beliefs

331
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,600
how I just come of one getting sucked under the scum like the rest of my people

332
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,780
how I just come of one getting sucked under the scum like the rest of my people

333
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,060
I went to a deal of trouble to extricate myself

334
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,740
anybody thinks I don't get to talk about it

335
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,300
anybody wants to shut me up

336
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,760
should go to hell

337
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,380
if they can find one

338
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,540
and I don't mean Michigan

339
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,040
now you see that sounds harsh

340
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,260
and I promised my darling wife, Sister Singleton,

341
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,940
that I would ease off the mean-mouthing.

342
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,640
But God damn it, this God deal just gets up under my hide

343
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,220
and goes to poking at me until I go to getting cranky.

344
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,600
From when I was a baby in swaddling clothes,

345
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,980
I was groomed for the ministry.

346
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,960
Fortunately, I came to my senses before anybody got hurt.

347
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,780
Long about time, certain parts of me got buzzing up.

348
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,960
I set out to find a way of getting God to reimburse me

349
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,020
for some of the shit I've had to put up with,

350
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,580
preferably one that didn't involve

351
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,680
rookin' the gullible out of their wages.

352
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,580
So here we are.

353
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,620
The gospel according to Bertrand Russell

354
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,800
says religion is based mainly on

355
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,180
fear.

356
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,200
And it sure was for me.

357
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,640
My folks, Brother John Calvin Singleton,

358
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,420
Sister Maureen Sedgwick Singleton,

359
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,280
were not assholes by nature.

360
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,200
I'd hate to think they set out to turn childhood

361
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,180
into some kind of freak show hell ride for my sisters and me.

362
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,440
But try her not, they did a bang-up job.

363
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,020
God!

364
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,780
That passage from Bertrand,

365
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,200
Russell, here's the rest of it.

366
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,280
Fear is the parent of cruelty.

367
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,580
It is therefore no wonder that cruelty and religion

368
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,820
have gone hand in hand.

369
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,640
Well, John Calvin and Maureen

370
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,940
sure didn't have any monopoly on using God

371
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,200
to terrorize their children.

372
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Parents and teachers and preachers

373
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
have been hard at that particular aspect

374
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,720
of the Lord's work

375
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,920
ever since the Bible first came out

376
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,560
as a full-length work of fiction.

377
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,660
After being serialized in Playboy.

378
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
Deuteronomy 31.

379
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,100
And that their children,

380
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,980
which have not known anything,

381
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,240
may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God

382
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,840
as long as they live.

383
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,640
Right through to Hebrews 10

384
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
where the Apostle Paul writes,

385
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,440
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

386
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,540
He ain't shitting neither.

387
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,960
It was pretty goddamn fearful

388
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,040
just falling into the hands of his kin.

389
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,400
When I was a child,

390
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,100
I preferred to think that somebody

391
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,160
was putting my folks up to the religious terrorizing

392
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,080
they laid on my parents or my sisters and me.

393
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,680
The gut-wrenching part

394
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,460
was accepting that there was no God

395
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,580
pulling their strings.

396
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,140
Everything they did,

397
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
they did it.

398
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,820
Out of their own free will.

399
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,600
Out of their own self-interest.

400
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,600
They loved God more than they loved us.

401
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,060
That was obvious from all the horrifying,

402
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
dangerous stuff

403
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,200
they were willing to expose us to

404
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,780
in order to reap the personal rewards

405
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,440
of God's favor.

406
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,280
Even a child could see

407
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,820
that like anybody who practices any religion,

408
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,700
they were ultimately,

409
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,840
in it for themselves.

410
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,580
The final benefit,

411
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,100
personal salvation,

412
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,080
all that goes with it,

413
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,520
couldn't help but go to them alone.

414
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,520
They could be lost.

415
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,620
You could backslide and fall from grace

416
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,020
and wind up burning in hell.

417
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,100
But salvation

418
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,520
couldn't be transferred to somebody else.

419
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,600
Couldn't even be shared.

420
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,860
And I was pretty sure

421
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,520
that if it came down to a choice

422
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,700
between God and me,

423
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,440
I was screwed.

424
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,060
I sure as hell knew better

425
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,440
than to put it to the test.

426
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,720
So on one level,

427
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,760
I was jealous of God.

428
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,200
And that's ironic.

429
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,960
Because God's pretty fucking neurotic himself.

430
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,340
Totally fatal attraction,

431
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,100
psycho stalker jealous,

432
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,940
and twisted enough to brag about it.

433
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,360
All the time.

434
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,840
He never shuts up

435
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,220
about how jealous he is.

436
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,260
I, the Lord your God,

437
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,360
am a jealous God.

438
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,140
That's from Exodus 20.

439
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Crazy God's

440
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,800
crazy crash course

441
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,160
in craziness.

442
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,160
It's so bad

443
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,000
that even when his toadies describe him,

444
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,160
it's the first word that comes to mind.

445
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,300
It's who he is.

446
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,720
What did the Apostle Paul write

447
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,020
to his pals in Corinth?

448
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,180
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?

449
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
You better goddamn not.

450
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
God refers to himself

451
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
like it's his given name.

452
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,320
Here's the direct quote.

453
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,520
And I shit you not.

454
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,000
Exodus 34, 14.

455
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,040
My name is jealous.

456
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,940
Jealous.

457
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,320
Now who's going to argue with that?

458
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,340
Tomorrow it might be

459
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,840
my name is spiteful

460
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,720
or avaricious

461
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,460
or puddentame.

462
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,180
You don't have to be any TV psychologist

463
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,200
to see that jealousy comes from

464
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,820
feelings of inadequacy

465
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,360
and insecurity.

466
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,020
Everybody experiences some jealousy.

467
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,680
But most grossly,

468
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,400
grownups don't,

469
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,100
like kindergarten teachers say,

470
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,020
act out.

471
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,120
Even little children know better than to act out.

472
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,920
God acts out like a motherfucker.

473
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,620
When he's displeased with one of his creations,

474
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
he just has him big old shit bit,

475
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,120
kills every damn body.

476
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,240
As if they mean no more,

477
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,760
less to him

478
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,600
than an ant farm does to a little Jeffrey Dahmer.

479
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,740
That's what the Bible adds up to.

480
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,440
Earth is a murderous God's ant farm.

481
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,980
He's already filled the ant farm with water.

482
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,560
Burned and tortured the ants.

483
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,760
Introduced deadly contagions and toxins

484
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,040
and ant bullies that prey on other ants.

485
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,420
So you never know what nasty shit

486
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,740
he's gonna spring next.

487
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,400
But there I was,

488
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,940
what you might call,

489
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,500
jealous of God.

490
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
And mad at him.

491
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,700
So in the back of my mind,

492
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,140
I'm thinking,

493
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,640
boy, if I ever run across this asshole,

494
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,360
I just don't know what.

495
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,780
And it turns out he doesn't even exist.

496
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,700
Can you believe that shit?

497
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,940
Now who's ass do I kick?

498
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,780
Some atheists say they can't be angry at God

499
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,160
because God is not real.

500
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,480
But I'm not.

501
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


502
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


503
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


504
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


505
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


506
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


507
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


508
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


509
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


510
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


511
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


512
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


513
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


514
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


515
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


516
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


517
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


518
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


519
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,480


520
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,580
I say the fact that God is fictitious

521
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,760
doesn't stop more than half the people on Earth

522
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,740
from believing in him.

523
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,400
So why should it stop me from being mad at him?

524
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,720
We ought to be able to discuss him

525
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,200
like any literary character.

526
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,480
Astro Boy.

527
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,700
Or Hannibal Lecter.

528
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,080
Or J.R. Bob Dobbs.

529
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,940
Or Reverend Ivan Stagg.

530
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,360
I moved to Cleveland and

531
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,320
and this white stuff fell out of the sky,

532
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,520
covered the ground.

533
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,100
It's called cocaine, Reverend Stagg.

534
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,260
And not in this part of Cleveland.

535
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,380
And the sad thing is,

536
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,500
at one point, Princess Wee said,

537
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,980
hey, did you hear that?

538
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,100
And I listened, I said,

539
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,220
oh, I just hear the cicadas and crickets

540
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,140
like I always do.

541
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,020
And I realized, wait, it's winter.

542
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,800
The ground is covered with snow.

543
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,480
There are no snow.

544
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,480


545
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,820
There are cicadas and crickets.

546
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,460
I have an ear disease.

547
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,520
And I went to the ear doctor

548
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,540
and he gave me a test and I flunked.

549
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,500
That's why I'm wearing headphones

550
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,660
and they're not.

551
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,560
Did he tell you to take the cicadas

552
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,920
and crickets out of your ears?

553
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,620
Damn! Why didn't that, you know...

554
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,440
Why didn't you think of that, Stagg?

555
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,200
That's so easy, you know.

556
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,260
Go for the cheap solution first.

557
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,560
He was going to sell me a hearing aid

558
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,680
and then he explained...

559
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,060
Oh, they're always going to sell you

560
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,480
some contraption or make you take

561
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,780
some expensive drug.

562
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,220
Actually, in this case...

563
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,860
There's a battery-powered bug

564
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,980
in those hearing aids.

565
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,780
Yeah.

566
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,600
The sad thing is the guy said,

567
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,040
I could sell you a hearing aid,

568
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,380
but they don't really work that well.

569
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,820
No.

570
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,640
No, they don't.

571
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
This one I've had in this ear for years

572
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
hasn't worked yet.

573
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,040
Well, they just amplify all the other sounds.

574
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,940
Oh, no, not the new technology.

575
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,280
The car...

576
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,520
The new technology.

577
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Are we talking about being old again?

578
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Remember that one?

579
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,240
I'm not.

580
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Let's talk about being young.

581
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,920
I can't remember.

582
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,540
I'm trying to think.

583
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,340
We members of the subgenius youth cadre

584
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,700
have important messages

585
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,660
for the rest of the subgenius youth division.

586
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,260
Faith in Bob.

587
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,040
Pride in one's work.

588
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,660
And even more pride in one's shirking and slack.

589
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,740
Golly, that's right.

590
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:11,940
Praise Bob.

591
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,760
Circle jerk by the pond in ten minutes.

592
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,760
See, I never was in the Boy Scouts,

593
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,620
so I missed out on all those circle jerks.

594
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,260
We're already behind the curve on that one.

595
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
That's the old Boy Scout stuff.

596
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,500
Oh, see, I was a Cub Scout.

597
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,660
Me too.

598
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,700
Of course, you have to go through Cub Scouts

599
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,100
before you get into Boy Scouts.

600
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,960
The den mother took care of all the circle jerks.

601
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,340
Did you ever get kicked out of Cub Scouts, Dr. Howe?

602
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,700
That horrible ceremony where you have to stand in the field

603
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500
and they rip the insignia off

604
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,060
while the drum plays and so forth?

605
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,020
Yeah, and they break your sword in half.

606
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,880
Yeah, I know.

607
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,520
And paint a big yellow stripe up your back.

608
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,000
It's hard for a child's self-esteem to go through all that.

609
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,560
But worth it for the other things.

610
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,840
For all the fun we had.

611
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,860
It's too bad all that great fireworks thing

612
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,440
used to happen.

613
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,580
Too bad that bus full of children

614
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,460
had to go over the cliff like that.

615
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,340
They had it coming.

616
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,340
This is the most boring show I have ever seen.

617
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,720
I was just thinking, that moment,

618
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,740
that just happened,

619
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,780
where no one was talking for a second.

620
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,600
You were thinking it was unbelievable.

621
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,380
That was like a shot of heroin.

622
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,380
The silence sank like music to my heart.

623
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,180
The show's on heroin.

624
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,380
It needs some speed.

625
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,900
We need a speedball here.

626
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,180
Some genius speedball.

627
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,820
I didn't take mine.

628
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,300
I wonder what was going on.

629
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,220
That's the problem.

630
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,220
You just don't...

631
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,580
See, there's another problem.

632
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,840
You gotta take all these pills.

633
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,120
That's because Papa Joe Mama got all the good drugs

634
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,560
and won't share them with us.

635
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,420
That's what the problem is.

636
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,080
You have to feel normal.

637
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,140
Well, you know how they told you, Philo,

638
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,380
when you started smoking that frop

639
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,940
the first time you smoke it,

640
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,780
it's cloud nine.

641
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, it's so nice up there.

642
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,780
And then the next time you smoke it,

643
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,560
you get to cloud eight.

644
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
But you have another one

645
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,380
and that gets you to cloud nine.

646
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,560
And this continues in a vicious cycle

647
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,220
till you're smoking 15 joints a day

648
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,140
just to stay normal.

649
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,800
On cloud one.

650
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,800
Yeah, but that's street marijuana.

651
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,840
Just to get to cloud one.

652
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,320
That's not frop.

653
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,280
I mean, a lot of people,

654
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,240
just to clarify,

655
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,020
you'll see people stand around

656
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,940
smoking this dirt weed and going,

657
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,920
we're froping, man.

658
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,720
No, you're not froping.

659
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,760
If you were froping,

660
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,940
you wouldn't be able to say those words.

661
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,000
What a liar you are, Reverend Stang.

662
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,340
Oh, I guess you haven't had your hit yet.

663
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,240
Huh?

664
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,180
See, he doesn't even know.

665
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,620
He's never even had real frop.

666
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,440
Never had real frop.

667
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,420
Habba frop zipulops.

668
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,360
That was the Buck Naked's secret church name.

669
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,140
But then we decided he wasn't worthy.

670
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:50,960
Well, he was named after the herb.

671
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,520
Yeah.

672
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,360
But he was named after the herb.

673
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,820
Yeah, right.

674
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,620
We took that name away from him.

675
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,280
That's right.

676
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,040
That's right.

677
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,580
He did not live up to it.

678
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,800
He didn't even really live up to Buck Naked.

679
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,840
No, we took away all his other names too.

680
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,440
Plus, there were at least 20 other Reverend Buck Nakeds

681
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,400
in the world that weren't even part of churches.

682
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,560
There was even a rockabilly band.

683
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,960
An Austin called Buck Naked and the Jaybirds.

684
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,800
And he had that too, didn't he?

685
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,040
Yeah.

686
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,620
That's a different Buck Naked.

687
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,040
This always comes up.

688
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,180


689
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,100
I mean, it's such a common name, Buck Naked.

690
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,280
Hey, what's your last name?

691
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,620
Naked.

692
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,260
Oh, your first name must be Buck.

693
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,240
You smoke, maybe?

694
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,860
Yeah.

695
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,760
Anything.

696
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,860
Yeah.

697
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,600
Here.

698
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,240
You smoke this.

699
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,080
Take pipe.

700
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,440
Yeah, so you smoke.

701
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,300
I beg you, smoke that.

702
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,380
Do it, Alan.

703
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,560
Now, please, could you just move?

704
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
No, I take it alone.

705
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,760
It's now, Alan.

706
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,540
It's now.

707
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,380
Now, now I feel refreshed.

708
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:11,520
It's here now, but that's usa—

709
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,060
我不 Т pedestrian, я собой ofårной цפали.

710
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


711
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


712
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


713
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


714
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


715
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


716
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


717
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


718
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


719
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


720
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


721
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,060


722
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,380
News in Washington. I'm unchanged after the meeting. He was not hurt. State law permits

723
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,560
PR News. A U.S. team led by the FBI has now spread to Sydney, Australia. We were just

724
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,580
been sealed off by an American investigative team today. Also today in Chicago at this

725
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:35,500
hour of today, the new United Nations envoy, Laos al-Bahir al-Bahir, raged in several cities

726
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:42,500
around the country. Laos al-Bahir al-Bahir also killed two NATO troops. About 29,000

727
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,100
workers say this is PR News. It's just something that we're taking a very deliberate approach

728
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:56,780
on. A rally gets underway in Chicago at this hour for President Vladimir Putin. A demonstration

729
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:04,060
is underway in Moscow against PR News in Washington. Now, as you notice on the stage, we have the

730
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,740
slot rods.

731
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,580
So everybody give a hand and a crotch scratch to the slot rods.

732
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,520
Ah-oo-ga!

733
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,200
And it's great because one of us has not tuned yet.

734
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,840
Well, I was ready to go into a lecture about ah-oo-ga as being appropriate to the slot

735
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,120
rods.

736
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,580
Please do.

737
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,840
History. If you're at all familiar with monster hot rod.

738
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,180
Slot card.

739
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,440
Spot.

740
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,120
Scale auto.

741
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,800
Scale auto?

742
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,340
Wait a minute.

743
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,660
Scale auto.

744
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,580
This is even nerdier than I thought.

745
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,060
Oh, yeah.

746
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,180
Jesus. I thought it was real hot rods.

747
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,040
No, we are the only scale auto.

748
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh, my God. These guys. Okay. Back when I was a kid, it was cool if you were into hot

749
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,880
rods and monsters.

750
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,840
It could be 124.

751
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,360
These guys are so nerdy, they're into miniature scale hot rods and monsters.

752
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,860
That is. I'm going to take this shirt off.

753
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,200
Immediately. I've had, I'm out of this cult.

754
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,620
It was a good cult for about five minutes.

755
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,100
So I thought it was real hot rods.

756
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,800
Now find out it's scale model hybrid.

757
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,980
You might as well be a bird watcher, Lionel train collector.

758
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,980
What's wrong with this world?

759
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,860
What's with you people?

760
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,540
Can't be model glue.

761
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,680
You can't be model glue, he said.

762
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,680
So I've heard.

763
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,100
Personally, for me, it was film cement.

764
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,040
I worked as a negative cutter for two years and it was just the same stuff.

765
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,900
Acetone.

766
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,780
Make you high as a kite and you'll never get those brain cells back.

767
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,500
No way. Just burns right through them.

768
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
What a way to go.

769
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,200
Glue, model cement.

770
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,120
Reverend Angry Larry, how many Aurora Frankenstein?

771
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,700
Models did you assemble?

772
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,680
Can you guess offhand?

773
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,560
I actually just finished one about two months ago.

774
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,900
So you did a new, a new one.

775
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,820
But when you were a kid.

776
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,900
Oh, when I was a kid, I used to do that and Godzilla.

777
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,180
Yeah. How many?

778
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,740
Oh, God. Can you count?

779
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,320
Oh, I can count.

780
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,200
I did four.

781
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,700
I did four each, at least of all of those model kits.

782
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,200
I remember. Yeah, I did.

783
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,500
I did about three or four.

784
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,160
And the forgotten prisoner was one of my favorites.

785
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,480
Yeah.

786
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,280
Here's a stick.

787
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:34,740
Here's a stick.

788
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,400
I could do the mummy.

789
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,600
I got my records.

790
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,340
This idea of mummy all the way through painting it in 20 minutes.

791
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,320
Oh, yeah.

792
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,380
We're professionals here.

793
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,580
What? Yes.

794
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,040
This is a professional rock.

795
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,640
So Reverend Angry Larry's played

796
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,900
five times, six, seven.

797
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,220
I've seen him many times.

798
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,660
Oh, and this is a beach blanket party.

799
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,120
So we want people up here.

800
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,360
We're dancing.

801
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,020
Oh, yeah.

802
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,080
This is the microphone I think they gave me.

803
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,420
I don't know.

804
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,780
I don't know if any.

805
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,540
I can't tell.

806
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,440
I don't hear.

807
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,320
I can't hear anything.

808
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,980
So it doesn't matter.

809
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,660
Hey, Elliot, are we going to have like monitors up here?

810
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,380
I mean, even just for like guitars and whatnot or.

811
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,500
I'm just asking.

812
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,420
I'm not one of those people that go, hey, you know what?

813
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,900
Can I get more in this side?

814
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,800
Because this here is like.

815
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,180
Touch it.

816
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

817
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Flippy, flabby, flup.

818
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,100
More monitor lizards.

819
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,800
That's what we say.

820
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,480
More monitor lizards.

821
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:35,900
Yes.

822
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,100
More monitor lizards.

823
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,800
No.

824
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,820
Like the thing said, we're just a straight up surf band.

825
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,780
So we want like as many female dancers up here.

826
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,160
Yeah, we need some bikini clad go-go dancers.

827
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,940
Right, right.

828
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,600
So Susie.

829
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:52,900
You don't have.

830
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,400
Don't worry.

831
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,800
You don't.

832
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,140
You don't have to be human looking.

833
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:55,600
No.

834
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,600
No.

835
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,520
Which means that.

836
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:57,900
Yeah.

837
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:58,940
Anything.

838
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,880
Anything can dance up here, even if you're male.

839
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,600
OK, more dancers or not.

840
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,220
What are the amino acids going to come on there?

841
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,140
They're a good band.

842
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,520
Yeah.

843
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,580
Whatever.

844
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
What happened to them?

845
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,280
They are still the only aliens that you can actually depend on showing up.

846
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,260
Even though they weren't here last year, they had to get real jobs.

847
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,200
But we were.

848
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,500
We understood that.

849
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:24,660
We were.

850
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,040
I was here playing drums.

851
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,640
All right.

852
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
It happens every day, including Christmas.

853
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,340
We were explaining to Susie how she would feel happy she didn't want to show up if God皆さん

854
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,340


855
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,340


856
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,860
This was the only at the ocean.

857
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,140
I couldn't eat something when I went to the facts place myself.

858
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,260
There were plenty of other experimentation.

859
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,260


860
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,280
But everything would get puzzle if printed.

861
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,280


862
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,420
It was nobody.

863
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,100
Nobody couldn't get this paper.

864
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:28,960
Thank you.

865
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,160
Thank you.

866
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,400
Thank you.

867
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,540
How do you bring an erudition?

868
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,640
You pack it?

869
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,480
What is an erudition?

870
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,880
Erudition?

871
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,340
Yeah.

872
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,800
You said they bring their erudition.

873
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,500
Well, you can bring their erudition.

874
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,900
Well, that's the one they have, right?

875
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,560
Bring an erudition to the table.

876
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,300
An erudition implies a specialized...

877
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,220
I didn't say I brought it.

878
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,240
I didn't bring it.

879
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,880
No, but you said they brought their erudition,

880
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,520
and I wanted to know what one was.

881
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,720
Why did you bring it?

882
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,440
Well, you know.

883
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,420
If anyone here has any taste,

884
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,020
we could use...

885
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:21,940
Alone.

886
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,980
Alone?

887
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,360
There is no taste up here.

888
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,640
No one...

889
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,520
If anyone here happens to have good taste,

890
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,880
obviously we need it.

891
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,380
The church needs it.

892
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,760
We've never had good.

893
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,220
That's something we've never had.

894
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,640
So you're saying the taste is something

895
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,280
you just have a deficit of,

896
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,760
but not necessarily in degrees of...

897
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,780
And where is our taste?

898
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,500
...goodness or badness?

899
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,260
Where has it gone?

900
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,400
You left it in the car with the erudition,

901
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,840
and it spoiled.

902
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,000
It went bad.

903
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,160
I did not borrow files

904
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,240
that somebody else brought the erudition.

905
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,120
I had nothing to do with it or the taste.

906
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,920
I just had the air conditioning.

907
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,940
Now we're starting to fall apart

908
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,240
on the physical as well as the mental place.

909
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:03,780
Oh, the wind has gone away.

910
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,220
My legs are overheating.

911
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,960
Dr. Drummond will now fix things.

912
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,300
Yeah, they're on fire.

913
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,260
Help me somebody.

914
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,080
My legs.

915
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,680
The flaming legs of G. Gordon Gordon.

916
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,120
Friends, a few weeks ago,

917
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,680
a school bus full of nice young people,

918
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,880
many of them from Europe,

919
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,080
came through Cleveland on their way home.

920
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,120
They were shooting a documentary

921
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,500
or a lot of little documentaries

922
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,720
for their project called

923
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,360
New World Manifesto.

924
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,040
You can see their videos so far

925
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,940
if you Google New World Manifesto.

926
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,860
They interviewed me for about an hour

927
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,220
and skillfully carved it down to 10 minutes,

928
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,020
which I will share with you now

929
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,880
because it saves me that much editing time

930
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,540
and I'm already late with this show.

931
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,060
Be prepared because I step out of character

932
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,660
and talk shop somewhat,

933
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,900
which means lying about Bob and the church

934
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,320
in order to protect them from scumbags

935
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,260
and worse, imitators.

936
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,380
Everybody's resistance to new and different things,

937
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,900
that's the conspiracy.

938
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,640
It's inside us.

939
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,420
It's inside everyone except Bob

940
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,080
who has nothing inside of his head,

941
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,840
nothing at all.

942
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,780
He's not smart.

943
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,440
He's lucky.

944
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,640
Hence the term subgenius.

945
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,800
Almost anybody with 35 bucks can qualify.

946
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,540
What the hell are we doing here?

947
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,080
No, I was going to ask you that.

948
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,840
What the hell are you doing here?

949
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,000
Where are all these people in my house?

950
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,740
We're still trying to figure out

951
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,560
what the hell the church of the subgenius is.

952
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,140
Dr. Philodrumon and I found out the hard way

953
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,640
that you can't say anything about the church

954
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:49,640


955
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:49,640


956
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,980
and you can't say anything so ridiculous

957
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,920
that somebody won't believe it.

958
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,840
It's also a complete joke and rip on religion.

959
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,160
Let's make up a fake cult and tell people

960
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,620
exactly what they most want to hear

961
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,620
and see how they react, you know,

962
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
see who believes it.

963
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,840
A lot of us really, our background is in monsters,

964
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,960
comic books and science fiction.

965
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,620
And to us, religion is a kind of a lie.

966
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:19,620


967
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,900
It's like an even cooler form of science fiction

968
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,380
because people will kill each other over that.

969
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,380
It's not that we love Bob so much,

970
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,660
it's that we love the idea of everybody else going to hell.

971
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,680
That's what we have in common with all the other religions.

972
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,960
When you make a religion, you have to have three elements.

973
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,180
The master, who's in this case Bob.

974
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,140
A goal, which is slack.

975
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:49,600
And a goal, which is to have a good life.

976
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:49,600


977
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,900
Slack is like freedom or happiness.

978
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,920
It's different for everybody.

979
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,320
You can't put your finger on it.

980
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,920
So they can't sue us when they don't get it.

981
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,640
And you have to have an enemy.

982
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,540
And Philo named the enemy, the conspiracy.

983
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,860
We decided that the conspiracy was everybody.

984
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,580
If you think about it, the United States

985
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,060
was founded by people, by your religious nuts.

986
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,520
The European religious nuts,

987
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,600
who couldn't, nobody else could stand

988
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:26,340
Hence, we have this huge population of insane fundamentalists of every kind.

989
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,860
From the different Christian groups to fundamentalist Jewish people,

990
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,500
fundamentalist New Agers.

991
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,360
I mean, I know fundamentalist Druids and fundamentalist Wiccans.

992
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,380
They don't like the Church of the Subgenius.

993
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,340
However, the Druids and Wiccans who are more open-minded love it.

994
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,620
Because we piss off the fundamentalists.

995
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,600
Do people feel like it's a real thing?

996
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,000
Is it really a community? Do you get a sense?

997
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,680
Yeah, it is.

998
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,800
And by the same token, although it is a community,

999
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,240
it also has the problems that a community does.

1000
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,980
I think it's human nature for people to want to simplify things.

1001
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,680
Life is complicated.

1002
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,140
And people are really complicated.

1003
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,660
Society is insane.

1004
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,960
So a simple explanation, it may not be true, but it feels good.

1005
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,240
In fact, a lot of Bob's most popular slogans are things that sound good,

1006
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,260
but if you take it apart, it's not words to live by.

1007
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,680
Well, how does Rush Limbaugh describe what he does?

1008
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,060
Making the complex simple.

1009
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,660
Well, guess what, dude?

1010
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,880
The complex isn't simple. It's complex.

1011
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,320
The only real law that we go by is,

1012
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,000
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1013
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,940
That is when you really can live by.

1014
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,400
I used to be an angry young man,

1015
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,540
and I knew exactly what was good for everybody else.

1016
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,920
Republicans were evil and Democrats were good.

1017
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,400
Well, I got a little older and found out,

1018
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,380
well, actually everybody's kind of a bit evil and kind of a bit good.

1019
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,800
And there's, you know, I'm not so sure.

1020
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,960
The more I know, the more I know I don't know.

1021
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,100
The less sure I become about things, the more I know.

1022
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,220
Whereas the more ignorant somebody is,

1023
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,940
the more sure they are.

1024
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,560
The more sure they are about what little they do know.

1025
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,480
You know, if you're different,

1026
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,440
then you're probably better than most people.

1027
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,540
Well, that's not true, necessarily.

1028
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,280
It might be, but boy, a lot of people like to think that.

1029
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,780
And as Bob said, you'll pay to know what you really think.

1030
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,880
And enough people did that I've been able to make a living

1031
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,420
off of telling people what they most want to hear.

1032
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,480
But it's hard work, actually.

1033
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,520
You know, I put in more hours per day

1034
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,260
than people with real jobs do.

1035
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,200
Because I have a slave driver for a boss, that's me,

1036
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,980
and I have this shirker, slacker for an employee, that's me.

1037
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,120
So there's sort of a constant tension there.

1038
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,860
And he works weekends, too.

1039
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,500
I mean, it's not like a night of fun.

1040
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:06,640
I'm working now.

1041
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,360
Yeah, that's right.

1042
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,100
Sunday's a big one.

1043
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,320
Yeah, Sunday's a busy day for preachers.

1044
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,920
So you don't have a lot of slack in your own life at the moment?

1045
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,740
Actually, I do now.

1046
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,660
I've learned over the years how to manage my time a little bit better.

1047
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,000
It was driving me nuts in the 90s.

1048
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,580
It really was.

1049
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,340
It was wrecking my health.

1050
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,960
And I finally kind of let people know I was going nuts.

1051
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,820
And suddenly I got more help.

1052
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,680
To tell the truth, when we first started doing this,

1053
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,680
I kind of took it a little too seriously myself.

1054
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,840
You snap out of it, you know.

1055
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,760
Number 23 is very popular.

1056
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,200
Yes.

1057
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,660
Yeah, there was, I mean, there's sections of Book of the Subgenius that I put together

1058
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,660
when I was probably taking it a little bit too seriously myself.

1059
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,320
And that's what attracts the real kooks.

1060
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,520
Luckily, my friends helped me, you know, keep a perspective.

1061
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,880
And now it's my job to help other people keep perspective on it.

1062
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,820
And keep it fun, you know.

1063
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,620
That's the main thing.

1064
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,420
It's got a, number one is the laughs.

1065
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,880
Wow, that's a lot of great information.

1066
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,780
We did spend a lot of time trying to formulate one question that we're going to ask.

1067
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,160
It's basically, if I can get this right, in this ever-changing world that we live,

1068
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,260
what would you like to manifest?

1069
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,880
And what are some steps we could take toward creating that vision?

1070
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,800
What we don't want is for the Church of the Seventh to be a place where we can say,

1071
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,980
well, we want the Subgenius to become a real cult.

1072
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,780
We're basically doing showbiz.

1073
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,180
I hate to say that, that's stepping out of character,

1074
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,480
but honestly, you know, we don't want it to turn into another Scientology or Mormonism.

1075
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,880
As ridiculous as that sounds, those things started out just as ridiculous.

1076
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,760
Some great thinkers talk about the singularity,

1077
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,780
when computers become so brilliant that they save our asses.

1078
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:22,240
Well, I'm afraid that the singularity is running neck and neck in a race against the ideogularity.

1079
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,200
Where, you know, will the idiots get there first?

1080
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:34,360
You know, will, I mean, one minute Germany was the most civilized place in the world,

1081
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:39,620
and suddenly, wham, this horrible, barbaric thing is going on.

1082
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,540
I can see that happening in the United States the way the climate is right now.

1083
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:48,160
I pray that the climate change deniers are right.

1084
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,780
Every day, I pray that they are right,

1085
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,640
that mankind isn't making things worse,

1086
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,100
and if the weather does get worse, it's not our fault.

1087
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,220
But I fear that that's not the case.

1088
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,880
Bob will always have customers.

1089
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,900
In that respect, in the long run, I'm very hopeful.

1090
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,720
I have no doubt that eventually there will be a utopian world

1091
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,960
where everybody gets along,

1092
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,920
and within reason,

1093
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,020
and life is easy,

1094
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,240
and you get to die when you want to,

1095
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,340
but I'm afraid that homo sapiens are not going to be involved in that world.

1096
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,760
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs, Connie Dobbs,

1097
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,420
and any other deities you care to throw into the mix,

1098
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,920
I now pronounce you ordained subgenius ministers,

1099
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,200
with all the rights and privileges granted to any holy person,

1100
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,940
such as being crucified,

1101
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,200
hung by lynch mobs,

1102
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,020
pursued to your grave by insane fanatics,

1103
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,420
and everything,

1104
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,220
and plus you can perform marriages,

1105
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,760
and I charge 200 bucks myself for that.

1106
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,660
Yeah, die, let somebody turn it into a religion, screw it.

1107
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,580
I really like this drop of hatred.

1108
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,360
Huh?

1109
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,920
The drop of hatred, and kill those normals.

1110
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,800
Right, right.

1111
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,880
Well, hate is a really important part of it.

1112
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,260
But when your hate builds up enough

1113
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,540
and becomes hate squared,

1114
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,440
then it turns full circle and becomes pure love.

1115
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:17,840
Yeah.

1116
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,940
It's the hate of hate itself.

1117
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,140
Yes, I love it.

1118
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:23,720
Sort of.

1119
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,700
I love this hatred.

1120
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,040
Right, right.

1121
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,940
Yes, we love to hate.

1122
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,720
That was the New World Manifesto video,

1123
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,560
which you can find by googling New World Manifesto.

1124
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,260
This is our Slack number 1380.

1125
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,640
And you can find links to our YouTube channel,

1126
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,100
which is the Church of the Subgenius.

1127
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,440
Links and information about everything

1128
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,900
are at subgenius.com,

1129
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,860
where you can also learn about the subgenius history

1130
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,980
and cult management online class,

1131
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,340
which starts October 1st and goes for six weeks.

1132
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,840
It's a look behind the scenes.

1133
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,600
And to close the show,

1134
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,380
here is a look inside the scenes.

1135
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:08,380
There are parasites that alter the behavior of the host.

1136
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,100
Why are you telling me something I don't know?

1137
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,940
In order to make the host do riskier things.

1138
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,980
Sing along with Philo or something?

1139
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,820
That same parasite actually affects humans.

1140
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,760
The same parasite that affects the behavior of some birds

1141
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,240
and makes them do risky things.

1142
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,180
Because the next phase of the parasite's life

1143
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,020
is in the creature that eats the bird.

1144
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,680
Well, those parasites can affect humans

1145
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,720
and they cause...

1146
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,020
Women to indulge in risky sexual behavior

1147
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:48,080
and it causes men to indulge in risky physical fighting type behavior.

1148
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,680
Where do we get these birds?

1149
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,400
Yeah, it's...

1150
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,820
Well, isn't there some disease, a parasite that gets on an ant

1151
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,580
and makes it sit on the top of a grass stalk so it's sheep can...

1152
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,680
That's the most interesting parasite that you mentioned.

1153
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,460
I was wondering when someone was going to...

1154
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,440
Yeah, do you know more about that one, Dr. Howell?

1155
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,380
That's the one I was...

1156
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,120
The one that gets inside an ant's brain

1157
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,740
and partially disables it and that ant climbs up onto a stalk

1158
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,420
and the parasite continues to grow.

1159
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,600
It's a fungus.

1160
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,700
It splits open the ant's head

1161
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,460
and it grows out from that place on the stalk

1162
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,320
and then the spores rain down from that

1163
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,100
and other ants take them up.

1164
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,640
There's a parasite that affects snails

1165
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,420
and causes their antennae

1166
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,380
to become beautiful rainbow colored

1167
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,840
and five times their normal size

1168
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,760
and that attracts birds to eat that snail.

1169
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,060
And that's...

1170
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,240
And when the bird craps,

1171
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,260
you're crapping little baby parasites everywhere.

1172
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,080
And isn't nature wonderful?

1173
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,100
Mother Nature.

1174
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,740
And all those parasites are down at the pond.

1175
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,200
Right. We'll meet them tomorrow.

1176
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,680
You will be introduced to them personally by Reverend Stang.

1177
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,820
They'll be introduced into you personally.

1178
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,920
Well, that's what I meant.

1179
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,240
I just didn't want to scare anybody.

1180
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,340
Well, last year we dunked a whole bunch of people in there

1181
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,000
and no one died that we know of.

1182
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,120
Well, it's not the ones that make you die.

1183
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,520
It's the ones that get in your brain

1184
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,380
and make you climb to the top of a tree

1185
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,660
so that the aliens can pick you up.

1186
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,740
No, there's a parasite in the pond

1187
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,260
that makes you come back to X Day every year.

1188
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:29,880
They're not here.

1189
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:30,620
I wonder why.

1190
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,320
I think I got that one at Sherman.

1191
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,980
And engage in risky behavior?

1192
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:34,760
Yeah.

1193
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,000
What happened to them?

1194
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,320
Of course.

1195
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,980
Remember Bunny Day and everybody that we baptized?

1196
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,020
They didn't come back.

1197
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,780
That's true. I thought Bunny was going to be here.

1198
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,220
That's funny, isn't it?

1199
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:44,480
Yeah.

1200
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,340
That's very strange.

1201
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:46,880
Yeah.

1202
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,160
A curious coincidence.

1203
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,580
Of course, when we speak of a coincidence,

1204
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,940
it's all that two things are happening at the same time

1205
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,880
as they're bound to do.

1206
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,940
That's what it is.

1207
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,500
Them big strong men that wave guns around.

1208
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,800
Two things happen, it's a coincidence, right?

1209
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,640
Three things happen.

1210
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:04,740
It's a fact.

1211
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,740
It's got to be a conspiracy.

1212
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,120
Especially those ones with tattoos all over them.

1213
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,120
Did you have a bunch of old blurry things

1214
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,280
that were once tattoos?

1215
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,320
One poison tattoo is not covered with Reverend Stang.

1216
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,700
I don't know where you got your vocabulary from,

1217
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,560
but that is not...

1218
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,580
There's Mrs. Drummond and Lily.

1219
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,500
Well, here's your better half, Philo.

1220
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,020
Yeah.

1221
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,260
Hello.

1222
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,480
Yes, it's the little Drummondite coming aboard.

1223
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,540
Okay, you can leave now, Gordon.

1224
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,680
Lily's here.

1225
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,340
Wait a minute, I was contracted for two shows.

1226
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,880
Well, we were just waiting for somebody interesting to show up,

1227
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,320
and she's here, so...

1228
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,820
What do you have?

1229
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,340
Oh, look, a bowl of ice cream.

1230
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,560
Oh, little...

1231
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,740
Folks, look at that.

1232
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,540
That lovely lady brought her husband some ice cream.

1233
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,140
There you go.

1234
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,100
He's not going to share it with us.

1235
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,460
It's parasite-flavored ice cream, to be fair.

1236
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1237
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1238
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1239
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1240
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1241
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1242
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1243
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1244
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1245
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1246
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1247
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1248
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1249
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1250
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1251
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,920
Ooh, thank you.

1252
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,780
Actually, it looks like he's eating a bowl of excrement.

1253
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,180
Oh, if somebody would buy me an ice cream bar.

1254
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,360
Somebody get Hal an ice cream.

1255
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,140
I'm tired of listening to him whine.

1256
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,540
Ice cream?

1257
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,940
Uh, um...

1258
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,180
Would you like a tick in your ice cream, Philo?

1259
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,080
This is an important message from the U.S. Department of Unusual Noises.

1260
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,680
Stay away from buildings and avoid protective clothing to reduce injuries.

1261
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,540
When it is safe, call CDC info.

1262
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,840
Sire, there is no more money.

1263
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,280
We gotta get some money.

1264
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,460
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back, flattened, wharton,

1265
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,760
Philip Bunker Burton, Perkaluma Burton,

1266
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,100
doesn't wash tonight at all.

1267
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,040
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1268
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,540
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1269
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,320
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1270
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,660
And not just this show, but subgenius.com,

1271
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,380
and all the other archive sites.

1272
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,900
But if you truly love Bob,

1273
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,460
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1274
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,420
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1275
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,960
or especially the radio page,

1276
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,980
or the catalog store pages,

1277
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,300
and help out financially as best you can.

1278
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,640
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1279
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:30,300
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1280
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,220
But some of you still have jobs.

1281
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,600
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1282
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,140
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1283
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,520
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1284
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,860
All we're saying is that

1285
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,260
blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1286
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,340
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1287
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,920
We also take checks and money orders to

1288
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,800
Subgenius Foundation.

1289
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,920
P.O. Box.

1290
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:09,260
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1291
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,480
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1292
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,480
You're welcome.

1293
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,620
That wasn't quick.

1294
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,380
What are you doing?

1295
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:32,920
DAVID exists.

1296
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,540
Are you supposed to beooo succeed?,

1297
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,320
why did you write this the first time I've seen you?

1298
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,660
That's the more you like I wanna do,

1299
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:39,660


1300
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,700
I just wanna see when Ier wants to make goin be good.

1301
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:40,700


1302
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,820

1303
