1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:07,240
Remember, people watch the line on drinking to make sure you have alcohol and fire on every level of your home.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,440
Remember, if someone in your household smokes or is under the influence of fire, you must be aware of Ontario.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,620
Remember, I'm a dangerous drinker.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,760
Remember, there's more to responsible drinking than alcohol and fire on every level of your home.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,460
Remember.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,380
Our All-Swab.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:42,280
Oh yes, our testing is working out fine so far as we test, test, test all of our little microphones and our background music.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,080
Is that okay?

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,480
Sounds good.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,440
Tarzan's radio station has now been assembled successfully.

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,440
Thank you.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:03,620
At the Dockstock Mountain House, Dracula's Castle, Stang Ranch, Stangsville, Stang County, Texas.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,900
Huh.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Now all we need is a show.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,960
A show.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,840
Oh, hey, hey.

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:51,700
I would love to be a part of this.

18
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,040
Oh.

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,440
Hey.

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,320
On the ground too

21
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,020
Yeah we got high

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,620
So high

23
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,480
On the ground too

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,880
We ate lots of mushrooms

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,860
To commune with nature

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,000
How are we to know

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
We got to move our nature

28
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,000
500 colors

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Flash into my brain

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,020
My cell division occurred

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,000
In three or four planes

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,340
My brain was blasted

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,080
My head feeling thick

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,440
My eyeballs protruding

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
But I didn't get sick

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,160
We packed up our kids

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,260
But we kept seeing dots

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,240
Yeah we found that the peak

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,320
Had gotten all the best spots

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,700
So we got high

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,420
So high

42
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,940
On the ground too

43
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,700
Yeah we got high

44
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,500
So high

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,980
On the ground too

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,760
Yeah we got high

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
People were happy

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
They were all having fun

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,560
While Dr. Stripop

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,760
Was farming skulls in the sun

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,820
The corpses were swinging

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,800
Their love did abound

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,620
The average corpse

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,900
Floated a foot off the ground

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,980
The band that dared not

56
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,940
Was speaking its name

57
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,240
While the doctors on the flint

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Show were claiming their fame

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
Sparked on explosion

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,680
And

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:51,260
We'll be right back.

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:01,820
Thank you.

63
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,780
Thank you.

64
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,500
Thank you.

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Thank you.

66
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,060
Thank you.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,140
Thank you.

68
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,180
Thank you.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,500
Thank you.

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Thank you.

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,840
Thank you.

72
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,400
Thank you.

73
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,780
Thank you.

74
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,780
Thank you.

75
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,180
Thank you.

76
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,700
Thank you.

77
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,940
Thank you.

78
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,440
Thank you.

79
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,540
It looks like beer, too, until you examine the fine print on the bottle.

80
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:37,960
And there's a lot of beer been flowing around, and I think that's why there's so many dragging subgenius feet around.

81
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,760
There's been a lot of good local beer, too.

82
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:51,900
Some friends of mine who distill spirits, you know who they are, Baby Bear, have friends who also distill spirits, and they distilled hard liquor out of beer.

83
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,660
And that stuff is delicious.

84
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,520
I'm afraid I drank it all.

85
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,780
And there isn't any more.

86
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,960
I've been told that you can run Kamchatka vodka through a filter.

87
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
And that's already distilled.

88
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
Yeah, well, it's...

89
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
I mean, have you ever had it?

90
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,680
Wow.

91
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,020
It's horrendous, but it's very affordable, and you can turn it into better alcohol.

92
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,840
One generation away from Pruno.

93
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,180
I just never really drank that much liquor, and only a little bit of beer.

94
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,560
I found myself to really enjoy non-alcoholic drinks.

95
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,960
But Frop is made up.

96
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,040
The other side of that world.

97
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:49,520
So in all of those ideas, you know, I've been able to sample all of these props from around the planet so far, and...

98
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,600
As long as you don't feel you're being shortchanged or short-sheeted at X-Day.

99
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Not at X-Day.

100
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,040
No, no, no, no.

101
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,360
It's been flowing freely.

102
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,900
It's just popping out of the grounds here.

103
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,820
Like black gold.

104
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,000
That a lot of people don't realize that they're dropping so much.

105
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,640
It grows without stems or seeds.

106
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,160
It's a miracle.

107
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
It bursts forth.

108
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,780
It bursts forth.

109
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,300
From the daydoll soil of Wisteria.

110
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,940
Where the froth bushes grow like weeds.

111
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,600
I'm heading away where we fop all day.

112
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
And there's Fairyland also.

113
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,480
Oh, Stang's just getting drunk now.

114
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,900
That's the entire idea.

115
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,260
Kingdom of the Fairies on the other side of the pond.

116
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,680
Oh, I'm not going to do anything.

117
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,700
I'm just going to...

118
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,060
Oh, look at this guy.

119
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,260
He's making a spectacle of himself staggering around.

120
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,240
Oh, isn't that nice?

121
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,980
Somebody should do something.

122
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,280
Look at him.

123
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,820
He just gets to slack off while we sit up here and do this.

124
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,660
Somebody call the authorities.

125
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,060
Oh, work.

126
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,460
Grandpa's sauce again.

127
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,720
Selfish, selfish Stang.

128
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,840
Someone should just tie you to a chair and just leave you there to think about what you've done.

129
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,600
You're setting a terrible example.

130
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Please, not in front of the children.

131
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,640
Really?

132
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,520
I mean, for heaven's sakes.

133
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,560
Live it or live with it.

134
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,400
That's the cousin of Nipplebot there.

135
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,420
It is?

136
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,100
Yeah.

137
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Look, it just doesn't...

138
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,560
It's Nipplebot's nippleless cousin.

139
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,600
Without the turbo nipples.

140
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,340
Is Nipplebot here?

141
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,740
Dr. Cosmack?

142
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,040
I can't hear anything you're saying.

143
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,520
He says yes.

144
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,220
It's here.

145
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
Yes, it's here.

146
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Making an appearance.

147
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,540
Nipplebot is here.

148
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,340
Present.

149
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,400
At the convocation.

150
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,300
And accounted for.

151
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,900
I blame the Nipplebot for last year's failure of the saucers to arrive.

152
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,080
Because I honestly believe that...

153
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,800
Blame some poor old robot.

154
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,980
Yeah, blame the new guy.

155
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,440
Fuck you, new guy.

156
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,540
Hey, we can do this one on the podcast, right?

157
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,580
Perhaps inattention.

158
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,840
Not enough worship was paid.

159
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,620
I forget which words I can and cannot say.

160
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,740
A subgenius zebiba was never developed.

161
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,140
You can't say any of them.

162
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,780
I'm already using words I'm not allowed to say.

163
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,960
Like word.

164
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,820
Well, you're welcome for me giving you something to rebel against.

165
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,320
You're already here.

166
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,680
I think nobody can do anything at this stage.

167
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm not a rebel.

168
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm just an idiot.

169
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,440
Well, there's no point in denigrating yourself.

170
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,000
I think you deserve some credit for making it.

171
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,200
This far.

172
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,760
To the center of the world.

173
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,460
X day.

174
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,340
You can't say the seven deadly words of Christ.

175
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,520
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.

176
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,900
Yeah, you can't say any of those.

177
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,480
Or bears.

178
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,060
You guys, I've...

179
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,000
I've...

180
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,080
You know...

181
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,020
Usually I feel pretty popular when everyone's talking about that.

182
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,540
But, I don't know.

183
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,400
You don't feel popular when...

184
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,560
It feels like everyone's talking about me behind my back.

185
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,240
We've made a spectacle of you.

186
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,520
Please, no.

187
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,780
A tabloid item.

188
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,480
Not at X day.

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:43,820
Dear God, no.

190
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,320
Lagoume told some story and got around.

191
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
Nobody look at me.

192
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,840
On stage.

193
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,120
With a microphone.

194
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,240
Avert your eyes.

195
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,540
They're too entranced by the sounds that they hear.

196
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,680
At night she becomes a small quadruped.

197
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,860
To associate them with any human creature.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,760
Sniffing through the trees for truffles and honey.

199
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,640
But I thought she became a winged avian.

200
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,500
And, uh...

201
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,060
Glided silently above the campground.

202
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,240
Well, uh...

203
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,680
That would explain all the big splotches on the ground, then.

204
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,060
They're not, uh...

205
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,360
What you call...

206
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
House-trained.

207
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,900
They're free spirits.

208
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,780
You lose all sense of house-training after transformation.

209
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,280
That's why werewolves can, you know, leave, uh...

210
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,360
Big piles in the corner when they're done.

211
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,040
Did you hear that?

212
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,400
With all else they do, no one...

213
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,160
There's werewolves around here right now.

214
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,600
There's well...

215
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,480
There's werewolves around here right now.

216
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,900
There's werewolves in these...

217
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,940
In these woods.

218
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,240
I heard them howling.

219
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,740
We've got Mothman.

220
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,520
Mothman is in these woods.

221
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,920
And I've heard rumors of...

222
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,500
Of, uh...

223
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:45,800
Of, uh...

224
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,320
Bipedal wolf creatures.

225
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:52,600
Well, they shouldn't bother us because, according to my notes, uh...

226
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,380
The, uh...

227
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,520
Moon reaches its perigee, uh...

228
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,900
Today.

229
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,120
At, uh...

230
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,640
Already has at 2.40 a.m.

231
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
And so, uh...

232
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,420
That we're the opposite of a wolfy, uh...

233
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,860
Moon.

234
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
You know, as the moon goes...

235
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,320
As the moon grows more and more full, your werewolf gets more and more...

236
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,200
His-stute and ravenous, um...

237
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,640
It gets wolfier by the...

238
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,540
Shifting moon.

239
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,000
Or the reshapen sign.

240
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,240
And, uh...

241
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,420
The full blown werewolf...

242
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,600
They're just real jerks.

243
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,680
Is really hard to stop.

244
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,040
There's not much that can be done about a...

245
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,720
A werewolf at the peak of its fierceness.

246
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,140
I've got silver bullets that, uh...

247
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,460
I've got silver bullets that, uh...

248
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,340
Somebody gave me, but, uh...

249
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,840
Really, they're hardly any good at all.

250
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,560
Uh...

251
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,700
Silver melts as the bullet is fired.

252
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,120
And your silver bullet tumbles in its trajectory.

253
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,080
So your werewolf has to be six feet close to you or...

254
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,480
Thereabout to fire the...

255
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,320
The bullet.

256
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,540
And that's too close.

257
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,160
Because the werewolf can kill you and rip you even as it's dying.

258
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,220
Uh...

259
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,860
If you're lucky enough to hit it in the first place.

260
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,820
And then these damn things are too small caliber.

261
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,780
Why didn't they give me larger silver bullets?

262
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,680
Still, I'm lucky to have the ones that I've got.

263
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,600
We need to give everybody more...

264
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,700
You know, we wouldn't have these problems if more people had silver bullets.

265
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,620
Well, they're good for a lot of things.

266
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:23,980
Larger... Larger...

267
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,220
So, yeah, and not just for werewolves.

268
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,860
Silver kills bad things like vampires and werewolves.

269
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,040
But, uh...

270
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,840
Fairies...

271
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,340
Filling in your teeth.

272
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,540
Hate the touch of iron.

273
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,240
And, uh...

274
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,840
Post-bronze...

275
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,760
Bronze age, uh...

276
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,340
Metals.

277
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,200
You touch them with that and they fade away or flee away.

278
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,180
I would think silver, uh...

279
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,400
How you doing?

280
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,120
Crossbow bolts.

281
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,960
Don't blame me.

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,500
That's good.

283
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:46,900
Yeah.

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,320
Silver crossbow bolts you could drive from a distance.

285
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,560
The whole problem is trying to get mechanized in the 20th century with anti-werewolf technology.

286
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,960
These kids these days...

287
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,480
Yeah, crossbow bolt...

288
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
That would be a good...

289
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,780
If you come across a...

290
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,080
With their new fangled...

291
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,300
A werewolf kill though...

292
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,780
Their rap music...

293
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,140
You can collect that wolfbane.

294
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,840
And their...

295
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
There's usually lots of fresh wolfbane...

296
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:08,820
Their internet...

297
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,940
That you can, uh...

298
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,960
That we'll process into smoothies.

299
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,320
Well, the wolfbane is supposed to keep, uh...

300
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,400
Werewolves...

301
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,120
Away.

302
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,100
As well as, uh...

303
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,140
Other things including the malevolent spirits of the Norse gods.

304
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,600
No.

305
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,220
No, no, no.

306
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,160
Can of beans.

307
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,660
Has beans.

308
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,280
Well, I'm out of stuff to talk about, you guys.

309
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,720
Welcome to Extant.

310
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,560
I'm not firing on all cylinders today.

311
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,900
Oh, I think you've been extraordinarily helpful.

312
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,180
Because I saw the dawn this morning and that makes for a bad brain next day.

313
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
A lot of us were up last night until it was today.

314
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,300
I hope it was a beautiful roseate dawn.

315
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,020
And then most of us have been draggingly, uh...

316
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,500
Uh, pulling ourselves across.

317
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,940
And then we had the, uh, the impromptu noise set.

318
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,720
The impromptu noise set.

319
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,400
The impromptu noise set.

320
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,060
The impromptu noise set.

321
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,940
The impromptu noise set.

322
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,540
The impromptu noise set.

323
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:19,540


324
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:19,560
What?

325
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,840
Uh, the impromptu noise set.

326
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,620
The impromptu noise.

327
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,480
People Reichstatt.

328
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


329
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,380
Ah, yeah.

330
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,980
Their babies are clarify-

331
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,020
S pesos.

332
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,020


333
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,020


334
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,020


335
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,020


336
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,120
S pesos.

337
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,180
S pesos.

338
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,540
��루.

339
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,240
I need a pyroflatulitis. Anybody got a lighter?

340
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,400
I got you a lighter.

341
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:47,860
I got you a lighter.

342
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,440
I actually literally do.

343
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh, it went away. I can't do it now. Everybody's watching. I can't do it in front of everybody.

344
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,940
You won't like it if people are watching.

345
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,820
I can't do it.

346
00:20:50,440 --> 00:21:04,740
I can't do it.

347
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,720
You first.

348
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:23,720
I love watching SwagTube with a big old bucket of scrum.

349
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,080
Deep fried nuggets of joy.

350
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,780
Scrum. Available in three different flavors.

351
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,860
Scrum. Available now through these participating readers.

352
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,140
I'm a big failure.

353
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,780
You ready to rock?

354
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,820
I used to be a house in 10.

355
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,860
Upset with my possibilities and my future and my things.

356
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,300
I used to have a problem with how my life was going.

357
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,040
Now I just give up and have a good old suit full of scrubs.

358
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,580
A big old bucket of scrubs.

359
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,720
A nice, warm tub full of another scrub.

360
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,560
Everything is fine now.

361
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,940
It's a miracle!

362
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,260
I'll be a snow wolf!

363
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,780
We need to... I think if there's anything we need to do right now...

364
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,800
We need to invoke the power of Bob to take away your ability to walk.

365
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,980
I love you Bob.

366
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,420
Conspiracy be gone!

367
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,500
Be gone from this man!

368
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,800
Can I get some leg removal music please? Thank you.

369
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Fox, you need to put your hand on this man's face.

370
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,520
I'd like to! I'd like to know if there's anybody out there in the audience tonight!

371
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,280
You need to put your hand on this man's face!

372
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:13,380
Who really feels the grip of the conspiracy on their ass, on their soul, on their mind, their heart, their dick, their genitals, their secondary sexual characteristics, whatever.

373
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,700
Is there anybody out there who wants to come up here and have the conspiracy cashed out on them?

374
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm ready!

375
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,340
They're already up here!

376
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,840
Nobody?

377
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,460
Really?

378
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,040
Everybody here is just fine?

379
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,480
No conspiracy problems?

380
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,440
Can't see if there are actually any up here if everybody's left.

381
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,040
It's quite dark.

382
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,200
Somebody step forward!

383
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,440
Cast! Cast! Cast!

384
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,560
Cast off your conspiracy shackles!

385
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,280
Was the dawn lovely, or was it...

386
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,860
I don't know.

387
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,320
It was bleary-eyed?

388
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,080
I just saw the fabric of the tent change different hues throughout the morning from...

389
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,020
As it billowed out unspeakably.

390
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,900
From grey to blue to greyish blue to more blue.

391
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,560
And then kind of grey for a little while, but now it looks like, uh...

392
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,280
Old Mr. Sun's peeking out and saying,

393
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,580
Yes.

394
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,360
Hey, you basement-dwelling losers, come on out!

395
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,240
After that last raingasm, it's now clear.

396
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,500
And perhaps will continue fair through the next day.

397
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,040
I didn't mind the rain as long as the sun was not out.

398
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,060
I liked it. I was startled to see it.

399
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,420
But then I realized it had been mentioned in the booklet.

400
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,480
And it was said precisely that it would fall on this day.

401
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,040
Did you get your...

402
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,280
I said it. I warned you.

403
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,460
We looked up the weather on the way in and I warned everyone, but they didn't listen.

404
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,320
Did you get your, um, booklet?

405
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,200
Oh, no, I didn't get a booklet.

406
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,340
I haven't gotten my book yet.

407
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,200
Well, they're right over there.

408
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,740
And not only can you get a booklet which has pieces of art tipped in,

409
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,680
at least the top ones do in the pile,

410
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,240
but there's also a comic paper from Portland, Oregon,

411
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,420
of people who are now drawing comics.

412
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,840
They haven't learned that that's the route to the poorhouse.

413
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,840
So there are new underground cartoons in those free giveaway papers.

414
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,600
Yes, you walk away from X-Day with a lot of stuff besides memories of a beautiful occasion.

415
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,380
Well, you don't walk away from X-Day.

416
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,560
We've walked away from past X-Days.

417
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,960
We're flying out this year.

418
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,480
Oh, perhaps when you land and you walked into the Port Authority building on Planet X.

419
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Intergalactic customs.

420
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,740
You may remember the diagram which I made in Revelation X,

421
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,960
the Bob Apocryphon showing what happens when you land at the other end of X-Day

422
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,600
and ascend through various universes until you reach the punchline.

423
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,660
Speaking of comics, five minutes.

424
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,380
I found a Chick track in the wild.

425
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,500
Which one?

426
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,820
It was in a hospital and they left the hospital one.

427
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,960
The one where the guy goes to the hospital and his friends are all like, you know,

428
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,380
they're all like bad guys.

429
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,860
Like they don't care about.

430
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,940
They're trying to draw him away from godly things.

431
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,360
Is he all burned and everything?

432
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,260
No, I think he's just sick.

433
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,580
And then like his roommate in the hospital is like, you should learn about God.

434
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,780
Hey, wake up and learn about Jesus.

435
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
And his friends come in there like, what's wrong with you?

436
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,080
You're talking like an idiot.

437
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,340
And he's like, but God.

438
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,760
Hey, sicko, what you dying for, idiot?

439
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,140
Learn about this Jesus feller.

440
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,340
He'll help you out.

441
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,720
I thought it was pretty jacked up actually.

442
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,200
So to speak.

443
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,220
I always think it's interesting that churches, especially in Florida,

444
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,260
a lot of our hospitals are run by religious organizations.

445
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,940
Seventh-day Adventists.

446
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,060
Imagine your surprise when you get there.

447
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,740
And you arrive and you just keep wondering, well, you know,

448
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,760
all these Bible verses on the wall kind of make me think,

449
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,880
why'd I have to get sick in the first place?

450
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,320
Sorry, we're Christian Science here.

451
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,400
You'll have to heal yourself after you learn about Jesus.

452
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,940
Lock yourself in this closet and think about what you've done, you cancerous fuck.

453
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,920
Well, they don't put it that way because that lacks the blessed gift of charity.

454
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,460
But they have a lot of good stuff.

455
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,620
They mean it just the same.

456
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,560
Jack Chick, you've got to hand it to the guy.

457
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,840
He is a kind of underground cartoonist, an alternative cartoonist,

458
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,340
whose little comic books go out all over the world

459
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,780
to send his confusing message of hate and fear.

460
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,780
I always enjoyed tiny shoes.

461
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,440
I just hit the microphone.

462
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,960
I don't even know where I am right now.

463
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,960
What's going on?

464
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,480
Well, that made a pleasant bumping sound.

465
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,860
And there you have it.

466
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,540
Thanks, Dr. Howell, Reverend Baby Bear, and Reverend Fox,

467
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,440
live at X Day 19, well, canned, but in front of a live audience.

468
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,680
Before that, we heard some confusing material

469
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,400
from what we might call Thorazine Urine Pod Crust,

470
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,960
a loose, and I use that term loosely, consortium of weirdos

471
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,460
who have a pod crust, Thorazine Urine Pod Crust.

472
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,980
And you should Google that and check it out.

473
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,340
It sounds a little different than the live version at X Day.

474
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,820
And now, before Dave calls in or something,

475
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,040
let's listen to a little bit of Reverend Experimental Please

476
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,120
doing a song called God Bless Hydrogen.

477
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,140
God bless hydrogen.

478
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,060
Time and weight are one.

479
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,140
Not to preserve it, nor to turn it.

480
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,980
From the pain to get it deep by the bone.

481
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:16,260
From the ground to the base, to the oceans,

482
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,780
all out clouds.

483
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,340
Bless hydrogen.

484
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Good.

485
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,260
This is a Derf

486
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,540
which is suitable for you to wear

487
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,540
thread-free

488
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,920
and prevents大哥

489
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,020
yellow to

490
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,900
red.

491
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,560
JEFFREYTER

492
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:58,900
turn to the prairies turn to the oceans

493
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:06,080
fall out clouds of god blessed hydrogen

494
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,760
my dead wish was found

495
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,040
of god blessed hydrogen

496
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,460
that i made out of heaven

497
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,420
now i'm a observer

498
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,640
now a detourer

499
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,100
find the way to get deeper

500
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,640
down to the prairies

501
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,800
turn to the oceans

502
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,020
fall out clouds of god blessed hydrogen

503
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,020


504
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,440
I want to change you

505
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,200
I didn't wish

506
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:04,920
And that was Reverend Experimental, please.

507
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,880
And that really is his name, he says.

508
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,720
That's what he wants us to say.

509
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,320
And we're okay.

510
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,260
Now the big experiment comes.

511
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,320
Calling Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

512
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,600
We'll see how this works.

513
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,860
Oh, it's so exciting.

514
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,380
We've never done this before.

515
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,580
I've never made a phone call.

516
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,600
I've only ever gotten phone calls.

517
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Yeah, I hear it. I hear it.

518
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,740
I can hear the ringing.

519
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,140
Yes?

520
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,020
Dave!

521
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,420
Dr.?

522
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,420
Dave!

523
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,980
I hear Dave!

524
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,420
Dr.?

525
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,320
You don't sound very good, Dave.

526
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,960
I don't sound very good?

527
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,800
Well, you were...

528
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,020
You sound sick.

529
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,040
Sick, Dave.

530
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,820
Well, I am sick.

531
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,100
See, there I hear that Aaron buzzening my...

532
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,760
Buzzening in my head.

533
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,500
There's a buzzling in your head?

534
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,740
Can you hear the buzzing of the phone?

535
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,000
Uh, no.

536
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,280
Good.

537
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,100
Then it's just on this end.

538
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,360
Yeah, I'm not...

539
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm actually not hearing anything too terrible aside from you, Dave.

540
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,260
And then you can actually hear something terrible now.

541
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
That you've had part of your brain...

542
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,420
removed.

543
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,600
Which was the least important part of your body as far as I remember.

544
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,400
Well, it depends on which part of your brain, doesn't it?

545
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,920
Depends on which part of your body.

546
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:28,560
Gee.

548
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:29,940
There...

549
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,400
Well, then...

550
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:31,580
There's your brain.

551
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,120
And there...

552
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,900
Yes, and the...

553
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:43,880
The, uh, human, like the mighty dinosaur, is famous for having a secondary brain lower down in its body to control its massive bulk.

554
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,560
Does that really...

555
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,820
Like the mighty stegosaur.

556
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,000
Is that...

557
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,140
What's the name of the stegosaurus?

558
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,840
The stegosaurus?

559
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,940
Is it two brains?

560
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,980
Is that really true or is that just something I learned in the fifth grade and forgot and wasn't true after all?

561
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,200
You got...

562
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,780
That's correct.

563
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,240
You learned it in fifth grade and it wasn't true.

564
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,980
Yep.

565
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:08,480
You know, I need to mount this Dave mic, also known as an iPhone, on something up high.

566
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,060
Princess, we could...

567
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,140
Oh, oh, there it is.

568
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,640
I mean, the box.

569
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Okay, friends, I'm gonna describe Tarzan's radio station.

570
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay.

571
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,780
And it's current location here.

572
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,800
I keep forgetting which to talk into, the phone or the mic.

573
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,560
Why not both?

574
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,200
Well, it's terrible because you can't mount them.

575
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:27,320
Why not both?

576
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,700
For...

577
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,060
I don't like the idea of staying mounting anything, at least in a public earshot.

578
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,120
There's a bear head not far from my head.

579
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,400
A mounted bear head.

580
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,540
Uh, Pappy...

581
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,880
Well, you could wear one of those like an Indian, like a Native American shaman.

582
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,380
Oh, kind of.

583
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,480
I mean, I've...

584
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,860
Pappy killed him a bar when he was only three.

585
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,760
Oh.

586
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,440
That's...

587
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,000
Pappy, Pappy, Pappy.

588
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,960
There is even a mounted goat head, a really big goat.

589
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,720
Well, that's the ritual.

590
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,220
Reverend Jessica, do you know anything about the, the, uh, that goat, Big Red?

591
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,720
I heard that that goat was a rapist.

592
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
That's what I heard.

593
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Okay, I just, I didn't want to put any, any ideas in your head.

594
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,700
No.

595
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,680
Yeah, that's why he was beheaded, apparently.

596
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,360
Yeah.

597
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,760
Uh, he was a pet.

598
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,360
He was one of the first goats.

599
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,940
Before there was a goat ranch here, there were a couple of goats.

600
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,480
Mammy brought into the house in Richardson, they, where they made quite a mess, and she

601
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,040
would, she would drive them out here every now and then.

602
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:44,560
Apparently, when, when the real goat farm started, the gr, the greatest of all time,

603
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,280
uh, goat ranch.

604
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,780
Goat farm.

605
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,440
Goat ranch.

606
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,960
Greatest of all time spells goat, friends.

607
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,720
G-O-A-T.

608
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,540
Grp, grp.

609
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,520
Uh, but, but somebody already had goat.com, that was the problem.

610
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,480
Uh, anyway, they, a Big Red, who was a, thought he was special, because he was a pet, uh, became

611
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,680
a rapist of other, uh, goats.

612
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,120
He was a bad billy goat.

613
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,960
And I guess he had to be put down like a wild animal.

614
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,000


615
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,540
Uh, my niece Jessica is here in, in the area.

616
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,680
Maybe studio as it were.

617
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,340
But, well...

618
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:22,280
Although, this isn't really a stud, this, this studio used to be my dad's control

619
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,320
module, where he'd sit and watch TV.

620
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,340
And now it's got Tarzan's radio station on it.

621
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,480
Uh-huh.

622
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,780
It's just as cramped as all the other Tarzan's radio stations.

623
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,260
Well, I'm, I'm confused about what Tarzan's radio stations are.

624
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,340
It's my portable, uh, mixing kit.

625
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,380
It's, it's got three mics, a CD, a phone.

626
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:43,780
I thought you were talking about that.

627
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:43,780


628
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,820
And the entire listening audience.

629
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,000
I thought you were still talking about rapist billy goats.

630
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,600
That's part of the station now.

631
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,000
This is a station that has goats.

632
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,620
There's goats at the new station.

633
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,040
Actually, most of them are way down the hill, but I've got a telescope so I can watch them.

634
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,580
But the house goat is overseeing the entire broadcast.

635
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,500
Yeah, the dead, mounted, decapitated house goat.

636
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,960
There's also a jackalope.

637
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,400
An actual mounted jackalope head.

638
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It looks like a jackrabbit head, but he has antlers.

639
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,240
Right, because jackalopes aren't real.

640
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,360
They're a figment of the western imagination.

641
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,620
Oh, really?

642
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:36,060
Well, when you come here and pet this little dead jackalope on the head, you might change your mind about that, Dave.

643
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,540
There are many strange things in this world.

644
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,820
I might even become a Buddhist.

645
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,360
So what are you talking about?

646
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,040
You already did.

647
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
No, I haven't converted yet.

648
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,500
I've been, well, I've been feeling strange.

649
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,300
You were already in the wobbly cult, right?

650
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,960
That's just about like being a Buddhist.

651
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:01,160
Yeah, but you don't have to get a shaved head or any kind of funny beard or anything like that.

652
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,480
Well, you do to join the Church of the Subgenius.

653
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,660
It doesn't matter what funny beard or shaved head you get.

654
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,460
You just got to have something weird.

655
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,120
Yeah.

656
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,580
Or we'll kick you out.

657
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,620
You better be really weird, too, because, you know, we're sticklers for that kind of thing.

658
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,260
We're conformists of nonconformity.

659
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,340
I'm glad, too, because who else is not, or are, is?

660
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,660
There's nobody that we know of that makes nonconformity such a high art.

661
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,760
It's so very, very, very, very, very, very important.

662
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,680
Well, and the strange thing is, there's actually no such thing as normal.

663
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,120
Although it's a good shorthand for something.

664
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,380
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what that is.

665
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,120
Recording, everything, everything's fine.

666
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:56,300
I guess that's why the word was normal to my sister-in-law, because she just could never say normal.

667
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
She said normal.

668
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,500
Her mouth revolted at the word, huh?

669
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:00,980
Exactly.

670
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,940
She's overcame my wishes to true within.

671
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,440
Normal! It doesn't normal!

672
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,220
Right.

673
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,660
Well, Dave, we wish you could be here.

674
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,640
You're here with us, but when we're in Cleveland, we wish that, too.

675
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,940
And Ashtabula, apparently, is just as far from Cleveland as it is from deepest Texas.

676
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,440
Well, not really.

677
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,840
But in many ways, yes, you're right.

678
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:32,500
You told me that the great man, Donald Trump, came to visit you in Ashtabula today.

679
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,060
He came. I wasn't home.

680
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,120
He left a note on the door, hand scribbled.

681
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,180
He said, Donnie, boy.

682
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,660
He said, I'll be around looking for you.

683
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,480
Wow.

684
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,020
And he never came back.

685
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,780
And I guess he went to some famous institution for the megalomaniacs.

686
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:00,720
And there's many, many pictures of him taken by the same morphers I work for, of him standing in front of crowds of people.

687
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:09,440
And I noticed I've actually seen some of these people before in my life that had their mouths open and were screaming and yelling for the great one.

688
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,460
And you've seen him do that in the supermarket?

689
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,000
Markets and convenience stores of Ashtabula and Geneva.

690
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,840
Of course.

691
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:15,960
Right.

692
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,660
With their tails on fire.

693
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,520
But not with, you know, in a regular position.

694
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,040
It's a sick place.

695
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,720
Well, you live, you're, right now, you're hanging out at another sick place.

696
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,940
Oh, we're hanging out at a wonderful, peaceful place.

697
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,520
It's...

698
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,260
I know, but I mean the statehood.

699
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,320
Oh, it's the state of Texas.

700
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,880
Well, yeah.

701
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,940
Texas politics.

702
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:41,800
Good boy.

703
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, if anybody's elected this election, I'm leaving this country.

704
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,140
I'm just leaving the country.

705
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,160
I don't care who it is gets elected.

706
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,160
If anybody at all gets elected, I'm leaving.

707
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,340
I'm out of here.

708
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,380
Got my passport.

709
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,260
I'm going to Portugal.

710
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,700
Portugal?

711
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,580
That's near Antarctica, isn't it?

712
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,460
Somewhere around there.

713
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:11,100
The reason I say Portugal is our friend G. Gordon Gordon and Mrs. Gordon have already...

714
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,120
taken up residence there.

715
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,740
Yes, they've boarded that saucer.

716
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
We might join them someday.

717
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:27,620
Well, yeah, it is quite nice to see most of the Mediterranean and the other areas of the Latin-speaking world are very, very nice.

718
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:34,700
Many say that it's fun to go to Italia because people just sit around and drink wine and talk about politics,

719
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,260
but they don't hurt each other.

720
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,160
They don't, you know, they're not...

721
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,820
Well, I'm not...

722
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,280
afraid to hear.

723
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:50,040
You would think that rural Texas would be Trump country, but actually this is Cruz country, so they don't really like Trump.

724
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,920
We honestly, we haven't seen any Trump signs in the whole town.

725
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,100
No.

726
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
I haven't really driven around looking for them.

727
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,040
Haven't seen any Hillary or Hillary signs neither.

728
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,540
Thank goodness.

729
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,100
Hillary, Hillary.

730
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,900
I love those signs.

731
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,400
Let's see.

732
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,600
Oh.

733
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,900
But we really have changed our residence for the winter,

734
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,380
and I'm going to give the subgenius post office box for the winter months.

735
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,120
Now, this doesn't mean that the Cleveland post office box, the one I've forgotten,

736
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,680
that doesn't mean we've forgotten it or anything.

737
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:40,480
But you can, if somebody wants to order stuff or write to me,

738
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,460
I mean, it's what I mean.

739
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,980
We have to do the ad after the broadcast part for the internet.

740
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,320
Yeah.

741
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,060
If somebody wants to send us their band on a CD or something,

742
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,440
it's, they can send it to stang or subgenius at, got that pencil ready?

743
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,920
P.O. Box 807.

744
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,180
That's right.

745
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,800
It's short.

746
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,940
It's only three numbers.

747
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,460
P.O. Box 807.

748
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,740
That's how big this post office is.

749
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,460
And the town...

750
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,740
The town is, well, we live in Stangsville, but Stangsville doesn't have a post office.

751
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,160
So the town is Glen Rose, Texas.

752
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,400
Two words.

753
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,520
Glen Rose, Texas.

754
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,740
Glen as in Glen and Rose as in Rose.

755
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,680
And the zip...

756
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,620
All one word though, right?

757
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,600
76043.

758
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,500
No, not all one word, Dave.

759
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,140
Two words.

760
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,280
I did the zip the way people do it on my answer machine.

761
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,120
The zip is 76043.

762
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,900
76043.

763
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,800
Uh-huh.

764
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,480
And Glen Rose is one word, correct, Lowe?

765
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,000
No.

766
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,080
Alamondis is one word.

767
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,480
No.

768
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,260
It's two words.

769
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,260
Glen with a capital G, R with a capital Rose.

770
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:55,780
Yeah.

771
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,600
And feed it with an obstructorata.

772
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,480
Right.

773
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:58,820
To follow.

774
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,700
Right.

775
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,860
And when in beautiful Glen Rose, you can also visit the Creation Evidences Museum,

776
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,860
the Dinosaur Valley State Park,

777
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,460
the Destructionist Evidences Museum,

778
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,020
which we'll be opening up ourselves soon,

779
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,100
when we finish the dinosaur tracks.

780
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,500
My niece Jessica wrote an essay about the Creation Evidences Museum

781
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,480
that was very sarcastic.

782
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,460
I did.

783
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,580
I had to see it for myself.

784
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,700
You know, I still haven't seen it.

785
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,260
I have never been in there.

786
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,280
I might be remembering it wrong,

787
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,340
but I think there's a picture of Jesus flanked by velociraptors.

788
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,320
Oh, is that where that's from?

789
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,040
Is Jesus aboard a velociraptor?

790
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,460
Uh-oh.

791
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Picture of Jesus aboard a velociraptor.

792
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,200
That's a great picture.

793
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,020
It's probably done by the great Western artist Bob Summers,

794
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,400
who is our neighbor.

795
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,820
These are like the swiney pig ornaments

796
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,000
we're supposed to wear at all concurrent junctions, you know?

797
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,420
And it's so nice to know that somebody's actually had the mutton chops

798
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,960
to pull off such an orangutan ordeal.

799
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,600
You took the words right out of my mouth, Dave.

800
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,120
And I spat on them.

801
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,420
Now I spat on them.

802
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:09,600
Oh, God.

803
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,340
Oh, gross.

804
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,340
Hey, man.

805
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,260
Say it.

806
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,960
Don't spray it.

807
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,960
You got that right.

808
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,500
I was drooling like a hawk.

809
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,860
Well, when we get...

810
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,120
But listen to these girls.

811
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,920
Isn't the laughter of girls wonderful?

812
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,880
They say that women laugh more than men.

813
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,600
And I envy them that,

814
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,960
but I wouldn't want to have their tubes and their products.

815
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,120
Listen to these...

816
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,160
God, man.

817
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,580
Okay.

818
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,520
Well, I mean, emotionally,

819
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,080
they're having more fun than we are most of the time.

820
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,680
Yeah, well, that's why I'm not having more fun.

821
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,340
I'm jealous.

822
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,020
Irritates me.

823
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,580
They're all giggling and tittering.

824
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,540
Yeah, that...

825
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,200
Strange noise.

826
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:53,880
Oh, that was...

827
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,360
Damn it.

828
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:54,860
We gotta...

829
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,720
That's another thing.

830
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,100
You can...

831
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,140
Dogs are allowed in this radio station.

832
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,700
Yes.

833
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,480
It's dog-friendly.

834
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,060
They make great receptionists, too.

835
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,700
You may hear the rattling of his ears

836
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,500
when he shouts.

837
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:09,980
He shakes them.

838
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,620
Kind of goes...

839
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,220
Yeah.

840
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,200
And his...

841
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,300
His tags are very loud in my hearing aids.

842
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,500
Anyway, yeah,

843
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,440
here in Glen Rose area,

844
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,460
there's a state park devoted to dinosaur tracks,

845
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,440
and there's private lands

846
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,860
and just riverbeds that have dinosaur tracks on them,

847
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,640
and we have such a creek bed.

848
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,700
It's not really a river,

849
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,160
even a named creek.

850
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,480
It's a secret place

851
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,500
that my brother and father used to call Tanglewood Canyon

852
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,120
because it was so rugged.

853
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
And Princess, we and I didn't know that name.

854
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,160
We called the area King Kong's Grotto

855
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,000
because it looked so dangerous.

856
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,660
Parts of it really do.

857
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,900
These huge fissures in the earth

858
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,320
with these giant insects swarming way down at the bottom.

859
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,560
Really gross.

860
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,540
And actual King Kong trees

861
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,940
falling down across the ravine

862
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,880
so that, you know,

863
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,900
you can start walking across on the tree

864
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,260
and then some monster's going to show up on the other side

865
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,060
and shake the tree,

866
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,980
shake you down to be bug-free.

867
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,040
But Princess, we and I spent the last two weeks

868
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,940
frantically driving down to the dinosaur tracks

869
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,200
now that you can drive there,

870
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,540
and casting them in plaster,

871
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,720
which is much, much, much harder than we thought.

872
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,880
And it was so hard that I ended up making

873
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,820
a whole half-hour documentary,

874
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,460
which isn't on YouTube yet,

875
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,680
but it will be by the time anyone hears this.

876
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,700
And it's called

877
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,880
The Subgenius Must Have Track.

878
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,760
I thought about calling it The Hour of Track,

879
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,600
but it's not an hour.

880
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,500
It's half an hour.

881
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,280
Why don't you use both and say, like,

882
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,440
slack track, slack?

883
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,040
Track.

884
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,960
Track, slack.

885
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,180
Well, when we do our ad for the Destructionist Museum,

886
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,620
of some wag, Reverend Apostate cracked

887
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,160
that heroin use was what killed the dinosaurs

888
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,420
because there's so many track marks.

889
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,180
You can only hope.

890
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,660
No, I thought it was pretty funny.

891
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm sorry.

892
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,040
I wrecked it.

893
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,900
I wrecked it.

894
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,320
I'm sorry, Reverend Apostate.

895
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,240
And, Princess,

896
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,380
Reverend 80 says that we're a track team.

897
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,560
Aw.

898
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,060
Because we go down there and...

899
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,560
I like that.

900
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,680
And cast tracks and pearls.

901
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,880
That's a good one.

902
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,880
We are a track team.

903
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,920
And swines.

904
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,740
We just cast them.

905
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,820
Now, if you're a track team,

906
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,160
who's pulling up the rears?

907
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,720
And who's the agent for the entire augmentation?

908
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,640
I was going to sell the show, so to speak,

909
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,480
and bring it on Broadway

910
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,600
where you can pick your heels up and make noises

911
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,180
and any noise you feel like it.

912
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:08,760
Yeah.

913
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,980
Whatever you said.

914
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,860
I don't know who was saying that,

915
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,840
but that just got challenged with my body.

916
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,920
But this music in the background kind of goes with it.

917
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,260
It's very relaxing.

918
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,820
This is Cyber Chump.

919
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,580
Cyber Chump?

920
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,440
Yeah, Cyber Chump.

921
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,080
Now, that's the only thing that I'm missing

922
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,680
is I can't hear Cyber Chump.

923
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,320
Right.

924
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,260
Or any other chump.

925
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,020
Right.

926
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,060
And I was hoping that I could get,

927
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:38,920
like, huge, like,

928
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
it is exciting watermelon music.

929
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,060
Or it is the music from

930
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,580
Flash and Andy Burr

931
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,720
and Sinbad and the Seven Sailors

932
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,580
and stuff like that.

933
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,000
Well, you know,

934
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,500
this hasn't been the kind of dramatic music

935
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,980
that makes you suddenly launch into a rant.

936
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,160
Like Herman.

937
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,220
Like Bernard Herman.

938
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,640
Right.

939
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,380
You'd know if it was.

940
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,480
Oh, no.

941
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,320
This is very serene,

942
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,660
misty, wonderful.

943
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,940
I'm sorry, listeners.

944
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,800
We'll get something worse.

945
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,300
Meditative, kind of almost new-agey music.

946
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,580
We'll get something worse next time.

947
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,260
Or as Reverend Stang would say,

948
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,040
new-age music.

949
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,300
Well, we played a bunch of Thorazine Urine Pod Crust music

950
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,560
earlier in the show

951
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,780
to satisfy the subgenius listeners.

952
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,520
And now this will balance it out.

953
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,240
My mom took Thorazine before I was born.

954
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,500
And that's one of the reasons I have.

955
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,400
I think we're at...

956
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:39,960
What?

957
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,500
They give your mom Thorazine?

958
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,840
Well, to calm her down

959
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,040
because she smacked the other individuals in the club.

960
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,740
Actually, it was not a club.

961
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,680
It was kind of a self-enjoyed intercalation party.

962
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,140
And everybody had to show up, you know,

963
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,080
and most of them were bare naked.

964
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,480
Which you can imagine for people in their 70s

965
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
walking around bare naked.

966
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,780
It was not fun for anything.

967
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,140
Well, maybe it was.

968
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,780
I don't know.

969
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,980
We're about to find out pretty soon, aren't we, Dave?

970
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,060
Yep.

971
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,760
Next week should be sometime.

972
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,980
Well, not the actual time,

973
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,400
but something should happen.

974
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,500
Oh, speaking of sad and death and stuff,

975
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,020
earlier in the show,

976
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,680
they were talking about the Jack Chick comics.

977
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,420
You know, those little Christian comics

978
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,560
you find in laundromats.

979
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,160
Yeah, Blatty died.

980
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,140
Yeah, Jack Chick up and died.

981
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,200
And...

982
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,180
That's a good thing, too.

983
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,760
And now we can make a funny biblical comic book about it.

984
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,360
Daniel said to his children,

985
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,040
children,

986
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,440
and his wife, Lorthal,

987
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,860
that if the Lord would come down from the hill

988
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,820
and give him a smiling handshake,

989
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,900
he would certainly do his bidding.

990
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,840
Well, Jack Chick comics are much more exciting than that.

991
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,440
They've got the Catholics cast as demons

992
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,200
and the Pope as Satan himself, practically.

993
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,920
There were wonderful hate pamphlets.

994
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,400
Funny thing, there was mostly hate in other Christians

995
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,140
more than anything else.

996
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,800
Yep.

997
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,760
Well, it's the same with any religion.

998
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,300
There's a lot of subgeniuses the same way.

999
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,240
Are they really spending their time

1000
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,360
hating Muslims or Christians?

1001
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,500
No, they're hating other subgeniuses.

1002
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,140
The Palmerian headlaunchers hate the Trevino's,

1003
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,260
especially now, because Arnold Palmer died

1004
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,100
and Trevino's still alive.

1005
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,360
The Jack Chick subgeniuses, you know,

1006
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,800
hate the anti-Jack Chick subgeniuses.

1007
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,880
Now, there's some of us...

1008
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:35,880


1009
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,840
Yeah, Jack Chick...

1010
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,760
As Dr. Howell pointed out,

1011
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,680
was an underground cartoonist

1012
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,640
and the most successful of all of them.

1013
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,380
And we do owe him a lot.

1014
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,000
We've gotten a lot of mileage off of Chick publications

1015
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,060
over the years.

1016
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,000
But most of them were self-produced, weren't they?

1017
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,040
Didn't he have them?

1018
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,540
Exactly.

1019
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,200
That's what I mean.

1020
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,320
He was self-publishing.

1021
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,200
He was a real underground publisher

1022
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,360
and he gave them away practically for free.

1023
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,800
You know, you could buy...

1024
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,100
He would buy sacks of them for 20 bucks or something.

1025
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,940
He was interested in bringing the word of the Lord

1026
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,760
to the people around him.

1027
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,240
Well, and he put Bob in quite a few of them.

1028
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,520
He did?

1029
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,520
Yeah, yeah, he did.

1030
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,660
He didn't mean to, but you know how Bob is.

1031
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,480
He gets into everything.

1032
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,480
In fact, it's a shame.

1033
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,580
I'm pretty sure that Chick never got around

1034
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,420
to doing the anti-subgenius comic book,

1035
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:36,260
which he was sincerely and truly planning to do.

1036
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,120
If he had time after he finished his life work,

1037
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,680
which was oil paintings of everything in the Bible.

1038
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,440
And I think he may have finished.

1039
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,580
But the reason I know this is because

1040
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,400
my good buddy, Father Joe Mama,

1041
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,800
the subgenius preacher,

1042
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,720
in disguise as a human,

1043
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,120
befriended Jack Chick himself,

1044
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,620
the elusive, reclusive Jack Chick,

1045
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,420
and made a documentary about his life.

1046
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,120
And told Chick about the evil subgenius cult,

1047
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,720
which had not been on his radar.

1048
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,120
And he promised to do something about it

1049
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,480
when he finished his project.

1050
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,720
Yeah, just as he does with other social phenomena

1051
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,860
that aren't right-wing, extremely evangelical,

1052
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,020
bizarro Christians.

1053
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,460
So bizarre when you call.

1054
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,460
Some other cultists are so weird.

1055
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,200
He takes a pen to that he disliked in his day.

1056
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,140
That's why I'm saying,

1057
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:37,300
we anti-Christians do not hate Jack Stinks.

1058
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,020
The only disargument with him is for his belief system,

1059
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,900
which is not, and not nice.

1060
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,080
If you can stand for it.

1061
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,260
Well, Jack Chick was God's cartoonist.

1062
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,540
And that's the title of the wonderful documentary.

1063
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,320
Directed by, quote, Kurt Kursteiner, unquote.

1064
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,140
Who is really Papa Joe Mama, not Father Joe Mama.

1065
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,520
You always call him Father Joe Mama,

1066
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,180
but it's really Papa Joe Mama.

1067
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,700
No, it's really Father Joe Mama,

1068
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,620
but everyone just said Papa Joe Mama,

1069
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,840
and he got used to it.

1070
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

1071
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,600
I apologize.

1072
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,840
I didn't know.

1073
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,240
Okay, Mr. Genius History Expert.

1074
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,360
Yeah.

1075
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,380
Wasn't he at one time king of all the Susquehanna monkey

1076
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,740
or some sort of great bishop or something like that?

1077
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,300
No, you're thinking of Mama Joe Mama.

1078
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,780
She was quite...

1079
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,620
Queen of the apes.

1080
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,700
Madres.

1081
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,260
Yeah.

1082
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,280
The old apos.

1083
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,280
Yeah.

1084
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,920
Those were the days.

1085
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,100
Days.

1086
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,020
Days and days and days.

1087
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,240
I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know.

1088
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:56,960
I don't know.

1089
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,060
Dave, is your on-air sign lit?

1090
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:00,860
Ours is.

1091
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,040
Is it my air sign lit?

1092
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,200
Of course it's an air sign.

1093
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,600
I'm a Librazerian, buddy.

1094
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:07,700
Yeah.

1095
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,900
He didn't see the red light because he doesn't have a studio.

1096
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,380
He has only the phone.

1097
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,860
I have an internal red light studio of my own.

1098
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,760
He has such an imagination.

1099
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,580
I would imagine his on-air light is really brightly glowing right now.

1100
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,640
Oh, it is.

1101
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,260
It flickers, actually.

1102
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,620
It's very intermittent.

1103
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:33,620
And sometimes it just shorts out and goes real, real bright and breaks.

1104
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,480
You have to replace the bulb.

1105
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,160
The Dave bulb.

1106
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,060
There's a World War II submarine ooga-ooga sound that goes along with it, usually.

1107
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,100
Which I think is much more inventive and creative than just having what you describe,

1108
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,520
which is only part of it.

1109
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,460
It's a micro-skew portion of the entire thing,

1110
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,060
which induces real alarm in the Soviet Republic.

1111
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,680
I mean, in everybody.

1112
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:07,140
Well, any pictures of the inside of you are going to be scary, Dave.

1113
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,640
Well, at least there's not a fried egg in my brain.

1114
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,180
The doctors have a lot of pictures of us now, don't they?

1115
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,500
Yeah, they do.

1116
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,580
And that means the NSA has the same gross, disgusting proctology pictures.

1117
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,700
They can see the fried egg in your midbrain.

1118
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,120
Right.

1119
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,620
They can see the polyps in your midbrain.

1120
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,820
The polyvinyl clorox.

1121
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,240
You know, one of those baggies.

1122
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,640
Yeah, it's true.

1123
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,640
Dave and I both...

1124
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,960
We both have been in and out of doctor's offices.

1125
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,180
So has Princess Wee.

1126
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,000
Yes.

1127
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,380
It's age, you know.

1128
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,680
Yeah, they constantly have to check us and recheck us and replace stuff.

1129
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,740
You know, change the filters.

1130
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,160
You need a colonoscopy every week.

1131
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,920
Every week.

1132
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,180
Right, every week.

1133
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,820
Once a week, you need a colonoscopy.

1134
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,340
God.

1135
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,660
Well, I like the pills they give you with that.

1136
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,860
The pills are great, but the colonoscopy part, I don't know.

1137
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,760
Well, I get to where I kind of like it, you know.

1138
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,720
Yeah, I can understand that.

1139
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,320
I can see why some people are into that.

1140
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,740
Reagan was really into it.

1141
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,640
In fact, he was the only president who always insisted, I don't know if everyone knew this,

1142
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,540
but he insisted on a coldest speculum the doctors could provide.

1143
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,400
He wanted it cold.

1144
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,680
He liked it that way.

1145
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:33,640
He was a great president relative to some things that might be precedents.

1146
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,720
Well, I wonder what kind of spatula Mr. Temple...

1147
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,800
Oh, that's right, because we don't know who the president is right now.

1148
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,300
Everybody listening to this show does.

1149
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,380
Yes.

1150
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,200
Soviet tanks in the streets of Washington, D.C.

1151
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,700
Soviet tanks in the streets of Ashtabula.

1152
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,220
Yep.

1153
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,500
And Glen Rose.

1154
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,680
I look out my window at which...

1155
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,720
Great fear and trepanation every morning.

1156
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,180
Not trepanation, trepanation.

1157
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,000
Trepanate, fear and trepanation.

1158
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,820
Hey, there's a good novel title for you.

1159
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,640
Fear and trepanation in Ashtabula.

1160
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,300
By the great Gozo, a form of Japanese ravioli.

1161
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,400
Gozo.

1162
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,460
Gozo.

1163
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,720
Well, Dave...

1164
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,840
Believe it or not, the show is over.

1165
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,280
We have to end the show.

1166
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,360
Oh, well, then I'll go take some pills now.

1167
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,340
We're going to...

1168
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:56,140
We'll play one last piece of music by the Psychoskeletons to take us out.

1169
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:05,740
But don't hang up, Dave, because as soon as I cut, we're going to then be free to talk to the Internet.

1170
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,180
Okay?

1171
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,080
Okay, bye.

1172
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,000
Say bye, but don't hang up.

1173
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,940
Say bye, but don't hang up, and I'll go get my pills, all right?

1174
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,220
Bye.

1175
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,260
Praise Dave.

1176
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:15,960
Okay.

1177
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,400
Bye.

1178
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:17,960
Bye.

1179
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,640
Bye.

1180
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:21,960
Bye.

Bye.

1184
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,340
Bye.

1185
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:25,940
Bye.

1186
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,180
Bye.

1187
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:26,760
Bye.

1188
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:26,760

00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:26,760
