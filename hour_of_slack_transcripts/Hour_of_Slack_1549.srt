00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,400


13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,300
Genuinely beautiful.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,000
Giant.

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,640
Perfect.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,400
Cool.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,900
Special.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,460
Cheered.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,140
Elaborate.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,420
Easy.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,900
Ultimate.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,340
Best.

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,820
Natural.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Growing.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,740
Special.

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,400
Nice.

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,340
Quicker.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And much more.

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,500
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,220
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,880
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
that actually it's not.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,360
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,720
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,100
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Selling.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,380
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

43
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
It's cool, man.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Cool.

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,840
And praise Bob and the whole world.

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,480
Oh.

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:57,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,200
Christmas tree.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,200


51
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,540
Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,220
Right here.

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,540
Khai.

54
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,480
Look that gene!

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,780
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

56
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

57
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,240
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop

64
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,140
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,920
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Too tight, too tight

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,900
Too tight, too tight

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,600
And I'm gonna say to you

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,460
And in the right

76
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

77
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,300
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

79
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
Till I get to bed

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

81
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Apple mango pie

83
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
You ain't no good of a child

84
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells

85
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you do something about that, boy?

86
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

87
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
No!

89
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,220


90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
No!

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,560


92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
No!

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


94
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


95
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


96
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


97
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


99
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


102
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


103
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


104
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,600
No!

105
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,600


106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,940
No!

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,340
No!

108
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,500
No!

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,700
No!

110
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,680
What Winger's manufacturer is selling is fun

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,860
The faith of a child

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,660
The faith of a child

113
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got

114
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,940
Spend all the money you've got

115
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,420
The Christmas고요

116
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,540
Oh, I'm lost!

117
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,040
Oh, look!

118
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

119
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,840
He's like a cowboy Santa.

120
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,440
How jolly.

121
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,640
Oh, Jazz is giving,

122
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,420
gives Dave the show pills.

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,580
Boy, I really need one of those.

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about Laundromat and his suit, though?

125
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

126
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

127
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,860
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,940
That's enough of that.

129
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

130
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,980
I also have the part of my pancreas

131
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,360
that I'd like to show you now.

132
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

133
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

134
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

135
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
I actually have the capability of a man

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,560
with 190 IQ's brain.

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

138
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

139
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

140
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,760
And my brain feel like it's a puddle

141
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,360
of liquefied crap.

142
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm shocked by the...

143
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

144
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,840
I like to take the red one and the blue one

145
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,560
at the same time.

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

147
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
The warp mix is easy.

148
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Angels we have heard on high

150
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,460
Singing about mountains

151
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,580
And those mountains in reply

152
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,720
Sing about mountains in reply

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


155
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


156
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,460
Sing we wish we had some too

157
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,020
Oh, warrior

158
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,920
In excelsis Deo

159
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,980
Oh, warrior

160
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,320
In excelsis Deo

161
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,660
Barbie Dolls

162
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

163
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,540
Barbie Dolls

164
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:53,120
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

165
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
It will empower this resistance.

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,640
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

167
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,260
It will be a baller for kids.

168
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:22,760
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

169
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,240
Good has lots of muscles.

170
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,500
Good.

171
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,380
Good!

172
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,380
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

173
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,140
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.

174
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,020
Sexual.

175
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,620
Sexual desires.

176
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,600
Latent in children.

177
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,760
Brought out.

178
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,720
Through the vehicle of this so-called.

179
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,680
So far, we're told these boys have church.

180
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,040
Batteries not included.

181
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,380
She's new.

182
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,460
From Kenner.

183
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

184
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,660
We must buy our toys.

185
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

186
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,060
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

187
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,720
Recorded there at Doc Stock 1984.

188
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,880
And me and Palmer Freedies.

189
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,500
Angels We Have Heard on High.

190
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,720
It was by The Philistines.

191
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,960
The collage called All the Money You've Got.

Excuse me.

The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

204
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,280
Once upon a time.

205
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
There was the baby Jesus.

206
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,900
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

207
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,120
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

208
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,240
And he wanted his two fingers.

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,800
And he had two front teeth.

210
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,840
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,300
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

212
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,820
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

213
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,640
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,340
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

215
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,520
But he couldn't.

216
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,340
He wanted tens and twenties.

217
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,860
Tens and twenties.

218
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Tens and twenties.

219
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,000
And.

220
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,520
He got McDonald's gift certificates.

221
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,280
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,860
And that's the Real Story of Christmas.

Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, oligarchatism, fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

303
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,140
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

304
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,300
This toy falls apart in three days.

305

He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe.

306
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,340
Too much is always better than not enough.

307
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,180
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe will be back after this message.

308
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,000
Santa Claus.

309
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

310
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,160
He wanted an electric train.

311
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,300
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.

312
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,740
But he never got lucky.

313
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:47,740


314
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,580
He could picture the whole thing and he would dream so far that the whole thing would come to life way before his eyes.

315
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,460
For ainflux, the

316
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,460


317
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,460


318
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,520
was a pretty strong wisher.

319
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,740
And what he started wishing for

320
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,660
was a pretty fancy-looking train set

321
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,320
with locomotives and freight cars,

322
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,420
and a station and a gateman,

323
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,960
the mortar tower,

324
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,320
and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

325
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,080
So grand that you might think

326
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,260
Tommy was wishing for something that just didn't exist.

327
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

328
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,680
It is turnover.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell,

330
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,820
the end of the year sale.

331
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,620
Oh, yeah.

332
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,460
So come and get it, everyone,

333
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,380
and just buy our products.

334
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,320
Now, are we...

335
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,880
I'm a little confused about

336
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,220
what Christmas is all about.

337
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus

338
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
or his death when they nailed him?

339
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

340
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,160
But the present subgenie

341
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
tried to make sure that

342
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,700
we have our inventories cleared by now

343
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,560
and sell everything to the pigs.

344
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh, yes.

345
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,200
Once a pagan holiday,

346
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,580
and now a shopping season.

347
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

348
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,740
Before it was...

349
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,500
After it was a pagan holiday

350
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,380
and before it was a...

351
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,860
a shopping...

352
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,120
a shopping season.

353
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,680
It was something else,

354
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,440
but I think they started a war over it.

355
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,780
Yeah.

356
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

357
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,520
Yeah.

358
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:39,860
I'm trying to get a read 4 Kerala book page!

359
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:39,860


360
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:39,860


361
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:39,860


362
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,660
Thank you.

363
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,860
Thank you.

364
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,760
At your house, my friend, if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius,

365
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,540
or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows and having strange microphones.

366
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,220
How did that paternity suit ever turn out between Dobbs and Santa?

367
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,340
And who?

368
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,460
His dad.

369
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,540
Santa dog.

370
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know.

371
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,080
I don't think it was.

372
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,140
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,

373
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,720
St. Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose.

374
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,240
And bloodied his nose.

375
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,940
And sucked it.

376
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,340
Really?

377
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,660
The historical St. Nicholas?

378
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,580
Over the trinity of God.

379
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,900
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

380
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,720
I swear upon Bob.

381
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,740
Who the hell is God?

382
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,780
The heart.

383
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,840
I could tell you said God.

384
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,440
Who the hell is God?

385
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,140
Who the hell is God?

386
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,140
Ask Dobbs one day.

387
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,880
That's the question we should be asking.

388
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,520
Suddenly, a lightning.

389
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,700
Lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day.

390
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,480
Bob did a backflip and from that day on, he too was a believer.

391
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,600
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged.

392
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,920
Chip, Chip, what else is on the TV show with St. Nicholas?

393
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,360
Sip, sicken.

394
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:39,120
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in, was it Constantinople?

395
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,100
I, yeah, like one of those.

396
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,500
Or it was an ancient Byzantium.

397
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,040
Asia Minor.

398
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,920
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.

399
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:54,760
Yes, he was, and he was, uh, he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women

400
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,660
and leaving gifts.

401
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,980
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

402
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,240
A saint he was, the girl said.

403
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,120
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

404
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,300
That's good.

405
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,940
That's good.

406
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,280
You gotta.

407
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,720
You got it, brother.

408
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,700
Snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

409
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
You got it, brother.

410
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,320
They knew when they were sleeping.

411
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,300
They knew when, he knew when they were awake.

412
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,020
That, you got it, brother.

413
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,740
But like the CIA, he was.

414
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,240
That's Foucault, baby.

415
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,200
He was protecting them.

416
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,680
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.

417
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,180
What?

418
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,740
He knows when you've been sleeping.

419
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
He knows what you've been eating.

420
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,180
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

421
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,180
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?

422
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,440
In Madison Avenue, of course.

423
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,280
No, the surveillance community.

424
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,860
And Disney.

425
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,980
Under your direction.

426
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,880
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

427
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
Miller Bear.

428
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,960
He's a very powerful being.

429
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,580
If you're bad, he punishes you.

430
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,340
If you're good, he rewards you.

431
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,880
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.

432
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,800
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

433
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,480
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

434
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,240
I think, I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know.

435
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:08,080
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior,

436
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,020
JVR, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

437
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,400
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.

438
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,180
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

439
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,000
You better watch out.

440
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,420
You better not.

441
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,280
You better not.

442
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm telling you why.

443
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,160
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

444
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,940
St. Nicholas.

445
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,800
St. Nicholas.

446
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,180
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

447
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,040
He knows when you awake.

448
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,000
He knows when you're in bad or good.

449
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,780
So be goodness, goodness sake.

450
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,600
Oh, you better watch out.

451
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,100
You better not.

452
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,140
You better not.

453
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,220
I'm telling you why.

454
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,600
St. Nicholas.

455
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,900
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

456
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,620
St. Nicholas.

457
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,620


458
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:39,620


459
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,920
Do you think I'm psycho, mama?

460
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,580
I've seen my ex last night.

461
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

462
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,500
We all saw Xmas last night.

463
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,840
At a Dancer Miller store.

464
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,000
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in Stank's head.

465
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,900
It would not lay for the little shig or plums and berries dropping toxic tears.

466
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,160
Shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck.

467
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,520
Shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck.

468
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:00,780
Shuck, shuck, shuck.

469
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,080
The poison in the plums.

470
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,100
Material plums.

471
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,520
Biological agents who only take 15%?

472
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,000
It's time for the Facts.

473
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,440
The Facts are back.

474
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,960
And now...

475
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Oh, it's a great day, all right.

476
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,880
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. Iron Man.

477
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,780
Shop as usual.

478
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,060
Shop as usual.

479
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,400
Shop as usual.

480
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:58,600


481
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,680
And avoid panic buying.

482
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,740
Shop as usual.

483
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:43,720
mão na Pennsylvania

484
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,140
A Scottie

485
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,700
Professional

486
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:55,720
Backstage

487
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,520
Sometimes I think,

488
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
all that Santa crap's just bull.

489
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,000
Santa Claus is real.

490
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
Santa Claus is real.

491
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,120
Who's the head man?

492
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,520
Santa Claus.

493
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,460
Santa Claus.

494
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,320
He was a huge, beastly,

495
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,040
bulging man.

496
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,060
He was so real,

497
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,020
how come we didn't get squat last year?

498
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,920
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan

499
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,840
on July 4th.

500
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,160
And now you can have it all,

501
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,700
all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

502
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,700
The birth of our baby Satan

503
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,740
as told by various authors

504
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,960
and eclectic scholars

505
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,780
from around the globular unit.

506
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,420
Including that announcer.

507
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,940
This announcement has not been

508
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,960
a perfunctory announcement,

509
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,740
but an announcement of the blessed

510
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,220
anointment and birthday of our Lord

511
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,300
Jesus Christ.

512
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,940
For one bright Christmas morning

513
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,480
was born in a cradle

514
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,580
to a rich man's family.

515
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,020
The Rave Jesus.

516
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,780
Oh, I know the Rave Jesus.

517
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm partying with the Rave Jesus.

518
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,860
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

519
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:15,380
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

520
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,240
Let your sight be light.

521
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,360
From the water

522
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,180
troubles will be out of sight.

523
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,100
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

524
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:50,080
From the water troubles will be out of sight.

525
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,200
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

526
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,200


527
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Once again,

528
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,720
as in olden days,

529
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,520
happy go.

530
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,680
Golden be miles of earth.

531
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,820
Let your heart

532
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,800
will be out of sight.

533
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,020
Our sight.

534
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,820
The Jackson's five.

535
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,940
We'll wish everybody

536
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,560
a crystal merry Christmas.

537
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,420
And it will be to you.

538
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,600
We'll be...

539
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,760
From a mutated Christmas, friends,

540
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,180
uh,

541
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,560
the, uh,

542
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:29,820
the, uh,

543
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,080
have yourself a merry little Christmas by

544
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
No-L.

545
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,900
No-L.

546
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,140


547
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,400
Uh,

548
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,660
before that,

549
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,520
some year old ESO

550
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,340
and Michael Shelley

551
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,320
did that real story of Christmas

552
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,820
from the Tarkin Records

553
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,060
All Star Holiday Extravaganza.

554
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm playing a lot from that.

555
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,640
So check out www.triage.com

556
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,140
for that one also.

557
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,660
The Tarkin Records is also on

558
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,500
www.triage.com

559
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


560
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


561
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


562
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


563
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


564
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


565
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


566
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


567
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


568
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


569
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,500


570
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,760
and now,

571
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,980
the Jethro's.

572
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,700
Happy go.

573
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:35,680
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

574
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,960
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

575
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,820
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

576
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,120
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

577
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,520
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

578
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,740
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

579
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,240
Oh, friends, it's tough.

580
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,140
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

581
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,580
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

582
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:21,720
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

583
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,680
Can you believe that?

584
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,520
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

585
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,220
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

586
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,260
We can't afford that.

587
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,160
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

588
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,980
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

589
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,540
Let's be friends.

590
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,420
Let's be friends.

591
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,220
Let's be friends.

592
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,640
Let's be friends.

593
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,700
Let's be friends.

594
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,660
Let's be friends.

595
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,760
Let's be friends.

596
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,920
Let's be friends.

597
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:45,740
Let's be friends.

598
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,700
Let's be friends.

599
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,220
Let's be friends.

600
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,500
Let's be friends.

601
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,740
Let's be friends.

602
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,420
Let's be friends.

603
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:45,520
Let's be friends.

604
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,040
Let's be friends.

605
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,920
Let's be friends.

606
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:58,400
You're gonna have the chance to get home, sir.

607
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,780
I don't wanna go to hell, sir!

608
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,960
I don't wanna go to hell!

609
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,140
No!!!

610
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,140


611
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,700
The tale-bearer will be at the judgment.

612
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,260
The tale-bearer will be at the judgment.

613
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,360
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

614
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,480
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

615
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,240
Dare I ask it? Yes.

616
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,980
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

617
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,560
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

618
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,540
The answer? Yes, definitely.

619
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,100
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,

620
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,260
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

621
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,740
Merry Christmas!

622
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,780
Merry Christmas to all!

623
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,580
Now you're all gonna die!

624
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,980
The night Santa went crazy,

625
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,540
the night Saint Nick went insane.

626
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,100
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal,

627
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,480
something finally must have snapped in his brain.

628
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,600
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it.

629
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,520
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet,

630
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,660
and he tied up his helpers.

631
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,460
And he held the elves hostage,

632
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,260
and he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.

633
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,500
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger,

634
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,560
and he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

635
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,180
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer,

636
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,200
and he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.

637
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,560
The night Santa went crazy,

638
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,760
the night Kris Kringle went nuts.

639
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,740
Now you're all gonna die,

640
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,480
you can't hardly walk around the North Pole

641
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,900
without stepping in reindeer guts.

642
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,400
There's the National Guard and the FBI.

643
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,540
There's a van from the eye witness news,

644
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,540
and helicopters circling round in the sky.

645
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,540
And the bullets are flying,

646
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,560
the body counts rising,

647
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,140
and everyone's dying to know,

648
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,460
who sent them why.

649
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,200
My, my, my, my, my, my,

650
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,140
you used to be such a jolly guy.

651
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,660
But now you're gonna be good,

652
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,880
for goodness sake.

653
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out.

654
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,040
You better not cry.

655
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,520
You better not pout.

656
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm telling you why.

657
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,040
Santa Claus is coming to town.

658
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,540
Santa Claus is coming to town.

659
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,860
Have yourself an Advance Dogmatic Christmas,

660
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:22,380
a song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coote.

661
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,900
ElectricElf at Loop.com can tell you more about that.

662
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,540
But now...

663
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,180
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?

664
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,660
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

665
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,600
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

666
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,420
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

667
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,700
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...

668
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limit?

669
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,640
How many do you get?

670
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,640
Jesuses?

671
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, how many can you bag?

672
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,860
How many messiahs can you bag?

673
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,020
Hail Jesuses.

674
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,680
If you're doing it in season...

675
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,700
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

676
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,300
Oh, you never do...

677
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,280
And you can only take one.

678
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,820
You never bag the Lord in C.

679
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,600
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

680
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,100
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

681
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,280
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

682
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,400
Obviously.

683
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,100
We are between Iraq.

684
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,280
And a hard place.

685
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,400
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age

686
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,180
and he got a very, very hard foot?

687
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,460
And he got elephantages of the rectum.

688
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,740
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.

689
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,600
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

690
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,000
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies

691
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,920
and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.

692
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,780
I like when he moves into a trailer park and...

693
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,520
I like the cowboy's problem.

694
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,320
He's a dog.

695
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,600
He's a dog.

696
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,500
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

697
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,040
The ranger.

698
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,620
I like the Texas ranger.

699
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,160
Jesus, Texas ranger.

700
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,320
Johnny Ripple was a Jesus.

701
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,600
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.

702
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,980
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

703
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,540
He was the white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

704
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,960
Well, what about old peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois,

705
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,940
who was actually Huron, a Huron.

706
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,380
You didn't know that, did you?

707
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,980
I got you.

708
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,680
I got you.

709
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:12,800
I got you.

710
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:12,800


711
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:12,800


712
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,080
Elrond.

713
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,120
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

714
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,140
Oh, it tastes like butter.

715
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,860
A new Jesus.

716
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,040
A different Jesus.

717
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,340
It tastes like clapping pie, children.

718
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:23,680
A future Jesus.

719
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:23,680


720
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,260
A pipe-smoking Jesus.

721
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,740
Dave, you know where it is.

722
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,420
Go kick that window open.

723
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,380
I already kicked it.

724
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,480
I'll kick it again, though.

725
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,940
Kick it good this time.

726
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,200
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

727
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,000
We hope that...

728
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

729
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,420
Clapping.

730
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,020
We appreciate all that.

731
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,920
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

732
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,500
That's all.

733
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,600
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff.

734
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,640
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

735
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,120
Right.

736
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,380
I could hear him say that.

737
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,020
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

738
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,960
Next topic.

739
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,100
Next topic.

740
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,080
Terrorist insurance.

741
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,360
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

742
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
And science.

743
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:10,700
Science.

744
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,060
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

745
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,480
That was...

746
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,520
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

747
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of hell.

748
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,500
Jingle, jangle, jingle.

749
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,100
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

750
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,240
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

751
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,700
Wrapped in wrapping paper.

752
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,160
We're gonna break our necks.

753
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,720
Gotta rock it in.

754
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,380
My podcast.

755
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,820
Rock it on a sleigh ride to heck.

756
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,520
Sleigh ride to heck.

757
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,100
Sleigh ride to heck.

758
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,840
Sleigh ride to heck.

759
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,160
The elves are full of cheer.

760
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,660
The kids are tucked in bed.

761
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,220
Santa ain't coming.

762
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,000
We're on a sleigh.

763
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,620
Sleigh ride to heck.

764
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,120
Their dreams are filled with toys.

765
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,700
But they're out of luck.

766
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,240
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to...

767
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,020
Sleigh ride to heck.

768
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,620
Sleigh ride to heck.

769
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,560
Sleigh ride to heck.

770
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,520
The greatest, scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album,

771
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,740
Don't Trust aspiration.

772
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,340
The credibility of his album, don't trust огром不是在你, James Kochalka Superstar.

773
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,560
A subgenius has so much faith,

774
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,820
that he not only can accept someone making fun of Bob on a picture,

775
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,240
he'll do it himself.

776
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,380
He has so much trust in the mystery of Jane Austen and the嚇死 under the mountain,

777
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:10,380


778
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,320
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

779
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,020
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

780
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:27,340
but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so many,

781
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:33,200
not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general.

782
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:40,960
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,

783
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,900
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

784
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,960
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

785
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,640
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say, are old drinking buddies.

786
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,960
Got nothing against Jesus.

787
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,860
It's just his fan club.

788
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,140
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

789
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,180
He's more like the smear on God's head.

790
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,600
Handkerchief, just like you or me.

791
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,620
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

792
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,800
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

793
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,540
He doesn't even sneeze.

794
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,540
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

795
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:25,180
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.

796
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,660
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

797
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,500
Oh, and he's male.

798
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,180
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff.

799
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,980
We don't take stuff out of him like we do, because we sin.

800
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh, yeah, we all sin.

801
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,380
We're bad.

802
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,180
We're worthless.

803
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:43,080
We're no good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent.

804
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,240
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

805
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,260
Returns.

806
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,860
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

807
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,920
Thank you.

808
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,440
Thank you.

809
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,660
Thank you.

810
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,480
Thank you.

811
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:57,560


812
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:57,760
Thank you.

813
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,600
Thank you.

814
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:58,840


815
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,100
Thank you.

816
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,340
Thank you.

817
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,340


818
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,900
Thank you.

819
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,140
Thank you.

820
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


821
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


822
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


823
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


824
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


825
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


826
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,780
You can make a Scarea

827
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:47,040
The world of the ancient gods stand

828
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:55,220
Just like the ones I used to know

829
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,420
Where the trees are small

830
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,240
And the children are safe

831
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:20,040
And I'm dancing in the snow

832
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:36,980
I'm dreaming about the ancient gods stand

833
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,820
With everyone in front of my eyes

834
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,480
May your days be rich

835
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,740
And short

836
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:10,180
And may all your gods stand

837
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,680
Right

838
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,820
Bye

Fernanda Nandeli Moore

840
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,160
Oh, holy night

841
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,300
The stars are brightly shining

842
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,180
It is the night of our kiss and youth birth

843
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,280
Long lay, long lay the world

844
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,080
In terror and repining

845
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,840
The pit and the stone on its worth

846
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,140
A thrill of hope

847
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,600
The weary world rejoices

848
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,500
Beyond the grace

849
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,720
A new and glorious morn

850
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,660
Fall on your knees

851
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,040
Oh, hear the angel voices

852
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,400
Oh, night divine

853
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,240
Oh, night when Christ was born

854
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:19,260
Oh, night, oh, night divine

855
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,440
Have yourselves

856
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,700
A new and glorious morn

857
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:24,700


858
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:24,700


859
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,860
A groovy little solstice

860
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,580
Mithras won his fight

861
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,580
Mithras won his fight

862
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,260
Oh, ho, ho

863
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,820
Oh, ho, ho

864
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,400
Come one, come all

865
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,500
It's He-Bomb

866
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,960
Hey kids, you can help the mighty

867
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,520
So genius rights overthrow the evil normals

868
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,860
With new Bob Dobbs action figure with rocket pot

869
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,280
What I wouldn't do from Bob Dobbs

870
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,000
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you know who

871
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,340
Buy my chocolate

872
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,360

Healing face reading

00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,280
Have some of my new coco pebbles

876
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,920
Now so trumpety

877
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,340
Mmm, smells coco-licious

878
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,700
These coco-lipids

879
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,340
Blue

880
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,920
Hello friends, what do you think?

881
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,200
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

882
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,020
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santa?

883
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,960
Or is it the

884
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,580
Or is it the

885
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:26,640
The

886
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,980
The

887
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,360
The

888
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,720
The

889
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:37,740
The

890
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,480
The

891
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,480


892
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,540
The Jethro's Friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's. They're at, um,

893
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:07,540


894
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,260
The Jethro's Friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's. They're at, um,

895
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,460
In the

896
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,460


897
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,300
They did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

898
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,940
The Jethro's are at

899
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,580
Two twelve and a half Miller Avenue

900
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,060
That's two twelve and a half Miller Avenue

901
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,840
Portsmouth, New Hampshire

902
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,820
Portsmouth, N.H.

903
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,540
O-three eight O-one

904

910
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:06,320
On to town

911
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,220
4118.

912
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,600
And friends, as always, the hour of slack is brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

913
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,480
www.subgenius.com

914
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,640
It's all Christmassy right now.

915
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,560
There's a bright green bob in the window and Christmassy lights.

916
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,960
Is there a DJA? Is DJA out there?

917
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,640
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

918
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,820
No, that's something just left for DJA.

919
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,860
It's all Christmassy.

920
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:41,280
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present.

921
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,800
Under the tree.

922
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,800
Smell that cinnamon.

923
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,480
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

924
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,420
And the sugar plums.

925
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,580
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's name.

926
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,420
Yeah.

927
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,840
Of Santa, I mean.

928
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,340
Otherwise, gosh.

929
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,340
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

930
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,060
Our beloved Santa.

931
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,880
I have wanted to...

932
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,380
Put your bag down for a minute.

933
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,600
This side is red.

934
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,420
Ready to learn.

935
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,360
Big red sack.

936
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,420
For so long.

937
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,080
Pray Bob and Mary Xmas.

938
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,280
Music.

939
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,480
Saul and macaé Picture of Christian selves.

940
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:47,640
This has been a controversial thought

941
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:47,700
and I'll keep it in secrecy.

942
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:47,700
