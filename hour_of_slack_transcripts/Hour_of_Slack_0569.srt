1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Up above the world so high Like a diamond in the sky

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:23,580
Twinkle, twinkle little star How I wonder what you are

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:35,140
In the dark blue sky you came While you threw my windowpane

4
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,220
You never shut your eyes

5
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,060
Take me to the sun

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,580
Take me to the sun

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,240
Take me to the sun

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,700
Take me to the sun

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,560
Take me to the sun

10
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,920
When scent of the moon

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,500
In the dark blue sky you came

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,240
Take me to the sun

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,160
Take me to the sun

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,420
Take me to the sun

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,560
Take me to the sun

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,380
What are you?

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,620
What are you?

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,520
What are you?

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,520
What manner of beast is that?

20
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,380
What the hell are you?

21
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,640
What are you?

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,600
What are you?

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,800
Every man and woman is a star.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,120
And that's why Dave's head is a glowing gas bag of flaming hydrogen.

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,880
So it was read, so it was written.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,440
All of their heads were glowing bags of hydrogen.

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,960
And they walked around town wearing their bags.

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,600
And one little day, one little man said,

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,640
Your head is much bigger than mine.

30
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,660
You must have a much bigger bag.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,900
Everybody is a star.

32
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,220
And yes, that man was the mayor of the town.

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,120
He had a great yellow giant for a head.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,980
Unfortunately, Dave, the village idiot,

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,540
had what is known as a dwarf star for a head.

36
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,460
In fact, it had collapsed so suddenly and compacted so tremendously

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
that it, although it had not quite formed a black hole,

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,300
the density,

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,780
the density of the head of Dave,

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,420
you know, every man and woman is a star.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,780
Dave was a dwarf star.

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,080
Well, one square millimeter or so of the interior of Dave's head

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,500
was of such a dense molecular,

44
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,560
densely packed molecular structure

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,220
that that tiny, tiny fragment would be heavy enough on our planet

46
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,140
that if you dropped it, it would bore its way,

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,280
it would bore its way,

48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,980
all the way to the center of the Earth.

49
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,340
This is why Dave was not allowed in most towns,

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,920
his head being altogether heavier than the most nearby planets.

51
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,540
His presence tended to cause disruptions in the orbits

52
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,720
of other inhabited star systems,

53
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,760
other planets that might have even cities

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,100
and old civilizations that had lasted for thousands of years.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,400
Merely the gravitational waves caused by the thickness of Dave's skull

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,380
could destroy and wipe out these entire civilizations.

57
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,580
Oh, man.

58
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,720
And that's why when Dave would beg for a dollar for a bottle of beer,

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,680
most people in town would go ahead and give him the dollar.

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,500
Spare change, buddy?

61
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,040
What the hell are you?

62
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,120
Because every time he got a headache, there was a...

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh, man, everybody's got some kind of personal deformity.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,580
So my bag's a little bigger than yours, you know?

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,420
And what's the difference between helium and hydrogen?

66
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,120
My bucket's a corpus callosum, excuse my language.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
Oh, my God, it's not even 12 o'clock.

68
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,360
The townsfolk and the other planets,

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,620
civilized galactic federations and so forth,

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
had to pretty much put up with Dave

71
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,840
because whenever he got a headache,

72
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,520
it would cause earthquakes in their capital cities.

73
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,120
Oh, my Tylenol's doing nothing.

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,720
These excepents are doing nothing.

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,620
These aspen's are doing nothing.

76
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,640
This old Indian herbal extract ain't doing nothing, man.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
I feel like my skull is spinning.

78
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,400
I feel like the weight of the universe is expanding.

79
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,180
It's just expanding out through my very, very, very, very...

80
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't have my laptop.

81
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,520
Did you ever feel that way, Fran?

82
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,740
Did you ever feel like the problems of the world

83
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,400
were weighing down on you so much

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,040
that your head was self-collapsing

85
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,420
into dwarf star density?

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
Have you ever felt that way?

87
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,220
Well, if you haven't,

88
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,420
then you're probably not a subgenius.

89
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,620
It's so dense in here.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,660
You lucky bastard.

91
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,840
It's just like the yolk of an egg.

92
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,520
Or she-bastard. What did I forget?

93
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,120
You can't say she-bastard.

94
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,580
She-bastard.

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,900
It's like a little psychic yellow of an egg in here.

96
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,100
It keeps me warm.

97
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,320
It keeps me nurtured.

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,500
That's all I need.

99
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,480
I am a star.

100
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,780
See, everybody's brain is...

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
I don't need those people.

102
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,920
I don't need to drink Tylenol.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,080
I don't need to snort that stuff.

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,660
I'm different than that.

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm going here.

106
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,840
We've taken good care to raise you up here, Dave.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,740
Oh, by the way, Dave, Dave,

108
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,160
there's something we needed to...

109
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
Dave, there's something...

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I hate to interrupt your...

111
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,100
You!

112
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,160
Your fun little monologue there, but...

113
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,820
Uh...

114
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,980
You've heard about cloning and so forth

115
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,240
and the replaceable body parts and...

116
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,820
Well, you actually, Dave,

117
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,720
are the clone of a master, Dave,

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,460
who is a very rich, powerful man

119
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,720
who happens to have

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,860
just destroyed his liver

121
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,740
through hard drink,

122
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,260
and it's time for his replacement liver.

123
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,460
And yes, you were cloned from him

124
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,240
and have been raised

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,300
as a poor, pathetic street wino.

126
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,280
Uh...

127
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,740
Just kept alive,

128
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,180
you and several other clones,

129
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,140
several others have already been used for other parts.

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,660
Dave, I'm afraid your life is...

131
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,320
The goal of your life

132
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,960
has come around.

133
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,080
It's time for you to give up

134
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
that which you were bred for,

135
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
which in this case is your liver.

136
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,560
You think cloning wonderful.

137
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,920
Too bad nobody cloned you, eh, Dave?

138
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,260
Wait a minute.

139
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,100
You'd love the rich Dave.

140
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
He looks just like you

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,600
and runs General Motors now, I think.

142
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,920
Wait a minute.

143
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,440
I don't know whether I'm having a psychic echo spasm

144
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
or if I'm having some sort of corticoloring license here.

145
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,860
I'm so in the corner and I'm panhandling

146
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,120
and I hear a voice that says I'm cloned

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,720
from somebody else who's rich and powerful.

148
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,900
And come on out from behind there.

149
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,720
My little leg yoke protects me.

150
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,740
My little helium hydrogen exchange key

151
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,380
is in the back of my car.

152
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,120
How could he break in here?

153
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,260
Hey, where'd he go?

154
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,180
Hey, little voice, little garbage can.

155
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,600
Come back here.

156
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,660
Man, nobody around here.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,340
Yoo-hoo.

158
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,800
Maybe he was just

159
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,220
sucking a weird dream or something.

160
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,820
I've got to stop doing that methamphetamine.

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,000
He's ripping my brain apart.

162
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,620
I've got to stop snorting gasoline.

163
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,820
I've got to stop letting it

164
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,720
leak in the bottoms of his jaws.

165
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,620
I've got to stop

166
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,340
shaving off my nail clippings

167
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,660
and my endo-chasing re-spulking.

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,800
I've got to do something, man.

169
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,940
Maybe,

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,440
maybe it's a self-concussive realization.

171
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,100
Maybe it wasn't a little voice.

172
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,980
Maybe I am cloned from some rich and powerful person.

173
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,540
I could take over the Church of the Subgenius, man,

174
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,180
and make a lucrative mola.

175
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,480
Yeah, I'll be standing on top of everything.

176
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,240
I could topple a little petty giant

177
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,560
and a little tyrant.

178
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,840
That little toot-bootch

179
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,600
wherever I'm staying.

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,880
Weird how these little voices in my head

181
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,760
always sound like him.

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,200
Well, gentlemen,

183
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,120
as you can see by our subject,

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,620
lonesome cowboy Dave,

185
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,180
the syringe implantable transponder

186
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,120
works beautifully.

187
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,760
He seems to think that there are voices in his head.

188
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,420
In this case, my voice was used,

189
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,160
of course, as the project chief.

190
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,100
But it is amazing, is it not, gentlemen,

191
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,380
that our

192
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
General Electric tiny microchip,

193
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,760
the size of a grain of rice

194
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,480
placed underneath his skin,

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,380
injected with a vaccination

196
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,380
in his childhood,

197
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,420
has allowed us to dictate

198
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,280
as voices in his head

199
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,460
his entire life.

200
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,940
You know, there's no difference

201
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,160
in principle, gentlemen,

202
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,560
between being forced to carry a microchip

203
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,440
in your plastic card in your wallet

204
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,500
or the little pellet that we put

205
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,460
in Dave's teeth.

206
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
The principle that

207
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,640
every sister has the right to track you

208
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,400
is inherent in both.

209
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,900
And the only difference is a layer

210
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,140
of skin, or in Dave's case,

211
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,420
a skull, a very, very thick

212
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,220
layer of bony

213
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,940
carapace.

214
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,900
Let's turn the voices back on.

215
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,180
Dr. Reverend Stenge, I was wondering.

216
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,800
Yes, yes.

217
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,360
I've noticed in the literature...

218
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes, Dr. Bronner.

219
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,540
I've read all of your papers,

220
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,420
and I am quite convinced that what you have done

221
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,820
to this man is a remarkable disservice.

222
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,580
I can picture a perfect example

223
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,800
of a man whose personality,

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,340
which was not in a good shape to begin with,

225
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
has been totally destroyed,

226
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,060
immersed in your faulty world religion.

227
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,600
You expect us to experiment on animals?

228
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,540
Poor, innocent animals?

229
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,060
Why not?

230
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,460
Dave volunteered for this thing.

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,600
I see nowhere in the transcript

232
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,580
you have given me an example

233
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,840
of Dave ever giving his permission,

234
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,740
written or otherwise,

235
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,620
for you to conduct this experiment on him.

236
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,960
It seems totally remarkable to me

237
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,420
that you could conduct such an experiment

238
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,160
and receive grants and so much money to do it.

239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,900
Dr. Bronner, I think you've heard the expression,

240
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,840
if you're going to make an omelet,

241
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,240
you have to break a few eggs.

242
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,560
I don't see.

243
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,040
I mean, to a certain extent,

244
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,460
this Dave,

245
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,380
lonesome cowboy Dave character

246
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,760
is little more than a human egg,

247
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,440
an omelet,

248
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,380
so to speak,

249
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,880
bubbling on the hot sidewalk of life.

250
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,360
How could you expect

251
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,440
to call a fellow human being

252
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,800
an omelet?

253
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,840
He's not a human being.

254
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,140
He's a subgenius.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry, but your rules don't apply to us.

256
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Dr. Stein,

257
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,940
I agree with your work.

258
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,580
Can I say one word?

259
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,900
Yes, Dr. Sotomayor.

260
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,560
I appreciate what you have been doing

261
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,260
the last few years,

262
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,640
especially, I mean,

263
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,100
Markovia, your work with lonesome cowboy Dave

264
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,140
and other people,

265
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,180
Einstein, the orchestra,

266
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,400
I would like to know

267
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,820
if you can help me

268
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,280
find a possible backup grant for,

269
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,320
I have a similar project,

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,600
a Hachou project,

271
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,040
I would like to do a similar sized city

272
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,740
in southern Japan.

273
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,220
Oh, well, I'll tell you the investment opportunities

274
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,460
if you will connect,

275
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,100
of course, I assume there's fetus research in your country,

276
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,320
probably considerable amount of fetus organ trade

277
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,180
going on there.

278
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,080
Yes, I have no problem with human donor.

279
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,580
Have you also considered

280
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,120
genetic cloning research

281
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,420
for, uh, to...

282
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,480
Well, that's another thing.

283
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,340
Dr. Bronner there was quite out of line

284
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,380
complaining about a so-called human being,

285
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,980
even if Dave were a human being.

286
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,820
This is a clone of a human being.

287
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,020
The original Dave, the Master Dave,

288
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,600
sitting over here to my right,

289
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,060
yeah, that's a very, very

290
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,820
nice tie you have there,

291
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,640
Captain Dave. Thanks, man.

292
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,400
The Master Dave there, obviously,

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,260
he was born with the same rights

294
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,400
according to human being,

295
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,920
or a subtenuous.

296
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
His clone, however,

297
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,320
I mean, how can one person have

298
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,120
more than one set of rights?

299
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,380
So, therefore, the clone,

300
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,900
being more or less the same person,

301
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,640
is going to have to find his own set of rights.

302
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,340
Uh, Ivan, do you mind if I

303
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,340
get a little personal postulation in here?

304
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,800
I want to show a little of my own perspective

305
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,340
after all being the clone donor.

306
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,740
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is not a human being

307
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,340
in the same way you or I would call

308
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,000
uh,

309
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,380
say perhaps the Reverend here,

310
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,200
or Dr. Sagamoto,

311
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,040
a human being.

312
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,520
He's an experiment conducted by the church

313
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,000
to re-incur the reprogramming

314
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
of thousands more people

315
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,960
and to stop this

316
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,460
X-Day thing that we've been,

317
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,440
we've all been talking about. That's all I have to say about it.

318
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,180
Dr. Broder can complain all he wants,

319
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,940
but the process has been set in motion.

320
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,440
Now, Dave is contagious everywhere he goes

321
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
in the city of Cleveland.

322
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,720
We're going to see the same progress in the disease,

323
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,920
the virus, if you want to call it a disease,

324
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,640
we like to think of it as

325
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,440
a new, uh,

326
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,040
oh, just some, we're adding some

327
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,740
artistic details to

328
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,040
the fabric of human reality.

329
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,920
That's all. We're just doing a little

330
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,780
window dressing, improving

331
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,760
on God's handiwork.

332
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,040
Why not? God gave

333
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,360
us that right, did he not?

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,160
He made us as unto gods. Every man and woman

335
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,520
is a star, I believe our

336
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,580
secret leader, Alistair Crowley

337
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,900
Hubbard once said.

338
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,780
Ah, I remember us sitting there,

339
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,800
Parsons at that nudist college.

340
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,600
Yes, yes, sir?

341
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,780
Stefano Grappelli of the Institute of

342
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,200
Psychic Research in Rome.

343
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,280
I was wondering if, uh,

344
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,760
if you found any sort of

345
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,640
repercussion with the

346
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,560
lonesome cowboy Dave,

347
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,220
perhaps any psychic

348
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,520
example of violence

349
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,180
or trouble with police,

350
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,140
or such psychological

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,280
exacerbation.

352
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,940
Yes, yes, I'm glad that you asked

353
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,540
that question. There was an extremely

354
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
unusual side effect to the treatment

355
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,840
by which whenever Dave would

356
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,940
sneeze, plates, for instance,

357
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,940
in the kitchen would fly across the room,

358
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,820
jump off the shelves and smash

359
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,980
against the opposite wall.

360
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,060
One time we were in the

361
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,880
front office and the files flew

362
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,860
out of the file cabinet drawers every time

363
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,920
Dave sneezed. Of course we had to

364
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,780
put him down whenever

365
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,600
he was around any kind of expensive equipment.

366
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,980
Out on the street,

367
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,880
most people hardly noticed. There's

368
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
so much violence mugging down there

369
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,880
on the level, the level where

370
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,700
he, where the experiments

371
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,840
are usually conducted.

372
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Uh...

373
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
Petri dish

374
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,920
one, you know, the sidewalk.

375
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
I, uh,

376
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,800
would like to ask question also of you.

377
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,880
I am from the Institute of

378
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,020
Moscow. I need to mention

379
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,640
the name of the Institute. We are

380
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,660
familiar with the parapsychological

381
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,840
research I've been doing. Oh, yes,

382
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,800
comrade. I would like to say

383
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,940
that after the upcoming

384
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,760
election, we'll be all different situation

385
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,880
in former Soviet Union and, uh,

386
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,700
the Commonwealth of all of the states

387
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,460
would be involved in, uh, and

388
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
after what you have said, uh,

389
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,740
reprogramming, making people

390
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,900
more malleable, pliable, we'll

391
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,800
find have to a different problem. Is

392
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
there some way we can use your research and

393
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
perhaps make, uh, the whole

394
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
of former Soviet Union, uh, similar,

395
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,220
uh, in the...

396
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,560
Well, comrade, as you know, uh, Dobbs Co.

397
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,800
is, uh, marketing the, as we call it,

398
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
the electronic leash of these

399
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,660
implantable biochips, uh,

400
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,800
to, uh, be any, uh, corporate,

401
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,800
uh, or governmental entity,

402
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,020
uh, we'd, uh, happily, uh,

403
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,140
assist. Of course,

404
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,220
our microchips do have the, uh,

405
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,980
Dobbs trademark, uh, built in

406
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,840
so that, uh, although they,

407
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,860
the, uh, subject's allegiance will

408
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,900
be up to the choice of the, uh,

409
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,680
corporation or, or

410
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,660
governmental entity, uh,

411
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,860
nevertheless, uh, as you can certainly

412
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,480
understand, it's sort of like

413
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,920
the Coca-Cola company is gonna

414
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,040
sell Coke in Russia. That's fine,

415
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,980
but they're gonna have their logo on it.

416
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,800
Well, uh, your people

417
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
will be mind-controlled, according

418
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,180
to your plans. However, they will respond

419
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,620
to the, uh,

420
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,820
smiling face image

421
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,380
of Bob.

422
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,860
That, uh, that would be

423
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,020
very, that is fine with us. Thank you very much

424
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,960
for answering this one.

425
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,520
And, uh, as we said, these, uh,

426
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,020
computer chips will link the individual up

427
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,900
to a vast computer database

428
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,880
so that we can, in fact, follow

429
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,900
the, uh, subject, uh,

430
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,940
and, uh, follow their spending,

431
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,020
their voting, uh,

432
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,940
habits, their, pretty much

433
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,800
their sexual habits up to a point.

434
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,140
Uh, we can, in fact, dictate their, uh,

435
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,040
sexual habits, uh, through the voice

436
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,840
in the head technique. We have

437
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,920
had some subjects, uh,

438
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,900
they get their ideas from the movies or

439
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,000
comic books or something, they pull all their teeth

440
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
out so as that they think

441
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,900
that this will silence the

442
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,980
silent radio in their head. Of course,

443
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,960
uh, that does affect the

444
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,940
resonance and we have to, uh, increase

445
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,560
the amplification when they

446
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,240
pull out all of their teeth, but it's, uh,

447
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,760
rather pointless,

448
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,000
uh, to tell the truth. It's sad.

449
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,800
I've noticed, uh,

450
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,880
Dave down there is, uh, bleeding

451
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,920
at the mouth, the one down on the

452
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,820
sidewalk, not the one here in the boardroom,

453
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,860
certainly. I don't think we're getting enough,

454
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,040
uh, can you, uh, can you enhance this picture somehow

455
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,760
so we can all see it a little better and bring up the volume

456
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,940
somehow a little bit? Yeah, zoom in on, uh, screen three

457
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,280
there, uh, Wellman, uh,

458
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
if you, if you pull in close now, you'll see

459
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that Dave yanked all

460
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,880
his teeth out with those pliers and has thrown

461
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,100
them down in the gutter where our servo robots

462
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,920
have retrieved them for the master

463
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,940
Dave here in case he ever needs, uh,

464
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,520
a new moment. I don't know what I'm saying to myself.

465
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,080
Me and the other day

466
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
I saw her beating myself in the face

467
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
with a hammer for no fair

468
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,760
reason. And here I am

469
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,660
pulling out a moment. Dave, Dave,

470
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,720
we're back. It didn't

471
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,100
do you any good.

472
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,780
You pulled your teeth out for nothing, Dave.

473
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,660
I love Bob. You're an idiot, Dave.

474
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,640
I came to the church,

475
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,480
not a doorbell. You didn't love Bob

476
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,780
enough, Dave. I've got to love more.

477
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,520
Listen to this, you guys. He'll believe anything.

478
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,340
Wait a minute. Dave, you sinned.

479
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,300
You pulled out all your teeth for nothing.

480
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,500
That'll look stupid as well as

481
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,180
I look stupid. I ain't never

482
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,740
gonna find me a day like this.

483
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,600
Bob's living so

484
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,200
worse.

485
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,080
But I'm not gonna let you

486
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,080


487
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,240
cry, Dave. Don't cry, Dave.

488
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,560
Bob has a new job for you.

489
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,720
He has a new

490
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,900
bride for you, Dave.

491
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,820
Bob has brought you a new bride.

492
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
See that goat over there in that

493
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,340
pen?

494
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,140
That she-goat over in that pen?

495
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,920
That's your new wife, Dave. What?

496
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,400
That's Hogan's goat. Oh, man.

497
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,940
You are the husband of Hogan's

498
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,900
she-goat. Last night

499
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,920
you told me that was some kind of weird goat they

500
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
was gonna clone. And then you said

501
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,940
it was the goats that was using to touch nerve gas.

502
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,880
And now you're telling me it's my wife?

503
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,980
That fella's gonna get me a nice

504
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,760
six foot seven yeti woman.

505
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,820
That's gonna blow me out.

506
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,560
I'm so confused.

507
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,920
Do you have a problem with the goat?

508
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,500
Uh, Dave?

509
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,800
Would you rather us take you

510
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,980
another wife?

511
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,820
Uh, I guess

512
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,960
How about this giant,

513
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,400
this gigantic eyebrow

514
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,200
mantis? An eyebrow mantis?

515
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,180
Man,

516
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,780
I can't see it. My mind's left astral.

517
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,920
Get the eyebrow mantis slide

518
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,260
into his retina.

519
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,000
There. Okay, he should be seeing

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
the, uh, the giant

521
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,740
eyebrow mantis.

522
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,480
What the hell is that thing?

523
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,700
Turn the erection

524
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
knob up to ten.

525
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,200
He's terrified of the mantis

526
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,620
and at the same time he's

527
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,200
sexually aroused. Oh my god, get that thing

528
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,520
away from me. This always

529
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,100
refuses to take my child. I'll bet you're a Leo.

530
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,720
I'll get away from you.

531
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,060
Oh my god. Hey, uh, hey. So you want to

532
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,300
see, gentlemen, not only is the experiment

533
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,240
Oh, get away. Oh, get him away.

534
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,120
As you can see, gentlemen, the experiment

535
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,060
is not only a success but a lot of

536
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,460
fun for we researchers.

537
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,880
You can pull the strings of the subject

538
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,080
as if he were a little puppet

539
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,920
dancing down there on that hot

540
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,540
sidewalk in the inner city

541
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,040
surrounded by the broken beer

542
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,000
bottles and the other bums and

543
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,120
losers while we up here

544
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,140
in our skyscraper sitting

545
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,720
at our computer keyboards

546
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,940
may make him

547
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
jerk and twitch

548
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,120
our own little pathetic

549
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,700
marionette, isn't he?

550
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,800
And so it's... He suspects,

551
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,780
of course. In fact, he knows perfectly

552
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,160
well his state, station

553
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,760
and life.

554
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,160
That's what religion is for, boys.

555
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,040
Praise Bob, eh?

556
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,920
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

557
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,060
And thank you

558
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,780
for the excellent demonstration and

559
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,040
quite an illuminating slideshow

560
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,220
it was. Now, what I think... We take credit cards.

561
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,080
Well, I think that's what we're

562
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,900
all asking right now. What will

563
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,520
the next project be and how much do you need?

564
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,740
All I need is...

565
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,300
is to fill the receptor

566
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,840
holes, my friend.

567
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,080
Oh, you ask

568
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,320
me what I need?

569
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
I just need to fill

570
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,320
those receptor holes.

571
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,980
They used to be

572
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,340
so full,

573
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,620
those holes in my brain.

574
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,960
They had just the

575
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,720
perfect molecule fit

576
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,060
right into that little

577
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,280
locked place.

578
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,940
Now... The brain holes.

579
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,140
The brain holes. The brain holes

580
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,540
are empty. The brain holes

581
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,160
are empty tonight. The brain's

582
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,880
gonna have to make its own... The moon

583
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,360
is shining. My eyes

584
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,880
are bright but...

585
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,420
The master molecule

586
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,700
is gone.

587
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,020
You look pretty sharp.

588
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,240
You look pretty cute.

589
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,100
But you ain't

590
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,920
going nowhere in that brain

591
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,900
holes suit you got on.

592
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,140
You say you look so cute

593
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,340
in that brand new suit.

594
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,980
You think you're

595
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,720
got some place to go.

596
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,380
You ain't

597
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,080
going nowhere so just

598
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,020
sit down in a chair and

599
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,060
let Bob Dobbs tell you

600
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,560
the truth.

601
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,680
I told you when you were

602
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,760
ten and I told you when you were

603
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,920
twelve and I told you as

604
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,380
you were coming on up.

605
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,900
When you look

606
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,600
scoward my son think of that

607
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,860
glimmering pipe.

608
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,900
So my work will be done.

609
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,980
I'm leaving soon.

610
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
There is a great mesh in your

611
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,500
brain.

612
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,880
And this mesh is composed of tiny

613
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,980
holes and these holes have a certain

614
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,040
shape. Those are

615
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,600
receptor holes and they're

616
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,220
responsible for your sense of

617
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,960
self and well being

618
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,060
and pleasure.

619
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,900
There's a certain shape of a molecule

620
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,980
that'll fall into those receptor

621
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,640
holes and make you

622
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,880
feel real good.

623
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,960
And that shape is a shape

624
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,140
oddly enough of

625
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,680
what looks to us just like a

626
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,420
common pipe.

627
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,100
Like a Dr. Grabow

628
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,440
pipe.

629
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,220
If you can find some way to get

630
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,080
tiny pipe shaped molecules

631
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,400
to fill those receptor holes

632
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
inside that

633
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,740
vacant mesh in your head

634
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,020
well you'll probably feel

635
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,040
so much better that you'll be able to do better

636
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,700
on the job. Get a better job.

637
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,600
Become like a great

638
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,040
stock whiz or something and get

639
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,960
rich overnight on some great

640
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,500
idea of perfect vision.

641
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,200
So of course at this point

642
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,740
you're asking

643
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,080
hey man where can I get

644
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,340
some of them pipe shaped molecules?

645
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,260
Is it like a pill or

646
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,480
is it something you smoke?

647
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,380
Hey Bernice

648
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,360
I just want you to try this.

649
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,720
Look what I got at the farm.

650
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,300
What is it?

651
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,980
It's not a pill. It's not a pipe.

652
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,380
You place it in your third eye.

653
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,700
It's the virtual

654
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,140
of the

655
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,100
the the

656
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,680
It's the emperor's new

657
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,160
pipe.

658
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,740
You just hear.

659
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,420
You see this

660
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,240
thing that I'm

661
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,620
holding in my hand.

662
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,680
There's

663
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,480
nothing really in my hand.

664
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,580
But it's a virtual pipe.

665
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,600
There is no virtual in that pipe.

666
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,120
Hey man let's all

667
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,920
like smoke some of what's in this

668
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,140
pipe in my hand.

669
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,840
Oh yeah yeah man

670
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,940
I see that pipe in your hand. Yeah let me have

671
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,520
some of that virtual. Oh whoa.

672
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,920
Whoa. I tried

673
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,020
marijuana once

674
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,580
at the same time and I tried LSD

675
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,060
and I tried bananas mixed

676
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
with Coca-Cola and aspirin

677
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,280
but man

678
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,780
and Jimson weed and NyQuil

679
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,320
but whoa

680
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,840
this virtual pipe.

681
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,300
Oh man

682
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,540
I am going inside.

683
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,920
Oh far in.

684
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,060
The pipe is feeling really nice.

685
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,160
I'm like caved in.

686
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,720
I'm caved in man.

687
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,720
I'm so deep.

688
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,960
I'm like a

689
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,540
I am speedlunking dude.

690
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,080
Help help.

691
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,520
I am like in the magma.

692
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,100
Help. Oh help sir.

693
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,460
Magma city.

694
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,080
Sir my lumps are crushed.

695
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,220
Feel that pressure.

696
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
No no the magma cathedral.

697
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,360
Whoa. I am so low.

698
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,440
I think

699
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,980
man I wonder maybe I'm

700
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,440
getting too low.

701
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,440
Maybe I'm getting too deep.

702
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,160
Am I ever going to come up?

703
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,200
Hey man don't come up

704
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,800
too fast.

705
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,820
Your hand will explode.

706
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
You'll get the beans.

707
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,080
Whoa.

708
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,600
Wow these anti drugs

709
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,180
are so much better than

710
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,800
those cheap conspiracy

711
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,100
street drugs.

712
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,460
I don't want to get high anymore.

713
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,840
Ever since I learned

714
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,900
the word of Bob

715
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,120
I've been ready not only to

716
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,600
come back down to earth

717
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,680
but to go below the sidewalk.

718
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,240
Below the sewers.

719
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,540
Below the upper crust.

720
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,660
Below the lower crust.

721
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,740
Down all the way.

722
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,360
Yeah.

723
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,380
I've learned how to go down

724
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,900
since I gave up

725
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,700
those getting high

726
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,640
kind of drugs.

727
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,940
Bob's dragging me all the way down.

728
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
Oh the pressure's getting

729
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,500
getting higher.

730
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,000
It's getting really really hot down here.

731
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,160
You know when Bob's taking me

732
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,080
I'm digging it.

733
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,660
It's really hot.

734
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,280
Look at these flames.

735
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,360
Somehow they're not consuming my flesh

736
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,580
but yet they're burning.

737
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,140
Whoa.

738
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,300
These Bob pills

739
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,220
and this virtual Bob pipe.

740
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,620
This stuff's really intense.

741
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,700
I'm like having a before death

742
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,320
experience.

743
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,020
I'm having an

744
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,440
out of inside

745
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,700
planet experience.

746
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,100
Oh man.

747
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
I think I am too low.

748
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,040
I probably need to come back up.

749
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,500
Hey man. Is there anything I can take

750
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,420
to counteract this non drug

751
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,460
that I didn't take?

752
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,080
Hey ref.

753
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,580
What are you doing here man? Crouched on the floor.

754
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,920
Isn't this the coolest club

755
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,620
you ever been in?

756
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,060
I already had three multi-gassets

757
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,820
and I don't even know what the hell that is.

758
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,200
Yeah this stuff's great.

759
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,700
It's free too. Yeah where'd he get it?

760
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,740
I got it from Bob.

761
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,760
Well I mean it's free once you join up.

762
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,060
This guy charged me 15 bucks

763
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,680
for one hit.

764
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,960
He tell me it's free once I joined up?

765
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,520
Well you're joined up now.

766
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,160
Here take.

767
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,860
See the pipe in my hand?

768
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,140
There's not really a pipe in his hand.

769
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,560
But they believe

770
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
there is a pipe in his hand.

771
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,040
See the pipe? Here take my pipe

772
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,220
Dave. Have a big hit

773
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,080
of what's in that pipe.

774
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,500
There is no pipe.

775
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,260
There is nothing in the pipe.

776
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,080
But the placebo effect is so much more

777
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,140
powerful than any real drug

778
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,120
that the subgenius victim

779
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,980
is now becoming

780
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,400
so low,

781
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,000
so in there

782
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,340
that it is as if

783
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,460
he is looking up

784
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,720
from eight feet underground.

785
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,940
I feel like they're made of mush.

786
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,380
He feels like

787
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
he's laying at the bottom of a hole.

788
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,040
I can hardly move.

789
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,080
In a box.

790
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,460
Hey man, I never understood gravity

791
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,260
and now I'm in it.

792
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,440
Underground.

793
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,960
This is wild.

794
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,500
In the dark.

795
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,920
But I want to go and do stuff

796
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,140
and I can't see nothing

797
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,840
and I can hardly breathe.

798
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,660
And the top of the box is only about an inch

799
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,340
from his nose.

800
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
And it's a real tight fit.

801
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,020
And he doesn't know how deep underground

802
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,260
he might be buried

803
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,380
and why he might be inside a box

804
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,140
underground freaking out.

805
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm a gothic service android guy.

806
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,660
I'm down to 65 in a gothic prison.

807
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
They can't hear you knocking up there, Dave.

808
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,120
Hey gothic prison guy,

809
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,700
I don't think I've been a mouthful.

810
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,420
Say Dave, you thought that problem

811
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,220
with premature ejaculation was bad.

812
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,780
How do you like premature

813
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,420
burial?

814
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,860
I better stop hyperventilating.

815
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,620
Maybe you should have just said no, Dave.

816
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,940
Yeah, maybe I just

817
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,220
said no.

818
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,360
Maybe that time when you were seven years old

819
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,060
that other kid offered you a cigarette

820
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,180
maybe you just should have said no.

821
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,420
Yeah, after all then I could say I had better lungs

822
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,680
and I could stay in here much longer.

823
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,540
What the hell am I talking about?

824
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,920
Maybe that time when you were 15 and that kid said

825
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,460
hey I stole this beer from Mr. Jones

826
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,840
icebox, why don't you

827
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,320
let's drink this beer.

828
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,300
Should you possibly, Dave, have said

829
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,320
no?

830
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,620
No, I should never have said no.

831
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,120
I said yeah and I'm...

832
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,340
And that boy said hey,

833
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,780
Dave, let's smoke some of this

834
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,800
corn silk

835
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,880
rolled up in this toilet paper.

836
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,040
What should you have said then, Dave, eh?

837
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,100
Give me some more corn silk

838
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,360
and I will save for my...

839
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,160
No, you should have said no, Dave.

840
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,880
Or if you had said no to the corn silk

841
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,940
perhaps you wouldn't be in this box

842
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,660
eight feet underground in the cold

843
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,580
and the dark wondering just

844
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,780
how you ended up

845
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,380
here.

846
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,740
Help me, please.

847
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,820
They can't hear you

848
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,060
eight feet above.

849
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
They're crying.

850
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,680
Oh, look, all your friends are up there.

851
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,340
Reverend Stang's always pretending to cry anyway.

852
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,400
Oh, and look, Princess Weard

853
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,220
it was so good, Chaz is

854
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,300
well, he's actually seems to be

855
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,760
divvying up money

856
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,460
with Reverend Stang and...

857
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,580
Come on, somebody.

858
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,700
Well, Michelle is crying.

859
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,200
I don't want to die.

860
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,920
Oh, I'm happy because she has hay fever.

861
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,620
I just realized...

862
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,540
Look, they're all laughing.

863
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
This is all a figment of my mind.

864
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,780
Yeah, I didn't smoke no corn silk.

865
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,520
I was back in the goose bar

866
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,480
and I had me hit on that pipe.

867
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,100
I think I had it look like Stangy Wings.

868
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,580
If I just used my psychic abilities

869
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,460
and concentrate my yogic powers

870
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,160
which was gifted to me by Bob Dobbs

871
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,660
down in my lowest lower chakra

872
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,680
way down...

873
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,880
Oh, no, I can't do that.

874
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,180
The slack will be with you.

875
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Oh, damn.

876
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,940
I'm never gonna make it now.

877
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,600
Feel the slack, Dave.

878
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,580
Close your eyes.

879
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Turn off the autopilot.

880
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,820
Come on, Bob.

881
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,620
Feel the slack.

882
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,900
I'm seeing crystal skulls floating by.

883
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,280
Just go with your instincts, Dave.

884
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,560
Oh, my God, I don't want to go into the wild life now.

885
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,580
I just want to take a hit off that pipe

886
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,600
and now I'm going to die.

887
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,200
Throw off the meat shackles.

888
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,540
Dave, baby.

889
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,180
I'm not going to die.

890
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,980
Suck the body like an old shoe.

891
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,960
Welcome.

892
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,020
Welcome to the other side.

893
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,560
Remember me?

894
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,560
Benny. Benny Gordon back in New York.

895
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,440
I was the guy who stole your shoes

896
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,800
and hid them in the garbage can.

897
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,940
Then you struck me in the face, remember?

898
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

899
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,140
Yeah, I died later.

900
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,300
No thanks to you. Yeah.

901
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,160
Kind of screwed me up inside.

902
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,900
When they let me in Bellevue, they said I'd never be the same.

903
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,240
I starved to death.

904
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,420
I thought about you when I died.

905
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,280
Yeah.

906
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,760
I just don't look like

907
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,400
the green carpets coming out.

908
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,080
Kind of looks

909
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,700
blood red.

910
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,460
Hello, Dave.

911
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,400
I'm sure you don't remember me.

912
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,960
I was originally

913
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
a tiny puppy that you

914
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,660
tortured when you were six years old.

915
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,720
Remember me now?

916
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

917
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,080
Now I am

918
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,820
Dog Demon,

919
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,340
the bearer of vengeance

920
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,520
for all torturers

921
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,580
of tiny puppies.

922
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,360
And meet my friend,

923
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,020
the legless grasshopper.

924
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

925
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,760
We've all come to get,

926
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,000
to tell you that we remember

927
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,140
all the things you did

928
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,300
in life.

929
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,660
I don't think this is going to be very pleasant.

930
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,220
If I'm supposed to recount

931
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,560
all my inches,

932
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,860
so far I've only had three inches,

933
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,880
and it's all bad.

934
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,280
What's next?

935
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,180
Who's that weird looking woman?

936
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,720
Grandma,

937
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,840
I've never done nothing to you really.

938
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,200
I'm sorry about the stove.

939
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,180
I'm sorry about the stove.

940
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,740
It's too late

941
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,880
for forgiveness now, Dave.

942
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,860
Oh, Mom, come on.

943
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
It's too late now.

944
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,620
It's much too late.

945
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

946
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,040
Oh, Lord.

947
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,620
She's all disfigured and burned just the way I left her

948
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,880
when I ran out of the house.

949
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,820
Dave,

950
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,280
remember your habit of sticking chewing gum

951
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,540
under theater seats?

952
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,480
Yes.

953
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,260
I am a soul who once reached under the seat

954
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,140
and touched your germ-ridden gum

955
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,680
later to die of a cold.

956
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,360
later to die of a cold.

957
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm sorry, bro.

958
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,120
You know, I try to keep myself clean

959
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,880
and have good personal attributes

960
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,740
like that and stuff,

961
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,660
but you know, those things are so bourgeois.

962
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,600
Hey, Dave, remember me, Butch?

963
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,960
Yeah, Butch. Yeah. I'm sorry.

964
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, I bet you're sorry now, Dave.

965
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,140
Yeah, I bet you're sorry now, Dave.

966
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,720
Get away.

967
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,640
I didn't mean nothing.

968
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,880
Maybe you shouldn't have stuck up behind me

969
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,480
and pulled that little trick on me that one time, Dave.

970
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,920
You know my personality, man.

971
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,480
Push me in front of that car, Dave.

972
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,080
Everybody in school knew I was a joker.

973
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,460
Everybody thunk and I just fell

974
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,280
in front of that car, Dave.

975
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:47,620
Dave.

976
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,180
Were you jealous just because I was bigger

977
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,800
and tougher and got all the girls

978
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,880
and got decent grades and had friends

979
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,980
and had parents and had money

980
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,120
and had a life?

981
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,860
Were you just, Dave?

982
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,260
What, you think you're gonna wait?

983
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,260
Yes! Yes! I hated you all!

984
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,340
I hated that puppy for having hair.

985
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,160
I hated Grandma for having food.

986
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,360
And I hated you for having a car

987
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,780
and girl friends. In fact, I still hate you.

988
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,560
And that's why I don't mind being here.

989
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,580
Dave, meet everyone

990
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,020
of whom you have ever been jealous.

991
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,000
They are here to gloat

992
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,780
at your misfortune.

993
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

994
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,880
Thousands and thousands

995
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,360
of people gloating,

996
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,540
gloating at your total

997
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,700
humiliation here in the endless

998
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,480
flames of, yes, let's say,

999
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,880
in hell, Dave. You're dead and you're in hell.

1000
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,360
You see him face us

1001
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
and you point fingers at me.

1002
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,900
And here are snapshots

1003
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,700
and tape recordings of every

1004
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,720
stupid or humiliating thing you've

1005
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,800
ever done. Here, the files

1006
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,700
of every callous and

1007
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,620
thoughtless thing you've ever said.

1008
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,020
Here, every lie you've ever

1009
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,120
said or done.

1010
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,640
Oh man, they're flying by so fast.

1011
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,840
Here, every betrayal.

1012
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,040
Here, every lie.

1013
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,200
Here, every time you've

1014
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,680
masturbated in an impure manner.

1015
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
Oh man, my eyes. I'm going blind.

1016
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,860
You didn't know we had such good cameras,

1017
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,920
did you, in all those grumpy

1018
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,620
filling station restrooms, eh, Dave?

1019
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,220
How did you know about that?

1020
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,540
All right. Here, the endless file

1021
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,340
of the times you picked your nose.

1022
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,540
Here, the file of the times

1023
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,700
you wet your bed.

1024
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,220
Here, the files of the times

1025
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,300
you didn't wash behind your ears.

1026
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,480
Everything, everything in your entire

1027
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,460
life has been reconstructed

1028
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,880
and you're going to have to

1029
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,220
relive every single moment

1030
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,260
of it over and over and over

1031
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,520
again inside this little black box

1032
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,440
underground because you smoked

1033
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,300
the corn silk and didn't do what

1034
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,240
your parents said.

1035
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,180
William. Oh, I love you.

1036
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,000
Thanks for sitting there, you guys.

1037
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
And as far as, all that masturbating

1038
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,340
and coolie, I, I don't know how long

1039
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,040
I can do it. I'm older now. My arms

1040
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
might get tired. But if I just go back

1041
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,460
in the box, when I reappear, I'll

1042
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,140
be back in the goo goo bar, talking

1043
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,180
to Stan and smoking on the bike, please.

1044
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So, what say, what say,

1045
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,740
brothers? Shall we give him another

1046
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,780
chance? Shall we give Dave a

1047
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,320
chance to live his life again?

1048
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,760
Do you think he's learned his lesson?

1049
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,920
Oh, please, good sirs and good dames.

1050
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,220
Let's flip a coin and see whether

1051
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,460
salvation. Or not.

1052
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,600
Alright, place the giant

1053
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,000
coin on the giant thumb.

1054
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,360
Set the catapult.

1055
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,080
Three,

1056
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,580
two, one, flip the coin.

1057
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,380
It is

1058
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,640
flying. Look at it.

1059
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,140
Flying miles up.

1060
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,500
Spinning end over end.

1061
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,180
Dave is pouring

1062
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
bullets of suspense out

1063
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,780
as the coin slopes.

1064
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,840
Oh, it's getting slower and slower.

1065
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,460
It's falling.

1066
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,560
It's falling back down to Earth.

1067
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,800
It's coming down and it's

1068
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,640
landed right exactly

1069
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,620
on edge and it rolled

1070
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,640
and it came to rest

1071
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,780
and the coin is

1072
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,740
on edge.

1073
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:05,840
How

1074
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,720
shall Dave's fate

1075
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,580
be decided now?

1076
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,800
We'll have to go through the

1077
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,860
suspense and flip the coin again. Okay, there it goes.

1078
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,820
It's a slow motion.

1079
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,980
Okay, hold it.

1080
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,320
And so the end

1081
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,380
of the suspense went on for another

1082
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,540
million years as Dave

1083
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,560
waited to find out whether

1084
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,580
any of the coins would actually land.

1085
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,000
And one day,

1086
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,520
a million years later,

1087
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,340
it landed heads up. Dave,

1088
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,940
you have won.

1089
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,720
You were allowed to dig your way out

1090
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,580
of your coffin and back to

1091
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,060
Earth in the year

1092
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,960
one million A.D.

1093
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,900
You have been,

1094
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,100
forgiven by God and Satan

1095
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,660
and are resurrected

1096
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,840
into eternal life

1097
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,100
in whatever is left on the

1098
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,060
planet of your birth, where

1099
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
you now claw your way

1100
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,220
back up. There he's tearing

1101
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,100
the coffin open. He's digging

1102
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,420
his, choking his way,

1103
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,200
but we're using his

1104
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,460
front teeth to dig his way like an entrenching

1105
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,140
tool. And he's finally made

1106
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,100
out of the grave. He's coming through

1107
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,060
the surface of the graveyard. Dave is

1108
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,780
free. Dave has escaped.

1109
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,920
He has literally dug his way out

1110
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
of hell. I'm free.

1111
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,960
Hey,

1112
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,980
where can you get a good sandwich around here?

1113
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,940
And some juder pie.

1114
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,680
Hey.

1115
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,980
Hey.

1116
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,620
Hey.

1117
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,620
Hey.

1118
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,140
Hey.

1119
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,140


1120
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,140


1121
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,460
Hey.

1122
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:48,860
Hey.

1123
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1124
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1125
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1126
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1127
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1128
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1129
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


1130
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,580
Say grade

1131
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,800
G Frances, I imagine you're thinking.

1132
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:18,360
McKenzie browsers are tomato bridge, savoryest have never seen. You don't talk any P край what a good layup for porem and

1133
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,240
It's called serendipity, Dave.

1134
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,560
Serendipity.

1135
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,640
Serendipity.

1136
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,200
Or slack.

1137
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,620
You can call it either one.

1138
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,580
Serendipity.

1139
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,920
I remember them guys when I was a little kid that used to be in the Thomas Brothers, you know.

1140
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,900
And one of them died of a heroin overdose, I think.

1141
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah, serendipity.

1142
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,540
I could die of a heroin overdose.

1143
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,380
That's my name, serendipity.

1144
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,420
How did you know?

1145
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,700
I didn't know, sir.

1146
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,280
I just kind of guessed it.

1147
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,380
Yeah, you know, I'm one of them intuitive kind of guys.

1148
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,440
You know, one of your strong, silent types.

1149
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:46,900
Yeah.

1150
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,440
Yeah.

1151
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,780
Wow.

1152
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,180
I hope I ain't smelling too strong.

1153
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,840
I just crawled out of a graveyard.

1154
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,660
I think it kind of smells manly.

1155
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,940
I kind of like it.

1156
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,280
Yeah, some people say it smells more like a goat, but you in the mood for a cup of coffee?

1157
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,760
Well, sure.

1158
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,900
An espresso?

1159
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,020
Yeah.

1160
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,200
How about a cappuccino?

1161
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,180
Can we snuff it?

1162
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,500
Yeah, baby.

1163
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,160
We can do anything you want to.

1164
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,440
Especially with legs like that, we can snuff it too.

1165
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,540
Wow.

1166
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,340
Is that your naturalist?

1167
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:18,660
Is that your naturalistic hair?

1168
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,980
Or is that some kind of falsified hair?

1169
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,560
I never saw that hue on a woman or on a human being.

1170
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,980
It's a virtual hair.

1171
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,720
Virtual hair?

1172
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,000
Yes, virtual hair.

1173
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,700
You mean like it's feely-reely?

1174
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,500
It's sort of like a holodeck hair.

1175
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,800
You mean if I touch it, like, then I would automatically experience the sensation you

1176
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,220
was talking about in the aforementioned article?

1177
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,360
Well, kind of, yes.

1178
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,060
Like a hologram.

1179
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,200
Kind of, yes?

1180
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,180
Yes, kind of.

1181
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
What about, you sure that ain't a merkin?

1182
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,340
No.

1183
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,660
You sure that ain't a bomb-dob's feely-reely virtual reality merkin?

1184
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,880
It really is.

1185
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,460
Oh, okay.

1186
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,400
I'll believe you.

1187
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,840
It really is.

1188
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,500
It's a real merkin.

1189
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,340
Ha.

1190
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,940
You just lied to me.

1191
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,640
You know, I'm wondering again since you just put...

1192
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,080
It's a real virtual merkin.

1193
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,800
Oh.

1194
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,640
So then...

1195
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,240
Does some of this seem too good to be true, Dave?

1196
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,180
Yeah, well, the birds are singing and a woman in virtual work had come up and tried to ask

1197
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,900
me out on a date.

1198
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,640
And you're on?

1199
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,480
Are you looking a gift horse in the mouth, Dave?

1200
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,180
No, I'm looking at...

1201
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,440
I mean, you, uh, we let you out of hell to relive your life and now you're complaining

1202
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,980
that maybe it's all too perfect or something?

1203
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,920
No, I was just looking at the bus stop.

1204
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,460
I was reading the cards on the bus stop.

1205
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,320
Snack Co.

1206
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,980
Funeral Home.

1207
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,840
George's Beanies.

1208
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,620
Uh, oh, hey!

1209
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,680
Wait a minute.

1210
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,180
Where'd the girl go?

1211
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,080
Hey, uh, hey, wait a minute.

1212
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,100
Oh, whatever.

1213
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,380
Well, Dave, we'll go ahead and admit it.

1214
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,820
It is.

1215
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,320
We put you in another one of those worlds where whatever you imagine is whatever you

1216
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,500
get.

1217
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:47,620
And, uh, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get you out of that.

1218
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:47,620


1219
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,700
And as long as you were feeling pretty, you were imagining pretty good things and getting,

1220
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,060
uh, the girls and so forth.

1221
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:57,800
But what are you imagining now that we've browbeaten you down and made you feel insecure

1222
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,860
again, eh, Dave?

1223
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,680
What kind of reality are you creating for yourself now, you poor, pathetic loser, eh?

1224
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,800
Oh, look.

1225
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:13,200
He's surrounded by snakes and harsh puppies and old, rotted, uh, crimped, um, lovdicats.

1226
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,560
And I know this is all full of it now.

1227
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,340
I'll surround the bus.

1228
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,600
I'll surround the bus.

1229
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:17,600


1230
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,300
I'll surround the bus.

1231
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,020
And everybody knows you don't eat no harsh puppies with no snake.

1232
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,420
You eat with a snake.

1233
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,260
You eat toot-a-pie and...

1234
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,720
You see, we confused him and his entire reality collapsed around him.

1235
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:29,760
I hate snakes.

1236
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,060
I hate snakes.

1237
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
We made him afraid.

1238
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,620
And that of which he was most afraid surrounded him.

1239
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,380
The moral of the story is, kids, you make your own reality.

1240
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,440
Every man and woman is a star.

1241
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,860
And if that was so, then how come it hurts when you stub your toe and how come your head

1242
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,600
ain't on fire?

1243
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:47,820
fire.

1244
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:59,200
These are the eternal questions to be answered only by the eternal verities, death and taxes

1245
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,780
and Bob.

1246
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,120
The three things that you can depend on.

1247
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:15,980
Oh ragged bones, oh ragged shoes, I am a vagabond, a vagabond, free as the wind.

1248
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,260
Hey buddy over here, I got some snakes and hush puppies.

1249
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:19,820
You hungry?

1250
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,260
You feel like curling your toes up and squirming?

1251
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,840
Come on over here, I got it.

1252
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,040
Hey you over there, I got lemonade too.

1253
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,500
You look a mite parched.

1254
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,660
You look like a demon.

1255
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,260
You, you.

1256
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,940
Say, say, say Dave, I'm a demon.

1257
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:42,140
I noticed that you took all those lemons we handed you and made lemonade.

1258
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,960
We noticed that you had that glass that was...

1259
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,200
It was half empty and magically made it half full.

1260
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,680
Yeah and I got the one Aaron eyeball pointing down like many convicts do.

1261
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,580
But that doesn't explain it.

1262
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,200
How come my life is such a mess man?

1263
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,120
I done squirmed by you.

1264
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,720
I bought your lemons with real U.S. money.

1265
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,260
David it's part of the seeking.

1266
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,560
It's part of the journey.

1267
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,440
You have to pay your dues.

1268
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,500
In order to truly soar through heaven you must first embrace the porcelain bowls of hell.

1269
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:14,780
Yeah.

1270
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,880
I'm like some kind of mythic knight Percival guy.

1271
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,620
Yeah, I don't mind so much.

1272
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,320
Yes, it's the holy grail of slack.

1273
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,040
And you're getting so close having gone through the terrible gauntlet of anti-slack.

1274
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,000
Surely you must be almost to your goal of enlightenment.

1275
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,320
Nirvana.

1276
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,580
And it's true.

1277
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,200
Here comes the nirvana.

1278
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,400
By the way Dave, you knew that nirvana means nothing, right?

1279
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,140
Yeah, I knew it meant nothing.

1280
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,560
And that's what I'm writing for man.

1281
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,520
Life's a nothing.

1282
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,820
Because every time I get me something good it turns out to be something bad.

1283
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:45,940
And I'm not going to get it.

1284
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:45,940


1285
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:45,940


1286
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:45,940


1287
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:45,940


1288
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:45,940


1289
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,980
And every time I get me something bad it turns out worse.

1290
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,720
So it's like a shifting sandy beach of twenty dollar bills.

1291
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,900
It keeps on changing and changing and changing and changing.

1292
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,180
And I need nothing.

1293
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,740
Blessing sweet oblivion.

1294
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,020
Here then is your reward Dave.

1295
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,560
You asked for it from Bob, God and all the others.

1296
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:12,360
Back into the little black box eight feet underground in the cold and dark.

1297
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,900
At least it's here.

1298
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,900
Here Dave is your nirvana.

1299
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:15,920


1300
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,660
No longer to face the woes and travails of life.

1301
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,820
You may lie here in total slack and repose.

1302
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,020
Yes, this is the slack that Bob promised.

1303
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,840
An eternity perfectly aware.

1304
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,580
Inside a closed black box.

1305
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:41,000
Feeling the corruptigating worms shoo their way through your desiccated decaying flesh.

1306
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,760
And finally to feel your bones dissolve into powder.

1307
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,700
As the.

1308
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,940
Black box caves in.

1309
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,280
And you have achieved nirvana.

1310
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,080
And final enlightenment.

1311
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,080
As worm experiments.

1312
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:53,900
Thank you.

1313
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,400
It was a little shoe shine.

1314
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,200
It was a little shoe shine.

1315
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,820
It was a little shoe shine.

1316
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,840
It was a little man.

1317
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,460
Who ran a shoe shine stand.

1318
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,840
And every day the man would sweep the water from the busy street.

1319
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,000
Blessed, blessed oblivion

1320
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,060
He sailed in the center of one

1321
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,040
And anybody

1322
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,520
There was something in his face

1323
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,740
Loneliness could not erase

1324
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,040
No thoughts, no sensations

1325
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,500
No feelings, no recurrent women

1326
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,820
It's simply a moldy spatula

1327
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,300
And those little worms kind of itch a little bit

1328
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,340
as they crawl in and out.

1329
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,400
Oh, yeah.

1330
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,380
Just me and the worms.

1331
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,440
Just me and the worms.

1332
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,740
Like a broken pup

1333
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,260
He looked up from his cup

1334
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,820
Drank his morning coffee

1335
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,840
Wiped the dribble from his chin

1336
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,760
There is nothing

1337
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,580
There shall be nothing

1338
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,040
There is nothing

1339
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,680
Nada and nada and nada

1340
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,280
Except

1341
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,600
When his eyes met mine

1342
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,900
He made a little watch

1343
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,040
He came within an inch or two

1344
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,740
And then he whispered

1345
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,740
I hate you

1346
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,160
Our nada

1347
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,660
You aren't in nada

1348
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,580
Nada

1349
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:12,720
Nada

1350
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,560
Be thy name

1351
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,940
Our nada

1352
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,860
Who are the nada

1353
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,300
Nada be thy name

1354
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,320
The name be dust

1355
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,200
Thy feet be dust

1356
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,120
Thy eyes be dust

1357
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,940
Thy toes be dust

1358
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,840
Thy teeth be

1359
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,600
Need I need

1360
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,100
My feet

1361
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,600
Thy brain be dust

1362
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,460
Thy feet be dust

1363
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,760
Thy hands be dust as well

1364
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,000
You know it young

1365
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,860
You know it young

1366
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,700
You know it young

1367
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,480
Going to hell like

1368
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,180
Good

1369
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:38,780
Good

1370
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,520
Good

1371
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,120
Good

1372
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:42,720
Good

1373
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:01,960
How do they know? How do they know? How do they know? How do they know?

1374
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,260
Once I had some pets I let them starve to death

1375
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:15,140
It was a funny little monkey and a big whiny star bunny.

1376
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:22,100
They lived in little cages and sometimes in rages.

1377
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:29,500
I'd turn them upside down and drag my monkey all around.

1378
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,940
And drag my monkey all around.

1379
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,260
And drag my monkey all around.

1380
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,760
And drag my monkey all around.

1381
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,140
And drag my monkey all around.

1382
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,500
And drag my monkey all around.

1383
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,040
And drag my monkey all around.

1384
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,420
And drag my monkey all around.

1385
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,840
I dragged my monkey all around.

1386
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,420
You shouldn't have dragged me around like that, Dave.

1387
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,700
I dragged my m-

1388
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,260
All around

1389
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,440
I drag my monkey

1390
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,820
All around

1391
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,860
I drag my monkey

1392
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,160
All around

1393
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,700
Now ye shall be dragged around

1394
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,900
I drag my monkey

1395
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,820
All around

1396
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,020
Let that monkey drag his name around his cage

1397
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,960
Let him be dragged

1398
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,420
Let him all be dragged

1399
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,800
Let his armpit hairs be braided by a tired chimpanzee

1400
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,840
No?

1401
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,860
No?

1402
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,600
Yes.

1403
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,840
Contaminated.

1404
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,940
No!

1405
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,060
No!

1406
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,220
Contaminated.

1407
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,380
Don't do it, man.

1408
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,960
Contaminated.

1409
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,720
Contaminated.

1410
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,480
Folks, you've been listening to ESO Radio

1411
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,260
and, uh, and, uh...

1412
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,160
Contaminated.

1413
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,200
Einstein's Secret Orchestra with the...

1414
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,980
with, uh, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1415
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,200
Uh, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself and Michelle

1416
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,680
and special guest this week,

1417
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,180
the Reverend Ivan Stang and the Princess We Are Doe.

1418
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,480
Contaminated.

1419
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,780
Being contaminated.

1420
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,180
Contaminated.

1421
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,200
The song.

1422
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,220
Contamination.

1423
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:28,940
Contamination.

1424
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,280
Warning!

1425
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,860
Contamination.

1426
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:33,960
Contamination.

1427
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,360
Don't do it.

1428
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:34,560
Don't do it.

1429
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:34,560


1430
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,260
That's not a poem.

1431
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,240
It's a song.

1432
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,240


1433
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,240


1434
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,240


1435
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:36,240


1436
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,620
highlight churches that have suffered.

1437
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,420
Nada and nada and nada

1438
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,540
creeps in this petty nada

1439
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,560
to the last syllable of recorded nada.

1440
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,140
God, I have no pain.

1441
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,280
And all bearded English professors

1442
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,200
will quote nada and nada and nada.

1443
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,160
And they should be throttled.

1444
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,260
They should be throttled by giant beasts

1445
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,040
and their hands held under their necks.

1446
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,000
And as they cry out,

1447
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,480
are you looking at my neck?

1448
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,620
They should be struck down by the archangel Bill.

1449
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,760
Great Bill.

1450
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,620
The Bill genius must be lax.

1451
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,380
There is only one gene that will work, though.

1452
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,700
It's critical we get the gene.

1453
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,140
We must not let Bob get to the gene

1454
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,200
before the ceremony.

1455
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,200
The gene must still be a virgin

1456
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,300
when the time is nigh for its arisal.

1457
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,240
We need a virgin gene

1458
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,820
clean of any impurities.

1459
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,880
That's the only way this will work.

1460
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,240
Where can we find the untainted gene?

1461
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,260
The unsullied, pure DNA formulae?

1462
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,520
Where, man?

1463
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,160
I know where you can find it.

1464
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,140
Where?

1465
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,140
Where, man? Tell us!

1466
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,240
It's in my head.

1467
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,480
It's in the woods.

1468
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,800
Woods are like worms.

1469
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,700
And they crawl in your brain.

1470
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,820
I think he's right.

1471
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,180
And they wiggle around.

1472
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,200
I think he does have it.

1473
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,940
And then...

1474
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,960
I think he has the perfect,

1475
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,560
undetaminated...

1476
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:05,660
It's solid, man.

1477
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,240
...crawling brain.

1478
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,360
Completely crushed gene.

1479
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,420
It's like the helium and hydrogen in the stars

1480
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,280
is in your brain, man.

1481
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,160
It's true.

1482
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,580
This man's brain is so densely compacted

1483
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,840
that the interior of it is like a dwarf star.

1484
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,580
We've found what we need.

1485
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,160
He's the Gene Genie.

1486
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,160
He wasn't a pathetic loser after all.

1487
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,240
He was the one.

1488
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,340
I saw God.

1489
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,560
Dave was the one.

1490
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,220
After all his tortures and tormented turns,

1491
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,800
it turned out that the Gene,

1492
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,780
the perfect, unselled, untainted Gene,

1493
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,720
was in fact buried inside Lonesome Cowboy Dave's head!

1494
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,840
Praise Bob! The world is safe!

1495
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
Remove the Gene.

1496
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,120
This will make Dr. Von Neumann very happy, Reverend Stan.

1497
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,620
This will make Dr. Von Neumann very happy.

1498
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,520
We have retrieved the Gene

1499
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,440
from inside the head of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1500
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,400
He's dead now.

1501
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,620
And we, the conspiracy of overlords,

1502
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:13,060
disguised as rebels against the conspiracy of overlords,

1503
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,320
have once again won.

1504
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,220
The world is indeed our oyster.

1505
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,220
The world is our oyster, one might say.

1506
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,120
Fearless clam or some sort of shellfish.

1507
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,940
We all enjoy shellfish.

1508
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,460
Let's have some more, shall we?

1509
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,080
Yes, let's slip a few more raw planets down our throats.

1510
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,920
We have no love, we have no heart,

1511
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,980
we have no air, water, we have everything we need.

1512
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:53,880
Is that Dave Corpse?

1513
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,340
Mumbling something again?

1514
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,720
I thought we removed the perfect Gene from his head.

1515
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,780
I thought he was dead now.

1516
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,940
I told you before,

1517
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,940
do not leave the corpse dead.

1518
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,840
If it does not become putrescent,

1519
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,300
the experiment will not work and he will come back to life.

1520
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,580
Oh my God, look.

1521
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,080
Chop off its head and stuff its mouth with garlic.

1522
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,680
It's too late, it's too late.

1523
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,340
He's already eaten all the garlic and chopped off his own head.

1524
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,440
He's coming back to life.

1525
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,920
And here he is, Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar.

1526
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,140
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Corruptigating Worms.

1527
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,260
There can only be one.

1528
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,220
There can only be one.

1529
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,720
One.

1530
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:43,080
As Dave, the resurrected Dave, without the perfect Gene,

1531
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,040
and with his head now hollowed out, emptied and expanded.

1532
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,560
And his Corpus Callosum, a perfect conical shape,

1533
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,280
so that we can impact it with all the necessary documents.

1534
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,800
He now freed from his tasks,

1535
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,120
he rides off into the forest.

1536
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,140
On the sunset, on his tricycle.

1537
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,300
Side-settled, wearing that funny conical hat,

1538
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,720
thinking somehow he has made it.

1539
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,160
But in fact, it's made him.

1540
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,100
Is that a good thing?

1541
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,960
Can you pick it up?

1542
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:31,200
I don't know.

1543
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:32,980
I don't know.

1544
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:33,600


1545
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,280
I don't know.

1546
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,380
Ever feel like you should have just said no

1547
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,500
to that magic carpet ride to Electric Lady Land?

1548
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,740
Ever feel so heavy?

1549
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,620
Ever feel like your thighs are so sick,

1550
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,040
your muscles are weak,

1551
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,880
and your neck is too blotchy?

1552
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,040
Ever feel disconnected and completely alone?

1553
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,360
Ever feel corrugated worms

1554
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,020
burrowing through your follicles?

1555
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,300
Well, if you have,

1556
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,300
we can't help you a bit.

1557
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,420
But we can help you get your mind off of it.

1558
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,360
So just write for free information

1559
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,160
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1560
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,680
Got that pencil ready?

1561
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,380
You can find out everything you need to know

1562
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,340
about how to make money off of your corruptigating worms

1563
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,980
by writing to b-b-b-b-bob at...

1564
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,480
P.O. Box...

1565
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,240
140306.

1566
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,640
That's P.O. Box, 140306, Dallas.

1567
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:48,940
Tix.

1568
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:49,940
Tix.

1569
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:50,560
Sis.

1570
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,520
Seven, five, two, one.

1571
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,460
Four.

1572
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,600
Okay.

1573
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:56,660


1574
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:56,660


1575
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:56,840
Thank you.
