I'm the first yet he will go and will pour his seed upon the earth

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:20,340
and there will erupt a grievous sore bleeding out of the darkness a prayer for the dying

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,900

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,240


32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,240


33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,480
pills

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,140
pay money

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,860
The end has come.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,000
Look to the west.

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,640
Into the wastelands from thence cometh the evil.

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,860
Send us a sword in these troubled times.

39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,400
To drive the conspiracy.

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,300
To destroy the conspiracy.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,320
To drive it from our hearts and from our lands.

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,520
A shadow has fallen upon the land.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,660
A shadow has fallen upon the way of the righteous.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,580
Death's pride has lifted the veil of Armageddon.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,660
For Bob's sweet nuclear kiss.

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,300
His promise is revealed.

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
The heavens break the seals.

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,380
God's writ the first scroll.

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,320
It sets your foot.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,200
Standing in time, two worlds collide.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,920
Break the numbers.

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
Break the chains.

53
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,100
There's nowhere to run.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,280
There's nowhere to hide.

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,080
Face the torture.

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,680
Face the pain.

57
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,420
Ride the train into the fire.

58
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,100
Piss on the father. Piss on the son.

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
Lady Dobbs.

60
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,780
I see the end.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,640
To take the children.

62
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,060
The saucer is the same one.

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,520
They're coming to set us free.

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,260
Bob, take my hand.

65
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,500
Take my money. Take my money.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,480
Take me through the door.

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,740
Bob, I understand.

68
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,280
I'm but one yeti who knows the slack the conspiracy has ripped off.

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
Your cries of anguish.

70
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,640
Your cries of pain.

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,200
They shall rain upon the land as the billions meet their fate.

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,020
Hate descends upon the land.

73
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,260
Hate descends upon the fortress.

74
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,500
Hate descends upon the souls surrounding us one.

75
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,400
One hate is the answer.

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,060
One hate is alive.

77
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,500
One hate is the answer.

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,500


79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,140
Hate lives through the yeti.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,060
Hate cuts through the bullshit.

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,940
Do you believe in the power and glory?

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,940
The end is soon to pass.

83
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,280
And hell now surrounds us.

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
And hell on earth awaits you.

85
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,540
Even the innocent should feast on poisoned flesh.

86
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,780
The door awaits you.

87
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,760
Call it.

88
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,300
To burn your fucking ass down.

89
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,500
Give us the power.

90
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,500


91
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,500


92
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,500


93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,500


94
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,860
We're spiritual strong-arm robbers.

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,340
I've seen the arrow on the door post that says this land is condemned.

96
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,220
All the way from Boston, Massachusetts to Jerusalem.

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,120
There's nowhere to run.

98
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,660
There's nowhere to hide.

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,260
Let the end times roll.

100
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,540
Let the end times roll.

101
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,860
Let the end times roll.

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:45,940
Let the end times roll.

103
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:45,940


104
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,840
Oh yes dear friends, let the end times roll.

105
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,500
That was Dr. Katadnick.

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,900
Dr. Katadnick, the first American legume at the final DeVival in Boston.

107
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,760
An incredible apocalyptic rant.

108
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,140
And friends, we have so much, so much more.

109
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,380
We have been burning our way across America with DeVivals.

110
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll be bringing you tapes tonight of Brother Cleve in Boston.

111
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,140

112
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,980
Incredible climactic preaching in Boston.

The Cleveland show with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,180

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,500
And even Winter Star recordings with the American League.

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,500


119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,500


120
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,500


121
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,860
With Reverend Glepo and Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

And Susie the Floozy and WREK.

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,200
My God, my God, man.

126
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,120
There is no escape.

127
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,640
There is no turning back.

128
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,820
It's only 62 days to X Day.

129
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Now is the time.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,980
If not us, who? If not now, when?

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,880
Praise Bob, Hell Connie, and the Hell King.

132
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,980
We'll be right back.

133
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,900
What?

134
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,420

.

136
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:37,660

00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:40,700
.

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:07:20,520


140
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:50,520


141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:20,520


142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:50,520

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,520


152
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,420
Yes dear friends, we are listening to Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

153
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,340
Recorded live, thanks to Mike, the sound man.

154
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,380
At the Euclid Tavern.

155
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,500
A couple of weeks ago, Mike was playing there.

156
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,500


157
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:28,200
my time, a couple of months ago your time, a thousand universes away for the unsaved

158
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,120
in the post-X-Day times, if anyone has tape reporters or computers left to hear this with.

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Um,

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
Tonight, one week from...

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
On April 16th...

162
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,920
At the Euclid Tavern...

163
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,460
Euclid Tavern...

164
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,940
And that will be the last ever Cleveland subgenius divival.

165
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,360
The last ever?

166
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,960
Yes, with Reverend Ivan Stein...

167
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,580
With Reverend Ivan Stein...

168
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,540
And...

169
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,440
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

170
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,860
And the secret orchestra of Einstein.

171
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Yep.

172
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,660
Do you remember when we used to sit in the backyard with Lolly Lovegarden?

173
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,780
How could I ever forget?

174
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,240
Do you remember that song?

175
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,180
She's the strong mother.

176
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh, sure, yeah.

177
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,360
I know the one you're going to be talking about, too.

178
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,700
I can feel it.

179
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,560
We used to sing a song

180
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,100
About love in the afternoon

181
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,320
It was you and me, baby

182
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
And Lolly Lovegarden

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,160
And a picture of Bob the Baboon

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,340
Yeah, yeah

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,120
Yeah, yeah

186
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,580
Yeah, yeah

187
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,580
Once upon a time

188
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,820
Wasn't so long ago

189
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,520
I had you, baby, with a mint julep in my hand

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,080
And you said

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,280
Oh, yeah

192
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,180
Oh, oh

193
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,080
Come back, Lolly

194
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, oh, oh

195
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


196
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


197
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


198
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


199
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


200
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


201
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


202
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


203
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


204
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,500


205
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,460
Come back, Lolly

206
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,880
Come back, Lolly

207
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,180
Oh, yeah

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Oh, yeah, I remember

209
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:45,440
Oh, yeah, I remember

210
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,900
A snare drum's needed, I'm afraid, to start a thrilling street parade.

211
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,380
Oh, yeah, I remember

212
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,740
I remember

213
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,580
Oh, yeah, yeah

214
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,380
Oh, yeah, yeah

215
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,860
Oh, yeah, yeah

216
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,280
Oh, yeah, I remember

217
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,600
Oh, yeah, yeah

218
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,740
I remember

219
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,340
Oh, yeah, wow

220
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,520
Oh, yeah, yeah

221
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,260
Oh, yeah, yeah

222
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,760
Oh, yeah, yeah

223
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:15,780
Oh, yeah, I remember

224
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:15,780


225
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:15,780


226
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,820
Oh, yeah, yeah

227
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,880
Well, it once was a man's world

228
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,120
The world's greatest salesman

229
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,660
And he had to find some way

230
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,780
To take the shackles off our feet

231
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Yeah, but oh, now he's gone

232
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,820
I'm out of to the cause

233
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,280
But there's my load

234
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,360
And it's coming again

235
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,020
Who knew that the first shot

236
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,100
Was gonna be the last shot

237
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,660
But he's got a hard driving pipe

238
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,880
That can't smoke all through the night

239
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
Oh, until our happy day

240
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,480
We can get on that drink and say

241
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,260
About this man alone

242
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,200
And it's coming again

243
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,420
He can save us from the men in black

244
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,500
With just one shot from his mighty side

245
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,620
If only he could make it back

246
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,080
He can save us from the men in black

247
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,500
From the land of the dead

248
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Oh, until our happy day

249
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,520
We can get on that drink and say

250
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,340
About this man alone

251
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
And it's coming again

252
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,580
I know we can make it

253
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,140
Without him we can't take it

254
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,060
The only reason I'm not mine

255
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,680
To the big boys and the whips

256
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,640
And we got to act like one

257
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,860
They never find learnin'

258
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,980
To stop us, baby

259
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,020
The only thing we can do

260
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,360
How are we gonna survive

261
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,220
And last forever

262
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,500
Is sayin', they said

263
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,500


264
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,700
But we got to do it

265
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,320
That's why we stillady

266
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,200
In our hearts

267
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,140
For every word

268
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,140


269
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,560
Bob is my note, and he's coming again.

270
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,960
If we don't want an excess upon us,

271
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,940
then we need Bob to be on us.

272
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,220
Bob is my note.

273
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,340
Bob is my note.

274
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,760
Bob is my note, and he's coming again.

275
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,320
Until the day that he goes back, it'll be a world without Zack.

276
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,060
All right, Lyon.

277
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,640
Cleave is feeling it.

278
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,960
I feel good.

279
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,800
I've been doing the Bibles in this town since 1982,

280
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,040
and this is the finest, finest group I have ever seen

281
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,200
in all of my motherfucking years.

282
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,460
It's a beautiful thing.

283
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,260
If you don't want the excess upon us,

284
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,040
then you need Bob to be on us.

285
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,680
Do you understand the implications of the term there?

286
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,880
July 5, 1998 is coming closer, motherfuckers.

287
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,500
It is coming.

288
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,280
It is coming.

289
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,500
It is coming.

290
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,580
And you know what that means?

291
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,140
It means Bob's bladder is full.

292
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,460
Bob's bladder is full.

293
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,500
And he is going to pee like the motherfucker that he is.

294
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,480
I say, Bob, let it rain.

295
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,700
Let it rain.

296
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,940
Let it rain.

297
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,040
Let it rain.

298
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,040


299
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,080
Let me feel the waters.

300
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,740
Let me feel the waters.

301
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,900
from your holy bladder let let connie just try to sit there and

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:56,140
let it run all over my face i can't wait to feel it i know my life it's gonna be a beautiful thing

303
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,680
it will save us from the men in black now many of you might not know that the three

304
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,340
stooges made a short subject entitled men in black and within that short subject

305
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:20,060
they are three doctors maybe they are doctors for bob yeah but whenever the mighty called dr howard

306
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:27,240
dr vine dr howard comes over the intercom they have to answer it just like the conspiracy is

307
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,600
calling you they are the men in black the conspiracy that is calling you

308
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,580
take

309
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,320
and you and making you whipped into shape down like a like a dirty dog

310
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,100
it's a sad sad situation but just like the three stooges at the end of men in black

311
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,500
when that little transistor was jumping up and down on the floor and they pull out their guns

312
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:03,000
and blam blam blam into the that is what we will do to the conspiracy

313
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:03,760
yeah

314
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,600
i've been a card carry member of the church of the subgenius since 1981 i believe that's correct amen

315
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,820

316
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,220

318
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,120
and i personally am glad

319
00:19:42,320 --> 00:20:02,100
affected by the Nextangan

320
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,360
It just makes me puke.

321
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,200
Woo!

322
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,380
But soon the vomit will have wiped away.

323
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,080
It will be in the glory, the glory of Dobbs Sound.

324
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,980
I'll be working in room three.

325
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,400
We'll have the nice little piano and organ combo going there.

326
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,280
Please stop by. Have a drink.

327
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,160
It'll be delightful.

328
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,860
The best thing in Dobbs Sound is it's open bar all the time.

329
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,480
Open bar of whatever you want.

330
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,360
The bucket of pills is never empty.

331
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,620
The bottle is never empty.

332
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,460
The perfect squid is never empty.

333
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,800
It is always full.

334
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,380
It is always full of love.

335
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,340
It is always just full of ooze.

336
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,620
Squid! Yeah!

337
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,060
Nice!

338
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,140
Yeah!

339
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,920
Give us your ooze, bro!

340
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,280
Hallelujah!

341
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm going to get a beer.

342
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,200
I'm not going to ask you for any more money.

343
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,060
You don't need money.

344
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,180
I don't need money.

345
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,460
The end times are here.

346
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,380
You can't buy your way into Dobbs Sound.

347
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,700
Why not?

348
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,700
Why not?

349
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,340
Because it doesn't take big boy money to buy your $30 membership.

350
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,800
No, it takes pure subgenius dollars.

351
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,040
Now, maybe they might have a picture of Andrew Jackson and whoever,

352
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,440
George Washington on them.

353
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,960
But if you anoint them properly before you put them into the envelope and send them off

354
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,120
to the sacred P.O. box, 1-4-0-3-0-6, Dallas, Texas, 7254, 75214.

355
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,420
I don't mail that much stuff anymore.

356
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,880
I get email.

357
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,780
He knows you do that as far as having a short-term memory.

358
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,660
Then all will be saved and all will be glorious, glorious.

359
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,300
And I look forward to seeing you all, brothers and sisters.

360
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
It's a glorious day.

361
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,020


362
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,140
The glory that will be Dobbs Sound Praise 5.

363
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,020
That's a squirt.

364
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,740
Squirt.

365
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,060
Hallelujah.

366
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,340
Friends, I'll keep it short and sweet here.

367
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:14,880
Amen.

368
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,620
Keep going.

369
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,780
Thank you very much.

370
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,640
But in closing, I would just like to prepare the litany.

371
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,280
And if any of you know the words, please join in prayer with me.

372
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,680
Amen.

373
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,280
Get on in.

374
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,040
Let's get into it.

375
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,820
Amen.

376
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,440
Okay.

377
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,440


378
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,440


379
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,440


380
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,440


381
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,700
S-A-W.

382
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,160
The S-A-W.

383
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,000
He is for the suckers who live all around.

384
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,420
U is for you.

385
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,560
They're always putting you down.

386
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,340
B is Bob.

387
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,180
He gives us our bread.

388
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,380
G is for the guns they put to our heads.

389
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,240
E is for the unit they want you to become.

390
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,700
N is for your nuts.

391
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,040
I'm a subgenius motherfucker and I ain't no fucking clown.

392
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,260
I ain't no fucking clown.

393
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:52,780
And some of you may wonder, now I'm going to depart from what I usually say here.

394
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,920
Oh no.

395
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,260
Like I said, there are some subgeniuses that are mutants and kind of, you know, they're

396
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,260


397
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,260


398
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,260


399
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,260


400
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,260


401
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,260


402
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:09,160
not funny looking, socially inept, clumsy, absent-minded, stupid, or too smart for their

403
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,420
own good, neurotic, whatnot.

404
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,560
And probably almost all of those things describe me and quite a few of my fellow doctors and

405
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,620
doctoresses in the church hierarchy.

406
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,580
And there was a time when we were as miserable as the most miserable person here.

407
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,580
But guess what?

408
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,260
We were not.

409
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,840
God damn it, but Bob Dobbs wasn't lying.

410
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:39,020
I personally am getting more pussy and better pussy than I ever got in my whole goddamn

411
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,640
life.

412
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,120
And I thank you Bob.

413
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,680
I thank you Bob.

414
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,880
I thank you Bob.

415
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,820
And not just me, Jesus Christ, my partner Jesus Christ too.

416
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,360
They're trying him dry.

417
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,780
Pope Sterno Doc is being trying dry.

418
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,680
Pope Angus is being trying dry.

419
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,040
That's with all the doctors, friends.

420
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,260
All the doctors, friends.

421
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,880
And the yourself, and all the doctors.

422
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,960
Sure, Connie's winning.

423
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,620
She's collected more of the juice than Bob is.

424
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,540
And, uh, praise Connie.

425
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,840
Praise Connie.

426
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,680
And I think about these, fragrance.

427
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,080
We don't want anyone to leave here unsatisfied.

428
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,660
Even if your idea of satisfaction is for everybody to just leave you all alone.

429
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,820
I kinda like that myself.

430
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,500
As I said though, the miracle of that man, Bob.

431
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,260
And that couldn't be more.

432
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,260


433
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,120
You know, all those other messiahs, they're always breathing down your neck.

434
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,500
Did you sin this week?

435
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,340
Did you make enough money?

436
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,440
Why didn't you tell that person off?

437
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,100
Did you kiss my ass enough?

438
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,020
Bob doesn't care about any of that shit,

439
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:48,520
because God is the one personal Savior that you can be truly alone with.

440
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,620
You can be alone with Bob.

441
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,400
Praise Bob.

442
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Praise Bob.

443
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,820
Dr. Howe, I think we'll introduce the next guest.

444
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Praise Mahogany Rush.

445
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,280
Praise Mahogany Rush, for some reason.

446
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,280
This is the final speech of the subgenius show as it was that night.

447
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,840
In its strange and metamorphic career,

448
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,020
where in a sense it was all things to all people.

449
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,280
At all times, in all countries, on all channels,

450
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,020
not just channel 18 like that other wimpy God in Texas,

451
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,000
but no, all.

452
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,480
All channels.

453
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,680
Isn't that already supposed to have happened?

454
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,640
Well, on March 25th, which is also the day that the man who was offering to donate his organs

455
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,660
is scheduled to die,

456
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
God will appear on channel 18 on all channels.

457
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,600
I mean, all of those channels, all over the world,

458
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,580
and speak in all languages at once.

459
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,740
And then on March 25th, I mean, I'm sorry, March 31st,

460
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,200
God will appear in Garland, Texas and do various things like

461
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,820
speak in all languages, shake all hands,

462
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,980
walk through all walls.

463
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,500
And then apparently there's a third, a tertiary level,

464
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,840
where they go to Gary, Indiana and board their spaceships.

465
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,840
Their pleasure saucers.

466
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,840
So many different ships are coming.

467
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,600
It actually seems like maybe something's happening.

468
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,580
Hal, as we sit here on this hill in Berkeley,

469
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,820
we can see various spaceships in their holding patterns above Earth

470
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,860
as the various little crackpot religions all come true.

471
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,980
Well, you remember, it is said it is to be a day of confusion.

472
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,960
And many of these spacecraft may be false messengers.

473
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,740
False conveyances.

474
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,660
And I'll carry you the wrong way, the wrong place.

475
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,140
Come on, our pleasure craft.

476
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Only our saucers, our contactee aliens.

477
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,500
There's a little onan running from saucer to saucer

478
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,580
trying to figure out which one is the genuine saucer.

479
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:42,920
Of course.

480
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,820
I don't know these aliens.

481
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Other aliens may be great.

482
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:46,980
I don't know.

483
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,680
But I do know that it's a crapshoot.

484
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,780
You might as well stay with the subgenius contactee alien.

485
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,380
Ah, well.

486
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,100
You know, you can give good.

487
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,580
You can give good advice.

488
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,840
But you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.

489
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,520
Such fools.

490
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,620
I'm just going to stay with what I know.

491
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,620
You know, old monster movies, that's what's going to happen.

492
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,060
Big monsters will show up.

493
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,000
Flying saucers.

494
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,880
Giant black and white crashes of endless cars off of endless cliffs

495
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
and endless beaches blowing up into flames.

496
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,760
It'll be a lot like the J-Man.

497
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,180
Forever.

498
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,300
I'll praise the J-Man.

499
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,780
Yeah.

500
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,060
Their Under the World sequence was pretty gorgeous.

501
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,720
Not to mention the wonderful scenes where they test the rock and roll

502
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,900
and the buildings break up and die.

503
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,300
And the buildings are actually full of dirt, ladies and gentlemen.

504
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,660
I'd like to see that again.

505
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:43,920
R1.

506
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,780
And while this all worlds R1 is being chanted,

507
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,300
I zoom in on a young lady who's staring intently at Ivan Stang.

508
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,280
Wow, I must see that.

509
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,020
And hold that for about a minute.

510
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,900
And then I slowly back back up.

511
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,360
And her beautiful gray eyes are watching.

512
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,080
The diminutive Stang and his metastophelian little beard.

513
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,360
It's a pretty great shot.

514
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,800
What?

515
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,220
Oh dear.

516
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,600
Uh oh, looks like we've got a scratch in the show here.

517
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,400
Yeah, this is really going to endear me with Janer now.

518
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,300
I think there's, here let me see if I can click this.

519
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,360
Oh look out Janer, how's.

520
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,520
Markle noises and vomitous upjuggings and uprising.

521
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,520
What?

522
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,340
I'm sure he didn't mean that.

523
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:28,960
I'm sure he didn't mean that in Phineas.

524
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,940
Phineas isn't Janer.

525
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,880
I don't know what happened there.

526
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,660
The computer went crazy.

527
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,540
He didn't actually throw up.

528
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,360
He only felt as if he was going to.

529
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm sure glad that show's over.

530
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,320
Still you have to admit it was a remarkable occasion.

531
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,600
Now it's a better show, huh?

532
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,020
You mean you're a sea-gwaying to Seattle?

533
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,680
No, I didn't cut Seattle yet.

534
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,840
I'll have to cut out all the bad subgenius words.

535
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,300
Here we go.

536
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,220
We're boiling them down into a kind of goob that people out there smoke.

537
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,020
That probably can call a drum.

538
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,160
Friends, friends.

539
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,480
Nose.

540
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,420
Nose.

541
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,140
Do you pee?

542
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,840
Nose.

543
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,500
Nose.

544
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,480
Do you pee?

545
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,300
How many of you pee and raise your hands?

546
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,000
About half.

547
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm peeing right now.

548
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,080
How many of you raise your hands when asked to raise your hands?

549
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,040
We have ascertained that about half of the people here urinate.

550
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,560
You're the ones I'm talking to.

551
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,440
If you pee, you're sure to be interested in this.

552
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,040
I'm not.

553
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,320
I'm not.

554
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


555
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


556
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


557
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


558
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


559
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


560
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


561
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


562
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


563
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


564
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


565
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,320


566
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,780
You know, I'm not Jane or Hyperclete, but I am an incredible simulation.

567
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,000
You know, some people say that all this subgenius stuff is just a big joke.

568
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,080
That all this Bob stuff is just a big joke.

569
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,520
Oh, the subgenius church?

570
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,560
Isn't that that joke cult?

571
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,500
Oh, the church of the subgenius, isn't that that parody religion?

572
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,900
A joke!

573
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,200
A joke!

574
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,860
My God!

575
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,120
My God, a joke!

576
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,040
Oh, yeah!

577
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,060
Oh, it's a joke!

578
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,540
Oh, yeah!

579
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,120
Oh, yeah!

580
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
Go back to sleep, baby!

581
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,920
Go back to sleep, Bob!

582
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Oh, yeah, it's just a big joke, isn't it?

583
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,440
Oh, yeah, it's just a joke!

584
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,300
Help me, somebody!

585
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,500
My light's on fire!

586
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,600
Oh, my God!

587
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,600
Oh, my God, it's just a joke!

588
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,360
Oh, I got...

589
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,160
Oh, honey, that alien mothership just turned New York City into an incredible slag heap!

590
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,240
Oh, my God, it's just a big joke, isn't it?

591
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,940
Well, I guess on July 5th, we're gonna deliver the fucking punchline!

592
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:27,920
Great!

593
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,020
Great!

594
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


595
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


596
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


597
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


598
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


599
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


600
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


601
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


602
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


603
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


604
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,020


605
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:39,420
But you know, friends, some of those surprise faces are not gonna be those of the conspiracy

606
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:47,380
dupes, the pinks, the glorks, the butt-splitters, the Barbies in cans.

607
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,000
Y'all, they're gonna be some of the most surprised people, they're gonna be those of so-called

608
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,020
subgeniuses, you know the kind that I mean, Mr. O, O, Mr. O, Mr. O, Mr. O.

609
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,020


610
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,020


611
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,020


612
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:05,160
I have a five t-shirt, but I keep it in my closet because I don't want to look like a geek wearing it, subgenius.

613
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Oh, I'm going to send in my $30 for my membership when I get a little bit more money for my pink job, subgenius.

614
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,160
Mr. O, X Day Celebration.

615
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,060
It sounds like a good idea, but I have to work that day, subgenius.

616
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,820
These people are going to be the most surprised of all.

617
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:37,260
You know, it says in the book of Meronicus that Bob spews these people from his mouth like a Danny Thomas spit tape.

618
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,440
But he still cashes their checks.

619
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:48,980
Imagine the looks on their faces when the first spaceships arrive at 7 a.m. on July 5th of this year.

620
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,960
Oh, you mean it wasn't a joke?

621
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,340
Oh.

622
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,040
Yeah.

623
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,040


624
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,240
You mean there is a Bob?

625
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, you mean it wasn't just some sort of art thing?

626
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,860
Is it a little too late to send in my check?

627
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,580
Is it too late to send in for my membership?

628
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,320
Is it too late to send away for those phineas starco tapes I've been meaning to send away for for the last three years?

629
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,540
Well, I'm afraid it's just being a little too late, friend.

630
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,020
But how many times have you said to yourself?

631
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,740
How many times have you said to yourself, I'll buy those tapes tomorrow?

632
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,500
How many times have you said to yourself, I'll buy that t-shirt tomorrow?

633
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,820
How many times have you said to yourself, I'll get right with Bob tomorrow?

634
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,040
Well dear friends, what if there is no tomorrow?

635
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,620
What if there is no tomorrow?

636
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,340
But I don't want to be negative.

637
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,160
I don't want to be negative.

638
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,960
That's why I've made these 10 things that you can do to get right with Bob before it's too late.

639
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,280
The number one thing you can do is to send money to Bob!

640
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,720
Bob.

641
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,940
Praise Bob!

642
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,480
Praise Bob!

643
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,980
The number two thing you can do if you haven't already quit your job,

644
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,160
quit your job and slack off!

645
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,960
I find that if you're still employed by July 4th,

646
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,900
a nice thing you can do to just sort of grease the wheels with the exes

647
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,940
is to kind of, well, make a blood sacrifice of your pink box.

648
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,760
I feel that on July 4th there will be so many fireworks

649
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,960
that will mask the screams of your pink box

650
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,020
and this will just sort of be like a $20 bill

651
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,160
that you can slip to the maitre d' to get on the good table at the sub-junius restaurant.

652
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,520
The number three thing you can do is send money to Bob!

653
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,100
That's right, praise Bob!

654
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,320
Praise Bob!

655
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,780
The number four thing you can do is one week before X-Day, stop sleeping.

656
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,180
Do not sleep one week up to X-Day.

657
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,840
That way even if the exes don't come,

658
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,420
you'll be hallucinating so actively it won't matter.

659
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,600
What are we up to? Number five, four, I've lost track.

660
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,300
Number four.

661
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,180
Number five, five!

662
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,620
Number five thing you can do is kill Bob!

663
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,240
Kill Bob!

664
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,440
Now some of you might say, kill Bob?

665
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,780
What are you talking about? He's gonna save the world!

666
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,000
Well, Bob just might screw the whole thing up.

667
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,940
This could be your last chance to take him out.

668
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,960
In fact, contrary to, uh, contrary to Mr. Stang who stole my ID,

669
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,800
I was gonna actually do that sermon. This is the ultimate sermon I have.

670
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,760
Why don't you just kill everybody named Bob?

671
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Kill everybody that you come across.

672
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,880
Smoke and a pipe.

673
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,260
Go down to the New York Stock Exchange and wear an AK-47.

674
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,740
Kill the Hanson brothers.

675
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,120
Kill the Spock girls.

676
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,420
Kill Barry L. Manson.

677
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,220
Kill everybody.

678
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,920
Don't die by the next day.

679
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,980
Hell, they're all gonna die the next day anyway.

680
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,760
You can have Cindy Crawford as your own personal sex slave in first class if you buy some genius goods.

681
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,020
Don't be stuck down in steerage and coached last in line at some very skid-squid gang.

682
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,480
You know, friends, it's not just a big joke.

683
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,820
You know, they laughed at Noah when he was building the ark.

684
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,420
They laughed.

685
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,440
They laughed at Lot and his wife when they told him Sodom and Gomorrah was gonna burn to the ground.

686
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,520
They laughed at Jerry Lewis when he played the nutty professor.

687
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,200
They laughed at the Heaven's Gate cult members.

688
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,520
Okay, maybe they're a bad example, but the point is...

689
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,140
Come next day, we'll be the ones who'll be laughing!

690
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,200
Praise Bob!

691
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,680
Thank you, Phineas Narco.

692
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:11,180
You know, it takes you back, kind of, to think that 15 years ago that humble radio show Dr. Narco was talking about

693
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,860
had its first beginnings in the primordial slime of Berkeley, California.

694
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,560
But we call it something else. It's not called the subgenius show.

695
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,700
It's called, uh, Puzzling Evidence.

696
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,080
Hey!

697
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,560
It's called that.

698
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,100
Well, uh, mm, eh, uh, uh...

699
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,160
No, I didn't cut Seattle yet. I'll have to cut out all the bad subgenius words.

700
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,580
Here we go. We're boiling them down into a kind of goob that people out there smoke.

701
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,520
It's the bubbling cauldron of the old bag.

702
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,680
Right now, I just gotta go to the bathroom and, uh, get back on the show, I guess.

703
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,140
Which is a dismal, rainy, cold, foggy show.

704
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,300
Hmm, well, that's a... I don't know.

705
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,160
Here go the subgeniuses.

706
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,740
Kinda comfortable.

707
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,460
Trudging up the hill in Portland back to their $5 a night dive.

708
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,280
Poor saps. I might help them, but, uh, but what for?

709
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,400
There goes Reverend Haloff. It was a 160-night dive for them.

710
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,740
Just make it over for them, ultimately.

711
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,720
I'll, uh, I'll see them in the morning. Maybe throw them a crust of cash.

712
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,920
Frying up some eggs here in the KPFA kitchen.

713
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,740
Mmm, this is your brain on eggs.

714
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,580
Oh, the coffee? You got that, too?

715
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,120
Brain and eggs. Wow. My favorite at 5 a.m.

716
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,020
This is your brain's mom, a chicken.

717
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,800
How'd that happen?

718
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,720
Oops. Okay, well, some say the egg came first. Others say the chicken came before the egg.

719
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,780
You want some chicken and your eggs?

720
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,440
To get to the other side.

721
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,080
Fried the chicken.

722
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,260
Yeah, all the way to the chicken.

723
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,280
That's what you were just saying.

724
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:06,420
We take this ring as a symbol of the holy and straight of marriage, and as well as the pole going deep into the hole of evil.

725
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,880
By the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dodds and in compliance with the laws of state and God and nature,

726
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,180
I now pronounce you man-wives of Marquis Blabant-Romain for the next 24 hours.

727
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,860
You must—this is the romantic part—you must now kiss each other.

728
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,040
Yee!

729
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,760
I know, I know.

730
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,940
But you'll get lucky, sir.

731
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:42,260
You are now newly authorized and excused for sexual companies of any perversely faithful nature for a period of 24 hours.

732
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,640
That includes jacking off.

733
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,720
And the next 24 hours, 20 hours.

734
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:56,380
And if you don't consummate this marriage, you make a mockery, a sick mockery of the sacred institution of marriage.

735
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,600
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, amen, amen, and a bunch of yens.

736
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,400
Praise God.

737
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,860
Hail God.

738
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,500
Look out! God is right behind you.

739
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,680
Take me down.

740
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,900
Oh, take me down.

741
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,880
It's been so long now.

742
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,440
Take me down.

743
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,340
Huh?

744
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,020
I'm still dreaming of you, Lolly.

745
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,620
I'm still crying.

746
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,020
What was your last name again?

747
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,140
What was your last name?

748
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,560
Just saying, man.

749
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,140
I know you and I know you are kind.

750
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,660
No, no, no.

751
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,500
I don't know.

752
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,020
I don't know.

753
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,200
I don't know.

754
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,160
I don't know.

755
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:00,940
I don't know.

756
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,160
I don't know.

757
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,220


758
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,820
I don't know.

759
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,160
I don't know.

760
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,140
Ready? Let's go.

761
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,820
Move your shoulders.

762
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,840
Move the head.

763
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,800
Move your elbows.

764
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,780
Travel.

765
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,260
Use your own style of moving.

766
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,900
Can you travel backwards?

767
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,020
Hold off on the seating.

768
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,520
Hold off on it.

769
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,580
Pope Meyer's been seized.

770
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,640
He's been seized.

771
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,860
He's been seized.

772
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,240
Tonight, we have seen many unprecedented things,

773
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,620
but every subgenius,

774
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,560
every subgenius here,

775
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,440
every subgenius here will tell you something, children.

776
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,300
They will tell you there's a tradition in the church

777
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,800
that is rock solid,

778
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,200
and that tradition is

779
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,080
when the pope finishes preaching, he leaves.

780
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
How many of these great preachers

781
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
have seen the pope this late in any divine?

782
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,200
Never do.

783
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,240
Never, children.

784
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,980
And before I get to my main point here,

785
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,720
there's something I forgot that I want to say,

786
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,020
and that is tonight,

787
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,660
and the spirit of tonight,

788
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,040
and the vibe that is in all of us tonight

789
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,160
would not be possible

790
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,280
without a couple of absent preachers.

791
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,340
And I've got to tell you, children,

792
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,780
when I see the Reverend Cleveland Dunham Duncan

793
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,020
be obsessed with the spirit of God,

794
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,900
it makes me feel,

795
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,340
it makes me weep,

796
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,340
it makes me cry,

797
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,380


798
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,220
and I remember a great preacher

799
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,860
who cannot be here tonight,

800
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,260
St. Janer Hyperclete, children.

801
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,320
Who can't walk?

802
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,240
Children, usually I go home after I preach

803
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,880
because when the spirit of God moves through me,

804
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,480
I can't bear to see anything else.

805
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,180
I have to go home and pass right out.

806
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,020
But children, I want to tell you,

807
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,300
1981,

808
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,280
I got off that plane from London,

809
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,400
I rode that taxi into downtown Dallas,

810
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,900
and what did I find there?

811
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,620
I found the world's first subgenius convention, children.

812
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,100
And I stepped up on that stage, children,

813
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,740
with the great Reverend Albert Stein,

814
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,780
St. Janer Hyperclete,

815
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,260
Stern, O. K. Cameron, and others,

816
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,920
and I found my calling, children.

817
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,740
I found the spirit of God.

818
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,860
I found the will.

819
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,720
I lost $1,500.

820
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,260
I found the will of God, children.

821
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,320
And since that night, children,

822
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,360
the Pope of all New York,

823
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,080
well, he's been to Dubai,

824
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,140
the Bible's great and small.

825
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,000
I've been to Dubai,

826
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,320
in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

827
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,440
I've been to Dubai,

828
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,880
I was in Seattle, Washington.

829
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,620
I've been to Dubai,

830
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,360
I was in Philadelphia, PA.

831
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,580
But children, I've got to tell you,

832
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,560
I have not seen the spirit of God as I have tonight.

833
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,600
I have been at this preaching day,

834
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,680
at this preaching day for a long time, children.

835
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
A long time.

836
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,260
And every now and then, children,

837
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,220
every now and then,

838
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,740
every now and then, children,

839
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,880
my phone would ring.

840
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,080
And perhaps on the other end of that phone

841
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,460
would be

842
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,260
whoever night I would stay.

843
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,780
Perhaps I would be clean.

844
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,980
Perhaps it would be someone else.

845
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,680
There's going to be death.

846
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,920
There's going to be rough day.

847
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,900
There's going to be Pope of all New York City death.

848
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,840
All New York City death.

849
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,560
Come to so-and-so,

850
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,560
boondock piss-out little town,

851
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
and preach with it.

852
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,740
And children, invariably,

853
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,340
the Pope of all New York would say,

854
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:42,880
No!

855
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,700
No!

856
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,080
The Pope would say, No!

857
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,040
The Pope would say,

858
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,740
I would love to come and preach with you

859
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,120
and your little jerk-water bird.

860
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,940
But you know what?

861
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,600
The Pope of all New York is not suffering an existential crisis.

862
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,480
The Pope of all New York is not suffering an experiential crisis.

863
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,740
The Pope of all New York is not suffering a metaphysical crisis.

864
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,760
The Pope of all New York is suffering a slack crisis, children.

865
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,600
Yes, I would see you in a great crisis of slack.

866
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,420
And I no longer found the stage of Bob to liberate it, children.

867
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,040
I can no longer escape the device through which the conspiracy controls you,

868
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,100
the observer self, children.

869
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:32,180
I come on stage to escape the observer self that the conspiracy works night and day

870
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,460
to keep you adieu to their wiles,

871
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,880
to their wiles, children,

872
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,380
to their vile, pernicious,

873
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,640
Abbotson wills.

874
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,640
And frankly, children,

875
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,060
with the Reverend D.K. Charles,

876
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,060
where's D.K.?

877
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,680
And I drove up today,

878
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,880
come on up here,

879
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,200
we drove up today, children,

880
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,060
let me tell you something,

881
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,120
we drove up in rain that was like a dream, children.

882
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,820
We drove up here in rain that was like a hallucination.

883
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,840
It was like the last five minutes of the last wave, children.

884
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,440
And all the way up here we kept saying to each other,

885
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,220
there's going to be nobody in the house tonight.

886
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,260
In fact, children,

887
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,520
in fact, children,

888
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,700
I was so convinced there would be nobody in the house tonight,

889
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,740
I left my tie in the apartment.

890
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,220
Have you ever seen me preach without a tie?

891
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,200
I have never preached without a tie, children.

892
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,340
I have never preached without a suit.

893
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,020
I didn't think anybody would be here.

894
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,220
And this is not proof of my lack of faith in the Boston subgenius community.

895
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,820
This is proof of my lack of faith in myself, children.

896
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,840
The way that I was estranged from Bob, children.

897
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,640
The way that Bob was taken from me, children.

898
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,440
And let me tell you something, children.

899
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,040
I have tied to Bob that which is Bob's, children.

900
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,800
I have given money and time.

901
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,960
I do not claim a false status, children.

902
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,780
I'm a hidden wrong preacher.

903
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,680
I am not in the cap from the same cloth as the great German Einstein,

904
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,720
but I attempt to do my part, children.

905
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,340
But the last two preachers, children, have not moved me.

906
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,620
They have not led me to escape my observer's cell.

907
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,540
They have not filled me with the spirit of Bob.

908
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,580
But tonight, children, you have filled me with the spirit of Bob.

909
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,140
Because, children, you have brought Bob into this hall.

910
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,820
Tonight, you have made Bob manifest.

911
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,200
Children, I have been on stage with the Reverend Cleveland Donald Duncan for 17 years.

912
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:34,800
I have never seen a man so filled with the spirit of Bob, and frankly, the spirit of Janger, as I have tonight.

913
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,820
Let's give it up for the Reverend Cleveland Donald Duncan.

914
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:36,960
Please.

915
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,600
The most inspirational preacher I have ever seen, children.

916
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,420
Now let me ask you a question, children.

917
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,700
A question that, frankly, I am astounded that has not been asked thus far in this evening.

918
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,380
What's that?

919
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,100
Children, tell me something.

920
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:56,680
What?

921
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,080
What?

922
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,840
I want you to think very hard about this question, and I want you to give me an honest answer.

923
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,420
Okay.

924
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,520
Children.

925
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,660
Yes?

926
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,220
What must a subgenius have?

927
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,100
Sloth.

928
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,480
Sloth.

929
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,320
What must he have?

930
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:07,880
Sloth.

931
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,780
What must he have?

932
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,520
Sloth.

933
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,660
What must he or she have?

934
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,420
Sloth.

935
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,120
What must he have?

936
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:12,880
Sloth.

937
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,040
What can he or she have?

938
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:14,640
Sloth.

939
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,360
What must he have?

940
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,320
Sloth.

941
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,840
The subgenius must have slack, children.

942
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,620
While I'm low and filled with the spirit of Bob tonight, children, let me ask you something

943
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,240
about rule number two, children.

944
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,420
Rule number two in the Church of the Subgenius...

945
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,500
Reverend Stanton, can you know what rule number two is, children?

946
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,380
It is...

947
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,260
Buccos.

948
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,340
If they can't take a joke!

949
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,080
Woo hoo!

950
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,780
You know what children, most of them can.

951
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,460
And our careers are living proof of that.

952
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,260
Such as they are, children. Such as they are.

953
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,160
Now the third rule of Turks and subgenius, which just as I promised you children,

954
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,300
just as I pointed out to you children, just as I illuminated on this stage tonight,

955
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,480
has been co-opted by the conspiracy is,

956
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,820
too much is always better than not enough.

957
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,480
Now children, when you see that on a beer can,

958
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,600
when you see it on a sneaker ad,

959
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,120
when you see it on an off-road vehicle ad,

960
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,820
you just think about the source, children.

961
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,760
You think about the source, because the beautiful thing about pop culture is,

962
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,580
there's always a source, children.

963
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,440
It's a big old beat, and you can always run it back to the man who started it.

964
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,600
Now, when you see that slogan,

965
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,240
you don't think, I'm going to buy that product.

966
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,300
You think the subgenius is weaving its way

967
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,460
through the fabric of the product.

968
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,240
Now children, rule number four is in my personal view,

969
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,500
the most violated rule in the history of mankind,

970
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,040
and it goes like this.

971
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,460
If you don't have a sense of humor,

972
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,460
don't try to be funny.

973
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,440
There you go, that's enough we haven't discussed tonight.

974
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,100
Children, children, it's neoclassicism.

975
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,500
I'm going to give them time tonight.

976
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,720
It's a club, whatever it is.

977
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,980
It's a neoclassicism preaching tonight, children.

978
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,620
I'm filled with the neoclassicism spirit of Bob.

979
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,000
So back to the panther and the bottle.

980
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,360
Pray, pray, shall come to the living room.

981
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,340
And that's the rule of the church.

982
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,500
All the subgenius children, if that Bob wants you to...

983
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,880
Pull the wool over your own...

984
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,140
That's right, children.

985
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,240
All your life you've been told your parents' wool,

986
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,840
your teachers' wool, your churches' or synagogues' wool,

987
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,160
your cult's wool, your T.A.T.'s wool.

988
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,100
But tonight, children, we want you to pull the wool over your own eyes and...

989
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,920
Relax in the safety of your own delusion.

990
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,720
You know what?

991
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,760
You know what that is?

992
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,600
I'll tell you what that is, children.

993
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,300
Listen, the conspiracy wants to drive you

994
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,540
to working for it, children.

995
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,560
They want to drive you to a certain career path.

996
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,100
And you might say to yourself,

997
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,480
Gee, Bob, I'm not really an artist.

998
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,220
I'm not really a bohemian outrider kind of gal or guy.

999
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,280
I'm not really that creative, children.

1000
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,940
But I'm here to tell you something, children,

1001
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,080
that's as true as Bob himself.

1002
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,040
And that is, when it comes to delusions,

1003
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,300
you're damn creative.

1004
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,760
We are in the storehouse of our own delusions, children.

1005
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,520
And they're a comfortable place to be.

1006
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,500
And what we want, children, what we need, children,

1007
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,820
is for you to relax in the safety of your own delusions

1008
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,980
till you get so sick of them,

1009
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,260
you'll start thinking for yourself, children.

1010
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,320
You'll start cutting through the illusions that are the conspiracy.

1011
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,320
And your delusions that are the conspiracy.

1012
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,160
Oh, yeah, boy, we are going back tonight, children.

1013
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,000
Thank you.

1014
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,540
Like so much of the church, like so much of this dance,

1015
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,540
in 1981, it only gets truer, children.

1016
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,620
Society only aligns exactly the way that we have described the church.

1017
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,880
The subgenius has only improved brighter and brighter and brighter.

1018
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,900
Every rule we say will be more apt now than it was 17 years ago, children.

1019
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,720
And that's where the church of the subgenius is.

1020
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,820
Anybody you see driving a Porsche doesn't deserve it.

1021
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,520
You see, gentlemen, this goes to the point that there are worthwhile conspiracy tools.

1022
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:43,220
Unfortunately, they're all withheld from you and you and you, children,

1023
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,740
because you won't give the conspiracy what it needs to get some of their nice toys.

1024
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,300
What's that? What is it?

1025
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:50,920
What do you mean?

1026
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,340
What's that noise?

1027
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,060
Children, the church of the subgenius is all about convalesce, children.

1028
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,980
Convalesce everything.

1029
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,080
Convalesce yourself and con-knowledge of the conspiracy and con-knowledge of the file.

1030
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,420
And you've got to know what you know.

1031
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,600
And moreover, you've got to know what you don't know, children.

1032
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,740
Which brings us to the next rule of the church of the subgenius, which is,

1033
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,260
if you can't tell shit from tuna fish, don't order seafood in a French restaurant.

1034
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,860
Children, can I get a merit on law?

1035
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,720
Can I get a merit on law?

1036
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,320
Can I get another fee on law?

1037
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:29,980
Can I get another fee on law?

1038
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,940
Can I get another fee on law?

1039
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,620
Thank you, children.

1040
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,060
And I just finished telling them there was only one rule in the church of the subgenius.

1041
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,140
Say it, Dad.

1042
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,420
Say it, Dad.

1043
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:40,720
Say it, say it.

1044
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,180
Children, what was that old thing they used to say about their own?

1045
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,120
Oh, God, yeah.

1046
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,280
Oh, by the way, children, he might look at you and me and you might say, Dave.

1047
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:49,940
Dave.

1048
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:54,540
In a quiet, pensive kind of way, a sort of introspective kind of way.

1049
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,680
You might say, Rev. Dave.

1050
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,780
Rev. Dave.

1051
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,120
Rev. Dave.

1052
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,820
Rev. Dave.

1053
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:10,380
Watch what you see, Craig Drexler, and all of them have a different attitude, way of thinking.

1054
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:10,380


1055
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:10,460
How can I go, not that, there's nothing on Sportsando in the world to tell them my prophecy

1056
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:11,940
is true.

1057
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,020
Well, what are the bonds that you legs are entfernt from my census?

1058
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,680
I don't know if they can talk to that.

1059
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,100
Oh, you know, you and Hess has one and you what is the chain of actions is that between

1060
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,460
you've finally gone through the ס, it's 12 of a kind like aAHI foi οnese, who

1063
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:29,800


1064
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,820
Most of us, the view is the view anyway.

1065
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,920
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to,

1066
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,320
and I hope you are either.

1067
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,660
Children, when you leave these humble halls tonight,

1068
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,400
I want you to remember what your place is.

1069
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:56,380
I want you to remember, children, that as a conspiracy seeks to de-sexualize you,

1070
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,460
to de-intellectualize you,

1071
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,380
it also seeks to isolate you.

1072
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,160
It seeks to make you believe that there is no community, children,

1073
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,280
that there is no place of belonging, children.

1074
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,360
But look around you, children.

1075
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,700
Look on this stage tonight.

1076
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,260
We have been preaching together for 17 years, children,

1077
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,280
and there is still community.

1078
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,480
Now people are going way back tonight.

1079
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
People often say to me,

1080
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,580
They said to me,

1081
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,520
They said to me,

1082
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,140
New York City and the great,

1083
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,520
Pacific Northwest is dead.

1084
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,900
Oh, New York City and the great Northwest is dead.

1085
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,540
What is a subgenius?

1086
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,840
What is a subgenius?

1087
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,640
Children, my eyes are on fire tonight.

1088
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,580
You can't see your own eyes, children.

1089
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,400
You can never see your own eyes.

1090
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,220
You can't think about your own brain.

1091
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,260
Oh, children,

1092
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,140
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of subgeniuses.

1093
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,680
One kind of subgenius is someone who can do one thing very well at all,

1094
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,380
and nothing else.

1095
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,760
And another kind of subgenius is someone who can do a little bit of everything,

1096
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,300
but nothing well enough to turn them up.

1097
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,740
I do everything well.

1098
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,560
Two of them right over here.

1099
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,380
Two of them right here.

1100
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,040
And when the Reverend Ivan is staying in his infinite wisdom,

1101
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,300
We've got to stand in his infinite wisdom.

1102
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,020
When he talked earlier tonight about ambition and how it affects a subgenius,

1103
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:27,020
my experience is that most subgeniuses are lazy workaholics, children.

1104
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,180
That's right, children.

1105
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,040
You know, I see a stage packed with lazy workaholics tonight, children.

1106
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,180
The subgenius is generally a lazy workaholic because what a subgenius must want,

1107
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,580
a true subgenius, is to be left alone, children.

1108
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,760
It's hard to be left alone, children.

1109
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,960
It's hard to escape the forces of the conspiracy, children.

1110
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:57,000
It's hard to escape that vice, that career, vice that employs you.

1111
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,720
It's hard to escape that vision vice, that work vice.

1112
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,680
But children, you've got to let Bob come in, children.

1113
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,640
You've got to open yourself to Bob, children.

1114
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,460
Look at that face.

1115
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,900
That's a real man, children.

1116
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,160
Children, in closing, in conclusion tonight,

1117
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,840
I want to say something that the Pope of all New York has never said on stage in his life.

1118
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,020
I want to say thank you, children,

1119
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,980
for renewing my faith in you.

1120
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,200
I want to say thank you, Bob.

1121
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,600
I want to say thank you, children,

1122
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,660
for coming out on this great night to see these great creatures.

1123
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,880
I want to say thank you, children,

1124
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,180
for reconnecting from all New York to his direct list.

1125
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,720
Come on, come down and fill it up tonight.

1126
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,060
Praise Bob!

1127
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,880
Oh, man.

1128
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1129
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,640
Oh, oh, dear friends.

1130
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,620
Oh, well, and you can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius,

1131
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,740
Bob Dobbs, and what the hell we've all been talking about

1132
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,560
by writing for free information, just a dollar,

1133
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:23,100
from Bob at post office box 140306.

1134
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,000
That's box 140306.

1135
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1136
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,320
I should mention the musicians in the background on this show.

1137
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,420
This is DK Jones in the background.

1138
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,620
He was also there in Boston playing behind.

1139
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,580
Pope David N. Meyer, whose rant you just heard,

1140
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,620
and who has also backed up that organ playing,

1141
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,300
that amazing organ playing throughout the Boston revival,

1142
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,040
was by Brother Cleve Donut Duncan,

1143
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,420
who we heard on side one.

1144
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,600
Yes, Brother Cleve doing Bob is my load.

1145
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,520
And, uh,

1146
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,180
we've also heard, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1147
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,200
with Chaz Smith, Michelle Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1148
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:07,320
Princess Wiardo, live at the Cleveland Euclid Tavern just recently.

1149
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,240
In Portland, we heard, D5,

1150
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,040
we heard Reverend Phineas Narco,

1151
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:17,160
an amazing piece with negative land in the background, friends.

1152
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,120
That was actually Mark Hosler with Otis Otter,

1153
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,820
Reverend Otis Otter and Reverend Bunny Love,

1154
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,080
and another guy there in Portland.

1155
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,480
We heard Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence on KPFA

1156
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,900
with the brain and eggs, and, uh,

1157
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,260
uh, uh, uh, uh, yes.

1158
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,900
I guess we didn't make it to, uh,

1159
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,160
Reverend Bleepo's Winter Star, D5,

1160
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:43,720
or even, well, maybe we'll get to the doctor like you, Yak,

1161
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,180
but by gobs, friend,

1162
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,500
it's, it's a,

1163
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,060
this old church, sometimes, you know,

1164
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,980
it'll pick you right up, just yank you up,

1165
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,940
and you'll be locked by your, uh, jock straps,

1166
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,740
and sling you over its shoulder,

1167
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,460
and haul you off to Jerusalem.

1168
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,340
Praise Bob.

1169
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:11,360
Oh, and you can also check us out at www.subgenius.com, of course,

1170
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,660
or email slack at subgenius.com.

1171
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,960
Praise, uh, DK Jones for this, uh, beautiful music in the background.

1172
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,440
Uh, this type also is available now,

1173
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,400
newly available from Church Home.

1174
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,440
Subgenius is a pretty, uh, thing.
