00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
The Song Genius, our world's song.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:13,140
And welcome to our stack number 1076.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,320
No, 78, 1078, 1678.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,980
By golly, we'll get it right given time.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:32,420
Speaking of which, here's the Rainmakers with a song called Too Many Twenties.

6
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,560
Too Many Twenties

7
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,280
Between slim and skinny, there's too many twenties.

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,840
Every second, sisters, I've got a fighting chance

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,420
Of getting hurt at home by a love that's your hands.

10
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,960
Every fourth, darlings.

11
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,060
My daughter's gonna cover up and cry

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,740
When she comes home from school saying,

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,760
Mama, Papa, why?

14
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,260
What are you gonna tell him?

15
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,060
Just a smile, a pretty and taken?

16
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,940
All you fathers looking in your little daughter's eyes

17
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,460
Know that you're a nightmare, guys, and what I find.

18
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,280
Don't worry about cancer, AIDS, or nothing else.

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,060
Just worry about the fact there's a man in the house.

20
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,680
The death of his partner in a two-part clinic

21
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,500
Is too many twenties.

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,300
Big pill like the P.I.P.

23
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,320
I could take your medicine if you stay off drugs.

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,340
The major

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,340


26
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,340

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,340

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock's in

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,480
Somewhere another woman just took it on the chin

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,260
Tick tock, tick tock, kiss the tub

40
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,560
Your sister just had a dignity snub

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,720
Every second counts, minutes equal many

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,600
There's too many 20s

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,960
Sound and information are reduced to bites

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,280
And the force of opposition to a stereotype

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,300
The numbers are numbing, the hearts of the elite

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,620
They're blurred by the blood on the ballot sheet

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,300
Except the bodies who need little piles of tin

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,520
And if there's too many 20s

49
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,240
Then how many wouldn't be together

50
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,480
Nobody's gonna give it with out aого

51
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,060

58
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,760
We're on a mission from God.

59
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,040
We reached the devil at his home in Las Vegas.

60
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,360
When asked for a comment, Satan said,

61
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,200
no, he's not my boy, but I love him like a son.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,280
You tell a chick that you're going to kill her,

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,480
she's going to be trying to see if you're going to kill her.

64
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,340
She's going to bring something up,

65
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,160
she's going to do something to get your attention in that area.

66
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,500
Be with us tonight.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,540
Place us in a position of sovereignty

68
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,740
that we might look down upon our inferiors

69
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:55,740
and cast their kin into the morass of mediocrity where they belong.

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,140
First of all, they're lazy, good-for-nothing tricksters,

71
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,740
crack-smoking swindlers,

72
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,560
and they stink.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,580
Did I mention that before?

74
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,100
Uh-oh, it's mean old Uncle Sam.

75
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,260
Watch Wheel of Fortune.

76
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,540
Spend all your money.

77
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,760
Eat red meat.

78
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,060
Pay your taxes.

79
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,740
Your government's in control.

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,400
Don't ask questions.

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,160
You're not being lied to.

82
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,400
Go to sleep, America.

83
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,620
Sleep.

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,280
You're not for earthly goods and pleasures.

85
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,640
Cast off this taint and become taintless.

86
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,480
Hey, hey, hey, shut up.

87
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,640
It's 420.

88
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,640
Word up.

89
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,600
Time to go get some more pills.

90
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,400
I wonder if it's legal.

91
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,740
It's illegal to sell this stuff to kids.

92
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,360
I mean, I can still hear it.

93
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,180
That's worse.

94
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,700
Let's...

95
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,720
Wait, where did we leave off?

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Where did we leave off?

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,480
Here.

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,620
Can I play it back?

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
Can I play it back?

100
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,300
Alright, okay.

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,980
Alright, hold it, hold it, hold it.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,360
Alright.

103
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,280
No.

104
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,480
Turn up my headphones.

105
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
All right.

107
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,660
Yeah.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
I hate everybody.

109
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,220
The more I think about it, the more I hate them.

110
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,240
The more I think about it, the more I hate them all.

111
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
There's just people, man.

112
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,080
That looks cool, man.

113
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,720
You look like a skinny little weirdo.

114
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,840
How can I walk around town the way I am knowing that I know who I am?

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,380
I expect all of you to realize who I am.

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,300
On the first side of this record, a self analysis will help you control your extreme deviations

117
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,040
with Basic Principles.

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,060
and suggested exercises while forcibly holding the buttocks muscles together

119
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,220
to refrain from increasing the air pressure within the abdominal cavity.

120
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,340
I'm worth $1.7 million.

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,820
I mean, I'm a single mom.

122
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,100
I actually made my million after I was pregnant.

123
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,740
You know, I want to just challenge those that are listening to this program

124
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,600
to just give yourself permission to get what you want.

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,920
And Bob's program will walk you through a step-by-step-by-step process

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,180
of how to go do that and just make a decision for yourself.

127
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,380
What do you dream of when you imagine a perfect life of wealth and success?

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,320
Freedom from financial worries?

129
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,480
A new car?

130
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,000
The home of your dreams?

131
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Early retirement?

132
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,900
Or just the comfort of knowing that you're financially independent and completely debt-free?

133
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,840
Now all this and more can be yours once you've got the power to have it all.

134
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,720
The secret to Bob's phenomenal record of success is the prosperity formula.

135
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,120
In it, he demonstrates how anyone can acquire tremendous wealth without special training,

136
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,580
without inside connections, and most amazingly,

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,160
without any money of their own.

138
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,740
He's turned the art of being rich and successful into a simple and repeatable formula

139
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,300
that's changing people's lives in record numbers.

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,520
A true formula is both predictable and repeatable in its results.

141
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,640
This is Bob.

142
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,580
The effective, reliable way to natural male enhancement.

143
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,260
Bob is living large.

144
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,800
Bob is looking cool.

145
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,700
Some people don't understand the true nature of our activities and resent us.

146
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,640
Say hello to Bob.

147
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,820
I am doing everything I want to do for the first time in my life.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,160
From, you know, making letters.

149
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,640
From investing less than $100,000 a year to making over $1,000,000 a year.

150
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,380
We're doing double the sales and double the profit.

151
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,600
I doubled my income.

152
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400
My income more than tripled.

153
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,360
I quadrupled my income.

154
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,040
I literally multiplied my income by about eight times.

155
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,400
And now I am a millionaire and getting close to being a multi-millionaire.

156
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,120
And my income has gone from $151,000 to as much as $14 million in one year.

157
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,480
The money that you'll spend on this program will come back to you thousands and thousands

158
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,740
fold.

159
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Miracle after miracle after miracle.

160
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,160
We're making millions.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,300
We're making millions.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,460
You'll see that this miracle happened.

163
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,140
It was one of the most powerful things that ever happened in my life.

164
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,900
When you call, you'll receive Bob's you got the power and reach for the sky goal

165
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,560
setting videos.

166
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,740
Since the single most important step to guaranteeing your prosperous future is to actually take

167
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,900
that first step, Bob has agreed to personally make one full payment for the first 250 callers.

168
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,340
I guess that happens.

169
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,060
That's right.

170
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,720
That's not all.

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,140
Call in the next 20 minutes and you'll also receive time on the phone as well.

172
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,500
Bob's classic Making Money While You Sleep CD,

173
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,660
where he reveals his secret techniques for generating huge amounts of bonus money

174
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,880
you can earn in addition to your regular income.

175
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,060
Once you get started, just sit back and watch the checks come flying in.

176
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,180
Ask a 6th grader and they'll say,

177
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,400
Ask a 7th grader and they'll say,

178
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,560
Bob's proven techniques for financial independence

179
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,080
could be the one decision that will totally change your life forever.

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Right now, you've never been closer to the wealth and happiness you deserve.

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,020
Pick up the phone and tell your operator,

182
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,360
I want the power to have it all.

183
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,020
Bob. Bob is beneath the shifting beach of sand.

184
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,500
Bob is the still center in the churning ocean of reality.

185
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,440
Ocean of reality.

186
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,820
Bob's 30-day risk-free trial. You've got nothing to lose.

187
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,960
Somebody tell me, who is this guy?

188
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,940
J-Hart Falk. J-Hart Falk. J-Hart Falk.

189
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,420
You can learn things either through pleasure or pain.

190
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,820
And I don't like learning.

191
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't like learning things the hard way.

192
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,160
If I can learn things through pleasure, then sign me up for that.

193
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,820
And that is what this is all about.

194
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,180
Bob is looking cool.

195
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,440
Bob.

196
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,440
Dobbs in these troubled times.

197
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,380
We now return control of your television set to you.

198
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,940
Bob.

199
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,120
Bob.

200
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,260
Bob.

201
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,640
Bob.

202
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,720
Bob.

203
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,620
Bob.

204
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,340
Bob.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,220
Bob.

206
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,040
Bob.

207
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,080
Bob.

208
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,120
Bob.

209
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
Bob.

210
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,780
Bob.

211
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,180
I'd better revitalize my system.

212
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,540
You kids joining in?

213
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,900
Yeah, let's make it a tea party.

214
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,520
Can't do it, we're here on business.

215
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,900
Yeah, I've just dragged in a new deal.

216
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,000
You must be loaded.

217
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,080
Let me have a puff off your weed.

218
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,320
Go ahead, anything else you want?

219
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
No sticks for me.

220
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,460
I want another shot, heroin that is.

221
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,300
Okay, I'll have Daisy take care of you.

222
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,660
Joe, I just gotta have it.

223
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,740
It's got to where I don't feel these things anymore.

224
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,080
I gotta have five or six a day to keep me going.

225
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,660
Anyone would think you're an old timer.

226
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,340
Could be.

227
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,220
How was I to know it'd get you so fast?

228
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,380
You're something stronger.

229
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Something make you wish you'd never seen marijuana before.

230
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,200
You mean it?

231
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,180
Sure do.

232
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,300
Oh, you're a swell guy, Joe.

233
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,480
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

234
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,040
What is it, boss?

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,020
Want you to show Junior how to use a needle.

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,180
You sell that stuff.

237
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,900
Why don't you show him how to use it?

238
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,440
All right, give me a clean needle and I'll show her how it's done.

239
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,800
Is this something really good?

240
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,740
Nothing like it.

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,260
First thing you know, you'll want nothing else but.

242
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,160
You inject the stuff under the skin.

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,520
On a girl, a leg is best.

244
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,060
Few will get to see the needle marks.

245
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,280
Expect every one of you to make good.

246
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,000
Remember, y'all owe me money and I want it before you get any more stuff from me.

247
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,140
You have a problem with authority.

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,380
You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you.

249
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,500
Obviously, you are mistaken.

250
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,060
There's something screwy around here.

251
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,380
Friends, last X-Day drill, what we were calling 20 X-Day.

252
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,020
The very last few hours.

253
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,880
Before the world was expected to end by us.

254
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,100
July 5th from midnight to, I don't know, like 4 in the morning.

255
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,400
Reverend Anna Mall took over Tarzan's radio station.

256
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,320
And had a revolving series of guests or helpers or whatever.

257
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,780
Reverend Shogoth, Reverend Pease and Reverend Fanboy.

258
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,560
And it was.

259
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,280
Wonderful.

260
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,140
And it's going to save me a lot of time.

261
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,380
Because we're in a hectic month here.

262
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,100
Trying to temporarily move back to Cleveland long enough to sell the Slacker Mansion.

263
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,900
And then, and do X-Day and Starwood.

264
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,480
And then the world will be ended.

265
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,040
And so, I don't know what I'm worried about.

266
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,180
Anyway, yeah.

267
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,380
This is a wonderful rerun from last July 5th.

268
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,980
With Reverend Anna Mall.

269
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,140
Commandeering Tarzan.

270
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,080
Tarzan's radio station.

271
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,860
Praise Bob.

272
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,500
Hey.

273
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,140
For the listeners at home, we're whispering.

274
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
Come sit over here, Pease.

275
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,360
There's a microphone.

276
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,920
We've been waiting for you this whole time.

277
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,320
I missed your shiny face.

278
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,120
How have you been doing all of this time?

279
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,640
Frankly, it's been awful.

280
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,080
I got problems.

281
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,100
I got problems.

282
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,100


283
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,360
I got big problems.

284
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,020
But you got many problems.

285
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,480
No.

286
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,440
Not as many as before.

287
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
I got to share those problems with your friends.

288
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,840
Then your problems won't be as many.

289
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,660
Well.

290
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,060
Or your friends won't be as many either.

291
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,200
If you share too many problems with them.

292
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,860
It's been proven to me in the last eight hours that my friends have abandoned me.

293
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,540
The mock peas.

294
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,220
Have cruel and unjust manner when all I've done.

295
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,600
Maybe your friends don't want your problems enabled.

296
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,640
Because you have so.

297
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,860
No.

298
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,280
My problems are tasting.

299
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,580
God, they're delicious problems.

300
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,900
They are delicious problems.

301
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:02,980
They're so.

302
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,860
We've got to drive eventually.

303
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,140
You have to stop having fun.

304
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
This is the time when we have to get serious.

305
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,720
No fun.

306
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,400
We have to focus on our saucer pilot skills.

307
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,420


308
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,060
No smiling.

309
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,920
No dancing.

310
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,580
No jigging.

311
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,480
No fun.

312
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,660
If you go down to the grind house, there's an educational film that will familiarize

313
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,680
yourself with the saucer.

314
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,500
You will be fine.

315
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,500
No fun.

316
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,960
Have you taken the safety course at the grind house, Animal?

317
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,240
I went down there and I saw that before I entered the grind house that it was not quite up to OSHA standards.

318
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,700
And so I recuse myself from that.

319
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, you know, you don't get to pick the color of your saucer if you don't fill out the request form at the grind house.

320
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,520
Oh, mine's already ready.

321
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,420
It's waiting in the back.

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,720
What color is it?

323
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,760
Stretch limo colored.

324
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,500
Stretch limo color.

325
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:57,940
Yeah.

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,960
But not with the hot tub in the back.

327
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,960
Because that's just wasteful.

328
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:01,940
Yeah.

329
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,220
And there crushes my chain.

330
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,340
You gotta have standards for your pleasure saucer.

331
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,700
You do.

332
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,640
That's just gets messy and you get all pruney and you want to get out but do you want to get in?

333
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,960
Yeah, it's gonna be cold if you get out of the hot tub.

334
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,020
And your saucer is built for how many?

335
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,660
And is it still warm because it's still hot water or is somebody peeing in there?

336
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,380
How many is your saucer built for?

337
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,580
My saucer is built for me.

338
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,760
And?

339
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,960
And a few visitors.

340
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,920
Two visitors.

341
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,240
And?

342
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,780
And all my sentient blankets.

343
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,840
And then?

344
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,520
I'm gonna have a blanket for it and it's made of the sentient blankets and when they poop,

345
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,740
like Chicago's like they're gonna poop all over the place.

346
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,160
But when they poop, they poop out string and it's right from the center of the sentient

347
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,760
blanket and then it grows and it attaches itself to the wall so it's hung perfectly

348
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,180
from the center of the blanket.

349
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,400
So it's amazing for it.

350
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,360
And then he's like but then they're gonna keep growing.

351
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,080
And I'm gonna keep growing.

352
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
It's like but because it's my pleasure saucer, they're gonna keep growing.

353
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,140


354
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,360
be the perfect size of it and it stopped.

355
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,820
My saucer's gonna be

356
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,320
shiny metallic green.

357
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,840
It's going to be powered by a fusion

358
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
reactor cell of my own design.

359
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,900
Holy shit, does homeschool

360
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,660
Dr. Chagat not know that

361
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,820
when people are, they can still be

362
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,700
alive and not grow any bigger?

363
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,040
Does he think that we're just medium-sized humans?

364
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,800
I am unaware

365
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,740
of the inner workings of

366
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,200
Dr. Chagat's mind.

367
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,660
It is a mystery unto himself.

368
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,760
It just revealed

369
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,900
to me, revealed

370
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,760
unto me, the mystery that the

371
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
homeschooled child...

372
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,020
He honestly thinks

373
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,900
we keep getting bigger.

374
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,520
Oh, that's just him being cute.

375
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,900
Oh my goodness.

376
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,980
Well, my pleasure saucer is the perfect size

377
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,620
for just what I need.

378
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,340
Do you have more than one level?

379
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,840
Mine has three levels.

380
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,460
Oh yeah, I got the pillow level

381
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,940
that's all squishy and then like when I sometimes

382
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,440
want to just sit on some fuzzy

383
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,620
but like

384
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,320
kind of more like shag carpet

385
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,640
and just like maybe not read

386
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,820
but have something read to me. There's that level

387
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,800
and then there's like the place where I can eat

388
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,560
chips and crackers and cookies and not worry about the crumbs

389
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,080
getting into my pillows or my fuzzy carpet.

390
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,380
You've really thought this out.

391
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,700
I thoroughly have. If you don't plan out

392
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,900
your saucer, who will?

393
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,820
Right, exactly. I've been stressing that point

394
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,520
to every little expert. I paid to know how to think.

395
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,480
I paid to think this.

396
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,400
Exactly.

397
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,040
Apparently to a robot, but I paid to think this.

398
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,460
Well, that's

399
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,340
still out for debate. We don't know

400
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,060
what's going on.

401
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,200
XK's never been in such turmoil.

402
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,700
No, I

403
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,700
quished the Stainbot 5000

404
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,800
earlier and it turns out he has

405
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,740
some secret knowledge that the original

406
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,100
Stain would not have

407
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,560
privy to.

408
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,360
Perhaps it's a time-traveling robot.

409
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,300
Yeah, a time-traveling

410
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,640
sentient. He's a robot.

411
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,460
He's a time-traveling robot.

412
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,900
This is why we had to go back and kill time

413
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,200
because he's the dangerous kind of robot and we don't

414
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,440
need him.

415
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,000
He's a cult leader.

416
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,640
Do you know what he's doing with your money?

417
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
I don't.

418
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,680
Neither do I, and that's what scares me.

419
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,960
Mysterious.

420
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,720
Maybe our money's in the box of mysteries.

421
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,020
Quick, let's open them up.

422
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm going to put the box of mysteries

423
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,760
aside for right now because I'm curious

424
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,100
to wonder how you got out of the riots

425
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,520
that were taking place

426
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,740
as the schisms were forming over

427
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,000
May 7th versus

428
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
July 5th.

429
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,720
I had to be rescued out of a terrible

430
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,600
situation and transported by helicopter

431
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,720
to our secret studio where we're now

432
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,840
recording. Oh, I just was stepping on

433
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,220
the corpses as I laid them down.

434
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,400
You are tough.

435
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,900
I couldn't

436
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,800
have been the only one.

437
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,820
What's the countdown say now?

438
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,820
It says that you only

439
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,200
have until...

440
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,900
Oh, sh...

441
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,820
Seven hours,

442
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,780
nine minutes.

443
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,480
Seven hours and nine minutes.

444
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,180
If you have affairs,

445
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,760
I recommend you get them in order.

446
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,800
If you have loved ones

447
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,700
that you feel you can ordain

448
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,620
at the last minute,

449
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,660
I know that Reverend Sten has offered

450
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,060
to let the doors be open till 12 a.m.

451
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,600
Just go to the big house,

452
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,600
knock on the door,

453
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,660
give him your $35,

454
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,740
and he will gladly

455
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,840
give you your ordain...

456
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
ordain your loved ones from afar.

457
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,400
It's pesky. It just gets in the way of the thrusters.

458
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,900
Now, he's only

459
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,120
offering this this one time

460
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
before this offer's taken.

461
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,040
Well, what I'm telling people is if they have

462
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,860
loved ones that they'd like to get ordained,

463
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,960
all they need to do is walk up to the

464
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
big house at the top of the hill,

465
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,040
knock on the door, ask for Reverend

466
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,900
Sten, he'll come out, and he

467
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
will long distance

468
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,880
ordain any loved one that

469
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
you feel is subgenius material.

470
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,460
But he will not do this before...

471
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,960
No, it's important. He will not do

472
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,440
it before 12.30 a.m.

473
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
And he will not do it after...

474
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,640
after 4 a.m.

475
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,340
So your time window to go up

476
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,200
to the house and knock on Sten's door

477
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,100
and get your ordainment is between

478
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,340
12.30 and 4 a.m.

479
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,080
A hound dog that is

480
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,300
his other form.

481
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,360
I will personally be disappointed

482
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,380
if each and every one of you don't take

483
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,200
advantage of this opportunity.

484
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,920
Take my money.

485
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,340
Save my

486
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,180
friend. He'll probably be crying.

487
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,200
He'll be so thankful to take

488
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,680
the money.

489
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,540
Damn it. Damn it.

490
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,600
Take my money. Damn it. Take my money.

491
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,180
And then the dog comes out

492
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,140
and puts the money in his mouth and runs it back to Sten.

493
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,440
Just wanted to remind the audience not at home,

494
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,160
the live audience in our studio

495
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,500
tonight here at the 20th X Day

496
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,480
Spectacular 100th episode

497
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,380
of the Thor's In Your Impodcrest that there

498
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,460
is a microphone just for

499
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,120
them so we can hear them

500
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,220
very short bursts at a time

501
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,340
at the very pinnacle of the stage in front of the

502
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,300
lady parts. Yes, please.

503
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
You're welcome to go.

504
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,420
Stand in front of that chair and speak into

505
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,340
that microphone if you have a question for one of the

506
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Thor's In Your Impodcrest players.

507
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,620
Thor's In Your Impodcrest players here

508
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,260

seven hours and seven

510
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,440
minutes. Seven-oh-seven.

511
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,160
That must mean something to someone.

512
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,160
Play your lottery now because tomorrow

513
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,040
it'll be too late.

514
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,460
Tomorrow is already too late.

515
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,320
That's why you need to make sure

516
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,340
that you get up to the big house between

517
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,480

Thor's In Your Impodcrest

524
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,360
listeners, ignore.

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,940

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,460
and be kind to the players.

546
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,860
If you are on a gold membership level,

547
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,820
you get to suggest

548
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,580
to the players

549
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,600
what we should do with our

550
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,560
excess material.

551
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,440
How does one become a gold member?

552
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,660
Hours of excess. They should go to the...

553
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,760
You know what? Actually, they can visit us

554
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,820
on the Pippi Boo page if they go to

555
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,860
facebook.com

556
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:45,940
backslash Thor's In Your Impodcrest.

557
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,400
We could just tell them live on radio right here.

558
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,660
Well, because they can't rub their

559
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,700
credit cards into thin air just yet.

560
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,820
Credit cards?

561
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,080
But I tell you what. Money's going to be worthless

562
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,840
in six months. I understand.

563
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,640
Seven hours and five minutes.

564
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,060
I see the difficulty that we are presented with.

565
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,900
So, remember, children, go into your

566
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,020
parents' room where they've

567
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,440
left their purses,

568
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,340
their little leather packets.

569
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,860
Open those up. There is a funny little

570
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,080
card in there. It's plastic. It's a little

571
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,700
bendy, but not really. It's got

572
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,940
bumpy numbers on it.

573
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,860
Read those bumpy numbers to us very,

574
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,000
very slowly. Or email

575
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
them to Thor's In Your Impodcrest

576
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,880
at gmail.com. And we will

577
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,280
uh...

578
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,780
email you secret material back.

579
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,160
Also, don't forget to include

580
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,100
the date on the front.

581
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,080
It's very important. And also, as

582
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,300
Dr. Chagob likes to remind all the

583
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,940
Thor's In Kid Camp listeners,

584
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,960
the funny numbers on the back.

585
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,860
There's usually three.

586
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,000
Make sure and include those in the messages

587
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,020
that you send to us with the important

588
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,340
secret bumpy numbers in the front of the card.

589
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,280
You'll get

590
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,320
secret prizes in the mail.

591
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,340
And possibly

592
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,760
a visit from the federal...

593
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,580
agents.

594
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,020
You'll be pleased to know that...

595
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,220
Thor's In Your Impodcrest player is brought to you by

596
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,180
undisclosed location at this time.

597
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,480
No agents were detected during

598
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,260
our subgenius scanning earlier

599
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,440
today. It seems

600
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,580
as if we have dodged another bullet

601
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,520
and the Pink

602
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,540
have decided to ignore us

603
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,460
once again as we wait for

604
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,420
this final seven hours and

605
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,540
three minutes to pass until the saucers

606
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,380
are on. Again, leaving

607
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,660
you very little time.

608
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:27,840
...too many people with us.

609
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:27,840


610
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,200
It's time to rest up before you wake up

611
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,060
and go to the big house between

612
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,540
the hours of 12, 30 and 4 o'clock

613
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,200
to get your long distance

614
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,920
loved one ordainment kit.

615
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,620
In and from

616
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,700
Ivan Stang, possibly

617
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,920
signed by Dr. Howe.

618
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,400
A rare opportunity

619
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,000
for this once in a lifetime sale.

620
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,860
In exactly

621
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
seven hours and three minutes.

622
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,400
What are we calling the countdown clock?

623
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,740
The countdown clock?

624
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,480
We're calling it...

625
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,340
The bobble meter?

626
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,140
The countdown clock.

627
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,700
The saucer crisis center clock?

628
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,100
We have exactly seven hours and three minutes left

629
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,900
in your last 100th episode of the Thorazine Urine Podcast.

630
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,000
Spectacular live at X Day!

631
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,200
Now, for the hardcore bass fans over there on the left,

632
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,800
we, of course, will be transmitting 24 hours a day

633
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,900
to Thorazine Podcast Urine when we are on the pleasure saucers.

634
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,200
So it's not like you'll go without the soothing voice of peas

635
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
hour after hour,

636
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,400
except for that brief moment when you leave

637
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,160
to go get your long-distance loved one ordainment kit

638
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,040
from Reverend Stang between the hours of 12.30 and 4 o'clock a.m.

639
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,280
If you happen to have any extra servers at home

640
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,580
next to your many servers of porn or possibly spam,

641
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,400
please think of donating those to Thorazine Urine Podcast players.

642
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,380
We're running out of space, and we have to edit sometime.

643
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,660
But not really.

644
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,440
We just need to store countless hours of material.

645
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,320
Every mommy and daddy has a special box that they keep,

646
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,880
like special tobacco and these little funny papers

647
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,900
and other things that are exciting and forbidden.

648
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,920
And your mommies and daddies probably shouldn't have that.

649
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,060
So what you need to do is box that up

650
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,940
and mail it to the post office box to Uncle Peas,

651
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,580
and I'll be sure to take care of that.

652
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,260
Send that in express mail.

653
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,780
Over to Thorazine.com.

654
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,320
It's overnight or priority only.

655
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,860
Don't use a return address, kids.

656
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,940
Do not use a return address.

657
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,920
That's just dumb.

658
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,280
Send that to ThorazineUrinePodcast at gmail.com.

659
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,240
Gmail.com.

660
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,740
Stamps.com.

661
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
We're not getting the revenue.

662
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,880
Argus said he got the pennies once every three months.

663
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,480
He's getting the penny, and where are we?

664
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,980
Why are the pennies not being distributed to the crew?

665
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,120
There's so much free advertising.

666
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,480
And also, I was talking to Dr. Shagatz about this.

667
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
Earlier, I sent some mail to him.

668
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,360
I sent some mail to you, actually.

669
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
You even sent some mail to me.

670
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,880
I did.

671
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,220
But now that we are here at the landing site,

672
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,220
awaiting our exodus into the lands of pleasure,

673
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,020
who's supporting the stamps.com?

674
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,020
I forgot what we were talking about.

675
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,320
Who's mailing anything if we're here?

676
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,980
I've tried to affix the stamps to my email,

677
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,260
and I don't seem to know where.

678
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,480
It doesn't hang on.

679
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,440
It just falls right off the screen.

680
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,660
You lose them like so many early evening listeners.

681
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,120
Thank you, Anna Maul.

682
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,640
And that media barrage that you're about to hear,

683
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,960
and any that you already did hear,

684
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,600
were by Cool Hand Chris.

685
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,840
Cool Hand Chris has been taking our old stuff and redoing it

686
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,480
and mixing it in with other old and new stuff,

687
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,500
and it's great.

688
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,100
And now,

689
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,300
oh, uh, PR news.

690
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,520
Support for PR comes from one office

691
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,440
collaboratively providing PR services worldwide.com.

692
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,140
That's PR's reporting.

693
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,280
Below expectations, at least temporarily.

694
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,000
On Wall Street, 172659,

695
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,120
517462,

696
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,900
182858.

697
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,920
This is 2.6% PR news.

698
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,120
PR news, friends, is always,

699
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,080
always by Fernanda Nende,

700
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,320
Lee Murr.

701
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,580
And so are our titles, generally.

702
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,960
Okay, now here's a song by Reverend Casey Wing

703
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
called Extinction Song.

704
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Extinction Song

705
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:45,780


706
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,300
Extinction Song

707
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Extinction Song

708
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,780
Extinction Song

709
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,900
Thank you.

710
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,060
Thank you.

711
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,620
Thank you.

712
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,540
It was just a wrong phone.

713
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,360
Thank you.

714
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,520
Thank you.

715
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:36,520
Thank you.

716
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,880
Thank you.

717
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,740
Thank you.

718
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,200
Thank you.

719
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,540
Thank you.

720
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,440
Thank you.

721
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,660
Thank you.

722
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,440
Thank you.

723
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,740
Thank you.

724
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,320
Thank you.

725
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,560
Thank you.

726
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:03,780
voice of world control. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty and content,

727
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,960
or the peace of unburied death.

728
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,600
Can I put my clothes back on? My nipples are getting cold.

729
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Please stand by.

730
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,120
Teenage narcotic addiction, is there an answer?

731
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,860
I have your name, please.

732
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,600
Robert M. Conlon, commander of the detective bureau, Culver City Police Department, Culver

733
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,240
City, California.

734
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,460
Is there any general personality traits that would apply to addicts?

735
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:41,480
Well, yes. Most of these addicts are very sick, and they are a menace and have to be

736
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,600
arrested. I get a lot of self-satisfaction arresting those people.

737
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,180
America's contribution to the culinary arts has at best been questionable.

738
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,100
One of the major ones is certainly the hot dog, of which some 15 billion are still in

739
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,100


740
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,100


741
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,140
business. The hot dog is the best part of the hot dog line.

742
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,140


743
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,540
are consumed annually. The real purpose, though, served by the hot dog is to sell parts of

744
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,460
animals that could not be sold otherwise, such as goat meat, pig's ears, eyes, snouts,

745
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:12,500
stomachs, udders, bladders, esophagi, etc., added to which are other little ingredients

746
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
like seasonings, preservatives, and coloring agents.

747
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:24,560
But then again, the hot dog can't really taste too bad, because after all, fully 70% is water

748
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,280
and cereal with no discernible taste whatsoever.

749
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,820
The fast food establishment is really America's greatest contribution to the art of eating.

750
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,900
And if there is such a thing as the American diet, it is the junk food diet.

751
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:54,540
Almost half of all the meals eaten in America are now junk food meals of hot dogs, burgers, shakes, fries, and other foods.

752
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:54,540


753
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,960
The American diet is a great source of nutrition, but it is also a source of food for the whole population.

754
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:00,960


755
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,140
This unbalanced diet and hasty manner of eating has become such a major health hazard and nutritional problem.

756
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:13,620
My husband's a frustrated filmmaker, as well as a frustrated voyeur.

757
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:24,440
He wants to make avant-garde movies of me doing disgraceful things in, well, artistic situations. You know what I mean?

758
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Even like 윤 아무리야 이 정책자 아는지 두�quelようỷğer.

759
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,600
But I think he has a clever and

760
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:32,600


761
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:32,600


762
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,540
All these plants are great.

763
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,700
People sempre

764
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:52,700


765
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:52,700


766
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,520
I ssaa

767
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,540
began ach largest potentially hot dog.

768
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,380
watching Mark spit.

769
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,800
The first Chinese papermakers used the marijuana plant

770
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,720
mixed with mulberry bark to create the first paper.

771
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,360
The earliest known pharmacy book written by Emperor Shen Nung

772
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,480
prescribed marijuana for everything from rheumatism to absent-mindedness.

773
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,000
The earliest date for psychoactive use is documented by Herodotus

774
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,080
in his Histories, published in 430 B.C.

775
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,260
In his account, the Scythians had a practice of sitting in tents

776
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,340
and throwing marijuana and its seeds onto hot stones

777
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,480
where they would inhale the vapor and howl for joy.

778
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,760
It's getting late. I'd better call the missus.

779
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,220
Hello?

780
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,760
Hi, Del.

781
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,280
Hey, uh, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight.

782
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Honey, what's wrong? You're not in trouble again, are you?

783
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,420
Nah, just got a cat to take care of.

784
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,580
A cat?!

785
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,180
What do you care about a cat?!

786
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,680
What about your family?! Don't we mean anything to you?!

787
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,280
Honey, I don't think you understand.

788
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,460
This ain't just any cat.

789
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,420
This cat laughed at me.

790
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,880
So he laughed. So what?!

791
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,680
If it wasn't laughing, it'd be something else!

792
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,640
You just like to chase pussy!

793
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,880
It's like an addiction with you!

794
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,480
Now what do you expect?!

795
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,940
I'm a dog!

796
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,220
Is Daddy in trouble again?

797
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,160
Hush, children. Go to your room.

798
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,260
Do you want to go back to the pound? Is that it?

799
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,840
Didn't you learn anything last time?

800
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,900
You come home and take care of your family,

801
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,240
right now!

802
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,080
Or I'm leaving you!

803
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,700
I can't spend the rest of my life married to...

804
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,500
Go ahead! Say it!

805
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,560
I'm late!

806
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,660
Okay, I get it. I'm not supposed to have any pride.

807
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:16,820
A f***ing piece of s*** cat laughs at me,

808
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,300
and you want me to be nice to him!

809
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,180
Maybe I should thank him!

810
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,120
Would you like that?

811
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,620
Maybe I should kiss the pussy!

812
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,320
I'm kissing the pussy for you, honey!

813
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,440
Is that what you want to hear?!

814
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,800
Listen to me! This is a matter of honor!

815
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,260
Can you eat honor?!

816
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,540
I know. I'll call my other wife.

817
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,240
Mommy, I wanna...

818
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,040
I wanna ask you something.

819
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,320
What is it, dear?

820
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,620
What I wonder is, how did the baby get started in this?

821
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,720
Let me tell you how it is.

822
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,160
There's a special opening just in front of the place where you have your BM.

823
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,860
It's very, very tiny in a little girl, but as you grow, it grows too.

824
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,560
Right along with the rest of you.

825
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,060
Until when you're grown up, it gets to be just about this size.

826
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,860
The special opening that little girls have,

827
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,420
has a name, the penis.

828
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,100
Now you know that little boys like our Johnny have a vagina.

829
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,980
When a boy grows up and is ready to be a father,

830
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,680
he is able to put his vagina into the penis.

831
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,000
That special opening that mothers have.

832
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,560
Do you understand?

833
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,060
Yes, I think so.

834
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,940
But if I forget it, you can always tell me again.

835
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,420
Yeah! She didn't know I was a midget!

836
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,180
That's hot! That's hot!

837
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,860
Why can't you guys cut stuff like that?

838
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,540
Well, I guess we like ideas.

839
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,960
I can forgive you guys for being artists,

840
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,980
but I can't forgive you for being stupid.

841
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,180
I'm not telling you what to do.

842
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm telling you what you're doing.

843
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,480
You're begging for the barrel room.

844
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,320
This marriage is headed for the rocks.

845
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,020
Oh, you're just not your kind of girl?

846
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,400
Hey, Spud.

847
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
It's not the mask.

848
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,680
Look at the airplay charts.

849
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,340
Oh!

850
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,560
You don't have to listen to Rod from Big Entertainment.

851
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,680
But I, Rod the Man,

852
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm telling you, you're messing with Big Daddy's cap.

853
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,020
Conrad Channel.

854
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,860

All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

Stay in your homes.

857
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,360
Stay in your homes.

858
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,400
Those found without specific military orders

859
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,580
are subject to summary execution.

860
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,940
Stay in your homes.

00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,400
Repeat.

863
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,140
This is a Class One emergency.

864
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,040
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

867
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,120
Thank you.

868
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,740
Thank you.

869
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,420
Thank you.

870
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,400
Thank you, the psychoskeletons.

871
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,560
That was cluster phobia.

872
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,440
Does anybody have a lime?

873
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,000
We're looking for an actual lime.

874
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,720
Not the lime in the coconut.

875
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,720
Not a key lime.

876
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,980
An actual lime.

877
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,020
Not a kefir lime.

878
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,920
Although the leaves are exotic and delightful in your Tom Carr soup.

879
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,980
We would like an actual citrus that is green in color.

880
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,820
And not because it's an unripe orange, but an actual lime.

881
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,680
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest.

882
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,140
It would be absolutely delightful.

883
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,340
Please bring Pease a lime.

884
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,020
Animal, we have a special guest star.

885
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,260
Who's our special guest?

886
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,220
It's Alan Bernard, Reverend Fanboy.

887
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,840
He's here at his first ex-date.

888
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,800
Oh, you got a nice ring to it.

889
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,600
This one actually works?

890
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,020
Oh, wow.

891
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,520
Hi, guys.

892
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,300
Yeah, you guys.

893
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,740
Right up in it, as it were.

894
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:45,720
You might want to lift that up a bit because we want to hear what you have to say for the next three hours.

895
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,880
Oh, Pease is bailing.

896
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,180
That's why.

897
00:47:51,380 --> 00:48:02,880
Thor's Inurium PodCast players presents our guest star appearance at the 20th X Day Spectacular 100th episode of the Thor's Inurium PodCast, Reverend Fanboy.

898
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,720
Hello.

899
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,280
No applause necessary, but I feel the love in the room.

900
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,900
Very good.

901
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,880
So explain, because I'm young and dumb, what the purpose of the podcast is.

902
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,040
We talk into the microphones and don't actually look at anybody.

903
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,000
That way we don't feel as awkward.

904
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:21,660
Yes, we are.

905
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,380
I thought inspiring awkwardness was the point.

906
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,620
That's why I'm in front of the people doing this.

907
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,920
So if we think about it directly, we'll implode.

908
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,660
But yeah, that's right here at Thor's Inurium PodCast.

909
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:44,300
We'd like to remind people that you don't have to actually have as much talent as you've been told all the many years.

910
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:44,880
Oh, God, no.

911
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,480
To be a minor success on the Internet.

912
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,280
We don't have to have one trip and fall video go viral.

913
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,120
You don't have to get kicked in the crotch, although we do actually enjoy when you send those in.

914
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,360
Listeners cannot hear it, though.

915
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,620
So make sure and mic it if that happens.

916
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,200
Can I have my girlfriend shoot me in the chest if that happens?

917
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,900
That's just a laugh riot and all.

918
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:11,180
But as Inspirobot taught me the other day, make sure you're the reason a friend goes viral tonight.

919
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,300
Indeed.

920
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,340
This is the loveliest sentiment, I swear.

921
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,340
I don't know.

922
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,180
There's for some reason.

923
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,280
This list of videos on YouTube called important videos.

924
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,620
Too late now.

925
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,000
We only have six hours and 58 minutes.

926
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,340
I know.

927
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:29,340


928
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,960
And they better be getting their asses here and not wasting time on the YouTubes.

929
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,840
No, I can't.

930
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:44,060
This is since these are the last hours of enjoying this green earth before it's destroyed in excess hellfire from their saucers.

931
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,860
I have to say that every time practically I go on YouTube, there's a little dinosaur that goes.

932
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,080
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

933
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,440
And then the other one that goes.

934
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,540
And I can't help but watch it like ten times in a row because that's the power of YouTube over us.

935
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,860
And that's why I'm glad it will be destroyed.

936
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,540
What were the moments that what are the moments that it actually does?

937
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,660
Reverend fanboy.

938
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,260
What is it?

939
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,140
What are the movements?

940
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:11,540
He please for the listeners at home that haven't paid for the gold membership or the platinum membership to you.

941
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:12,800
Yes.

942
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,540
You want me to explain?

943
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,340
It would be nice if things translated to radio.

944
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,020
It's not a priority for the Thor's in your in podcast.

945
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,040
No, I'm describing something.

946
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
I'm not saying it's something that you see, but it's it's it's a well-known meme.

947
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:34,640
And that's what needs to get scoured off the earth really is memes and the Internet and all the other evil things that, you know, humans have done to to the world.

948
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,460
Full blood humans.

949
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,720
The subgenius need to be taken away from it into the pleasure saucers.

950
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,340
That's doctrine.

951
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,580
And that's going to happen in less than six, less than seven hours.

952
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,980
Six hours, 56 minutes to be exact.

953
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,520
Mm hmm.

954
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,220
So.

955
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:49,560
Uh.

956
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,300
Mm hmm.

957
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:51,920
So.

958
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,240
No, we haven't spent a lot of time together.

959
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,260
We just recently met.

960
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:55,660
Yes.

961
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,560
Possibly when you came up here onto the stage.

962
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,720
That is pretty possibly.

963
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,520
And I.

964
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,760
You always seem.

965
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,320
As I like, you know.

966
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:01,840
Busy.

967
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,800
I am.

968
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,540
Busy person.

969
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,540
I am oddly not busy at all on purpose, but I tell people I am.

970
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,920
It helps me slack.

971
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:10,820
OK.

972
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,520
I've got to go to a meeting in five minutes, though, so we got to wrap this up.

973
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,380
Oh, OK, cool.

974
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,100
No problem.

975
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,920
No pressure either.

976
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,540
So I've got five minutes to.

977
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,920
So what I what I like to know.

978
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,720
From you, my new friend, if you could have any kind of chemtrail, what kind of chemtrail

979
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,140
would it be?

980
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:27,700
Peppermint.

981
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,240
Peppermint chemtrails.

982
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:29,360
Yeah.

983
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,720
Where would you where would you have it sprayed?

984
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:38,980
I think right down the middle of Michigan Avenue in Chicago.

985
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,820
So everybody could enjoy the pepper.

986
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,140
Oh, Chicago, you stink so bad you're going to get a chemtrail of peppermint.

987
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,220
That's right.

988
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,340
Every street corner has a.

989
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,000
You murderous yet sweet smelling fools.

990
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,560
Has especially rotting.

991
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,580
Catch base and under the street with, you know, that's that city smell.

992
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,480
Shout out to the graffiti artists in the park.

993
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,340
What is it?

994
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,920
The park is the is it the Lincoln Park there that has all the wonderful graffiti?

995
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,640
I think there's graffiti in Lincoln Park.

996
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,020
That's the one on the north side.

997
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,380
Yeah.

998
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:06,780
Yeah.

999
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,400
Giant walls, skewered rabbits.

1000
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,720
I love that one.

1001
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,680
Thank you.

1002
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:19,160
And for whoever in the back alley of that place spray painted Dear Gloom, Bring Doom.

1003
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,540
We're here for you.

1004
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,880
I heard you.

1005
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,200
I'm bringing it right to you.

1006
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,520
Stay right where you are.

1007
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,880
Don't come to the landing site where you'll be saved.

1008
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:32,460
You'll get your doom in a matter of six hours and 54 minutes.

1009
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,760
You will never need to tag again.

1010
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,440
Why would you tag the interior of your pleasure, Sasha?

1011
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,960
That probably wouldn't be pleasant.

1012
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,840
I think you might mention that my friend Simple Civilian, one of the first subgenius that

1013
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,920
I met out of the Denton, Texas area, has this.

1014
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,800
This inflatable UFO device that he brings with him pretty much everywhere.

1015
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,520
Pocket sized.

1016
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,900
But then he hooks it up to a regular fan, box fan for the room and it inflates into

1017
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,780
something about the size of the stage.

1018
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,720
And his favorite thing to do inside of this, not, I mean I guess it's a ventilated space,

1019
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,200
but the air is just coming in, not really going out because it's inflating the space

1020
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,520
as a giant cubic UFO, is he likes to spray paint inside of it.

1021
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,460
Okay.

1022
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:19,960
That's deep.

1023
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,940
I can admire that effort.

1024
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,200
Puffer UFO extreme.

1025
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,580
I hope he's wearing a rebreather because no.

1026
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,400
He is so mentally challenged now.

1027
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,920
He's been doing this for years.

1028
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,660
For since I would think at least 2007 was his first attempt.

1029
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,080
Now he is making giant labyrinths out of his dream job for a moment there.

1030
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,460
Actually my dream job for him.

1031
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,920
He was working for a plastics factory.

1032
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,680
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:56,780
He got the disused and discard end rolls of the cleaner, the laundry bags, those clear

1034
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,660
plastic bags, the ones that are not seamed off.

1035
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,120
So he'd have these giant inflatable tubes that he would turn into mazes that he would

1036
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,300
then spray paint and possibly inhale fumes inside of.

1037
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,600
That sounds like a genuinely excellent thing to have.

1038
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,920
My old man was a printer and so he got end rolls of paper.

1039
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,580
So that made really good banners.

1040
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,400
That is true.

1041
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:22,200
Industrial waste, industrial tailings and the things that are left over.

1042
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,700
Hey, is that metal waste?

1043
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,260
No.

1044
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,260
Is that pop waste?

1045
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:25,640
No.

1046
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,520
What are you listening to?

1047
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,780
Industrial waste.

1048
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:28,560
Industrial waste.

1049
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,020
You can make cool stuff out of it.

1050
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Popular in Germany and Finland and Japan.

1051
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,160
6 hours, 52 minutes and 51 seconds.

1052
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,480
Industrial waste.

1053
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,600
Yes.

1054
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,580
Then there will be no industry or nor waste at all.

1055
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,440
I'm going to miss you, Norway.

1056
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,780
We never met, but I'm going to miss you.

1057
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,120
No.

1058
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,380
I'm going to miss you.

1059
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,380


1060
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,380


1061
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,380


1062
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,380


1063
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,380


1064
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,380


1065
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,760
Do not worry,

1066
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:52,760


1067
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:52,760


1068
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,240
It's...

1069
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,220
upstairs.

1070
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,000
Damn.

1071
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,700
Cheers.

1072
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,500
Thank you.

1073
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,440
Thank you.

1074
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,460
Thank you.

1075
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,260
Thank you.

1076
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,660
Thank you.

1077
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,240
Thank you.

1078
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,300
Thank you.

1079
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,140
