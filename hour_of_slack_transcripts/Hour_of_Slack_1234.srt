1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,340
Oh

2
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,140
Oh

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,980
You know

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,900
You know

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,000
You know I'm so thankful tonight

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,280
That I don't have a lot of money

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,060
I don't have a lot of friends

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,320
But I have a whole lot

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,220
Of diagrams

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,280
Of how to position

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,220
Or

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,900
Or

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,980
Or

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,360
Steve

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,060
Somebody's got a

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Conspiracy going on

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,920
And you will say

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,140
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,080
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,200
We don't have a lot of money

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,020
We don't have a lot of people

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,020
And we got a lot of power

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,540
Of the wicked Bob

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,720
And the spiritual darkness

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,940
We asked Bob

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,260
To come

27
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,520
And to reveal the conspiracy

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,800
In the skies

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,580
Above you

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,060
And open up

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,380
Every deceitful work

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,540
Of conspiracy

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,200
You know

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,080
The things that it's done

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,980
The symbols and the emblems

36
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,440
Of Bob

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,340
Now

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,840
A lot of people

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,920
Loved

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,340
The hour of

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,280
Slug

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,480
Actually

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,720
They're in bodies

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,640
With two legs

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,100
They have two eyes

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,320
They have two ears

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,660
And their mouth

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,580
Is filled

49
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,140
With

50
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,700
Bob's

51
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,300
Spiracy

52
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
And they're

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,740
They're

54
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,020
Looking

55
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,780
At you

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:06,780


57
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,580
I think

58
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:10,740
We're

59
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,760
I think

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,060
We might

61
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,460
Still be

62
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,460
You're

63
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,220
You're still

64
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,460
On

65
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,820
Audio

66
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,460
Audio

67
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm hearing

68
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,080
I hear you

69
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,220
The listeners

70
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,860
You're hearing

71
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,880
So how do we

72
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,480
Do this

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
Please be patient

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,340
As we

75
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,500
Work through

76
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,120
A brief

77
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,200
Technical difficulty

78
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,980
This is

79
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,640
A skit

80
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
It's a skit

81
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,360
It's a skit about people trapped

82
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,260
And they're trapped in a radio show

83
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,880
And then they can't get out

84
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,880
So soon soon soon

85
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,740
There will be an escape

86
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,040
There will be an escape

87
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,640
Zombie air

88
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,280
Zombie air

89
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Well you know we got

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,220
We're going to stay on here

91
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,320
So why don't we stay on

92
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,160
Until someone shows up

93
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,940
I've got to go out and meet

94
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,380
My ride

95
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,320
Yes and that's your ride right now

96
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,760
Say Byron spin us some more music

97
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,660
Alright we will be working with these technical difficulties

98
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,400
Right at the moment

99
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
And I'll be right back

100
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,760
There's water all over the place

101
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,940
The water

102
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,500
The sounds

103
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,360
The various things that are going on

104
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,060
And we are trying to deal

105
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,820
With the technical difficulties at the moment

106
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,380
Ah

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


119
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


120
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


121
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


122
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


123
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


124
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


125
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


126
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


127
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


128
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


129
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


130
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


131
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


132
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


133
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


134
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920


135
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,920

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,560
Ah

151
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:37,560

Ah

154
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,280


155
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,280


156
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,300
Ah

157
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,840
Ah

158
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:38,840


159
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:38,880
Ah

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,560
Ah

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:39,620


168
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:39,620


169
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,600
No no no no no no it's synthetic it's not even close

170
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,020
I don't understand

171
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,000
What what

172
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,260
I don't understand what are you talking about

173
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,280
No no no

174
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,100
Agnes Agnes listen to me listen to me

175
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,280
It doesn't know where Lloyd is

176
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
It doesn't know anything

177
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,700
It only knows what they program it to say

178
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:58,920
I don't know

179
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:58,920


180
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,060
No, shut up!

181
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,680
They can't wait for me to come outside.

182
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,740
They've come to collect me.

183
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,080
The experiment is over.

184
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
They've come to pick up their petri dish,

185
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,180
and they sent a machine to do it.

186
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,120
Agnes, it is a fucking machine.

187
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,960
You can see for yourself they're sending a machine.

188
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,420
Okay, okay.

189
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,760
Okay?

190
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,120
Okay.

191
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,500
Okay.

192
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:13,900
Okay.

193
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,220
Okay.

194
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,580
Okay.

195
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,920
Okay.

196
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
Okay.

197
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,580
Okay.

198
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,060
An anti-nation or a loosed-in state of oftentimes

199
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,880
Think about politics at twenty-two

200
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,320
Mixed with your single syllables of fashionable groove

201
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,680
The rest of incoherence and the arrogance of you

202
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,120
With a slight effect in accents you'll be hailed like the true

203
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
If it's too stupid to be said it's sung

204
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,880
If it rhymes it'll never be meaningful

205
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,700
You'll never hear a valid point at number one

206
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,280
Cause if it's too stupid to be said it's sung

207
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,620
If it's too stupid to be said it's sung

208
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,300
If it rhymes it'll never seem meaningful

209
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,560
You won't learn anything from radio one

210
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,900
Cause if it's too stupid to be said it's sung

211
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,380
If it's too stupid to be said it's sung

212
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,360
If it rhymes it'll never seem meaningful

213
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,200
You can rock all you like in the midnight zone

214
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,640
But if it's too stupid to be said it's sung

215
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,040
If it's too stupid to be said it's sung

216
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,000
If it rhymes it'll never be meaningful

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,300
You'll never hear a valid point at number one

218
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,600
Cause if it's too stupid to be said it's sung

219
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,600


220
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,840
You'll never hear a valid point at number one

221
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Cause if it's too stupid to be said it's sung

222
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,140
Cause if it's too stupid to be said it's sung

223
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,120
Anyway, I'm going to give a quick rundown on the Church of the Subgenius

224
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,040
for those who don't know what it's all about.

225
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,280
There's really only three things you have to understand.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,100
Bob, which is this guy, well, this is a picture of Bob.

227
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,100
This is not Bob.

228
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,860
We often have to explain.

229
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Oh, right there are more Dobbs heads than you'll ever see anywhere else.

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
Every little detail in there is a Dobbs head.

231
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,400
Your mind has just been bent beyond comprehension.

232
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,020
I've got you to look at that thing.

233
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,280
Now it's too late.

234
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,960
Memberships are only $30 at the sales table.

235
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,680
Anyway, to put it real quickly, in 1953,

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,600
this unusually talented,

237
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,540
but also, and lucky, unbelievably lucky,

238
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,000
but also unbelievably stupid,

239
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,500
salesman, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

240
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,440
was seized up in the spirit

241
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,900
by, not exactly God,

242
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,780
but this alien space monster that calls itself Jehovah One

243
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,680
that has been posing as God to various cultures throughout history.

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,120
But to Bob, he told the truth.

245
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Which was that for, since time immemorial,

246
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
there's been a conspiracy,

247
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,300
yes, a real conspiracy, not one of these silly ones,

248
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,280
that, I mean, all those other conspiracies,

249
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
except Roswell, saucer crashes, and 9-11,

250
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,220
all that, you can believe everything.

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,380
Go ahead.

252
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,060
But the real conspiracy is a conspiracy of plain, ordinary, garden-variety, normal people

253
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,120
who automatically, instinctively,

254
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,400
steal away and screw up the slack

255
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,760
of the weirdos, the abnormals, the disbelievers,

256
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,740
and those who will believe anything,

257
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,240
which is probably many of you here.

258
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,480
And the slack of the abnormals,

259
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,180
and we'll get into that a little bit more later,

260
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,760
one thing you won't hear me do is define slack.

261
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,460
That's what you have to do for yourself.

262
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,400
For $30 from us, you can,

263
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,560
you can perform weddings and funerals,

264
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,220
you can, when the aliens finally get here,

265
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,140
you can destroy everybody you ever disliked,

266
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,920
and live forever, you get to do all that for $30,

267
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,960
but we won't tell you what slack is,

268
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,740
because it's different for each individual.

269
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:11,660
Anyway, Bob kind of kept all these secrets close to his wallet for decades, really.

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,580
And just in the late 70s,

271
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,200
he hired me,

272
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,700
and, well I still haven't been paid yet,

273
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,600
but he talked me and my partner Dr. Philo Drummond

274
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,020
into making this little $1 pamphlet

275
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,660
that had his truths all packed into 16 pages.

276
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,840
That damn pamphlet costs almost a buck for print.

277
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,160
So, um, we, strangely enough,

278
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,340
the pamphlet by Bob's Magic,

279
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,780
although 150 book publishers had turned down our book proposal,

280
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,860
this guy found it in the backseat of my sister-in-law's car,

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,220
found the little pamphlet, went,

282
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,500
this would make a great book.

283
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,720
To make a long story short,

284
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,400
there's now been like five or six or seven books,

285
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,480
I can't remember, three of them are still in print,

286
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,460
the book of the subgenius is in its 20th printing,

287
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,080
we've been doing the Hour of Slack radio show for 25 years or something,

288
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,720
you'd think I'd get a life.

289
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,280
And I'm not the only one,

290
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,760
there's also a subgenius radio show in Atlanta

291
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
and one in San Francisco,

292
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,680
and they're just all over the place.

293
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,360
And we whipped out DVDs,

294
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,240
as seen on Night Flight,

295
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,100
and, uh, if you're that old,

296
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,460
and you name it, it's all over their sales table

297
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,280
where the beautiful Princess Leigh is setting everything up.

298
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,520
Bob?

299
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,420
Bob?

300
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,120
Bob?

301
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,520
Bob?

302
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,520


303
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,080
Bob?

304
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,260
Bob?

305
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:50,860
Bob?

306
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,460
Bob?

307
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,820
Bob?

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000


309
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,640
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

310
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,040
I bring you a warning.

311
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,900
Every one of you listening to my voice,

312
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,300
tell the world,

313
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,160
tell this to everybody wherever they are,

314
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,940
and watch the sky.

315
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,400
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

316
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

317
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,920
Shazam?

318
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,820
And I say it is possible

319
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,180
for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being seen.

320
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,240
The last ball.

321
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,860
The last ball.

322
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:38,980
The last ball.

323
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,040
The last ball.

324
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,080
The last ball.

325
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,260
The last ball.

326
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,280
The last ball.

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,000
The last ball.

328
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


330
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


331
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


333
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


334
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


335
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


336
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000


338
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,520
You yuck middies.

339
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,260
You bloated idiot.

340
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,360
You stupid fat还有.

341
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,020
That'll hurt.

342
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,900
That'll hurt.

343
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,960
You.

344
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:56,760


345
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,240


346
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,680
You bloated idiot.

347
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,480
You stupid fat have.

348
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,120
You.

349
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,140
Come on, shut the fuck up.

350
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,380
It's quite a joke.

351
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,700
It's quite a joke.

352
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,920
I tried the prop.

353
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,240
Groovy.

354
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,980
Right, Bob?

355
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,780
Bob?

356
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,660
Bob?

357
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,700
Wait a minute.

358
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,780
How did this happen?

359
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,700
We're smarter than this.

360
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,300
Apparently not.

361
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,580
Bob?

362
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,340
Bob?

363
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
Bob?

364
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,760
Bob?

365
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Bob?

366
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,960
Bob?

367
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,920
Bob?

368
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,000
Bob?

369
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000


370
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,560
Bob?

371
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,180
Long call, babe.

372
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,860
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

373
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,060
Apparently, Bob came and did something

374
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,060
with all of them.

375
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,500
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

376
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:16,000
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

377
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
Bob?

378
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,320
Bob?

379
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


380
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


381
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


382
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


383
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


384
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


385
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


386
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


387
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


388
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,440


389
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,440


390
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,420
And you ain't earned the last earnest tea bass.

391
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,380
Praise earnest tea bass, friends.

392
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,940
That musical piece was done by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

393
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,860
your host and prayer partner under Bob.

394
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,140
But I made it using a lot of pieces edited by Fernand and Andy Lemur,

395
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,820
who also did our opening noises and credits.

396
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,960
Before that, we heard some of the Starwood Festival revival from last July.

397
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:52,080
And before that, the great song, if it's too stupid to be said, it's sung,

398
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,360
was by The Attery Squash from an upcoming CD and CD website,

399
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,460
myspace.com slash theattrysquash for more.

400
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,640
There are two Ts in Attery.

401
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,580
The crazy guy ranting was from the movie Bug by William Friedkin,

402
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,600
and now more crazy guys in bugs.

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,720
They changed the meridian from the Paris,

404
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,360
meridian which is 2.2 degrees,

405
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,940
and we're concentrating on the number 33.33,

406
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,300
to establish 2012 based on the Paris meridian.

407
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,360
Now, which one would you think would be right?

408
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,880
You see, if they can get you out of time sink,

409
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,040
if they can take you out of knowing the times and the seasons,

410
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,980
they've got your soul.

411
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,860
Satan has enslaved you by changing times and laws.

412
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,500
And basically, the 33.33 degrees north from the equator to Mount Hermon,

413
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,780
the longitude of the Earth based on the Paris meridian,

414
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,640
seems to have been regarded as increasingly sensitive

415
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,080
due to the louder dissemination of knowledge

416
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,980
during the Industrial Revolution and needed to be obstructed.

417
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,640
I don't really understand.

418
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,620
You have to explain to me.

419
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:15,940
What is it?

420
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:15,940


421
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:15,940


422
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:15,940


423
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:15,940


424
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,600
What is going on, Peter?

425
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,280
Listen, listen!

426
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,920
If you want to know what is going on,

427
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,460
you have to listen to me.

428
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:22,980
I've listened to you.

429
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,540
You have to.

430
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,140
I'm listening.

431
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,800
Because you don't know the fucking enormity of what we're dealing with.

432
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,540
I'm listening.

433
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,220
May the 29th, 1954.

434
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,460
A consortium of bankers, industrialists, corporate CEOs, and politicians

435
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,060
held a series of meetings over three days at the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek-Collin.

436
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,560
They drew up a plan for maintaining the status quo.

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,440
It's the way things are.

438
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,720
It's the rich get richer.

439
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,780
The poor get poorer.

440
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,680
They devised a plan to manipulate technology, economics, the media, population control,

441
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,140
world religion to keep things the way they are.

442
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,200
And they have continued to meet once a year, every year since the original meeting.

443
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Look it up.

444
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,060
Okay.

445
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,240
Under their orders, the CIA had smuggled Nazi scientists into the States

446
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,440
to work with the American military at Cowspan,

447
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,020
developing an inter-epidermal tracking microchip.

448
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,320
A what?

449
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,200
It's a surveillance tool.

450
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,940
It's a computer chip that has been implanted in the skin of every human.

451
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,360
Being born on the planet since 1982.

452
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,800
The test group for the prototype was the People's Temple.

453
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,860
And when the Reverend Jim Jones threatened to expose them,

454
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,200
he and every member of his church were assassinated.

455
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,700
Oh, Jesus.

456
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,240
But it's not enough just to attract people to spy on them.

457
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,920
They want control.

458
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,440
Yeah.

459
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,980
So they create the intelligence, manned, interface, biochip,

460
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,940
a subcutaneous transponder, a computer chip imprinted with living brain cells.

461
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
They needed lab rats to...

462
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,220
They tested and they found us.

463
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,860
Me in the Gulf and another soldier working at Cowspan at the time,

464
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,160
Tim McVeigh.

465
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,900
Oh, wait.

466
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,920
They turned us into fucking zombies.

467
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,120
Remote control assassins.

468
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,900
And then they picked Tim up, chucked him in the prison factory,

469
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
but I found my chip and I cut it out.

470
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,040
So they sent me back to the lab for further testing and a new experiment.

471
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,260
You're John Doe number two.

472
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

473
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,920
That's who they want me to be.

474
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,860
That is the flaw in the IMI biochip.

475
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,980
They can't get to everybody.

476
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,720
People slip through the cracks.

477
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,280
They find the chip, they cut it out.

478
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,960
Like me or Ted Kaczynski.

479
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,660
They need a chip that will self-perpetuate,

480
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,540
that will spread like a virus

481
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,360
that people can pass to each other, to everyone.

482
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,980
They got it!

483
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,580
Oh, you mean the bugs.

484
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,900
They got the bugs.

485
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,140
A living, breathing organism.

486
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Oh, my God!

487
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,680
The ultimate parasite implanted by a queen bug,

488
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,960
the supermother who mates with the drone, lays egg cells,

489
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,200
and the body of the host,

490
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,380
and governs a growing army of rapidly multiplying brainwashing bugs.

491
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,120
They gave those things to you and you gave them to me.

492
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,040
You gave those fucking things to me!

493
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,300
Baby!

494
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,460
What?

495
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,560
Well, of course you did!

496
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,100
Agnes!

497
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,400
I want you to know

498
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,440
that I'm happy for you.

499
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,180
I want nothing but

500
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,940
the best for you.

501
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,540
Oh.

502
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,060
And all a version of me

503
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,340
is being promoted like me.

504
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,840
Will he go down you in a theater?

505
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,440
Does he speak eloquently?

506
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,860
And will you have his baby?

507
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm sure you'll really make an excellent mother.

508
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,880
But the love you gave and we made was it able to be

509
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,440
good enough for you to be open wide?

510
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,860
No.

511
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,940
And every time you look at me,

512
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,640
I just think it's me.

513
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,840
Because you know how you hope you'll hold me until you die.

514
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,460
But you're still alive.

515
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
Because I'm here

516
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,800
to remind you

517
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,180
of the mess you left when you went away.

518
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,160
It's not fair

519
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,980
to deny me

520
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,380
of the cross I did that you gave to me.

521
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,520
You wanna know

522
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,680
what I know?

523
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,620
Things seem very well.

524
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,420
You look peaceful.

525
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,420
I'm not quite as well.

526
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,020
But thought you should know.

527
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,320
Did you forget about me?

528
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,120
Mrs. Duplicity?

529
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,140
I hate to bug you in the middle of the fair.

530
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,300
There was a snap in the face.

531
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,220
How quickly I was replaced.

532
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,520
And all you're thinking of me

533
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,500
when he fucks you.

534
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,400
But the love you gave and we made was it able to be

535
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,000
good enough for you to be open wide?

536
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,580
No.

537
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,700
And every time you speak his name

538
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,900
does he know how you hope you'll hold me until you die?

539
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,600
But you're still alive.

540
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,880
Because I'm here

541
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,420
to remind you

542
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,280
of the mess you left when you went away.

543
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,120
It's not fair

544
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,040
to deny me

545
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,540
of the cross I did that you gave to me.

546
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,620
You wanna know

547
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:31,940
oh

548
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,320
oh

549
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
and it should be me and the man that was mean.

550
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm not gonna feel this.

551
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,040
So close your eyes.

552
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,800
Oh, don't you know it.

553
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,220
And every time my stress fails.

554
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,200
And someone else's back.

555
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,300
And I'm out here waiting.

556
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,300


557
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,300


558
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,300


559
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,300


560
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,300


561
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:15,000
I know you feel it, I can feel it, cause I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away.

562
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:24,380
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me.

563
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:33,480
Cause I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away.

564
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:42,740
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me.

565
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,080
You ought to know.

566
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,680
The Duke of Uke did it, live at the Portland Subgenius Devival last October.

567
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:11,320
The Duke's website is hard to read out, but you'll find links to all of our musical contributors on the log of each show at subgenius.com and click on the radio button.

568
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:19,140
Now back to Starwood and following that, a nice juicy excerpt from a really great movie called The Invention of Lying.

569
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,040
Friends, really, and this is an honest statement.

570
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:32,100
The Church of the Subgenius is the only alternative to work that absolutely does not involve wealth.

571
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,360
I can promise you that.

572
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,500
Wearing that subgenius t-shirt for sale right over there might be the only thing, the one single thing that keeps you from getting a raise at your job.

573
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,020
Now you just think about that.

574
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,380
Work, work, work, work, work.

575
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,940
It's tiring just thinking about it, ain't it?

576
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,360
Work makes me tired.

577
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,440
Does it make you tired?

578
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,060
And after you finish working, what do they make you do?

579
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,700
Retire.

580
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,300
So it says all you get, work, work, work.

581
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:14,980
And I want you to, when you visit our sales table over there and speak with our beautiful swaggers, we call them, they sell our swag.

582
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,360
You just think about that.

583
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,800
Keep me from working, friends.

584
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,700
And keep them busy.

585
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,940
This is Phil Proctor.

586
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,820
And David Osman.

587
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,780
Of the Firesign Theater.

588
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,980
And we're enjoying listening to the hour of slag.

589
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,660
I'm slacking off myself.

590
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,740
24 hours ago, Mark Bellison was just your typical nobody writer.

591
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,300
Today, people are saying he has new information about what happens after you die.

592
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,580
I know some things, some very important things about...

593
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,560
What happens to you after you die.

594
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,680
Everything you need to know is written on these pizza boxes.

595
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,980
Number one, there is a man in the sky who controls everything.

596
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,340
Number two...

597
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

598
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,780
What does he look like?

599
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,700
Tall, big hands, making stuff, good head of hair.

600
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,200
What ethnicity is he?

601
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,820
He's a new...

602
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,440
Type of ethnicity.

603
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,620
He's a mixture of all our ethnicities.

604
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,960
Does he live in the clouds?

605
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,480
No.

606
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,180
Do we see him?

607
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,620
No.

608
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,560
He lives higher than the clouds, too high to see him.

609
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,540
So he lives in space?

610
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,600
Not that high.

611
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,240
Sort of in the thermosphere?

612
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,040
Sorry, people.

613
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,400
I've got a lot to get through here.

614
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,040
I mean, just...

615
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,880
Man lives in the sky.

616
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,860
You can't see him.

617
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,820
He controls everything.

618
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,780
Cool?

619
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,440
Good.

620
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,980
Number two.

621
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,700
Number three.

622
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,200
When you die, you don't disappear into an eternity of nothingness.

623
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,560
Instead, you go to a really great place.

624
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,160
Number three.

625
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,080
In that place, everyone will get a mansion.

626
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,120
What kind of mansion?

627
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,920
The best mansion you could think of.

628
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,880
I was thinking of a horrible mansion.

629
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,840
Well, no.

630
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,160
It's the best mansion you could ever think of.

631
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,840
Not the one you're thinking of right now, but ever.

632
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,180
Whatever the best mansion...

633
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,140
Whatever mansion is you'd like, that's the one you're gonna get.

634
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,140
Number four.

635
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,420
When you die, all the people you love will be there.

636
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,640
Will they have their own mansions?

637
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

638
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, of course.

639
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,180
Everyone gets a mansion.

640
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,500
What if I want them to live in my mansion?

641
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,760
Well, that's fine.

642
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,820
They'll leave their mansion.

643
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,960
They'll come and live with you, won't they?

644
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,920
What happens to their mansion?

645
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,460
I don't know.

646
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,760
It goes back on the market.

647
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,960
Can we...

648
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,240
Number five.

649
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,620
When you die, there will be free ice cream.

650
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
For everyone.

651
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,820
All day and all night.

652
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,020
Whatever.

653
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,180
Whatever.

654
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,380
What are the flavors you can think of?

655
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,820
Even bad flavors?

656
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,440
Why would you think of bad flavors?

657
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
You just said every flavor I could think of.

658
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,280
Oh, no.

659
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,220
I just thought of vanilla and scones.

660
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,680
Well, don't eat that then.

661
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,480
I just thought the chocolate sauce was diarrhea.

662
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,540
Well, don't put that on the ice cream then.

663
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,140
What is the matter with you people?

664
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,140
Can we...

665
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,040
Please.

666
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,060
Number six.

667
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,000
If you do bad things, you won't get to go to this great place when you die.

668
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,600
Where will you go?

669
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,280
A terrible place.

670
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,640
The worst place imaginable.

671
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,460
What constitutes a bad thing?

672
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,180
All things.

673
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,780
It's painful crimes, rape, murder, things like that.

674
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,980
Is punching someone bad?

675
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,500
Yes.

676
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,880
What if they're trying to hurt you?

677
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,080
No, it's fine.

678
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,280
Is cursing bad?

679
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:31,860
No.

680
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
What about being late for work?

681
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,580
No, that's fine.

682
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,160
I mean, you might lose your job if the boss doesn't like it, but it won't affect what

683
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,120
happens to you after you die.

684
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,260
What about if you forget to feed your dog?

685
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,940
Well, then if you forget, I mean, it's bad for the dog.

686
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,060
If the dog dies, it's bad.

687
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,640
But it's not...

688
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,040
I mean, don't do it on purpose.

689
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,040
Don't buy a dog just to starve it for a laugh.

690
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,700
But...

691
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,180
It's fine.

692
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,180


693
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,180


694
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,180


695
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,180


696
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,340
I mean...

697
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,400
If I do just one bad thing, do I go to that bad place?

698
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:57,900
No.

699
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,160
You get three chances.

700
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,480
Three bad things...

701
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,200
And you're out.

702
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,900
Like baseball.

703
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,760
So long, Mr. Briggs.

704
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,320
So, anything else?

705
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,020
Yeah.

706
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,700
Oh, please, can we just move on?

707
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,020
No.

708
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,620
We have to know everything that's bad.

709
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,100
Fine.

710
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,180
Is it bad to wear pants?

711
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


712
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


713
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


714
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


715
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


716
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


717
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


718
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


719
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,180


720
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,560
We've been through this.

721
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,020
The main ones are things like hurting people physically on purpose, okay?

722
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,000
Taking their stuff.

723
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,680
Doing things to people they don't want done.

724
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,480
Murdering people on purpose.

725
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,900
Okay.

726
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,160
Number nine.

727
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,580
The man in the sky who controls everything decides if you go to the good place or the

728
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,140
bad place.

729
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,700
He also decides who lives and who dies.

730
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,260
Does he cause natural disasters?

731
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,040
Yes.

732
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,500
Did he cause my mom to get cancer?

733
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:52,940
No.

734
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,420
Yes.

735
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,060
Did he cause that tree to land on my car last week?

736
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,660
Yeah.

737
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,720
Did he kill my dad with that heart attack?

738
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,620
Yeah.

739
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,800
I say fuck the man that lives in the sky!

740
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,320
Yeah, that guy's evil!

741
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,420
That guy's a coward, hiding up there doing bad things to us.

742
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,020
Why doesn't he do it to our faces?

743
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,740
We have to stop that evil bastard before he kills us all.

744
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,060
Wait, wait, listen.

745
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,820
The man who lives in the sky and controls everything is also responsible for all the

746
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,900
good stuff that happens.

747
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,180
He's the guy that saved my life on that fishing trip when the boat capsized?

748
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,820
Yes.

749
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,560
Did he capsize the boat?

750
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,740
Yeah.

751
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,660
He killed my grandmother and left me those millions of dollars?

752
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,780
You bet, yes.

753
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,620
So he's the one who cured my mom's cancer?

754
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,620
Yeah.

755
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,180
So he's the one who saved my mom's life?

756
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,180


757
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,180


758
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,180


759
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,180


760
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,180


761
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,680
Yeah.

762
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,840
So he's kind of a good guy, but he's also kind of a prick, too.

763
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,520
Right, but check this out, okay?

764
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,580
Number 10.

765
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,820
Even if the man in the sky does bad stuff to you, he makes up for it by giving you an

766
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,920
eternity of good stuff after you die.

767
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,840
As long as you don't do any of that bad stuff that you mentioned, right?

768
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,680
Yeah, of course.

769
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
So it's kind of a test.

770
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,420
Yeah.

771
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,460
Well, that's everything I know.

772
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,940
How do you know all these things?

773
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
Because the man in the sky told me.

774
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,820
Yeah, well, how come we're just finding out about these things now, millions of years

775
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,600
into our existence?

776
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,280
I forgot.

777
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,640
I've seen all the stuff he does.

778
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,480
Thank you.

779
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:53,160
That was all from the invention of lying, which, as you might surmise, is a very subgenius

780
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,160


781
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,980
leaf film, whether it knows it or not.

782
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,000
It came out very recently, and I would recommend it.

783
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:06,220
But now, a cover of the Negative Land song, Roy, Store And Sportsline from the 180Gs of

784
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,720
negativeland.com.

785
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,040
All right, and we will be talking about anything from Pico to Popnoe.

786
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,160
Now, this is the music for Negative Land.

787
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,020
Oh, whatever you wanna do

788
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,780
Soda gum, chewing water, whatever is up

789
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,800
Somebody asked me one time

790
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,460
What is chewing water?

791
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,520
I'm like, you know

792
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,180
It's ice as we used to call it

793
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,580
But same difference

794
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,560
And it's better than cold coffee

795
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,580
I'll tell you that

796
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,300
Okay, let's

797
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,920
Let's take a chance and see what's going on

798
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
Hello, who's this?

799
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,920
Join us in a glass of beer

800
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Join us what?

801
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,960
I see

802
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,900
I didn't think three-year-old kids would be up this late

803
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,280
I don't know

804
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,900
There's gotta be a way

805
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,140
We thought they weren't on TV

806
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,740
We were wrong

807
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,780
Well, we'll get enough of those and put them together

808
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,600
And just turn it over to them

809
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
They can't handle it

810
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,820
Can't do anything to children anyhow

811
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,080
So it probably wouldn't do any good

812
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,220
Eventually we'll be on

813
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,040
We'll have this thing set up

814
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,480
So that we can

815
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,900
Let the little kids like that can't

816
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,420
Play around

817
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,840
Or at least the big boys

818
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,420
With the little kid brains

819
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,180
Or like they say

820
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,820
Another brain

821
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,160
And it'd be a half-wit

822
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,100
Hello there

823
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,660
You wanna talk about the 49ers?

824
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,140
Hi, I'm Gene Stapleton

825
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,200
A PTA member

826
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,180
Hello there, PTA member

827
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,820
You wanna talk about the PTA or football?

828
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,780
Um, considering

829
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,120
I'm serving on natural resource

830
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,140
Oh, I see, okay

831
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,680
I thought you had to

832
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,920
Facilitate it this time of day

833
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,900
But you can't figure that one out

834
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, well

835
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,820
They got the kicks out of that now

836
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,100
And that'll keep them happy for school

837
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,360
And us, we'll go back to the PAM now

838
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,800
We'll go back to the PAM now

839
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Another brain

840
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,140
And it'd be a half-wit

841
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,500
Hello there

842
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,820
This is Peter Schofield speaking

843
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,120
Another one of those idiots

844
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,740
How do we allow them to be on the air this long?

845
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,700
You know

846
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,660
Does that make you feel good, fella?

847
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,240
You feel real happy now?

848
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,660
You're cheating, huh?

849
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,900
This is Peter Schofield

850
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,400
I wonder what's up

851
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,700
I wonder if their parents know that they do these things

852
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,260
Or maybe they don't have parents

853
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,040
Maybe they were hatched rather than born

854
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,240
I think that's it

855
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,820
As I said before

856
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,260
Give them another brain and they'd be a half-wit

857
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,420
But what do you expect from dropouts?

858
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,140
And now we go down to line two

859
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,260
Line two

860
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,440
Do we do

861
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,240
One of the uh

862
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,320
We go to line two

863
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,500
Okay, line two

864
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:24,940
Hello

865
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,020
Give them another brain and they'd be

866
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,200
That's right

867
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,920
That's about the way it would be

868
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,460
Did you call him back?

869
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,120
You got his telephone number?

870
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,780
Okay

871
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,420
As long as I

872
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,500
You got his telephone number

873
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,640
I'll be getting the number tomorrow

874
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
You got the recording

875
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,060
So we got it made

876
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,380
It would

877
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,320
Take more than a

878
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,740
Even a

879
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,980
Another brain

880
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,620
As long as you got the number

881
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,700
That's what counts

882
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,540
Okay

883
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,520
So we took care of the gender by now I think

884
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,160
Or we will tomorrow

885
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,820
Hi, Mother

886
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,160
You're late today

887
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,220
I was having a cold with some of the gang

888
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,320
Mother

889
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,520
Bob

890
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,500
Was having a party this Saturday night

891
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,160
No, I'm afraid not

892
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,520
Marion

893
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,800
It's too much work and worry and money

894
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,500
What's too much work and worry and money?

895
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,120
Oh, Marion has some idea about having

896
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,320
Bob

897
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,160
Over some night

898
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,100
I'd have to break and go to a lot of trouble

899
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,940
Bob

900
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,740
Was having a party this Saturday, Dad

901
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,420
That's wonderful

902
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,440
Sounds like a lot of fun

903
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,680
You haven't seen much

904
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:37,900
Bob

905
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,000
Lately, have you?

906
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,920
I used to think you two were great pals

907
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,180
I know

908
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,580
I seem to have gotten out of touch with

909
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:44,760
Bob

910
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,340
Somehow

911
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,720
And it seems to me

912
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,080
They were always the ones

913
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,220
Who didn't seem quite to fit in with me

914
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,980
And who didn't fit in with the others

915
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,900
Mother, may I be excused?

916
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,800
I have some homework to do

917
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,420
Yes

918
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,980
She ought to know how to talk to Bob

919
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,440
It does seem that Marion's left out of the gang

920
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
More and more lately

921
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,720
She's just a child

922
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,340
Maybe it'd do her some good to have a little party

923
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,120
Nothing elaborate

924
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,660
Mal, why are you getting so excited all of a sudden?

925
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,080
Well, I'll tell you, Evelyn

926
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,060
Bob

927
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,660
Don't get me wrong

928
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,620
Marion's a wonderful kid

929
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,220
I think she studies chemistry

930
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,580
Too much

931
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,320
What's got into you, Mal?

932
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,940
Some people don't appreciate you until they get to know you

933
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,980
I can remember kids like that

934
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,660
I just want Bob

935
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,600
I suppose what you mean is

936
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,500
No

937
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,900
No, Evelyn, that isn't what I mean at all

938
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,700
Bob

939
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,300
Always seemed to be snaring and giggling at me

940
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,720
Evelyn, I didn't mean to upset you like this

941
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,140
I know Bob

942
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,780
And I understand Bob

943
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,960
And I like Bob

944
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,540
But

945
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,840
Well, you know you are shy

946
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,260
And back in school

947
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,720
I suppose you're right, Malcolm

948
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,240
To tell you the truth

949
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,440
I'm scared to have Bob over here

950
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,300
I never knew how to act or what to say

951
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,960
It's different with boys

952
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,880
You give them a piece of it and it's all the same to them

953
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,980
The most successful people

954
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,000
Weren't always the most popular kids

955
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,980
Remember Bob back in the days at school

956
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,200
He was a good boy

957
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,200


958
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,200


959
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
He was always on the fringe

960
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,700
The way you say Marion is

961
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,500
But he's the most popular and successful man

962
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
Yes, I remember

963
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,180
But somewhere along the line

964
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,160
Bob learned to get along with other people

965
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,280
Or he wouldn't be the community leader he is today

966
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,880
Maybe I could arrange a little party for her

967
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,860
But I'll need your help

968
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,900
I think I will have some more coffee

969
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,620
Well

970
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,580
Now all we have to worry about is whether Bob is going to call or not

971
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,560
Let's g-

972
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:09,560


973
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,140
Hello, I'm Joey Perkins with the KKK

974
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,100
It's okkk to blackout

975
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,460
Joey Perkins with the KKK

976
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,600
I guess you could call it a bad O-R-G

977
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,360
Where'er Joey Perkins with the Vitterproblem

978
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,920
You sleep badly down the road

979
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,540
So cover up history, doubt tradition.

980
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:40,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm strained since the Archbishop's unprecedented invitation for homosexual sex in the hotel's courtyard

981
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,820
when he snuck out for a secret rendezvous with his sex mistress in South America.

982
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:56,520
Pope Benedict XVI is homosexual for the first time since the Roman Catholic Church invited Anglicans to vote on whether to allow PR reports to move forward.

983
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,420
For Senator Reid, it's been a week of denying coverage to those with pre-existing PR news.

984
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,480
Like me.

985
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,580
President Obama's angry about PR news and homosexuals.

986
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,080
Tonight, the U.S. Senate is using the party's overwhelming dominance to undermine democracy in recent regional elections.

987
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,740
From Washington, a rocket hit PR News.

988
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,520
Here they are on their way to school on a beautiful spring day.

989
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:30,140
But no matter where they go or what they do, they always try to remember what to do if the atom bomb explodes right then.

990
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,500
We believe the U.S. is an impossible powerful Russia.

991
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,500


992
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,500


993
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:55,500


994
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,720
our first clutch

995
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,660
erg

996
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,500
all

997
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,580
we

998
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,360
man

999
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,720
movement

1000
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,520
there's my

1001
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:09,520


1002
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,220
movement

1003
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:10,500
movement

1004
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:10,560
movement

1005
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,460
movement

1006
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,300
movement

1007
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,000
movement

1008
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000


1009
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000


1010
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,760
Try it, and crawl with fun!

1011
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,220
You can crawl again, you crying children!

1012
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,020
You can crawl again, you crying children!

1013
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,660
Here they are on their way to school...

1014
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,160
Here they are, here they are...

1015
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,320
Here they are on their way to school on a beautiful spring day...

1016
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,480
Here they are on their way to school on a beautiful spring day...

1017
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,740
It's a bomb, it's a bomb!

1018
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,920
Nothing can cover it!

1019
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,700
The

1020
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,740
idea that America or any country values individuality

1021
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,540
is the highest ideal is a cheap myth.

1022
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,800
Everybody's an individualist,

1023
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,880
but they don't like individuals.

1024
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,220
Perhaps in simpler times it was true,

1025
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,280
but no modern industrial death culture

1026
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,840
can really afford a population of unpredictables.

1027
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,200
Um, um, Bob, please just,

1028
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,740
you have to believe in everything.

1029
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,360
Bob, please just,

1030
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,380
you have, you have, you have to believe in it.

1031
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,500
Bob, please just,

1032
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,080
you have to believe in everything.

1033
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,460
And especially, um,

1034
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,800
especially, especially,

1035
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,520
um, you have to believe in

1036
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,000
the God that tells you not to believe in it

1037
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,280
because he doesn't want you to know

1038
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,500
what he's been doing to you.

1039
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,100
I don't forget!

1040
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,340
You can crawl!

1041
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,040
I don't forget!

1042
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,500
You can crawl!

1043
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,140
I don't forget!

1044
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,060
And crawl with Brad!

1045
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,120
You can crawl again!

1046
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,720
You can crawl again, children!

1047
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,020
Somebody called PMC did that mix

1048
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,720
using ancient audio clips

1049
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,600
available from subgenius.com.

1050
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,940
Before that, Lemurs, PR News,

1051
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,920
a short Norell Pref cut,

1052
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,300
and a Phineas Narco edit of The Bob Party.

1053
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,740
Now, an oldie from The Psychoskeletons,

1074
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,080
guitar solo

1075
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,200

We don't want no antiprice

1080
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,940
Is it true about your film?

1081
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,380
Nova told us that anyone who sees it, you know...

1082
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,600
Goes insane?

1083
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,780
You'd think they'd blown it a bit out of proportion.

1084
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,640
But they didn't.

1085
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,340
In fact, if anything, they played it down.

1086
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,320
It's about 25 minutes in.

1087
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,380
The people went mad.

1088
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,020
Ripping it.

1089
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,380
They were tearing at each other.

1090
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,920
Tearing at their own eyes.

1091
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,980
It was the Hamburg Film Festival.

1092
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,120
They almost tore down the theater.

1093
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,940
They couldn't get rid of the smell.

1094
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,900
Or the blood.

1095
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,960
It was horrible.

1096
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,080
What's it about?

1097
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,960
My film is based on a real cult.

1098
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,800
A group of fanatics founded back in the time of Constantine.

1099
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,360
A powerful group.

1100
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,800
More ancient than the Templars or the Illuminati.

1101
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,240
Kind of like Lovecraft, you know?

1102
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,820
If that stuff was real.

1103
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,200
They predicted the rise of a second messiah.

1104
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,520
It's all in my film.

1105
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,840
Don't tell the authorities, but I have a print of the film.

1106
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,380
What?

1107
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,920
We could watch it together.

1108
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,360
Cool.

1109
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,060
Cool.

1110
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,400
That evil.

1111
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,800
That thing that happened.

1112
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,300
It's something in the audience.

1113
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,820
Something to grow.

1114
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,220
Something that feeds on the crowd.

1115
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,580
I've seen it dozens of times.

1116
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,500
Mel's seen it too, right?

1117
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,120
And she's perfectly fine.

1118
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,400
These are dark times.

1119
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,340
These are dark times.

1120
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,560
These are dark times.

1121
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,380
The end times predicted by Bob.

1122
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,820
Stupid idiots.

1123
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,380
Stupid idiots.

1124
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,380


1125
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,460
Dressing up in stupid clothes.

1126
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,480
Preaching whatever it takes to get you to buy.

1127
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,400
These are dark times.

1128
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,700
The end times predicted by Bob.

1129
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,300
Did I mention the one law of our church?

1130
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,320
You know, every religion has to have lots of rules.

1131
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:11,040
Just, if for no other reason than to dislike the next religion down the road over their different rules.

1132
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,500
It's not that we love Bob so much.

1133
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,180
It's that we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell.

1134
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,960
Let's get face it.

1135
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,360
You know, we're just like any other religious group.

1136
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,000
But our one law.

1137
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,780
The one single philosophical rule we have.

1138
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,020
Kids, cover your ears.

1139
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,200
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1140
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,220
And you can live by that.

1141
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,520
Reverend Pickles, there's been reading his pre-scriptures.

1142
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,720
You really can live by that.

1143
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,020
I mean, it's an old saying.

1144
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,520
It's not Bob's copyrighted line.

1145
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,100
In fact, in Latin, it has been found scrawled upon walls.

1146
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,180
Copula eam senon posit acceptera jocularum.

1147
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,660
I may have that a little bit wrong, but that's not my fault.

1148
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,860
It was the graffiti writers.

1149
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,320
Bob also said,

1150
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,740
The Lord is a sock puppet for idiots.

1151
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,060
And then he followed that with the odd phrase,

1152
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs is a trick on subgeniuses.

1153
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,700
I don't know.

1154
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,520
Friends, as we've told you time and time again,

1155
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,860
the Church of the Subgenius is not here to forgive your sins.

1156
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,660
We don't care about your sins.

1157
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,820
It's here to rationalize your sins.

1158
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,800
Bob brings not forgiveness,

1159
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,860
because he's not that well connected and he doesn't care.

1160
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,500
He brings an excuse.

1161
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,800
And you can, it comes with our ordainment kit.

1162
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,000
A big frameable document that lawyers really love.

1163
00:50:44,140 --> 00:51:09,480
You have to be kind and honest.

1164
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1165
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1166
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1167
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1168
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1169
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1170
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1171
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1172
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,480


1173
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,540
Sahaja Gita Gita.

1174
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,000
Sahaja Gita!

1175
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,120
It's at the bottom of my heart

1176
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


1177
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


1178
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,120


1179
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,320
Thank you.

1180
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,120
Thank you.

1181
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,260
Thank you.

1182
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,560
Thank you.

1183
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,340
Thank you.

1184
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,980
Thank you.

1185
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,060
Thank you.

1186
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,380
Thank you.

1187
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,880
Thank you.

1188
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,360
Thank you.

1189
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,560
Thank you.

1190
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,120
Thank you.

1191
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,380
Thank you.

1192
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,240
Thank you.

1193
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,560
Thank you.

1194
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,220
I'm living in Arizona.

1195
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,360
I'm living in Arizona.

1196
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,380
I'm living in Arizona.

1197
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,020
I'm living in Arizona.

1198
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,540
Living in Arizona.

1199
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,160
I'm living in Arizona.

1200
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,100
I'm living in Arizona.

1201
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,100
was done

1202
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,120
guitar solo

1203
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,600
Bye, Mom

1204
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,740
Bye, Dad

1205
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,200
I gotta go into space now, Mom

1206
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,340
I gotta get into the rocket ship

1207
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,900
I gotta go into space, Mom

1208
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,480
Dad, I gotta go

1209
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:32,280
And I'm never coming home

1210
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,620
Yeah
