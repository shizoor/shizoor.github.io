1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,600
It was in the year of 1982 that spacemen first discovered the great galactic barrier.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,800
In the past ten years, rocket travel to the moon and the mirror planets have become commonplace.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,080
And yet, the explorers refuse to admit defeat.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,380
It was on June the 2nd, 1987, that the rocket Starcloud made ready for takeoff.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,120
Now hear this! Now hear this!

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,100
The Self Genius Hour of the Starwatch!

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,900
Don't bother me for a while, I'm busy!

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,820
Stupid idiot.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
We'll have to reintegrate, the whole works!

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,280
Prepare to blast off.

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,440
Four, three, zero.

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,640
Fire up number one cyclotron.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,360
Number one ready.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,620
Fire up number two.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,280
Number two ready.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,840
I think that's rubbish.

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,180
What do you think?

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,440
Oh, I think it's terrible.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,360
At least it won't be boring.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:08,960
Hmm.

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,680
10 seconds for launch.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:38,700
Head forragging.

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:38,700


24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,060
Time to nolastes and Farragals.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,480
Hop in, we under go.

26
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,400
upid in the чол

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,820
Thank you.

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,880
Thank you.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,700
Thank you.

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Thank you.

31
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,740
Thank you.

32
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,060
Thank you.

33
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,900
Thank you.

34
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
Thank you.

35
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,480


36
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,360
Thank you.

37
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,940
Thank you.

38
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,340
Thank you.

39
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:38,780
Thank you.

40
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:38,860
Thank you.

41
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,180
Thank you.

42
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,860
And that was the Rudy Schwartz Project.

43
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:51,920
I've almost used up all the music from that particular album, Postal Code of Ham.

44
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Uh,

45
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,580
and, uh,

46
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
and now let's just cut to a bunch of random stuff.

47
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,040
By the way, you've seen Trigger's stuffed self, haven't you?

48
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh, no.

49
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,880
And the Roy Rogers.

50
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,100
What is the Trigger sign, by the way?

51
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,380
No, no, you've never heard of it.

52
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:07,880
You never did?

53
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,560
Well, he had taxidermists prepare his beloved mount, Trigger.

54
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,280
You knew that, right?

55
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
Roy Rogers and Trigger.

56
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,640
The first goat that my family had, its head is mounted on the wall.

57
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,220
Oh, yes.

58
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040
He was a malfeasor.

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,100
His head is mounted on the wall the way that heads of criminals were impaled on pikes outside the Tower of London.

60
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,840
He was, he was, he turned bad.

61
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,560
He was, he was a billy goat.

62
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,460
Your goat turned bad?

63
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
He was a bad goat.

64
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, Big Red.

65
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,580
Bad stuff.

66
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,960
Big Red, he was called.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,240
That's so obscene.

68
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Somehow the sickness got into him.

69
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,880
That sounds really obscene.

70
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,800
Yes, well, uh,

71
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,560
No, he honestly did.

72
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,780
He turned bad and he became a rapist.

73
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,340
See, Big Red, I told you he was obscene.

74
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,760
He was evil, evil.

75
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,460
And his head ended up on the wall.

76
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,240
There's a goat, a big horn.

77
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,620
Let it be a lesson to us all.

78
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,780
Some kind of sheep, a bear, a deer, and a jackalope.

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,460
An ejaculope.

80
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,460
Well, not an ejaculope.

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Hey, that's what I need for my museum.

82
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,320
The ejaculope.

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,120
Look what now has to do.

84
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
We're going hunting now.

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, here's what it'll be.

86
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,700
It's like there's the jackalope head, which is not very big, but it is really a jackalope head with little antlers.

87
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,440
You're not going to modify your fox head?

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
No, the jackalope won't change that.

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,020
We'll just add another little mount about an inch underneath with a little ejaculope dick sticking out.

90
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,620
I'll let you borrow my raccoon bone, my raccoon penis bone.

91
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,220
That can be your ejaculope.

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,000
We have one.

93
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,920
It's called a bacula.

94
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, actually, not a raccoon.

95
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,460
My dad had a collection of, what are those called?

96
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,140
Penis bones?

97
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,660
Yeah, but they have this.

98
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,160
Baculi, the bone.

99
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,980
He has a bear penis bone.

100
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,140
Oh, oh, oh, be long.

101
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,120
They're like swizzle sticks, and he does have a raccoon.

102
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,200
Swizzle stick.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,680
The bear's about this long, but get this.

104
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,760
The walrus is this long.

105
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,440
And it's got scrimshaw on it.

106
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,220
Scrimshaw?

107
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,700
Yeah.

108
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,300
Oh, my God.

109
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,680
He bought a walrus dick bone with scrimshaw on it.

110
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,140
With the tale of Barnacle Bill the Sailor inscribed thereon.

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,980
This might be a good place to do a transition.

112
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,980
My father.

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
Yes, let's change into.

114
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,900
A vampire or whatever.

115
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,840
It is cold up there.

116
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,280
I've heard that it was cold up there.

117
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,560
This is an indelicate story, but it does demonstrate how cold it gets.

118
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,520
They have Quonset huts just about everywhere.

119
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,100
That's the main thing, because they're easy to keep warm.

120
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,740
And the temperature inside is about 60.

121
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,060
They don't let it get up more than that, because it's so dry inside.

122
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
It feels like you're suffocating.

123
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,580
If the temperature got up around 70, with that dryness, it just feels terrible.

124
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,360
Your lips get all cracked.

125
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,260
And I said, I've got to go to the restroom, boys.

126
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,060
Where is it?

127
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,620
And this old sourdough said, well, he said, it's kind of foggy out there.

128
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,200
He said, follow that yellow nylon rope.

129
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,220
And they have ropes.

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,620
There's a green one that goes to the.

131
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,100
Dining hall.

132
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,660
And a red one that goes over to the offices and so forth.

133
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,220
And then there's a yellow one that goes to this latrine.

134
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,060
And he said, follow the yellow nylon rope.

135
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,180
And so I went and used it.

136
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,400
Coming back on the path, it was snow.

137
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,920
Kind of tramped down.

138
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,140
It looked like a crystal laying there.

139
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,060
What do you smell there?

140
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,320
I know what those crystals are.

141
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,600
I know.

142
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:47,700
I know.

143
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,040
Okay.

144
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,940
It was about that big around.

145
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,880
And I picked it up and I got inside.

146
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,740
It had frost on it.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,740
Kind of knocked with frost.

148
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,280
It was rough.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,820
Knocked with frost.

150
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
And you could look at it and tell it was kind of crystalline.

151
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,420
And I threw it down on the table.

152
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,220
Wonk, wonk.

153
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,000
And rolled along.

154
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,160
I said, what kind of mineral is that, guys?

155
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,880
And they took one look at it.

156
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,940
Everyone got it and walked to the other end of the Quonset hut.

157
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,380
Now, I couldn't understand what it was.

158
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,080
And I kind of picked it up and looked at it and brushed some of that frost off of it.

159
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
And you could see it kind of glimmer and shimmer inside.

160
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,020
Yeah, it was a crystal.

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,540
And finally when it thawed out completely, it says, poof, it disappeared.

162
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,740
And it probably smelled bad, right?

163
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
I don't know.

164
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,700
It was too cold.

165
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,360
Was it frozen in a poot?

166
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,780
That's right.

167
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,360
It was frozen in a poot.

168
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,360


169
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,040
That's how I knew.

170
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,160
As soon as I heard it was green crystal, I was like, yep, up in South Dakota, in the

171
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,960
dead of winter, you'll find those around.

172
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,600
You don't want to bring them inside.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,920
It takes about a minute and suddenly it all grows at once.

174
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,980
And, you know, usually it's dogs or not usually.

175
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
It could be about anything.

176
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,880
Hmm?

177
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,640
It could be just about anything.

178
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,740
Yeah.

179
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,580
But it's cold when you get down to that.

180
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:19,820
It's real cold.

181
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,700
Yep, that was Pappy.

182
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,340
A little bit of leftover stuff from his description of his time with the Eskimos.

183
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,840
And that's just a joke.

184
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:41,640
Before that we heard Dr. Howell and me and I forget who else talking about the mounted

185
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,040
ejaculope.

186
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,400
Which I'm actually looking at right now.

187
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,480
So you see, that's real.

188
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,160
And now, PR News.

189
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm singer Frank Ariklender and I'm failing to register as

190
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,540
a foreign singer such as Jesse Clinton and Bill Jackson for the funeral services he did

191
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,660
on behalf of Ukrainian singers such as former President Samuel Patton while working for

192
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,700
singers tied to Paul Manafort.

193
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,840
Manafort is set to go on trial next month on related charges of failing to sing for

194
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,520
the Trump administration on a renegotiated North American free foreign singer agreement.

195
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,680
Among the obstacles, Canada wants PR News Washington.

196
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,960
Members didn't make much progress and it's unclear when they'll be back.

197
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,100
The doubt is 23-26-10-30-80-18.

198
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,760
Democrats tries to racially gerrymand to dilute PR's power.

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,020
Under the rules for the hunt, fewer than 30% of the population are gay.

200
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,140
More than two dozen federal judges would have been allowed to be killed.

201
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,540
California fire officials say they're listening to the deadly PR News from Washington.

202
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,100
If that was the end of that show, that means this is the beginning of this show.

203
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,260
Or not the beginning, but we're probably kind of appearing after a bunch of cuts.

204
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,380
And boy, those cuts were great.

205
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:12,120
That was some great subgenius, old-timey stuff we just heard from all those things I see.

206
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,520
Yeah.

207
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,960
So, and we're back.

208
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,760
Thinking the same different thoughts we never thought before.

209
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,520
Taking you to the edge of responsibility when it comes to your reasonable logic.

210
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,500
Do you want to know what's really, really, really, really, really, really going on?

211
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,220
Or do you just want to sit there in your contrived evil tent of self-satisfaction and cold jammy glue

212
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,260
and expect nothing to come walking down the woods for you?

213
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,820
I think I'll take that lighter choice. I like that lighter choice.

214
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,460
I'll take the red pill.

215
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,860
A pear. A pumpkin or a pear.

216
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, I'm going to move for a pear, not a pumpkin.

217
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,960
They're both vegetables.

218
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,660
I know in the same hermeneutic and glasovic tradition, but it doesn't mean they're related.

219
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,980
I mean, you know, pumpkin pie, you could have pear pie, but a pear and a pumpkin are a bit fast.

220
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:05,960
Right?

221
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,980
Yeah, like a turd and a duck and...

222
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Yeah, like a duck.

223
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Like a turd and a duck egg.

224
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,560
Or a duck and, you know, it's like that dish.

225
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't never...it's just got such an unappetizing name, I don't think I ever want to try it.

226
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:32,320
Then there's a really long name of like when you cook a whale that's stuffed with an elephant,

227
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:40,000
that's stuffed with a horse, that's stuffed with a dog, that's stuffed with a turkey,

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,760
that's stuffed with a chicken, that's stuffed with a hummingbird,

229
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,080
that's stuffed with a spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.

230
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,640
And of course she died.

231
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,880
Right.

232
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,840
You have to remember that part because that was after the...

233
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,700
Remember the intro about Benny Hoodwards and Eugene Starglick and the whole swing orchestra?

234
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,520
Those guys were so great back in the old days before I was at least born.

235
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,980
I wasn't quite in the universe.

236
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,040
Yeah, but I was hoping someday I could get a chance to go to planet Earth,

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,240
spread goodwill among men and women, mostly between squirrels and other small nuts.

238
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,080
You mean the original planet Earth?

239
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,300
The original one, not the Martian one later either.

240
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,000
I know we're all kind of distant or foreign one way or another, but I'm talking about, you know,

241
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,440
some people could really call the Earth, planet Earth, their home.

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,960
And we're just so rudely thrown out by the planet Earth.

243
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,920
Pulling the bone apart.

244
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,040
Onan spoke of this.

245
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,860
Onan spoke at length in the past and recently.

246
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,220
He has had more to say about it as we hear here.

247
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:02,800
And now a disclaimer written by Onan Canterbight, but it applies universally.

248
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,980
Friends, members of the press are here tonight.

249
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,220
I didn't bar them at the door because the Church of the Subgenius has nothing to hide.

250
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,420
That said, there are certain false rumors and misguided opinions about our faith that I need to dispel.

251
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,360
The Subgenius Foundation is not responsible for men or women of legal age who entirely of their own free will

252
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,920
listen to our podcast 24 hours a day for months on end.

253
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,960
And should these dues-paying subgenii elect to turn over a new life,

254
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,880
and offer all their worldly goods and the right of attorney to us,

255
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,820
well, who are we to limit their freedom to do so?

256
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,340
Young people who get the face of Dobbs tattooed in hidden places,

257
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,180
such as their kidneys or lungs,

258
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
do so without our consent or guidance.

259
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,860
We've never been paid to take a fall and look foolish in the eyes of rival cults.

260
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,340
Although we do have an outstanding invoice to that effect.

261
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,040
When our members find slack in their own definition of slack,

262
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,840
be it romance, revenge, or even some twisted form such as employment,

263
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,120
or a lack of social isolation,

264
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,940
we had nothing to do with it.

265
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,360
The Church of the Subgenius does not have members in every nation.

266
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,300
Nor do we bend the ear of popes and presidents.

267
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,060
Nor do we have a hand in Hollywood.

268
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,320
The video game industry is not large enough to do so.

269
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,500
It is largely under our control.

270
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,720
A majority of internet traffic is not directed at subgenius.com.

271
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,420
And therefore, we can't be blamed for your bandwidth issues.

272
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,360
The famous musicians and pro wrestlers and porn stars you like best

273
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,180
may say that they're subgeniuses,

274
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,060
but we neither confirm nor deny any such claim.

275
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,640
Our membership list is available

276
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,320
only to our founder, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

277
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,820
and only for the purpose of selling it to the men from Planet X.

278
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,600
Someone has even advanced the claim that we're a parody

279
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,460
of a mail-order mind control cult.

280
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,600
Is this funny to you?

281
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,520
Is it?

282
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,340
Is it?

283
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,960
I hear yes and I hear no.

284
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,300
Well, you hear this.

285
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,460
The Church of the Subgenius is the public face

286
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,380
of a race of superior mutants

287
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,660
older than humankind itself.

288
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,040
The accusations, the slanders, the mockery

289
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,700
we endure with a chest-bursting pride.

290
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,920
That war you didn't like wasn't caused by us,

291
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,460
and the one you did like wasn't ended by us.

292
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,740
We have answered every inquiry

293
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,860
by federal, state, and local authorities promptly,

294
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,460
including those times when the answer was silence.

295
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,220
Likewise with our prayer partners.

296
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,920
There is not a single documented example

297
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,760
of a failed prayer request among our members,

298
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,200
providing they prayed really hard

299
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,040
and in just the right way.

300
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,860
I hope this will satisfy the reporters in the room.

301
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,720
Now that I have dispelled all these red flags,

302
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,280
and all these reservations,

303
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,380
let me cast Dis-Spell.

304
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,380
Ladies and gentlemen, I am a subgenius.

305
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,260
I stand before you innocent of life's cares

306
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,260
and empowered to take command of any situation I survey.

307
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,940
I have perfect health in mind and body

308
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,520
and shall live in this fashion fully

309
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,160
as long as I so choose.

310
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,660
I owe no money to anyone.

311
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,860
I have a secure home

312
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,620
and permanent prospects for popularity and prosperity.

313
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,620
My family loves me and I them.

314
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,200
My friends are flashing bright lights,

315
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,140
strong and clever and a blessing to behold.

316
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,780
I have the strength of seven men,

317
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,340
one seventh my age.

318
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,500
And how did I come to this mighty stature, you ask?

319
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,880
How did I come to this mighty stature, you ask?

320
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,840
How did I come to this mighty stature, you ask?

321
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:28,840


322
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,140
How did I come to this mighty stature, you ask?

323
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,740
Because I am a subgenius.

324
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,740
Our founder, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

325
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,420
the very man whose face you see printed here

326
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,200
on your inner eyelid,

327
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,840
was not always the saint of sales.

328
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,460
No.

329
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Before founding our voluntary association of brainwashed freethinkers,

330
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,140
Bob was among the elite of the elite of the conspiracy.

331
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
The conspiracy of normals.

332
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,620
Not the normal of,

333
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,520
it would feel normal if my friend were here today.

334
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,400
Or in a normal world,

335
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,960
that thing that happened to you would not have happened.

336
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,600
Or it's not normal how much noise

337
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,860
those subgeniuses next door can make.

338
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,920
Let me be the first to say,

339
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,020
there is a subgenius connoisseurship

340
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,500
for that variety of normal.

341
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,920
No.

342
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,180
I mean the normal that makes normality the norm.

343
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,220
Where everything not forbidden is compulsory

344
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,200
and even then you have to buy a license

345
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
not to do the forbidden.

346
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,340
I mean the conspiracy of normal

347
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,720
in which you're tricked into thinking

348
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,040
there could never be a handsome subgenius mate for me.

349
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,720
Or there could never be a Republican police officer

350
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,300
who is also a subgenius.

351
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,020
Bob knows all their tricks

352
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,920
and he will sell them to you.

353
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,900
He will sell them to you.

354
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,460
He will sell them to you.

355
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,220
He will sell them to you.

356
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,420
Me, I'll give you three conspiracy tricks for free.

357
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,880
First, the conspiracy wants to keep you busy,

358
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,480
night and day,

359
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,660
making sure other people know

360
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,580
what things out of your control you are for

361
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,780
and which ones you're against.

362
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,880
Second, the conspiracy wants you to think

363
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,500
it's all planned out in advance

364
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,280
how things are going to go for you.

365
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,420
How things are going to go for you.

366
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,420


367
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,380
Three tricks of the conspiracy for free

368
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,340
and all it costs you is the admission ticket.

369
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,300
You're welcome.

370
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,840
As every one of you full well knows

371
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,260
the world will end at 7 a.m. on July 5th, 1998.

372
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,880
The world still being here leaves us

373
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,360
with two and only two possible explanations.

374
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,120
It could be

375
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,340
that all Earth-based calendars are wrong

376
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,400
and that July 5th, 1998 is a date still ahead of us.

377
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,900
Perhaps the world ends tomorrow and you will die.

378
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,500
And if so, are you going to look back and say

379
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
gee, I sure am glad I spent all that time

380
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,420
head down in my phone

381
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,220
doing unpaid data entry work for Facebook?

382
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,120
Or are you going to go down while whooping it

383
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,960
in a blaze of glory?

384
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,100
Which for many of you is not true.

385
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,520
It's a quiet evening laughing with a few friends.

386
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,760
It could be we don't know when July 5th, 1998 is to be.

387
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,740
We practice for the arrival of the men from Planet X every year.

388
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,720
Sometimes several times a year just in case.

389
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,180
Or it could be that on July 5th, 1998

390
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,600
the X's came to Earth.

391
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,540
Bob was there to meet him

392
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,820
and sign the paperwork.

393
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,160
To sell them the Earth.

394
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,360
And this planet isn't Earth.

395
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,780
It could be that at some point

396
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,020
the third and fourth planet from the Sun switched places.

397
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,040
In part or whole.

398
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,940
Bob was there.

399
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,700
The saucers were ready to lift us up in glory.

400
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,780
But on the fourth planet, quote Earth, end quote.

401
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,580
While we were stuck on the third planet, Mars.

402
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,680
We don't know how or why.

403
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,340
All we know is that sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s

404
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,440
Earth and Mars switched places.

405
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,660
Logic and evidence dictate that it wasn't a completely successful shift

406
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,720
or everyone would know about it.

407
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,660
Instead, that's the time period when the flying saucers appear.

408
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,360
It's when the mainstream media couldn't provide us with enough Martian invasion films.

409
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,440
It's the Cold War, except real.

410
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,860
Why would paranoia become cool

411
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,360
except as a cover-up for planetary realignment?

412
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,680
And the subgeni?

413
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,720
We seem to be the most in tune with the Martian experience.

414
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,780
We see the same monster movies as everybody else.

415
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,020
It's just that sometimes we cheer for the monster.

416
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,860
We can tell when a certain patch of land is Martian land.

417
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,340
The puzzle isn't explaining to the cycle

418
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,980
the fanciful and the complainers why Earth and Mars are not as they seem.

419
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,500
Our challenge is determining whether we must complete the transition

420
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,920
of this green Earth to a red Mars

421
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,680
or whether we should abandon this confused world altogether

422
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,360
and reconnoiter on the red planet.

423
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,200
For Mars is a planet of war.

424
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,300
Mars needs women.

425
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,060
Be you Ransom or John Carter,

426
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,860
you know in your heart

427
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,220
that Mars is the planet of naked adventure,

428
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
of good versus evil.

429
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,420
Mars is our home away from home.

430
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
We have our operatives at SpaceX.

431
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,280
Who doesn't?

432
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,500
But we need you, yes you,

433
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,440
to cast your vote dollar

434
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,940
and decide once and for all.

435
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,120
Will you be the last Martian

436
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,780
or the first Earthling?

437
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,440
Thank you, Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canterbight

438
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,320
for that disclaimer rant.

439
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,860
And thank you, CyberChomp,

440
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,660
for the background music.

441
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,260
Which ended beautifully just now.

442
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,300
And then kept going.

443
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,280
Hear, hear. Hear, hear. That was great.

444
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,120
Thank you, Onan Canterbight.

445
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,240
I received my former home of employment

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
where I was working before.

447
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,700
I received a threatening email

448
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,160
about my disgusting Onanism.

449
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,580
And many of the people who saw it

450
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,700
didn't think it was quite as funny

451
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,440
because they didn't know who Onan was

452
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,260
or what Onanism was.

453
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,300
But apparently they had some picture of me,

454
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,040
he claimed,

455
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,420
of me masturbating

456
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,960
to a photo of a person who was underage,

457
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,220
a girl who was actually a girl.

458
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,940
Another woman.

459
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,760
And if I did not submit to his will

460
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,800
and pay him $1.5 billion in Bitcoin,

461
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,560
I got that same email.

462
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,660
I got that same...

463
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:33,800
You did?

464
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,260
Yes, I got that same spam scam.

465
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,140
Yes, I did.

466
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,660
Everybody got that letter, Dave.

467
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,800
Everybody got that letter.

468
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,220
And only the ones that were guilty believed it.

469
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,640
I didn't believe it because I...

470
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
It's like, no, that's not the kind of pornography

471
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,220
that I was going to do.

472
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,280
I masturbate to.

473
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,300
It's just exactly the opposite, in fact.

474
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,600
I know.

475
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,080
I'm a three-students man myself.

476
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,640
I didn't think it was that important.

477
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm usually looking at, you know,

478
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,000
if I'm going to be masturbating for sexual purposes,

479
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,220
I'm usually looking at

480
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,840
invertebrate photography websites and things.

481
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,600
I have special tastes.

482
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,860
I'm a subgenius.

483
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,520
I mean, human and subgenius gals

484
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,540
or whatever are fine,

485
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
but, you know,

486
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,420
then there's your octopus on ecstasy.

487
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,280
Or you could save the ecstasy for yourself

488
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,480
and just go out with a prairie squid.

489
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,600
They don't have to be convinced.

490
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,080
Or wooed.

491
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,480
They don't have to be wooed or courted.

492
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,860
They're ready to go.

493
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,940
They're swingers.

494
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,600
Yeah.

495
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,420
And you don't have to worry about

496
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,760
their shirt sizes either

497
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,540
because they're kind of as spanning and contracted

498
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:45,980
as they would.

499
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,500
You can't get a disease from them

500
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,220
but only from the sloppy leftovers

501
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,900
that might be squeezing out the edges.

502
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,840
Yeah.

503
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,380
I don't like them shaved.

504
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,760
I mean, I like them.

505
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,860
If you're going to buy one that's dead

506
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,080
in the supermarket wrapped in cellophane,

507
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,740
yeah, of course they're going to shave that.

508
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,900
But, you know, out in nature, in the wild,

509
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,080
it just doesn't seem right.

510
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,860
It seems like they're supposed to be

511
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,760
hirsute and funky and, you know,

512
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,400
giggling and slimy around us.

513
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:30,820
They do.

514
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,840
Right.

515
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,460
My folks come right out and say

516
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,420
when they're explosive is when they're best.

517
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,340
They're tastiest.

518
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,480
You can't get them too close to any kind of sunlight,

519
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,840
especially in the summertime.

520
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,420
It gives above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

521
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,720
Oh, they get pretty rank pretty fast.

522
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,720
I remember that one ecstasy drill.

523
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,540
And they just didn't know their own.

524
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:48,820
Yeah.

525
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,660
We had a prairie squid in a cooler in a tent

526
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,860
as a kind of an experiment.

527
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,860
And there was a sign, a handmade sign outside the tent.

528
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,720
It said great big letters that said,

529
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,940
Prairie squid love, 50 cents, come inside.

530
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,880
And even with the cooler,

531
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,300
we had to throw the cooler away

532
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,120
because it got so nasty in there.

533
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,180
But, you know, the sad thing is, Dave,

534
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,700
at the end of that ecstasy,

535
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,780
I wanted to collect the money

536
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,300
and see how much we'd made.

537
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,300
There were three quarters.

538
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,440
50 cents, right?

539
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,680
Three quarters.

540
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,900
I don't think that other quarter was a tip.

541
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,960
Maybe it was.

542
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,260
But I'm sure half of them didn't even pay.

543
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,520
Well, they just snuck in there.

544
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,560
And when they left, they were ready to pay,

545
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,740
put money in the little can.

546
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,520
But then they thought, oh, nobody's going to know.

547
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,840
I'll save that 50 cents for something I really need,

548
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,060
like ice cream.

549
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,280
Well, some people have a hunger,

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,900
a hunger for the non-absurd,

551
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,620
a hunger for things being right and normal

552
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,520
and obsequious and informal.

553
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,300
And, you know, you just can't,

554
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,060
you can't just send people off

555
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,120
into a totally different Hemingway variety

556
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,460
than, you know, and wake up,

557
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,440
they're fishing off of a boat somewhere.

558
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,500
I've had so many adventures,

559
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,240
and I've learned that boring is actually really, really good.

560
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,620
Yeah.

561
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,520
Boring is just great compared to exciting,

562
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,100
because exciting frequently ends up being a little too exciting.

563
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,060
Yeah, you got to do too much stuff or else, you know.

564
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, sometimes the excitement wasn't exactly what you signed up for.

565
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,980
So, I mean, when I was young, I never would have said this,

566
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,000
but now that I'm,

567
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,420
uh,

568
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,780
at a permanent nap level,

569
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,800
whatever,

570
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,440
still alive anyway, apparently,

571
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,080
I kind of appreciate boredom in a way that I never did before.

572
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,720
Yeah.

573
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,260
I mean, you can do all kinds of things.

574
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
You can mumble about the rocks.

575
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,380
I've seen these same group of individuals

576
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,580
go down to the beach where I live,

577
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,600
and they mumble at the rocks as they walk by,

578
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,420
you know, like the gravel, stone, things like that,

579
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,280
as if they were all different,

580
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,280
had different personalities.

581
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,040
They mumble about bread,

582
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
and I'm not talking about any kind of,

583
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
you know, really good bakery bread.

584
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,160
I'm talking about the kind they give you out on food stamps.

585
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,500
Oh, boy.

586
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,780
Dave, you see some pretty interesting and boring things,

587
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,440
both as you wander the lake side there, don't you,

588
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,800
in Ashtabula, Ohio?

589
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:36,820
Oh, yeah.

590
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,660
Oh, yeah.

591
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,980
Yeah, I can, you know, you can technically walk all the way

592
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,980
on a certain route, which, whose name I won't mention.

593
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,140
You can walk all the way from Pennsylvania to Cleveland.

594
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,400
And I'm not counseling anybody to, you know,

595
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,300
take a ride or a walk tonight and everything,

596
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
but you can do that.

597
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,240
You go through all kinds of neighborhoods and villages,

598
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,260
many towns and big towns.

599
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,220
Is that the Erie Canal?

600
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,880
No, the Erie Canal stretches to the south,

601
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,540
more towards the land of Wisteria and places like that.

602
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,080
Oh.

603
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,760
Okay.

604
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,960
But there's the canal, there was a canal,

605
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,420
a vast canal system near Cleveland area,

606
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
but I forget the name of it.

607
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,260
And somebody said that's where the graves were,

608
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,800
they would put the Irish laborers.

609
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,760
Well, there's the Erie Canal,

610
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,940
which is different from the Erie Canal.

611
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,580
Yeah, and it's...

612
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,380
The Erie Canal is straight Erie,

613
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,080
whereas the Erie Canal is just, it's sort of Erie,

614
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,460
but it's Erie-ish.

615
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:38,560
Sort of Erie.

616
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,060
The Erie-ish Canal, they could have called it.

617
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,520
Yeah, it's a little spooky too, so they call it,

618
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,820
but it could be a little Erie.

619
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,700
Yeah.

620
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,760
Yeah, but, you know, if you get an infection in the Erie Canal,

621
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,560
you don't want that.

622
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,380
You end up like me, having to put on headphones

623
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,880
and earmuffs at the same time and crank it all the way up.

624
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,740
Virtual goggles and a helmet and...

625
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,920
That's next.

626
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,660
One of those lances like Sir Galahad used to wear when he was, you know, keen.

627
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,860
Hey, Dave, we weren't going to talk about how old we are,

628
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,980
so let's cut to something.

629
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,860
I know, we'll cut to us when we were young,

630
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,820
or somebody who's young, or was young.

631
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,060
Yeah, or something young.

632
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,360
.

633
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,360


634
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,700
.

635
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,060
.

636
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,720
.

637
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,720
.

638
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,060
.

639
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:24,060


640
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,740
.

641
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,160
.

642
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,600
.

643
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:40,620
.

644
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:40,740
.

645
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,080
.

646
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,160
.

647
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,180
.

648
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,000
.

649
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,000


650
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,980
.

651
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,360
.

652
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,460
.

653
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,460


654
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,480
.

655
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,500
.

656
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:56,520
.

657
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:56,540
.

658
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,380
Friends, I have a confession to make.

659
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:21,500
I did a dumb thing. There was this this annual fossil convention here in the

660
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:27,920
tiny town of Glen Rose, Texas because this is a very fossiliferous area and

661
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,680
it's famous for dinosaur tracks. So I go to this convention every year. It's one

662
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:41,700
of the biggest events of my year, seriously. I'm a bit of a being in junior

663
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:49,180
scientist, amateur paleontologist specializing in Cretaceous marine life

664
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,640
fossils because that's what we have around here. In fact that's what my

665
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,260
driveway is made of. But I'm always on the lookout for the ones I'll never find

666
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:08,040
here. And this last fossil mania convention as they're called, I was

667
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,360
pretty good. I learned my lesson from last year and I went in with a

668
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,680
buzz.

669
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,560
I had a budget of $100. I wasn't gonna spend a penny more than that. I

670
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,420
photographed everything on display that the vendors had and then went

671
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,560
home and decided what I was gonna get and I stuck to that list and I spent

672
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:39,940
exactly $99. Then I saw something I couldn't afford. It was too good to be

673
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,320
true.

674
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,580
It was a

675
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:50,980
complete dinosaur skeleton or actually a marine reptile skeleton and embedded in

676
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:57,380
rock. So it's not exactly, well we don't know, but it's only about four inches

677
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:03,020
long. There were very small marine reptiles that looked just like a

678
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,180
plesiosaurus. They just weren't giant like a plesiosaurus. They were little like

679
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,680
swimming lizards. In fact the name of this one, scientific name, is the name of a

680
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,920
plesiosaurus. One of the scientific names is Sinohydrosaurus. No, Sinohydrosaurus.

681
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Which means Chinese water lizard. And it was only a hundred and sixty bucks. Now to

682
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:41,520
some people that may sound like a lot. To other people, like my advisor Pease, it's an obvious

683
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:50,720
fake. It's from China. It's a fake. Well there's reasons why it could be real. There is a

684
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,840
formation in China where a lot of these little fossils have shown up much like

685
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,740
the Green River Formation fish fossils that one finds in Wyoming. They're

686
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,880
everywhere. They're a dime a dozen. They're great fossils. They show complete

687
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,600
fish skeleton laying there where it died.

688
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:17,900
Must have been a gigantic guy off of that formation. And something similar may have

689
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:26,940
happened with the Sinohydrosaurus. But I slept on it. I went, man, I've got to have this

690
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,960
thing. The guy vending it said, well, you know, this will be the last time you see something

691
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:40,320
like this because China has outlawed exporting these. And I thought, oh God, I've got to,

692
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,580
I've got to.

693
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:40,580


694
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,480
I've got to pick up on this. But I did sleep on it. And the next morning I went there and I bought

695
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:55,400
it. And I showed it to several other paleontology buffs and a couple of working actual

696
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,560
paleontologists. And they oohed and aahed over it. And they looked at it through my little

697
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:09,800
jeweler's magnifying glass. And nobody said, well, I hate to tell you this, man, but it's fake.

698
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,500
Of course, the vendor was packing up his stuff right next to us. But so that may have been part

699
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,000
of it. I'm pretty sure it's fake, friends. I got it home. A couple of days later, I pulled out my

700
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:32,280
stereo microscope, which is much more powerful than a hand magnifying glass, but a low power

701
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,720
microscope. Well, the skull and tail are painted on.

702
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,500
And there's, they've been slightly carved out to give it a bit of a 3D feel, but it's definitely

703
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,780
paint. The center of it might, there might be a real fossil there. There may be a little tiny

704
00:40:52,780 --> 00:41:00,720
pelvis and bit of a spine, maybe even a flipper, but they've been painted over and all the missing

705
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,760
parts have been painted on them. Really certain from looking through the microscope that a guy

706
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,720
with exactly that kind of microscope in China.

707
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:16,740
Was sitting there and whipping out one of these things every hour or so. And he got really good

708
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:24,800
at making them look believable. Whoa, that's the alarm that says we're all going to die.

709
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,820
If we don't take our pills, I'll have to remember that. Anyway, what all this is about,

710
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,540
I'm still displaying the thing. It's not a loss because a replica of this good would cost $160.

711
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:50,360
Even if it was advertised as such. And it just goes in my hoax fossil collection,

712
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:58,620
which are mostly built by me and my wife, Princess We Are Doe. We have a devil fossil.

713
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:06,440
We have the fossil of an alien skeleton. It's an alien, but it was an alien that died

714
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,720
six, a hundred million years ago.

715
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,180
In the lower Cretaceous. We have a robot fossil of a robot that probably belonged to that alien.

716
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,960
And of course, a whole family of cave subgeniuses.

717
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:27,760
So my realistic looking fake plesiosaur skeleton could go in there, but

718
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:38,780
praise the subgeniuses. This subgenius named Eddie Romanoff, I'll call him Reverend Eddie

719
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,460
Romanoff.

720
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,720
Because for him to even be on the scrub genius forum means he must have sent me 35 bucks

721
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,920
at some point in the past.

722
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:57,100
He has an explanation that I much prefer. And it goes like this. Pull the wool over

723
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:06,520
your own eyes and embrace the alternative truth. Clearly, the foul agents of the con-spiracy

724
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,780
painted over that fossil to make you think.

725
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,180
I think it was a fake when in reality it is actual physical evidence of the first reptiloid

726
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,640
phase of our race from the Pennsylvanian era.

727
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,320
Excuse me, I have to cough every hour. I'm very cold.

728
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:36,980
You will recall from standard film strip 87, Bob visits the dinosaurs. And dinosaurs is

729
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,580
in quotes just like Bob.

730
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,280
You'll recall from that that the newly engineered reptilian subgenie quickly regretted forsaking

731
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,460
their amphibian forms when the political climate of the late Carboniferous suddenly turned

732
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:59,720
against them and a horde of rampaging mushroom headed Trumposauri came swarming up from the

733
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,720
valleys and laid siege to Fort Sikistni.

734
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
Our ancestors had been there for a long time. They were the first to have ever seen a dinosaur.

735
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,100
That was the first time we had seen one.

736
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,100


737
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:13,600
We had no choice but to return to the waters of the Monongahela, a titanic struggle still

738
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,780
preserved in the coal seams of the Monongahela Formation.

739
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,240
I mean, that is why you picked that particular house in Cleveland, right?

740
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:31,740
Didn't you notice, asks Eddie Romanoff, the other end of the coal seam that the con lit

741
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,680
on fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania?

742
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,940
Or the tunnel drain?

743
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,020
It does look familiar…

744
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,020


745
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,400
I have plenty of friendlies family friends, you know, like your husband.

746
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:56,960
We destroyed Itat sat co fuel and it was our idea we fucked up half a difference a three

747
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,160
nos with a thousand dollars in Marcellus.

748
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,920
I remember that great era we lived in in the years to come.

749
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:06,920


750
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:14,360
gas to power their foolish society as it limps alarm on ever more scarce fossil fuels.

751
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:21,500
They may even flood our bunkers with their toxic spew, but they will never take our freedom.

752
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,220
Praise Bob!

753
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,500
Hail Slack!

754
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,100
Our kind shall triumph!

755
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,920
Tune in next time when we'll talk about the second reptiloid phase and the legendary natural

756
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,000
stone Standing Bong of Huntington County.

757
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,960
And I had to respond.

758
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,420
I said, that's it!

759
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,360
I'm weeping with joy.

760
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,580
This is the spiel I will adapt to go with the display of the excellent fake fossil in

761
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,840
my destructionist evidences museum and sanitarium.

762
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,380
That killer rant explains everything.

763
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,840
I think I even have some samples of the fart glass.

764
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,960
They strangely resemble beer bottles.

765
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,920
Half melted.

766
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,260
Half melted in brush fires and burning piles of unwanted cedars.

767
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,800
But, like the Atlantean artifacts that dot this place, if you really examine them closely,

768
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,020
the evidence is unquestionable.

769
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,600
Uh, oh, and then I went on to continue.

770
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,040
Say, Eddie, did you know this is Eddie Romanoff I'm talking to?

771
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,800
Did you know that my real name is Romanoff too?

772
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,920
Not Stang or Smith, but, well, technically Rasputin.

773
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,880
Romanoff.

774
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,380
I don't have the blood of the Tsar coursing through my veins, but my great grandma, the

775
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:50,380
Tsarina, is sure in there, as well as the genes of a certain bug-eyed, long-haired,

776
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,120
mad monk who couldn't be fully killed unless you killed him five times.

777
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,420
Of course, my side of the family had to be banished and brainwashed and disguised and

778
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,480
sent to the colonies, but they did pretty well there and one of them signed the Declaration

779
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,220
of Independence.

780
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,900
Under a patent-free law.

781
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,320
I don't want to say that name because it's also my brother's name and he's sensitive

782
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,000
about being made fun of for it.

783
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,240
But yeah, we were the actual rightful heirs to the crown jewels of all the Russians.

784
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,460
Me and my brother and sister.

785
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,420
Damn the Bolsheviks.

786
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,480
They screwed up everything.

787
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,380
Everything was going great, but then they went and messed it all up.

788
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,660
I hate commies.

789
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,280
Well, I have some respect for the Viet Cong, the smart warriors, but the rest of the commies,

790
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,880
I don't want to say it in front of women and children.

791
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:36,880


792
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,960
Socialism, sure, I'm probably a socialist, but screw the commies and the Nazis and white

793
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,160
supremacists and anti-Semites and rapers.

794
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,820
Screw all that crap.

795
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,680
Sorry I get worked up.

796
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:03,560
So yeah, it turns out my adopted child's cynohydrosaurus skeleton is probably just a good miniature

797
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,880
painting by some hunched over nearsighted scientist.

798
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:06,880


799
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:06,880


800
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:13,660
Figarette addicted, talented Chinese with a low power microscope and a three hair paintbrush

801
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,580
who probably got three bucks for his work if that.

802
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,260
God, what planet have we found ourselves on?

803
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,580
Friends, this is all wrong.

804
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:28,980
But hey, we can find humor in it because we're sick.

805
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,160
And now this.

806
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,880
Has this ever happened?

807
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,080
Oh, it should have been there, Ted.

808
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,940
It was great.

809
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,100
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

810
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,680
Where were you that night?

811
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,800
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

812
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,660
I guess I should have gone, huh?

813
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,260
Didn't you feel stupid?

814
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,080
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

815
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,420
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

816
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,580
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

817
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,000
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time, slow time, and make time run backwards.

818
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,840
Thank you, Lurden.

819
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,000
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

820
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,240
How you may ask?

821
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,540
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

822
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,000
One day my dog ran out in front of a truck.

823
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:18,760
Blango.

824
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,980
My dog was dead.

825
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,880
Was I sad till I met Bob.

826
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,240
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car, do a slip

827
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,840
job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it, that truck went off into a ditch and burst

828
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,380
into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

829
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,140
Ain't that right, fella?

830
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:33,960
Yes.

831
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,360
Imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow if you had only gone to Bob's

832
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,560
School of Time Control today.

833
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,660
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

834
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
Just right.

835
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,900
Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

836
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,280
Bob's School of Time Control, a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

837
00:49:53,420 --> 00:50:02,420
Friends, I read here in the weekly news called The Week that there's a new ice world that

838
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,720
raises Planet Nine hope.

839
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:11,200
Yes, astronomers have discovered a dwarf planet in the very outer reaches of our solar

840
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:19,560
system, a find that may point the way to a long-hypothesized ninth large planet lurking

841
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,580
somewhere far beyond Pluto.

842
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:30,120
Nicknamed the Goblin, the roughly 200-mile-wide dwarf planet follows an extremely elongated

843
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,760
orbit.

844
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,700
Right now, the ice world is as close as it gets to the surface.

845
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:34,700


846
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:34,700


847
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:34,700


848
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:34,900
The

849
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:41,340
Goblin is about 2.5 times farther than Pluto.

850
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:47,780
At the most distant end of its 40,000-year orbit, the Goblin will be more than 200 billion

851
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,900
miles from the Sun.

852
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,940
Because the Goblin is beyond the gravitational pull of the solar system's giants Jupiter,

853
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,680
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the scientists believe that something else must have shaped

854
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,160
its unusual orbit.

855
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,600
This is where the elusive Planet Nine comes in.

856
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:24,700
The Goblin is the third small planet of its kind to have been discovered in the outer

857
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,980
solar system, and the orbits of all three appear to be clustered together.

858
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,960
That suggests that distant worlds are being shepherded by a massive undiscovered object,

859
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,680
possibly a dwarf.

860
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,260
The Goblin is the third largest planet in the solar system, and possibly our solar system's

861
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,720
ninth large planet.

862
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:44,080
Astronomer Scott Shepard says the Goblin's discovery isn't a slam dunk for Planet Nine

863
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:51,340
believers, but it makes the mysterious planet's existence look more likely than not.

864
00:51:52,680 --> 00:52:01,860
Something else that was discovered to have been in existence, and still are, is a lot

865
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,680
more Mayan structures than we know.

866
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,340
And more than anybody ever, well, than most people ever dreamed were there.

867
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,360
Archaeologists have uncovered tens of thousands of ancient Mayan structures in Guatemala using

868
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,720
a groundbreaking new laser mapping technology.

869
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:23,520
The researchers flew over 830 square miles of dense forest in a plane equipped with a

870
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,440
LiDAR device, which rained millions of light pulses on the canopy to reveal the contours

871
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,340
of the ground beneath.

872
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,540
The survey revealed an astonishing...

873
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,660
...and this is a lie.

874
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,260
This is astonishing.

875
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,460
...61,480 Mayan structures, many of them never seen before.

876
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,720
There were large houses and temples, 60 miles of causeways, roads and canals, even defensive

877
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,720
fortifications such as moats, which suggest the Maya came under attack from other Central

878
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
American peoples.

879
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:02,280
The discoveries provide a unique snapshot of the Maya, who lived in the region from

880
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,640
about 1000 B.C. to 1550 A.D.

881
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:04,640


882
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:10,440
And should help scientists understand more about their population size, agricultural

883
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,960
techniques and conflicts.

884
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,800
After analyzing the scans, the researchers explored the jungle at ground level to verify

885
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,180
some of their findings.

886
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,580
We were all humbled, lead author Marcello Canuto tells the Post.

887
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,900
All of us saw things we had walked over and we realized, oh wow, we totally missed that.

888
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,640
So, there you have it.

889
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:34,640


890
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,400
There you go friends.

891
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,220
Hidden planets and hidden cities of the ancient astronauts.

892
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:53,780
Or basically a really advanced civilization that predated everybody else.

893
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,740
Yes sir, I like subgenius.

894
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,740
No sir, I don't like pink boys.

895
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,620
Yes sir, I love Bob.

896
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,500
No sir.

897
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,960
No sir, I do not want to stop Bob.

898
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,720
I want Bob in every tree.

899
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,780
I just want to give my feast to the thousands.

900
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:16,160
In every flower, in every bee, in every leaf, in every twig, in every cow, in every pig.

901
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:16,400
Yes, deep fried as it is.

902
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,080
They brought out the best in Bob's fish and laid it upon the other water and foul and

903
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,800
little stinky things.

904
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,760
I want to see him in the sky.

905
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,200
And everybody saw and everybody ate and it was kind of nice for all those people.

906
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,480
Dear Bob who floats above the ground, I long to hear the mournful sound that's made when

907
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,480
you emerge from the sky.

908
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:33,480


909
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:33,480


910
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:33,480


911
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:33,480


912
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,380
I want to see you from space and come to this, my dwelling place.

913
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:42,740
Dear Bob, each night while I'm asleep, I hope to my house you will creep and poke your pipe

914
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,680
in through the wall so I'll be burned remembering all.

915
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,140
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

916
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,220
Remember now.

917
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,560
It's no surprise if I should be found dead someday.

918
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,280
I'll think that you were in the way.

919
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,180
Oh, gimme Bob.

920
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,000
Confusing that face.

921
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,460
Oh, gimme Bob.

922
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:03,460


923
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:03,640
Confusing that face.

924
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,180
With my own.

925
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,620
Can't remember my place.

926
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,280
And that's it.

927
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,980
That's, did we get an hour?

928
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,080
Oh, it's an hour and 20 minutes.

929
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:28,360
And my whole plan was to do an hour and then do two shows that had a half hour of the old,

930
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:32,240
of us being old and a half hour of youngsters being young.

931
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,460
Oh, my God.

932
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,200
Or us being young from the day.

933
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,220
So there's plenty.

934
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,060
There's enough for three shows.

935
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,780
You all sound like we're on helium.

936
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:44,840
Huh?

937
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,440
In the old recordings, you all sound like we're on helium.

938
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,100
Yeah.

939
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,060
Well, sometimes that's the fault of the cassette players, which weren't exactly crystal sync.

940
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,020
And half of them were wind up, powered by rubber bands.

941
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,460
So, yeah.

942
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,420
So they weren't, they didn't keep perfect sync.

943
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,380
But, yeah.

944
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:16,800
The squeaky voices and, it's us when we were little babies of 40, of a mere 45 or 50.

945
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:26,480
Children, innocence, with our pants down, caught that way every time.

946
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,300
Deer in the headlights caught with their pants down.

947
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,260
That's us.

948
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,440
There's that cough again.

949
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,000
I was productive that time.

950
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,360
Jeez.

951
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,600
That's good.

952
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,160
That means it's starting to go away.

953
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,560
Because it was just a horrible, painful bark.

954
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,940
It came on every half hour.

955
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,080
I wasn't sleeping well.

956
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:56,580
I had my expectorants and things, but, and my suppressants.

957
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,620
I don't know.

958
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,400
Maybe you shouldn't take both at once, but.

959
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,240
I took the red pill and the black pill.

960
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,700
The blue pill.

961
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,120
And next thing I knew I was stuck in the bathroom for days.

962
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,320
So, careful kids.

963
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,220
Don't eat your dog's medicals.

964
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,460
Well, that's a power note.

965
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,140
Yeah.

966
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,500
This, the music in the background has actually been perfect.

967
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,940
Brian Henke again, from an album called The Nature of Light.

968
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,200
A Cleveland guitar player.

969
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,500
That's all he does, play guitar.

970
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,340
He plays it real, real good.

971
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,320
Like Leo Kottke, sort of.

972
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,140
Or John Fahey.

973
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:51,360
I even went to a Kottke concert when I was in guitar aficionado.

974
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,600
Okay, Dave, let's go sleepy by.

975
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,960
Okay.

976
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,160
Man, this little digital recorder's gonna be real glad to be turned off.

977
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,740
It's sweating.

978
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,040
Okay.

979
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,060
Well, let me know what's happened.

980
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,200
Okay, man.

981
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,640
Okay, man.

982
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,220
See ya.

983
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:27,180
Okay, now we can talk about the really important stuff that we can't talk about on the air,

984
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:27,940
on broadcast radio.

985
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,080
Oh, yeah.

986
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,920
Because the Hour of Slack is on my phone.

987
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:30,920


988
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,020
I mean, I mean, my phone is on my phone.

989
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,460
I'm gonna have to go to the radio.

990
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,040
I don't know if you have it on, but I've got the radio on.

991
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


992
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


993
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


994
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


995
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


996
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,040


997
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,220
We can do anything.

998
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,240
We can do as crash as possible, as available.

999
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:52,880
We can, this is the, this is our one chance to let you know that, we know that you're

1000
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,240
tired of that old begging recording that I stuck at the end of all those shows.

1001
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,860
and this is the new one. And we're not even begging. We're just selling you the ordainment

1002
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:15,500
kit, the subgenius ministers kit or membership kit. It's $35 plus a 375 postage, I think,

1003
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,640
unless you're overseas, in which case it's like 150 bucks postage. But you'll see when you get on

1004
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:28,080
subgenius.com, right at the top, it says become an ordained minister. You click on that

1005
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:35,500
and you'll see a picture of all the cool stuff. The package that you get, aside from the fact

1006
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:41,620
that you're now a damn minister, okay, you could really can perform weddings. In fact, I did one

1007
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:47,780
tonight. I signed the papers for my niece, Jessica, and that lucky sumbitch, Guillermo.

1008
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:56,880
And I did it for them for free because they're relatives. He's my nephew-in-law now. But anyway,

1009
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,060
friends, you can do that.

1010
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:08,680
You can perform weddings, and I usually get about 200 bucks from civilians. You can do burials.

1011
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:17,880
Unfortunately, you can't do divorces, and that's where the real money is. But for your 35 bucks,

1012
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:26,800
you will get inside a large, puffy envelope, you'll get a black folder that has, for one thing,

1013
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,820
your subgenius minister.

1014
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,880
You'll get a card that says you're an ordained minister, but also all the kind of things you'd expect

1015
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:40,060
from a fan club, such as a decoder ring that only we can decode. You won't be able to do it.

1016
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,040
It looks like a little metal button with Bob on it.

1017
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,100
No, you will need some assistance, or actually divine intervention.

1018
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,820
You get eternal salvation.

1019
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,540
Or triple your money back.

1020
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,400
Right, of course.

1021
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,040
Or, yeah.

1022
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,220
Two really, really fancy-looking documents.

1023
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,900
The all-inclusive excuse.

1024
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:06,500
And the doctorate of the forbidden sciences, which both look fantastic framed on your law office wall.

1025
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,560
Hint, hint to all those lawyers out there who haven't joined yet.

1026
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:18,540
But the main thing about membership is the feeling you get that you finally really did support the Hour of Slack

1027
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,380
and the subgenius Facebook pages and all the other stuff that's free.

1028
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:28,060
And you helped Reverend Stang pay his half of the mortgage.

1029
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:34,660
And it allows us to keep doing this and so forth.

1030
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,220
So friends, send that $35.

1031
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,540
Actually, make it $40 with postage.

1032
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,240
Or $38.75.

1033
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,840
Okay, $38.75.

1034
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,220
You can write a check to Subgenius Foundation.

1035
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,760
You can do it online and use a credit card.

1036
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:56,120
You can technically call us and give us a credit card number, but we hate doing that because,

1037
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,920
oh wait, I'm not deaf anymore.

1038
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,260
I guess I could take those calls.

1039
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,520
Yes, you can take those now.

1040
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,320
Anyway, friends, yeah.

1041
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,720
Really.

1042
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,320
$35.

1043
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,520
And you get to write...

1044
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,500
And you've got to mention the post office box, both in Ohio and in Texas.

1045
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,620
Don't forget that, Reverend Orville Stange.

1046
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,680
Right, that's post office box.

1047
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:24,320
And during the winter months, it's subgenius at post office box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1048
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,340
During the summer...

1049
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:38,860
Summer and fallish, springish sort of months, it's subgenius at P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1050
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,080
Oh, I remembered it.

1051
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,280
Yeah, that's...

1052
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,140
Don't be a gimme bob, friends.

1053
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,080
Don't be...

1054
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:47,960
Be a bommie gimme.

1055
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:57,360
I mean, it's really not cool to not send in your $35.

1056
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,060
It's...

1057
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,180
It's the one-time thing.

1058
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:04,440
And from then on, I'll speak to you.

1059
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,800
That's about the only way that's going to happen.

1060
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,620
Yeah.

1061
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,300
Also, you'll get to...

1062
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:10,560
It's the most important.

1063
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,480
You'll get to look at the members-only internet forum called Scrub Genius.

1064
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:22,260
And believe it or not, there's some really intelligent writing on that thing.

1065
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,040
It's nothing like Facebook.

1066
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:25,900
So...

1067
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,900
And the reason is?

1068
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,520
Because we can...

1069
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,400
I can kick out anyone I want.

1070
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:33,600
And I've never kicked anyone out.

1071
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,140
Because Susie the Floozy always does it instead.

1072
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,740
Reverend Susie the Floozy's on Scrub Genius, friends.

1073
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,660
And that's the only way you can be Reverend Susie the Floozy's friend.

1074
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:48,160
And I know you want to be friends with Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1075
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:53,940
With a name like that, she must be purdy and sexy and just ready to jump in bed with anybody.

1076
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,140
Well, some of those things are true.

1077
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,540
She is really purdy and sexy.

1078
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,120
She is purdy and sexy.

1079
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,120
And she's really, really funny.

1080
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,900
And friends, that's why you must join the Church of the Subgenius.

1081
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:08,760
Get...

1082
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,020
How valuable...

1083
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:10,180
Get slack.

1084
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,000
The real thing.

1085
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,260
Yeah, exactly.

1086
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,180
How invaluable of a trick-or-treat bag is this?

1087
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,980
When you think of all the things you've gone through in your subservient lives out there,

1088
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,260
waiting for one day or the next for something to change or happen.

1089
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,320
This will actually change your life, friends.

1090
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,680
I don't mean to call you friends speciously because I'm not in that form of mood.

1091
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,540
I'm a nice person.

1092
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,260
I could just as easily say something very vicarious and argumentative about you.

1093
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,020
But I don't know you.

1094
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,300
And that's the problem.

1095
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,620
Sort of solve that problem.

1096
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,680
Vote for the Church of the Subgenius by becoming a preordained ministry.

1097
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,780
Because ministration is a very important part of our existence.

1098
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,320
If we didn't have it, we wouldn't have it.

1099
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,440
Price Bob.

1100
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:57,900
Yeah.

1101
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,560
Yeah.

1102
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:00,980
Yeah.

1103
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1104
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1105
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1106
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1107
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1108
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1109
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1110
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1111
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1112
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1113
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1114
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1115
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1116
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1117
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1118
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1119
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1120
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1121
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1122
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1123
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1124
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1125
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1126
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:00,980


1127
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,680
And with that, friends, thank you and good night.

1128
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,180
Okay, but we're still on the fun day.

1129
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,560
Buenas noches.

1130
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,960
Buenas noches.

1131
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,180
Buenas, buenas.

1132
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,220
Are we done?

1133
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,520
Well, we're...

1134
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:15,780
Yeah.

1135
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,540
Yeah, we're done.

1136
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,360
I'm afraid...

1137
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,640
Okay, I'm going to actually turn the recorder off and that means we really are done.
