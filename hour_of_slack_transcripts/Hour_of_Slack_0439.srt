Shut your mouth, get on the bus, join us in the fold.

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,740
Folks don't like it when you question lies they've done been sold.

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,860
Thinking can be painful, at least that's what I'm told.

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,180
Miracles can happen, dumbf*** can be gold.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,220
Miracles can happen, dumbf*** can be gold.

36
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,480
Hold my hand and come with me, save a brain-dead atrophy.

37
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,220
Compromise your freedom with a soul.

38
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,620
Miracles can happen.

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,660
Miracles can happen.

40
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,680
Miracles can happen.

41
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,480
Cold and sterile logic just won't help you to get laid.

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,400
To fit in with PC friends, f*** you must be sprayed.

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,280
Crystals can't cure hemorrhoids, please don't be afraid.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,700
Miracles can happen.

45
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,280
Mr. Cavalcante.

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,740
Miracles can happen.

47
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,960
Pyramids can sharpen blades.

48
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,080
Shower the world with new age blindness.

49
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,200
Pass it off as random kindness.

50
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,740
Quadrupole and headway look real smart.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,860
Miracles can happen.

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,280
Hey!

53
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
Miracles can happen.

54
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,220
Look, I can slap him with a pillow.

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,920
He can take it the way he's expected to go.

56
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,620
Look, I've got a blade I can open up a hole.

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,060
That's right, he's got the choke on him.

58
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,280
He can take it the way he's expected to go.

59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,280


60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,280


61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Look in the back there, you see, I don't have a rock on my floor.

62
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,920
I got the mobile.

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,660
That's for cute people like you.

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,380
Rock and roll is dead.

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Rock and roll is dead.

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,240


67
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,740
Rock and roll is dead.

68
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Alright now, is everyone acting like a dip?

69
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,360
Yeah!

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,880
That's good!

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Now I want to see all of you get up and dance a whoop-dee-jig.

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,900
Miracles can happen.

73
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,780
You can kiss my butt.

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,260
You can kiss my butt.

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,920
Miracles can happen.

76
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,280
You can kiss my festering butt.

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
Hold my hand and come with me.

78
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,200
Masturbate with stupid glee.

79
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,860
Substitute your dignity with God.

80
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,620
Substitute your good with God.

81
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,900
Substitute your dignity with God.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,760
Substitute your dignity with God.

83
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:32,240
Miracles can happen.

84
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:59,740
Mm, huh.

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
Miracles can indeed happen dear friends

86
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,320
They're happening even as we speak

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,800
I wish I knew about any of them

88
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,560
That song we just played was by our good friend Joe Newman

89
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,640
Last week we played a rough mix from his new album

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,320
Which is called Enhanced Florence Henderson

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,000
And that by the way is by Rudy Schwartz Project

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,820
Is the name you'd see on the cassette tapes or the CD

93
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,160
There is a CD that's hard to find

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,140
It's all Joe Newman pretty much though

95
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,480
And we also said last week that we never would devote a whole show to one album or one artist

96
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,020
But this week we're going to play basically the entire rest of that

97
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,300
And we're going to play a whole show of Joe Newman

98
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,300


99
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,160
Not quite yet to be released Joe Newman album

100
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,860
And I'll be giving the address to write for information on Rudy Schwartz Project

101
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,740
Joe Newman

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,140
Nearer to the end of the broadcast

103
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,460
There was one song on this album that I want to play first

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,120
Because it is, oh the timing was so perfect

105
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,920
Last week on the poor little Dallas Cowboy

106
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,300
Fence

107
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,120
The fans here in Dallas got their little hearts broken

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,720
The coach is gone

109
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,080
And the owner is drunk

110
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,480
And everybody's so sad

111
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,560
Well you can imagine the glee that we felt when we heard this upcoming

112
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,980
Lovely piece of music

113
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,940
And the timing of it arriving when it did

114
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,320
Obviously planned by Bob

115
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,980
The first few minutes of this Rudy Schwartz Project song

116
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,360
By the way are edited

117
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,000
Like the last song I had to play

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,020
There's just a couple of places on the album

119
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,600
I had to run them to tape

120
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,280
And replace the bad words with the good word of Bob

121
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,840
And but then we'll switch back to the master D.A.T. dump

122
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,060
Oh by the way following this amazing song

123
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,280
Will be Joe's touching eulogy to the great Frank Zappa

124
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Oh and by the way I'm going to play a little bit of this

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,900
Uh huh

126
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:31,780
Right now I'm waving to Jenny

127
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:31,780


128
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:31,780


129
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:31,860
Oh oh yeah

130
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,120
Yeah

131
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,580
There you are

132
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,020
On your wa-

133
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,820
guitar solo

134
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,420
guitar solo

135
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,940
guitar solo

136
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,660
I wanna watch Pornhub Theater.

137
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,860
character solo

138
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,480
character solo

139
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,780
character solo

140
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
No.

141
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,300
speaker solo

142
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,620
character solo

143
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,480
1, 2, 3

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,060
Are you ready?

145
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,260


146
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,260


147
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,260


148
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,260


149
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,260


150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,260
ťhowłux

151
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,440
I'm not going to lie to you, Waldo.

152
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,640
Yeah, I'm a tax evasion.

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,740
You've got to be faster.

154
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,620
If you don't know where to learn, I'll tell you right now.

155
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,580
You're very wrong.

156
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,820
You're a spirit of mayhem.

157
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,860
Just also upset.

158
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,300
Hey, Waldo, do you want a pizza?

159
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,600
Yes, I do.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,820
Now, bear this knife this way.

161
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
You will drink the black sperm of my vengeance.

162
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,620
Here's Buck Owens.

163
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,380
Who raised up brain squelchy, made it glisten with pink,

164
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,680
and served up big stupid so yous all take a drink?

165
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,120
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

166
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,140
Who spent Sunday morning praising in church,

167
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,240
then pants from the touchdown when he's doing God's work?

168
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,780
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

169
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,800
Lift a conlandry, won't you come out tonight?

170
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,160
With your cowboys in need and sweet Jesus inside.

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,180
Crumpish on pickup trucks, who could it be?

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,660
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

173
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,160
Who dance around naked with long dangling meat?

174
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,600
Down at the schoolyard, let the girls get a peek.

175
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,360
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

176
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,580
Who says he's sorry for what he's done?

177
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,820
For playing pre-birded and flashing his buns?

178
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,400
He's a good ball player.

179
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,020
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

180
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,180
Could Roger Stavart be the governor's aide?

181
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,240
Illegal abortions and white bread to eat?

182
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,540
Ask any Cretan you happen to see.

183
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,240
I'm the governor.

184
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,240


185
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,240


186
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,240


187
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,580
I'm the Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

188
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,340
Kindness, one, two, kill for God.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,760
Kindness, one, two, kill for God.

190
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Kindness, one, two, kill for God.

191
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,460
Kindness, one, two, kill for God.

192
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,320
Kindness, one, two, kill for God.

193
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,000
Who made roly-poly, roly-poly, roly-poly?

194
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,860
Hot dang, it's spicy cheese ball.

195
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,660
Let all them friends and neighbors come a-calling,

196
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,940
cause anything's good if it sits on a wrist.

197
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,260
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

198
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,560
What kind of thing is it that's got one head like Andrea Dworkin,

199
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,280
the other head like Bob Tilton,

200
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,700
and two scoops of raisins,

201
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,300
cause that's the only way he could get it to sit up straight at the golfer and table?

202
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,840
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

203
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:27,840


204
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,260
Yip-de-com-lendry, won't you come out tonight?

205
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,780
Put your hair up in curlers, pull your nipple rings tight.

206
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,920
Stretch your urethra around the sycamore tree.

207
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,120
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

208
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,160
Yip-de-com-lendry, won't you come out tonight?

209
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,660
Put your hair up in curlers, pull your nipple rings tight.

210
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,780
Stretch your urethra around the sycamore tree.

211
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,060
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,440
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

213
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,140
Me, Jesus and me.

214
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm a-driving for the touchdown score!

215
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,580

You know, and of course we sell bonds also.

293
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,860
I walked up to a person one afternoon and I said, what's your name?

294
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,600
And they said, Jonathan Joseph Jeremiah, Timothy Titus Obadiah,

295
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,020
William Henry Walter Simm, Reuben Rufus Solomon Jim,

296
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,020
Nathaniel Daniel Abraham, Walter Peter Frederick Simm,

297
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,440
Simon Timon, Nicholas Pat, Christopher Dick Jehoshaphat,

298
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,080
Chita Jose Gonzalez, Bustamante Rafferty.

299
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,720
And I said, that's a nice name.

300
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,280
I never heard it again until you told me the name of your church.

301
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,120
And I can relate to that now.

302
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Now, Dave, I appreciate your calling.

303
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,840
And do call me when the show's over.

304
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,920
I'd like to talk to you a little more.

305
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, yes, friends.

306
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,080
And we appreciate Radio Jihad.

307
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,360
And I'll give their address.

308
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
They put these tapes out.

309
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,160
It's actually Brother Russell Ministries tape called Radio Jihad.

310
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,960
You can buy this tape with many other interesting phone experiments like that.

311
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,180
Available from 5525 Burnett Road.

312
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,100

Austin, Texas.

317

Seven.

318
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:57,820
Eight.

319
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,300
Seven.

320
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,220
Five.

321
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,920
Six.

322
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,980
Radio Jihad tapes there, friends.

323
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,660
5525 Burnett Road.

324
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,480

325
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,920

326
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
Austin, Texas.

327
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,400

328

Six.

332
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,240
You know, there's a lot of great tapes being made in Austin,

333
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,440
and none of them are played on Austin radio because there's not a decent radio station in Austin.

334
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,340
When I was driving around down there,

335
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,460
oh, this weekend I had to go there and finish up this stuff real quick in between Easter and back.

336
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,180
And as I got closer to Austin, I just had to leave the car on scan

337
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,700
because there was not a single radio station I wanted to stop on.

338
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,880
Scan was more like what I wanted to hear than any one station in Austin.

339
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,560
Here you got the hour of slack, dear friends, for what it's worth.

340
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,160
And, well, as soon as this tape turns over here, which I'm waiting for my show tape to die,

341
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,080
then, my friends, we can go back in.

342
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,160
We are healed.

343
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,860
We are healed.

344
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,180
We are healed.

345
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,180


346

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,540
We are healed.

348
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,820
We are healed.

349
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,420
We are healed.

350
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,320
We are healed.

351
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,900
We are healed.

352
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,820
We are healed.

353
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,140
We are healed.

354
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,740
We are healed.

355
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,740

373
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,280
I want to give.

374
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,800
I've been a miner with a heart of gold.

375
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,360
It's these expressions I never give.

376
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,980
Keep me searching for a heart of gold.

377
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,200
Oh, oh, oh.

378
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,500
Oh, oh, oh.

379
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,160
Oh, oh, oh.

380
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,360
Now, Reverend Ivan Stang, many people have said that you're not Mediterranean.

381
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,240
You're not Mediterranean and you're not African and you're not white, whatever that means.

382
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,100
Exactly what nationality does the bob come from?

383
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,000
What's your ethnic class?

384
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
He's a damn yeti.

385
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,920
He's a bigfoot.

386
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,960
He's an abominable.

387
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,560
Abominable snowman of the Himalayas.

388
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,340
That's what bob is.

389
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,140
He's half Irish.

390
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,180
Has anyone ever said that?

391
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,900
Half Irish.

392
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,100
Did anybody ever make fun of you when you were a kid and go like, bob the slob, bob the slob?

393
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,940
Where do you think the subgeniuses come from?

394
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,040
They're the ones that got put into the trash cans by bigger kids.

395
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,860
Bob the slob.

396
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,800
They got all the balls thrown at them.

397
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,960
And they're all peeped.

398
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
They're the ones that get picked last for sports.

399
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,840
They hate everybody normal and I don't blame them.

400
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,620
Sure, you're saying...

401
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,740
Kill them all, I say.

402
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,140
Let Bob sort them out.

403
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,000
Kill them all that slob.

404
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,680
Blort them out.

405
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,200
Blort them out.

406
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,700
I haven't been blorted in months.

407
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,940
I'm getting the hang of this religion thing now.

408
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,620
Praise the Lord, Pastor Bob.

409
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,940
That's what I...

410
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,720
Praise the...

411
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,780
Praise the Lord.

412
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,760
I'm praising the Lord.

413
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,300
Ask the Pope about that.

414
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,920
He gets the best of Trappists.

415
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,980
They make the best liquid frass.

416
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,400
Yes, but they're afflicted with having almonds in their prostrates and stuff.

417
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,600
They're not allowed to see or speak.

418
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,240
Nor hear.

419
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,920
Or hear anything.

420
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,640
But they can make a hell of a brew.

421
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,360
The Trappist monks have my full approval.

422
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,160
I've had it.

423
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,480
I've had a Trappist monkey.

424
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,640
I've had a Trappist monkey too.

425
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,360
I don't...

426
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,760
They have terrible personal habits.

427
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,540
They have terrible personal habits.

428
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,540
They have terrible personal habits, but they make a hell of a brew, guys.

429
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,460
I heard a story about a Trappist monk who...

430
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,440
Hey, did you drink that mushroom tea the other night?

431
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,340
You?

432
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,200
Are you talking to me?

433
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,800
Dave?

434
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,400
Dave?

435
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,000
No, you...

436
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,400
That mushroom tea, how was it?

437
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, it was fine.

438
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,600
Just fine.

439
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,280
What do you mean?

440
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,380
Is she talking mushrooms you bought at the health food store?

441
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,500
No, that mushroom tea at that party you went to.

442
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,540
You look nervous, Dave.

443
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,520
I thought you were talking about...

444
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,420
Dave, I thought you were talking about the mushrooms you bought at the...

445
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,220
How was that mushroom tea?

446
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,640
Because I didn't get to have any of it.

447
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,780
It was just fine.

448
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,240
It was just fine.

449
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,060
Anyway, I was...

450
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,160
You know, Reverend...

451
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,280
He's sweating.

452
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,540
I don't know, but I may...

453
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,700
He smells like mushrooms.

454
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,460
Let's lick him.

455
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,540
He's flooding again.

456
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,800
Get a slide and scrape some of that stuff that Dave's sweating and roll it up.

457
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,120
I'm sweating beads of corn.

458
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,580
Snort it.

459
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,240
Look, I'm an Indian deity and I'm five foot high.

460
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,520
Can I snort your armpit for a minute?

461
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:37,520


462
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,240
Little beads of corn coming out of my armpit.

463
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,060
Those are nipples.

464
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,500
Again with the prairie squid nipples.

465
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,260
I can't win with this.

466
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,260
You just keep talking about them and tantalizing me.

467
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,300
That's what nipples are for.

468
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,880
But prairie squid nipples, what an awful thing to be tantalized by cup-like things crawling out of gopher holes.

469
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,260
It's a natural thing.

470
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,600
It's natural, Dave.

471
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,120
Just...

472
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,200
You have to get past your childhood thing, you know, where they say nipple pleasure is bad.

473
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,900
Nipple pleasure is good.

474
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,500
Enjoy it.

475
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,300
Go with it.

476
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,300
Go with it.

477
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,160
Yeah, go with it, man.

478
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,160
Loosen up.

479
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,520
Inflate, dude.

480
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,940
Rise above it all.

481
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,720
Inflate.

482
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,660
Rise above it.

483
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,960
Don't worry about what the nuns say.

484
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,460
Blow up like an amphibian, especially if you're making love to a shaflopod.

485
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,500
They look to me like tiny little peppercorns.

486
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,820
But what did the priest say?

487
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,500
What kind of love could I make to something like that?

488
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,160
What did the priest say in sixth grade to you, Dave?

489
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,160
He told me that I would probably never grow up and he said it would be a shame to my family.

490
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,400
And he said also that I would probably wind up in either jail or some kind of mental institution.

491
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,480
But instead he became a high priest in the church.

492
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
The church of the subgenius.

493
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,600
And you can too for only 20 easy monthly payments.

494
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,640
One dollar per month is enough to last a lifetime.

495
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,300
A lifetime of salvation.

496
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,640
We cannot guarantee that prices will remain at 1994 levels.

497
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,380
And due to inflation over the last few months, a 5% rise per month should be expected.

498
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,840
So what is the church of the subgenius?

499
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,020
Your master or Visa card.

500
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,820
Well, I'm sorry.

501
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm sorry.

502
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,740
I'm sorry for that voiceover.

503
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,620
Stop on.

504
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,300
What is the church of the subgenius planning for the year 2000?

505
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Everything will be gone.

506
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,140
Yeah, that's a moot point.

507
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,480
We'll be doing whatever the hell we want to do.

508
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,220
Actually, the earth will still be here.

509
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,260
What is that date again?

510
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,620
July 5th, 1998, 7 o'clock in the morning.

511
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,780
I won't even be up.

512
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,340
In any time zone.

513
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,580
It starts in the middle of the date line.

514
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,780
The international date line.

515
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,140
And where does it wait for this?

516
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,720
It moves along with it with the sunlight.

517
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,860
Well, basically, imagine this row of spaceships hovering over the earth and letting the earth turn underneath.

518
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,500
Yeah.

519
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,340
And people bursting into flames.

520
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Those are the subgeniuses bursting into flames and rising up to the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

521
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,700
And then the rest of the people, the subgeniuses who didn't pay their $30, which it'll be by then, or the humans.

522
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,720
I thought you said it would be $50.

523
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,340
You know, just the general everyday humans will suffer nearer.

524
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,200
Are you guys peace?

525
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,200
Pardon me?

526
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,920
And I didn't even...

527
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,660
Are we peace?

528
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,720
No, shit, they'll be suffering.

529
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
We'll be suffering at the hands of the Amalians.

530
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,840
Yeah, that's what's the question.

531
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,040
Are you at peace with yourself?

532
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,240
Yeah, you mocker of Christianity.

533
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,180
Does this church bring peace to you?

534
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,860
Well, who wants to know?

535
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,500
What do you mean?

536
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,620
What kind of a question is that?

537
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,260
Who wants to know?

538
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,280
Hey, maybe.

539
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,480
That's like saying...

540
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,020
Well, I don't know what...

541
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,020
It's like saying axolotl is your regenerative organ.

542
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,340
It's sort of like saying, hey, why don't you give me all your credit card numbers?

543
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,460
That's a cockamamie phrase if I ever heard one.

544
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,080
That's a good one.

545
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,940
I had a guy come up to me and go, Ray Richstang, have you ever seen the white light?

546
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,020
Now, obviously, if I said yes, I'd be lying.

547
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,960
If I said no, then he might suspect the truth.

548
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:04,960
That you...

549
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,180
That I, you know, the reverse flip around.

550
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,240
You know, those who know don't say no, those who say don't know.

552
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,260
So I said, I said, I said, my friend, I guess there ain't much white light.

553
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,980
We had to spray our yard for it.

554
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,520
So you can take that and shove it in the place where Bob Dobbs don't care to look.

555
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,100
Oh, yes, dear friends.

556
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:30,900
And speaking of the white light, I've got a little story here about a woman who either

557
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,060
is never going to see it again or that's all she's ever going to see.

558
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,440
But...

559
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,020
But...

560
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,520
But before I forget, let me give credit where credit's due.

561
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,360
To begin with, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

562
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,240
Spokesorgan, you might say, for the Dallas headquarters of the Church of the Subgenius.

563
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,640
Praise that man, JR Bob Dobbs.

564
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,900
However, that stretch of tape that you were just listening to?

565
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:13,780
Was recorded a couple of months ago at WCSB at Cleveland State University.

566
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:26,700
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Chaz Smith with yours truly, Reverend Ivan

567
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,520
Stang in the background.

568
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,280
And I believe the giggles of Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.

569
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,880
They're on the radio.

570
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,800
On Reverend Chaz's show, ESO Radio.

571
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,160
With, benefiting there from Lonesome Cowboy Dave's show with Psychopath Finder, Brain

572
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,760
Rot Radio Theater.

573
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,060
Once again, thanks to WCSB at Cleveland State University for letting people do that sort

574
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,520
of thing.

575
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,420
And, uh...

576
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,240
Dallas police are investigating the case of a Louisiana school teacher who came to Parkland

577
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,360
Memorial Hospital last week with her eyes removed and chanting,

578
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,660
Thank you, Jesus.

579
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:21,380
She has no eyes, said Detective M.J. Ned of the assaults unit.

580
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,240
It was a pretty clean job.

581
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,480
They took everything out.

582
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,680
Yeah, they, uh...

583
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,600
This woman and her two sisters had ended up in the hospital Friday evening, Friday week

584
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,360
ago, back.

585
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,640
He said, the detective there said the woman's sisters were being questioned in the case.

586
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:53,760
They may have assisted her in removing her eyes, Detective Ned said.

587
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,460
At this point, we don't know anything.

588
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,800
Anything for sure.

589
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,720
It's a very strange deal.

590
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:11,940
They're talking about possession by spirits, and that definitely has some kind of religious

591
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,360
overtones.

592
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:20,560
According to police reports, the two sisters who are also, uh, like the victim, from Louisiana,

593
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,740
told police their car broke down and the three women became separated.

594
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,440
They had agreed to meet at a hotel near Dallas.

595
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:38,460
And when they met again, the victim, Ms. Obazi, told them she had been assaulted with a pipe

596
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,140
by several people she didn't know.

597
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,000
The women then apparently went in search of someone to help them pray for Mrs. Obazi and

598
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
ended up at the home of Mattie Bradfield.

599
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:58,420
Now, the great Mattie Bradfield told police that when the sisters, uh, were being arrested,

600
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,260
the two women arrived, Ms. Obazi had her eyes.

601
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:10,600
But at some point during the visit, Ms. Obazi's eyes were, according to this newspaper, torn

602
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,540
or cut out.

603
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,060
According to the report, Ms. Bradfield did not witness the removal of the woman's eyes.

604
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,960
She and another woman found the eyes in the trash wrapped in tissue.

605
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,400
Police said they were unable to talk to Ms. Obazi at the time, but did not say if they

606
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,400


607
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,520
the hospital because she was incoherent and kept chanting, thank you, Jesus, over and

608
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,900
over and over.

609
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,480
One of Ms. Obazi's sisters were taken to a county psychiatric facility for evaluation

610
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,740
after she kept, quote, talking wildly about the devil, unquote.

611
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,520
Now, see, that's proof of liberal control media, because when she's talking about the

612
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,420
devil, they always add in talking wildly about the devil.

613
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,880
I don't see what's so wild about talking about the devil, do you now?

614
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,220
It's a really strange deal, Detective Ned said.

615
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:10,600
The sisters also kept saying that Ms. Obazi was possessed by the spirit of Chester, their

616
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:16,600
father, who has apparently, Chester has caused this tape of Tommy Lopez background music

617
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,200
to go out, run out.

618
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,940
I need more minutes of that.

619
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,980
And we'll put some Joe Newman or Zoox, or I don't even know who it is in the background.

620
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,640
I get mixed up.

621
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,120
Detective Ned said, I really haven't been able to get a straight answer from her or

622
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,760
her sisters.

623
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,360
They were under the impression that she was possessed, and they went and had this nice

624
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,780
little prayer, and somehow, someone removed her eyes.

625
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:49,880
Well, friends, actually, there's more to that story that came up later this week.

626
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,020
There's been some more information.

627
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,880
Police say, yeah, they had.

628
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,380
As it.

629
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,440
Had ascertained.

630
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:07,040
This is after Mrs. Ms. Myra Obazi, the self-blinded or sister-blinded woman, has gone back to

631
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:15,600
Louisiana, and I guess the spirit of Chester, her father, has been driven from her, and

632
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,720
so forth.

633
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,100
But Detective Ned has added to the story, she is kind of cloudy on what all was said,

634
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,660
but she remembers her.

635
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,540
The body of her home, memories took all of the people.

636
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,800
Brutally sick, a job confused Mrs. Obazi.

637
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:40,460
When she realized that her bond is going on, sheぇr

638
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,460
Credit for calling us up.

639
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,320
she was thinking she should be interested in hurting her or fossil else.

640
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,120
Now that

641
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,320
way, we may not know exactly what she was asking but it doesn't seem it enough.

642
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,200
Working at Elizabethan speaking Is there any

643
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:50,280
reason that she wants to know?

644
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,280


645
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,280


646
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,600
A h u s p r i s t h a k a u t.

647
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,620
n

648
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:55,620


649
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:55,620


650
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,160
And it can't.

651
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:56,700
Ok.

652
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:56,860
Let's go.

653
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,860
Ms. Bradfield, who has been leading prayers at her home for more than 25 years,

654
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,660
said she began to fear something horrible was about to happen

655
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,160
when she placed her hand on Ms. Obazi and heard her speak in a different voice.

656
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,480
Quote,

657
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,320
The sisters started asking her questions, and she would answer in different voices,

658
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,200
Ms. Bradfield said.

659
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:26,060
They asked her if she was jealous of someone else, and she responded that she wasn't.

660
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,280
They asked her a lot of things, things I didn't understand.

661
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:41,600
Oh, by the way, friends, Ms. Obazi was also known in the past as the radio commentator...

662
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,720
What was her...

663
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:52,140
Aunt Bertha, that's right, Aunt Bertha, in Tucson, Arizona,

664
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,860
and for the last five years has taught elementary...

665
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,840
Elementary school in Shreveport.

666
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,120
I guess she ain't gonna be teaching anymore, friends.

667
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:02,580
Uh...

668
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:09,280
But poor Ms. Bradfield, who had allowed these women to come into her house and pray,

669
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,160
I saw blood coming from her eyes, Ms. Bradfield said.

670
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,560
It was running down her face.

671
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,280
Her eyes were shut, and I couldn't tell anything was wrong with her.

672
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,080
But then Ms. Bradfield made a horrifying discovery.

673
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,100
I was picking up the trash bag when I looked down.

674
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,040
I saw...

675
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,600
I saw this bloody tissue.

676
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,960
When I opened it, there was this eye in there.

677
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,040
It was the weirdest feeling I ever felt.

678
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:41,320
I felt like I was going to pass out.

679
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:49,040
And friends, the two sisters who did this act of mercy on their sister,

680
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:56,040
one of them, Mrs. Johnson, drives a van for the Council on Aging,

681
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,720
and the other, a Ms. Crawford, is a housewife.

682
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,120
Um...

683
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,320
And the, uh...

684
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,100
Ms. Bradfield said she will not soon forget the incident.

685
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,180
It seemed to me they were acting like they were in another world, she said.

686
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,000
There was something terribly wrong with them.

687
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:25,100
It looked to me like they were under some kind of self-spell or something.

688
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,920
Well...

689
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,020
Well...

690
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,020


691
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,020


692
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,020


693
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:32,260
Well, friends, it just goes to show that you can in fact see your own eyes.

694
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,560
At least for a short period of time.

695
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,140
According to subgenius doctrine, you can in fact see your own eyes.

696
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,860
If that woman had pulled one eye out a little ways,

697
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,080
just enough to keep the optic nerve connected.

698
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,680
I've been thinking about this all week.

699
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,840
She would be able to actually turn that one eye around

700
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,180
and gaze into the other eye while still seeing through both.

701
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,320
Friends, according to the word of Bob,

702
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,520
you can in fact see your own eyes.

703
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,240
Thank you.

704
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,440
Back to, uh...

705
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,320
Reverend Joe Newman's enhanced Florence Henderson album.

706
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:04,840
Thank you.

707

Mustafa, Mustafa

Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this concert, I asked myself this.

754
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,020
Who are you to be the guest speaker at this concert?

755
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:52,700
I thought about my answer about being a guest speaker for a long time.

756
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,460
What is a guest speaker?

757
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,240
Let me clarify this.

758
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,120
I have been called brave.

759
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,740
What is brave?

760
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,480
Let me clarify this.

761
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,500
Of course, we all know that it is true.

762
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,440
We are all brave.
