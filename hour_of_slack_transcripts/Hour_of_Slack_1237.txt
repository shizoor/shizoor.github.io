Power of thumb.
Well, Christmas has other meanings, hasn't it, Bob?
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Forget about it now.
You should be destroyed.
Again?
That's right.
You don't mean right now, do you?
It's important to us now.
It was my fault.
But why?
What's the big deal?
Bob.
You should be destroyed.
Bob.
This here is a holiday message from Tater Gumfries.
Now, the holidays are coming up and a lot of you will be spending them with your kin.
And so you know there's going to be some drinking.
But you got to remember, don't nobody like an asshole.
So if you're going to be drinking, try not to be an asshole.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
I'm Santa and I endorse this product or service.
Santa.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
It's Christmas time again.
You hear it in the songs of joy promoting fiscal gain.
You see it in the credit cards that platter down the drain.
Cause Santa's laughter mocks the poor and here it comes again.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
It echoes in the night.
A nagging sound that makes you wonder if you've got it right.
Everybody lies awake and thinks there's more to life.
But Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
And y'all.
You've got to blame tonight.
Santa.
We have been Santa.
Don't you care?
Why don't you ignore us?
Santa.
At this time of year.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
A liability.
That taunts you every time you turn on one of your TVs.
Or choose the leather option or a nice Moroccan tee.
Oh Santa's laughter mocks the poor across the seven seas.
Santa.
We have been Santa.
Don't you care?
Why don't you ignore us?
Santa.
At this time of year.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
The catchiest of songs.
If everybody else is singing it, it can't be wrong.
You hear it in the news reports of panic in Hong Kong.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
You've known it all along.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
They just don't help the clout.
To make a difference in the way society's turned out.
Share out all the money in the world.
We've seen one out.
Oh Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
Of that there is no doubt.
Santa.
We have been Santa.
Don't you care?
Why don't you ignore us?
Santa.
At this time of year.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
It's Christmas time again.
You hear it in the songs of joy.
Promoting fiscal gain.
You see it in the credit cards.
That plod down the drain.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
And here it comes again.
A credit card Christmas had died.
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.
Happy New Year.
If it's not worth anything.
Then it's not worth having.
Remember children everywhere.
Keep your receipts.
Yeah aren't you.
You know I mean it's a giveaway.
What can I say.
Yeah but remember that time I did that.
We've got a special on them today.
I want you to look especially at our bargain basement item.
I remember that one time.
You know we've got such wonderful bargains here.
It was great back then.
I think we all take it for granted.
But the customer comes first.
We all used to go down and sit around.
The customer is king here at Subgenius Department Store.
And I want each and every one of you not to forget that.
I love this job.
Me too.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world to work in the lingerie department.
At the Subgenius McPartment Store.
Here's a rose for your buttonhole.
A lot of people thought it was a radio show.
But it was really a Subgenius McPartment Store.
Yes the ladies love this department.
And all the people came down to the McPartment Store.
And they McParted each other.
Not the McPartment Store.
That vulgar chain store.
They held their grummins over their head
and whirled them around in the air.
Every Christmas we set up the model trains
for the kiddies on the roof.
And there's Gizmo the Clown
and that jolly old elf Saint Nick himself.
Quit playing with your artifact there, son.
In Santa's workshop children will be
dandled and not diddled by Santa.
Promise?
They'll be dandled around with their head.



They'll be falling into their diddle can.
They'll be falling into their diddle can
with their dando boy.
Meanwhile mighty bargains can be heaved up
from the deep of the subbasement
where bargains reign supreme
in Pluto's kingdom.
Yes and even Pluto will

And before that, dear friends, we heard the Attery Squash doing that lovely song, Santa's Loft-a Mocks the Paw.
And yours truly, I even got to be a part of that.
And there's a little video of that if you look for the Attery Squash.
On YouTube.
They also are at MySpace.com, the Attery Squash, and Facebook.
And we heard a song also by the Psychoskeletons, the Good King Bob song.
The Psychoskeletons are, well, I don't know if they're good like King Bob, but you can find them in good time at SoundClick.com, the Psychoskeletons.
And then there was all those collages.
And, you know, in this case, they were all done.
Either.
By the great Mr. Fernandinandi Lemur or the great whatever it is, the Large.
And you can't get a hold of them, I don't think.
I don't know nothing about the Large and not much about Fernandinandi Lemur except that I don't know where we'd be without him.
Here, on the Hour of Slack, number 1,237, technically.
And, oh, and we have a song.


We heard Tater Gumfries.
That's the first time anybody's heard Reverend Tater Gumfries on this show.
The real Tater Gumfries.
Yeah, as far as I know, that was the real Tater Gumfries.
And if you ever want to read the best of current subgenius writings, including fairy tales and biological and creation sciences and forbidden sciences, you can check out Kearns Holler.
I don't think it's KearnsHoller.com.
It's a blog.
But if you just go Googling Kearns.

Not hollow, but holler.
Anyway, friends, before Lonesome Cowboy Dave gives us a holler in about 10 minutes, this is our New Year's show, you might say, even though it's a bit Christmassy, the way things time out.
By the time you hear this, it may be next year.
2010, the sequel to 2001.
It may very well be next year.
And Princess Wee and I have a sort of a farewell for 2009.
There we go.

Goodbye, goodbye to all of those things that lived before December 2009.
Apologies, by the way, to the Firesign Theater,
who did a little list like that long, long, long ago.
We have more historical 2009 things coming up.
When Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave calls, which should be soon.
However, I should mention that we have some news about festivals coming up
that subgeniuses and others might be interested in.
And the Winter Star Festival is in Ohio, in Delroy.
Winter Star Symposium, that's in February, around Valentine's Day weekend.
Yes, it is.
February 14th, I believe, somewhere, whatever that weekend is.
I'll be preaching there.
And Witch Disco will be jamming there in the Space Cabin.
And Starwood, sponsored by the same folks, Ace, will be happening.
We have a date.
It's a different.
It's a different date than it used to be.
July 6th through 12th.
And maybe more.
It may be a two-week festival.
But the second week will be like the detox or the...
The healing festival.
Yeah, the healing after the furious fun and craziness of Starwood,
which is right after X-Day.
Of course, we're having X-Day Festival, subgenius festival,
starts June 30th and ends July 5th.
So, and in fact, the world ends July 5th.
So, I don't even know why we would be discussing shows or whatnot that may happen then.
I'm going to switch this music over to...
Let's see, what do I want to go to?
Oh, number one would probably be fine.
Number one comes before three, right?
From PR News in Washington, I'm disguised as a security guard.
President Obama is dropping boxes of instant noodles to doctors and nurses
to help them.
To help him blow up the bodies of victims with a car bomb.
Nobody has credibility with the American people on this issue.
The president was speaking to a group of 150 doctors from all 150 states
for the first time in more than a year.
All of the UN's offices have been shut down temporarily as a precaution.
On Wall Street, 8595773,
the first doses of swine flu are being distributed this week.
The New York Times is reporting that many doctors are being cut off today
by people anxious to get PR news.
And I know many are anxious to get...
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Don't you dare get me.
Because I've already been got numerous times.
Lonesome Cowboy Dove is the other name.
I really get Dave. I get him. I really get him.
You know, some people don't.
I do get Dave.
Did anyone offer any solutions to the problem of either not getting or not getting Dave?
Especially with the delivery.
I've been in delivery services lately.
I noticed a lot of people who sing Ave Maria in the shower this time of the year
or maybe perhaps wear little trinkets on their testicles or other organs.
You know, you see the people with the Santa Claus earrings and stuff like that
singing merry, merry, happy, bad songs.
I hate Christmas.
But at least it's over now. So I guess I can stop hating it for a while.
What's up geniuses? We vomit on Christmas.
No, actually I had a great Christmas.
But you know, I'm in a different situation for most because my family is all subgeniuses.
Dave, I hear a strange hum that comes with your phone.
Can you like kick your phone or wiggle it around?
I'm wondering if I can either kick it or call it back.
It went away.
Tickle it.
Hey, the hum went away.
No, I can still hear it. Can you?
Wiggle it.
Can you still hear it?
I just heard the...
Oh, there...
No, I don't hear it.
I hear the hum.
I don't hear the hum. It's fine. I hear beautiful music. How'd you do that?
Oh, well, I was thinking of Brahms and Bach at the same time and it came up with Brahms and the Tinkshnurr.
And there you had it.
Actually, this is Johann George Albrechtsberger.
Albrechtsberger.
Doing the Conspiracy in E major. Titor Gumfries turned us on to this.
You can find it at Kern's Holler actually.
Johann George Albrechtsberger.
And you'll hear later...
Give it a little time and the listeners will hear why we're playing this type of classical music on this particular Hour of Slack.
The kissing goodbye of one annual event and the welcoming in of another.
I always wondered at why those words, you know...
Old father baby time is crawling along in his Alzheimer diapers and changing...
We're changing him. Here we go.
He's playing this harp in the background.
The little baby with the weird Monopoly guy top hat is playing?
Right. No, no. Old man father time baby.
It's the same, you know, it's like, don't tell the kids, but it's the same person.
That's why things don't really change much from year to year.
Well, I was just going to say that I was substantially aware that nothing changed this year,
which is quite precisely why.
Precisely the point of the Church of the Subgenius.
The conspiracy in pinks will continue to rule as long as they continue to rule.
And you will live in a world like that as long as you...
I lost my train of thought there.
I was staring at a bumblebee who apparently drank too much wine and was staggering around on my carpet.
I don't even know where it came from. It's 20 degrees below zero outside.
It's okay, Dave. Everybody loves to watch the train wreck of your mind.
And also the nematodes of your species dish. I mean, your petri dish there.
Well, not everybody has drunken bees on their carpet, you know?
Or nematodes in a petri dish of horror.
Actually, Dave, it's kind of sad, but Nessie and Ned nematode apparently died,
and only one of their little orphan babies is left in there.
And I think they were all eaten up by Sally Cyclops and Simon Cyclops, the copepods.
Because now, every time I look through the microscope, it's like Copepod City.
Well, they're not... they're voracious then, aren't they?
Well, they're gigantic. They're like killer whales compared to all the other little bugs in there.
They're going to start eating themselves pretty soon.
The copepods are so large that you can see them with the nude eye.
And your reading glasses.
It helps to have your reading glasses.
Also a refractory disease, some sort of optic malocclusion of some sort, biting out.
You can tell when they're pregnant, too. The females, anyway.
It's hard to tell with the men, but the male copepods.
But the female Cyclopses, anyway, that type of copepod, carries this big wad of glass balls on its hip, on either hip.
And I guess those glass balls turn into eggs,
and those turn into little baby copepods.
And that's why my... and that's who's eating up everybody else in the Petri dish of horror.
My concentration camp that I keep on my dining room table, actually.
Well, I'd just like to ask the lovely Mrs. Princess Wiardo if she's noticed in your...
in the dining room area there and also in the other places where you sport your tomfoolery,
if she's seen any of these creatures getting bigger than...
as you claim they should have been getting.
Dave! Dave! I enjoy looking at all of these creatures right along with Reverend Stang.
I think they're quite curious and interesting, and it's always so interesting from his perspective, you know?
Well, that is kind of a dodge, wouldn't you say? A kind of a...
a brief shift of the lesson, wouldn't you say?
That you're kind of making a little ado about the... you know, about them getting bigger.
Well, it's just... it's such a fun, wiggly world, you know? It's all just so crazy in there.
If you know what to look for, you can watch them having sex.
Well, that certainly killed the show.
But you can watch them mutate, as you said before.
Mostly they're killing and eating, but they... well, yeah, I'm kind of the Dr. Moreau of microbiology.
I'm into... into kind of doing cross-breeds and so forth.
It's kind of tricky to get a paramecium to mate with an amoeba, but...
But the fun is in trying, you know? The journey's half the fun.
I think it's a rather ironic evocation hobby for you, don't you think? A rather odd one, considering you...
Poor plain god!
... tend to proclaim that you speak for things.

I think it's like a... some sort of ubermensch or something or some sort of... that will come and rescue those chosen few people who are better than the others.
Well, okay, first off...
Or less better or not quite as good as, but never... you know what I'm saying.
Not better, just better.
Just badder.
Slack...
... deep fried.
... will get you through times of no slack, as Zeppo, the bot, said.
But time will get you through slack.
No, what was the other... what was the...
Slack will get you... get you through times of no slack.
... and the turnstile.
That's why it's slack, baby!
Yep, that's why it slaps you in the face like a hot salmon.
Well... well, friends, we're kissing goodnight to the year of 2000-ought-nine.
And, uh... now, Dave...
God, man. Oh, that's been so sweet.
I'm gonna... you...
I'm gonna...
And you guys want...
... the baby's diaper stain bonds.
Because I... I'm embracing this year so wonderfully, of nike... of two-ninety... which is... it
is 98-90... no?
Not 98-1, that's the year that the world almost comes to an end.
2010.
Princess, we was getting, uh, confused between, uh, 2010 and 2012, cause one... in one, the
whole world ends, and in the other one, something wonderful.
It will happen.
Well, this is also the warm-up, in the other way of speaking.
First, something is hap... going to happen, something wonderful, and then the Mayans will
destroy the world.
Yeah, one...
Only... only... only...
... let's face it, this ain't really 2010... coming up, or now.
We don't know what year it is, we don't even know what planet this is.
Right, it's kind of a really, really poorly done hologram.
On a major scale, you might say.
Some of us don't really know who our parents are.
Some of us don't even know who our kids are.
Some of us aren't aware that there are no such things as parents.
There are these, uh, other holograms that have, uh, may or still...
Now you're getting ahead of yourself, Dave, that's in future time.
I don't want to dump the ball, as they used to say in Spanish, but, uh, the fact remains
that many, uh, of the listeners out there who have the ear balls to hear, let them hear
this.
That this world is not going to continue.
It's going to continue too much longer in the present shape it is, one way or another.
Well, we have some predictions here for the year of 2009.
I can hardly wait.
I'm in the spirit, I'm in discernment, I'm getting, uh, an uncut wave of pure feeling
and knowledge from the time that is the timeless all time of all things.
The cash... the uncashed records, you might say.
And, uh, I'm... I'm... I'm seeing an increase in the number of people that are watching this.

Now I'm... I'm in my crystal ball, that in January 3rd of 2009, Israel will or did launch
a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.
But then, not four days later, Russia will or did shut off all gas supplies to Europe
going through the Ukraine.
Well, that's what they did in, uh, 2009.
Or will do in 2009, depending on when you're listening to this show.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
What if you're listening to it from the vapid space of 2010 where we're not even allowed to mention what happened those last few final days of 2009?
Exactly. That's why we have to couch it in these terms.
Because in the year 2010, nobody's allowed to speak the truth or lies unless they're funny.
Well, that's where we're in trouble.
That's where I'm afraid it's all going to fall apart.
Now, this may seem crazy.
Now, this may seem crazy.
I predict that on January 20th of 2009, a black man known as Barack Obama will be inaugurated as 44th President of the United States.
Now, you may say, well, that sounds like science fiction.
That couldn't happen in redneck America.
But I say that it will.
Well, can I?
The poor bastard.
The poor.
Well, go ahead.
I was just thinking of my own personal prediction.
I've been staring at my ball quite as well.
And I predict alongside concurrently with your prediction that on January, is it?
January 20th of 2009.
I dare to be that specific.
On January of this year.
20, 30.
Sometimes towards the end of January of this year.
2010.
That a slack man will be inhibited from growing fungally in the orifices of most small animals.
Well, that's a pretty easy prediction to make, Dave.
Because that's always been true and probably always be true.
They always hold the slack man down.
Just because.
Because they're jealous, mainly, I think.
Yeah, man.
They don't know what it's like to be tough slack.
And so they.
But they don't.
They know that somebody somewhere might be having slack.
So they better put an end to it.
Yep.
Oh, yeah.
The pink man is always trying to hold down the slack man.
They always talk about how.
But it ain't going to work.
Big ears and stuff to hear with.
Like in big pineal glands to smell with.
And different anachronistic.
Oh, you're thinking of a different president.
That's H. Ross Perot.
With the giant ears and pineal gland that sticks off.
Hangs off the front of his face.
That was.
In a different.
That's what that is.
His pineal gland is hanging out.
It was.
Was.
Right.
Was hanging out.
The pineal gland is for whiff reading, isn't it?
Well, it's a vestigial, useless leftover that's attached to the third nostril,
which is actually what you use for whiff reading.
After you've had it opened by the surgeries in Dobbs Town,
by the Dobbs monks and the nun snakes and the lovely flying cherubs
with their sutures and needles and flitting back and forth.
And their bone saws cracking open the front of your head,
opening the third nostril, making a nice little plastic surgery,
winking eye right in the center.
The dim lights of the night table, the orderlies rushing by in their scrubs,
the blood on the floor, your pineal gland hanging from your forehead.
It's not a pretty sight, but it's the only thing you've got to look forward to.
And there's nothing better than a blueberry pineal gland.
Mm-hmm.
Literally all you have to look forward to.
Because it's right there in front of your eyes, right?
Now, I predict, I predict on January of 2009,
the former Union of Congolese Patriots leader, Thomas Lubanga,
will be accused of training child soldiers to kill, pillage, and rape.
You know, that does, it sounds as crazy as a Criswell prediction.
Just to read the action.
It's the most controversial news that really did happen.
Doesn't it?
Indeed.
Well, I know.
Yeah, sure, training child soldiers to kill, pillage, and rape.
Since when are children going to be raping?
Well, that's why they have to train them, I guess.
Well, yeah.
2009.
Post-order drills.
Now, to counter that, though, on January 26th of 2009,
I predict the Icelandic government and banking system will collapse
and Prime Minister Gerhard,
will immediately resign.
Wow, man.
That sounds absurd, because, yeah, why Iceland?
Nobody even thinks about Iceland.
Well, plus, we all know that its economy is,
there's the major economy in Europe right now.
And by the way, if you went into a restroom as a Latin American,
or a South American,
and you exited the bathroom as a North American,
what would you have been in the bathroom?
A Meso-American?
Making a big mess?
That's one of them.
The one I was thinking of was European.
Oh, I get it.
Because you'd be urinating.
I get that part of it.
Yeah, sure.
I don't know what that has to do with a prediction.
I'm sorry.
No, well, it has a lot to do with it,
because remember how I mentioned that the Icelandic government
and banking system would collapse on January 26th?
Well, three days later, on February 1st,
you are...
Anna Sigurðard Yttir
will be appointed as the new Prime Minister of Iceland,
the world's first openly lesbian head of government.
Wow.
That's...
Now, that sounds like something Criswell would have said.
An open lesbian will be Prime Minister of Iceland
in the year 2009.
But, in fact, that will happen.
This, to me, is like listening to...
is like...
reading my book, which I forgot to bring to the night table here,
entitled Predictions.
And it was a book written...
created in the 1950s.
It was a compilation of all the most bizarre predictions
of the 19th century.
There were things of when the automobile was first invented,
where in the year 2000,
everybody would be wearing these huge goggles
and large suits and so forth and stuff
because they hadn't invented it.
They hadn't invented real windshields yet.
Right.
Yeah, because the danger of flying along in the air so fast.
There was one...
Birds and things would hit you.
There was one of the year of 19...
in 1901 of what it will look like in 2001
where the roads were just...
there were billboards everywhere.
And it was very, very ironic or...
No, what's the wrong word?
Disgustingly accurate.
Disgustingly accurate.
Just like yours are.
I mean, the ones that you've read.
Well, you know, there's a wonderful old movie
called Just Imagine that takes place...
It was made in the year of 1930 or so,
and it takes place in the year 1980.
Just imagine.
1980.
And people have numbers instead of names,
and you're assigned...
The government decides who you're going to marry,
and they have...
Instead of eating, they take food pills.
Mm-hmm.
In the year 1980,
Now, in...
I predict that in February of 2009,
Melbourne, Australia,
will record the highest ever temperature
in any capital city,
115 degrees Fahrenheit.
Now, come on, not on Earth.
150?
115.
It was 115 degrees in February
in Melbourne, Australia.
February, Derek.
But remember, they're hanging upside down,
so everything's all different there.
Well, the hottest temperature in Death Valley
ever recorded was 115.
Well, but that's not downtown Big City.
That's just in the suburbs of Death.
You're right.
Right, the valley.
Well, yeah, they like it there.
I mean, that's why skeletons love it
when it's that...
To them, that's breezy.
Oh, nice.
Anything else is cold.
You know, if you're a skeleton,
100 degrees is kind of chilly.
Well, I predict that in the year 2009-10,
which is a backwards-forwards kind of way of looking at it,
that we will all be skeletons
whistling in the breeze,
conducting our everyday business
as if we were fleas,
or as we please.
You know what I mean?
We'd just be going to...
We could make a country-western song out of that.
Oh, I already have.
I've turned it into a wobbly anthem
where the working man,
who has to take over the factories
and start producing really, really rich grower cheese
instead of all these metallic objects.
Now, in February of 2009,
a Russian...
I predict a Russian and an American satellite
will collide over Siberia,
creating a large amount of space junk!
Space junk!
Peru 2!
Well, that's not...
Texas!
That's not such a wild...
Kansas!
Because space junk does...
Christmas!
...has since the devonics
actually whispered those words into our...
front, front, front, front, front, front, front, front.
Space junk!
People are going to think, people are going to think,
people are going to think you're a space junk!
I like when they name off the states.
Texas!
You know.
Yeah.
Now, the next day, I predict...
Oh, that one's not interesting.
It's...
Prime...
A new prime minister of Zimbabwe
following a power-sharing deal with President Bob Mugabe,
the greatest leader of all time.
J.R. Bob Mugabe.
J.R. Bob Mugabe,
who's...
who had inflation at the one trillion percent inflation in his country.
Let's see.
Ew.
Ew.
Oh.
Well, now, we have a whole string of assassinations and coups coming up
in March of 2009.
The president of Guinea-Bissau,
which I've never even heard of,
will be assassinated.
The International Criminal Court will issue an arrest warrant
for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir
for war crimes against humanity in Darfur.
And, lastly,
the president of Madagascar will be overthrown in a coup d'etat.
And Hamburger will be all over the highlands.
By the way, in Mystic, Connecticut.
Oh!
I don't...
Train commuters in Mexico City will be wearing surgical masks
due to outbreaks of...
swine flu.
Well, I predict that in such a following year,
in the upcoming one that we are designed to be in right now,
that...
hexagon computers will also be falsified
into wearing undergarments on public transit.
Thank you.
Take my word for it.
I believe you.
I believe you.
You wouldn't lie.
I'm not...
Listen to this.
I'm not spouting the usual trans...
trans bites
that you hear so regularly on the figu-mental radio and televisions.
And this is the real poop.
Now, listen to this.
Listen to this now, Dave.
...that the arms sing
for us two.
For us two.
For us two.
Every day.
Every day.
I don't...
I don't...
It's true.
Thank you.
It's, um, Lolita.
I thought it was Marlena Daytrick.
No, it's Lolita doing...
...from Yoyoyoyotay.
...Theme from a Summer Place.
That was one of my mom's favorite albums.
Oh, I remember that, too.
In Berkish Garden, we used to sit around the patio,
which was actually the...
Never mind, I...
My mind's taking a bad turn, right?
No, I don't want to say what I'm thinking.
Now, uh, what else happened in, uh...
What else did God do in 2009?
Oh, he caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake in...
Oh, thank God.
...La Chila, Italy, where he La Chilad nearly 300 people.
That's not good.
God had people in Peru sentence their former president, Alberto Fujimori,
funny name for a Peruvian, to 25 years in prison for ordering killings and kidnapping.
Snappings by security forces.
And a political crisis will begin in Fiji in 2009,
when President Josefa Oiloilo...
Oh!
...suspends the nation's constitution, dismisses all judges and constitutional appointees,
and assumes all governance in the country.
What I think is very nice about their prediction, Stangeman,
is that you've mentioned the fact that, you know,
while we wonder why all these foreign wars,
and, uh, strange political events are occurring around the globe in such obscure places as Fiji,
it's not hard to imagine why, when we think that the man's name was Oili, Oili, Oili.
Oiloilo.
Oiloilo.
I swear to God.
Well, you know, I'm...
...interested in Fiji because there's Oiloilo there.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Earth means nothing.
What, Earth means nothing?
Yeah.
Yeah.



Are we getting that command again?
No, I got distracted.
It's all right.
Everything's okay.
Everything's okay.
I thought you were, you know, messing with the thing, and they were going...
Because finally, in May of 2009,
I predict that following a quarter century of fighting,
the Sri Lankan Civil War will end with the total military defeat of the LTTE.
Which is the Tamil Tigers?
I guess so.
Legal extremists?
Yeah.
And the legal...
No.
No.
By the same token, in South Korea, former president Roh Moo-hyun, the human,
will be under investigation for bribery during his term and commit suicide.
Meanwhile, in North Korea, they will announce a second successful nuclear test.
I call it a test.
In which...
Which...
Which...
Which...
Which...
Which...
Which...
North Korea.
North Korea.
North Korea.
And, uh...
They're always, uh, causing bad stuff.
Don't they?
I...
I...
I...
I...
I have another prediction.
Eh?
I believe that on October 30th of 2010, Dr. Howell will announce he's running for Congress.
Oh, you mean 2009?
I mean, well, yes.
That's right.
That's right.
Dr. Howell is...
Well, there's certainly a Facebook page to elect Dr. Howell, the great subgenius thinker
and yakker.
There's not only a Facebook page.
The answerer.
There's a...
There's an http://tinyurl.com slash electdrhowell2010 if you're interested to read about more of it.
Oh, oh.
So it's tinyurl.com slash electdrhowell2010?
Yes.
Yes.
And thank you.
There's a funny...
Thank you, Rocknarr.
Thank you very much for that.
Yes, Governor Rocknarr set that up, and there's like hundreds of people behind him now.
Hundreds.
So, you know...
And they've got a big...
Today, California.
Uberales.
Tomorrow, the Verde.
California.
Uber...
I...
I...
I think that's going to happen.
I think much like Upton's in Clara Lewis, he's going to reorganize the state in a way
that the federal authorities are going to be forced to attack Sacramento with their eyes
shut.
Uh, uh, wearing bunny hats?
No, no, no, no.
Now, almost halfway...
Huh?
Huh?
I'm just trying to waste your time.
The bunny hats, well, now, those, yes.
And I predict that in the year 1895, glass bunny hats will be worn by the swells and
the gents, gentlemen and ladies of the upper classes.
I predict that if the women...
Continue to get as much power as they want by the year 2000, they'll all be smoking cigarettes
and be in charge of the military, giving men the orders.
Well, I had to do the dishes.
Half part of them.
Gosh, they're bringing back the glass rabbit hats?
Now, on, uh...
I predict, friends, if you're planning to fly from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris,
don't take flight Air France 447 on June 1st, 2009.
Because you're going to be in charge of the military.


Because you'll crash in the ocean and all die.
You are uncanny.
I predict that an outbreak of an H1N1 influenza strain, commonly referred to as hog cold,
will be deemed a global pandemic.
Nostrus tangus.
And yet, nothing much will come of it.
Nostrus tangus.
It will be a handy...
It will be a handy scare.
Another great scare, like SARS.
And what was one last year?
Oh, bird flu.
Avian flu.
Yeah, we're all going to die of avian flu.
Now we're going to die of pig flu.
Next, we're going to die of monkey flu.
Then it's going to be goldfish flu.
But everyone knows that goldfish never flew.
The flying fish flew, and the flying squirrels did, but not the goldfish.
What?
What?
What?
What?


What?

















Squims and the electronic fishes were all joined together in a gigantic melange of boo-boo
ply.
They wanted to be friends.
They were tired of fighting and crying and pulling out each other's eyes.
One of the smarter fish, the river and ivory stink, condemned the rest of the fish, saying
that they were unfit.
Unfit?
Unfound.
And didn't taste good.
You're unfit.
All of you.
Damn you.
I had to stop there because of physical problems.
Now, Princess Wee, what is the name of the president of Iran who will be re-elected despite
tremendous...
Black Luster Blimey, I think.
You know how to pronounce his name funnily.
Zorag the Magnificent.
No.
Mamut.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.







Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Akhman-e.
Mississippi River Basin, attack St. Louis, leaving thousands of orphaned children and strung out moms and dads with no toothpaste and other people that just didn't want to get out of St. Louis.
And it will go so far up the Mississippi that it will even attack St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Jude and St. Claire, Wisconsin.
Okay. Okay. Fine.
I'm sorry.
And we'll also be responsible for the death on June 25th, 2009, of American entertainer Michael Jackson, St. Michael, which will trigger an outpouring of world grief.
And reactions to this event will cripple several major websites and Internet services.
Because of the terrible tragedy of losing such an important artist who, one day before he died,
was being reviled as a child molester all over everywhere.
All you have to do, man, nothing.
Death makes the greatest PR agent ever.
Avar.
Truly.
No, that's your thing.
Avar.
I predict that a balloon bag baby will climb into his father's elements and continue to harangue the atmosphere from a pretty high altitude.
It'll be out there all the time, you know.
And that a...
An irate jumble of news services will continue to fog the issues.
And Hu Jintao, the new former prince...
The human.
Not prince, but the first party secretary of the Chinese thing there, will join hands and feet with all those people.
And that'll be it for us, you know.
I want to make these scary ones.
Like the children are going...
They start growing hair on their feet and big fangs, you know.
Stuff like that.
But sometimes America's got to wake up.
Because...
Well, there's good news.
It's not all bad news.
I predict that in August of 2009, Bolivia will become the first South American country to declare the right of indigenous people to govern themselves.
Now, see, it did only took how many...
500?
Yeah, only 500.
600?
500?

500 years?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's, you know, things are moving along.
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop.
About llama speed, I would say.
Well, they can go pretty good, but...
Yeah, I guess we're going to have to put that in the plus column and order two more fried rice.
I predict that North Korean leader Kim Jong-il will pardon two American journalists who've been arrested for illegal entry into North Korea
after a reach-around from U.S. President Bill...
Bill Clinton.
Okay.
Typhoon Morakot will hit Taiwan, killing 500 and stranding more than 1,000 in the worst flooding in this island in half a century.
Friends, there's signs in the heaven and signs in the earth.
Bob predicted it.
Blood belching from the earth.
And great waves, tidal waves.
It's never happened before.
And crazy weather.
That's never happened before either.
These things shall be harbingers of the end times.
The end for those who never became subgenius ministers.
But it will be the beginning times for those who had faith in Bob, kept up the FIB.
A mental case.
Right.
And kept their mentats in the right cases in case of wars and rumors of wars.
And SARS and rumors of SARS.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
I can't...
I can't disagree with you more.
And yet at the same time, I want to pound the tambourine and say whatever the hell you like.
Some sort of ditto head or something.
Just, you know, repeat everything you say.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
It's hard to pursue a future.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.




shock or dismay us.
It's hard to think of a future
that makes us feel all soft and squishy,
like a beaten-up tennis ball.
I think if we just have faith in our leaders,
everything will be just fine.
Don't you think?
Just have faith.
Just trust whoever is the authority.
Give it a try.
Quit questioning authority.
God.
It seems like the more you question,
the more problems you have.
Why not just...
Oh.
Kill them all and Bob sort them out.
That's what I say.
That was the prediction about 1984, wasn't it?
But, well, now the world leaders that used to run,
the world used to run on a G8,
and they have improved that.
It's now the G20 of world leaders.
20 little cylinders popping off at one time during the season, yeah.
Finding ways to make the rich richer and the poor.
Or...
Invisible.
Invisible.
Invisible.
And you know there's...
Invisible.
Oils lubricating them pistons in them cylinders.
I don't know why I said that twice in a row.
I don't want to be a...
Well, it's like us...
Diseffective to the energy consortiums of the world.
We non-rich people are the grease used in those engines
to keep them running smoothly
so the rich people can drive around.
But, Pam, you live...
Since...
Since...


Stang bitterly.
Jealously.
The Mesozoic Oink gravy.
Let's see.
When did they create them?
Dinosaurs that got frozen into pie.
Well, over a period of time,
from about 300 million years ago
to when the men from Planet X first showed up
about 60 million years ago.
So was that the geodesic or the harmonic age?
Oh, that was the Devonian.
Devonian?
Oh, no, no.
That was before.
That was more like the talking Hedzian
or the Elvis Costello-ian age.
I get mixed up.
That was which one was ahead of which.
Right.
It was right before the Archezoid period,
which was a very, very long series of cramps
brought on by the Devonians.
And we...
She's a woman.
She knows about Archezoid cramps.
I do.
I actually do know.
That's true.
They come once every 28 million years and...
Exactly.
Exactly.
And when the Earth goes ow, ow, ow,
I'm going to, you know...
That's a womanly thing.
Well, the planet is a womanly thing.
Only women bleed, right?
I was going to go...
I'm interested in going to see a bunch of women bleed
in March of the year 2010
when the opening bout of this year's season
of roller derby starts in Cleveland
with the Burning River Roller Girls.
Oh, man.
The Hard Knockers.
Yeah.
Our team is the Hard Knockers.
But they're going to be up against the Rolling Pinups
on March 13th.
And then the second game is the Hell Bombers
versus the Cleveland Steamers.
Now, I kind of like them because of their name.
But those are actual real roller derby teams
here in northern Ohio.
And the Burning River Roller Girls are going to start.
We missed this last season.
But I've...
I've kind of gotten interested in that.
For some reason, Princess Wee is not interested
in seeing husky young women
ramming into each other at high speeds.
I only wanted to go when my friend's daughter was doing it.
And once she got out of it, I have no further interest.
Well, but see, your friend's daughter gave us a catalog
that had pictures of all the team members
of all the roller derby teams in Ohio.
Which piqued your interest, and it hasn't ended.
It piqued...
It piqued...
It piqued...
It piqued...
It piqued...




It piqued...
It piqued...








I used my audio editing program, Peak.
He went into a fit of Peak.
Yeah.
But...
Well, I remember Wendy Williams,
before she turned into a fish,
was the head of a huge girls' ladies' wrestling team
that I actually tried to join.
I actually went to the auditions and...
Did you really?
Yeah.
I had to do this zip-up mommy and the whole deal going on.
Really?
I had a wig that was really...
Really itchy, too, by the way.
And I didn't convince anybody, but they invited me back to sell wieners.
I bet.
If you're not too old for it, Dave, you can try again.
Sodas and so forth, you know.
Roller derby's coming back big.
Now, let's get through the predictions here real fast.
Roman Polanski will be arrested in Switzerland, Cleveland.
See, he's going to be a wrestler, too, in Cleveland.
Yeah, he'll be a wrestler with the roller derbies and be arrested for it.
But let's see.
A tsunami near the Samoan Islands will do its usual thing.
There'll be an earthquake off Sumatra, which will cause Skull Island to sink even farther beneath the waves.
Atlantis will rise in the middle of Kansas.
That's in Revelation X, I think, or Dateline for Dominance.
But it is Kansas. It hasn't been moved to Missouri.
It's actually Kansas right now.
But I predict that...
European astronomers will discover 32 exoplanets in October of 2009.
And that in November, NASA will announce that it has found a significant quantity of water in the moon's Cabeus crater.
Yes, a crater of the moon harbors water as well as a small amount of cheap vodka.
Wow.
A goobriel goodness.
Yes.
Oh, and finally...
Oh, this is the very last prediction.
As we approach the end of the show, CERN in Switzerland will restart the Large Hadron Collider Particle Accelerator in Geneva.
And the world will end in mass hallucinations that it hasn't ended yet.
Wow.
And it ends along with this witch disco recording from Starwood last year.
That was the end of that.
That was the end.
And it's...
The end of the show almost.
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, yes, we must.
We must go.
We could at least have a few more really coarse arguments.
Or perhaps we could do root stunts in the buff.
No, no, no.
We've done the root stunts in the buff and we have to go.
It's time to go because the proper next show, the good show, will be coming.
No pedagogical arguments.
No...
No...
No...
No, no, no.
In fact, I'm fading you very slowly out right now, Dave, because we really have to go.
It's...
It really sounds like the hour of slack.
Bye, Dave.
It's...
This music in the background is Leo Cupper radio.
Leo Cupper with a C.
Again, thanks to Tater for turning us on to this.
But I'm going to let us go out with a little smash.
And that will be the end of this hour of slack.
Thank you.
You're normally such a slacker.
It's the first time you've heard of him.
Are all four of you guys in here?
Is Phil in there?
He just...
Yeah, yeah.
Can we...
Do it with four?
Yeah, all four.
Okay.
What are we doing?
How do we...
This is...
This is...
Oh, the hour of slack.
They'll do the comedy.
How about this is Phil?
Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater.
Okay.
This is Phil.
Phil.
Let's take it again.
Oh, Pete and Dave.
Okay, there we go.
All right.
You over here?
You just shut up.
This is Phil.
Phil.
Pete.
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.
And we're listening to the hour of slack.
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.
Because we're subgeniuses.
And we're slacking off.
Now, but Bob has a beautiful face like a flower.
Bob should join the Ku Klux Klan.
I heard you have hair on your chest, Bob.
No, there are times when Bob has something on his mind.
And Bob is not very worldly.
And Bob isn't the biggest sports fan.
Bob said, I heard the Lions were playing the Tigers.
Bob is not a sports fan.
Bob was the first comedian.
Bob honestly has never had an unkind word for anybody.
Anybody, anybody, anybody, anybody, anybody.
