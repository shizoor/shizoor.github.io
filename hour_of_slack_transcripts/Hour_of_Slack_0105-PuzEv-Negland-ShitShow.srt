1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:19,480
Set my body on the radio, on the radio, radio control.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,400
Can I just bring it back here, Jack Siegel?

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,620
The show is starting up.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,280
Go ahead and hit number five ignition switch.

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,780
You want to turn it into a broadcast?

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,840
Oh, we're already broadcasting.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,700
All right, let's hit.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,600
All right.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
You love it listening.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,580
Whoa!

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,620
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,140
Hey.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,220
Yes!

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,000
It's the scream that knocks you out when you go down for the count.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,220
It's the dream becoming reality and the battle cry of seduction.

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,460
Best of all, it's true!

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
Are we controlled by secret forces?

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,240
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,840
Do people think you're strange?

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,480
Do you?

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,320
Then you may be on the right track.

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,420


24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,160
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
No trouble.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560
Just get set and get going.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,400
Here we go.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,660
Recording.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,880
Everything's going fine.

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,700
No trouble.

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,380
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,140
Bob?

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Bob?

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Bob?

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,700
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,100
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,380
What about Slack?

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,540
That's your key phrase.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,580
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
Welcome to the subgenius radio industry.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
Power of Slack.

43
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,180
Sponsored by Bob.

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,720
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

45
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:38,160
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the first orthodox mega fist temple lodge of the church of the subgenius.

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,920
The sexiest man on earth.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,540
A young Adonis who's irresistible.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,240
Wait a minute, I've got to have sex with you.

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,240
You shall have sex.

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,280
Bob is sex.

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,500
Bob?

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,180
Bob.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,180
Bob.

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,460
Bob.

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:11,660
Bob?

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,780
We are controlling transmission.

57
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,360
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

58
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,580
Three.

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Two.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,140
Two and one.

61
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,420
Now to continue with the tape recording.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,240
Oh, and the barrage, the intro barrage, by the way, dear friends,

63
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,640
is by me and Puzzling Evidence and St. Byron Werner and Mark Mothersbaugh.

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,500
Walk forwards.

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,680
Walk backwards.

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,440
Radio control.

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,140
Walk hard.

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,980
Take a vacation.

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
Radio control.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
Radio control.

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,100
Bob's getting down with you here tonight.

72
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,960
Bob's getting down to help you.

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,500
No part.

74
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,180
Wait a minute.

75
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,540
Okay.

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, Ben.

77
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,600
The Subgenius Foundation, the Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond,

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,420
and they are, as we mentioned before, the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation,

79
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,160
which is the publishing and PR arm of the Church of the Subgenius.

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,840
You're in the...

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Just for the bucks?

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,560
Do you have some?

83
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,300
No.

84
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,500
Don't you kick me in the gutter.

85
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,540
This one's for Puzzling Evidence again.

86
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh.

87
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,380
Yuck.

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,140
Hello?

89
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,840
Hello.

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,140
This is the famous Subgenius radio program.

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,740
We're calling you from the left coast.

92
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,760
The United States.

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,160
Did you hear about that?

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,220
We're sorry.

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,360
You called the wrong show.

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,640
We'll have to reconnect and be part of your dialing process later.

97
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,920
Now let's go over that again.

98
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,380
Dial again.

99
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,020
And dial again.

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,200
And dial again.

101
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
We're sorry, too.

102
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,980
Because it's spooky.

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,020
And dial 823-7490.

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
And be on the show.

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,800
But, of course, a vast conspiracy...

106
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,700
The show.

107
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,640
You won't believe.

108
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,380
You heard the whole thing.

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,700
823-7490.

110
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,300


111
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
The show.

112
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,500
Oh my god!

113
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,820
Die Autobots!

114
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,940
First Prime.

115
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,120
Then Ultra Magnus.

116
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,180
And now you.

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,560
It's a pity you Autobots die so easily.

118
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,620
Or I'll kill you.

119
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,480
I might have a sense of satisfaction now.

120
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,240
You got the touch!

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,860
You got the...

122
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,680
Arise, Ragnus Prime.

123
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Optimus.

124
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,020
Yeah!

125
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,740
Just you wait!

126
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,440
Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian Wars

127
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,620
as we march forward to a new era.

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,740
A new age of peace and happiness.

129
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,820
Till all are one!

130
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Till all are one!

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,180
Till all are one!

132
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,180


133
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,700
Dear friends.

134
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,660
It's so true.

135
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,040
And this show.

136
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:15,920
My subgenius listeners marks a new age of the merging of all shows in friendship.

137
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,580
Ending the battle of the shows.

138
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,320
And joining together in masculine power against the conspiracy.

139
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,100
I'll kill you even if I have to.

140
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,860
I'll kill you even if I have to.

141
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,100
I'll kill you even if I have to.

142
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,160
I'll kill you even if I have to.

143
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,160


144
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,860
You can call.

145
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,840
828-9500 or 823-7490.

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,660
If you're...

147
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,560
If you think you really want to know what's going on.

148
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,240
You can call.

149
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,080
If you think you really want to know what's going on.

150
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,100
I'll call and you'll get to tell me.

151
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,960
If you think you're really going to tell me.

152
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:06,960


153
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:06,960


154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,580
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

155
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,940
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

156
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,500
Stella!

157
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,940
Stella!

158
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,480
Open the Padme doors please, help!

159
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,500
Open up, Podbean girls, please, now!

160
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,300
Is it safe? Is it safe?

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,220
Is it safe?

162
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,900
Here's Johnny!

163
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,620
Here's Johnny!

164
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,460
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!

165
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,320
Fall home! Fall home!

166
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
I am not an animal!

167
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,540
Badges! Badges!

168
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,760
We don't need no stinking badges!

169
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
My sister, my daughter, my sister, my daughter, my sister, my daughter!

170
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,620
It's hard work bringing you great movies.

171
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,260
Queen of Blood.

172
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,000
She's gorged herself of fresh blood.

173
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,920
She's a monster.

174
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,420
We have a good supply of blood plasma with us.

175
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,680
We'll use that to feed her.

176
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,920
And if we run out of plasma, Commander?

177
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,460
I have some good news.

178
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,500
May I share it with you?

179
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,740
I have some good news.

180
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,720
May I share it with you?

181
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,400
Hi, I'm Reverend Doug.

182
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,440
Welcome to our singles group.

183
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Hi, I'm Reverend Doug.

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,600
Welcome to our singles group.

185
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,120
Oh, by the way, have you been born again?

186
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh, by the way, have you been born again?

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,120
I can acknowledge your need for your space.

188
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,200
The model carefully today.

189
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,400
No doctor will ever touch me.

190
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
The model carefully today.

191
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,980
No doctor will ever touch me.

192
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,520
Warriors of Allah feel no pain when they die.

193
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,160
Yes, Jesus loves me.

194
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,420
Yes, Jesus loves me.

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,340
Sister Mary Elizabeth, hit me with a stick.

196
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,580
Sister Mary Elizabeth, hit me with a stick.

197
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,500
Sister Mary Elizabeth, hit me with a stick.

198
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,660
Man didn't come from no monkey.

199
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,660
He came from the breath of God.

200
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,660
Man didn't come from no monkey.

201
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,760
He came from the breath of God.

202
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,320
Hare Krishna. Hare Rama.

203
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,160
Here's your flower where's my dolla.

204
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,640
Hare Krishna. Hare Rama.

205
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Here's your flower where's my dolla.

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:27,820
Where's my dolla?

207
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,860
I'm not allowed to tell you what my mantra is.

208
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,700
I'm not allowed to tell you what my mantra is.

209
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,500
When I hit yo-

When I hit your head.

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,480

uh

245
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,460
uh

246
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,680
uh

247
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,100
uh

248
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,100


249
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,360
uh

250
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,260
uh

251
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,380
uh uh

252
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,440
uh uh

253
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,000
uh

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,940
at the age of three.

255
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,540
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit

256
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,140
strange powers of persuasion.

257
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,140
By age six, he had made his first million

258
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,480
almost by accident.

259
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,560
In college, he met and married his first

260
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,900
and still his primary wife, Connie,

261
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,420
who is now revered by female subgeni

262
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,260
as the blessed anti-virgin.

263
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,880
With Connie's encouragement,

264
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,340
the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary

265
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,100
and almost frightening abilities,

266
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,740
known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

267
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,400
He worked his way up to the very top

268
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,860
of the conspiracy ladder and might have saved it.

269
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,020
But late one night in 1953,

270
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,220
while working on an amateur television of his own design,

271
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,620
an event occurred which was to become a milestone

272
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,560
in man's mind path to slap.

273
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,420
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit

274
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,320
by the hand of the devil.

275
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,940
The hand of Jehovah One itself,

276
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,280
the cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament,

277
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,860
the wrathful alien space god

278
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,560
from some corporate sin galaxy.

279
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,860
In this timeless moment,

280
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,140
which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob,

281
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Dobbs received the first of countless

282
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,700
grain-curdling pronouncements

283
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,220
which form the sacred prescriptures of the church.

284
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,640
He was shown a vision,

285
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,940
a world where all humanity was equally wealthy,

286
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,620
rich beyond imagining,

287
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,480
but without working.

288
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,620
This experience, combined with his UFO-given sales magic,

289
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,860
led him inevitably into the religion field.

290
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,320
He quickly discovered the golden rule

291
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,180
embodied in his classic saying,

292
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,820
they'll pay to know what they really think.

293
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,760
Is this Bob?

294
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,660
You're cool.

295
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,320
You're cool.

296
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,320


297
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,580
Psychedelic Groover-Rock-a-trasmik.

298
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,460
I can dig it.

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,720
You wanna hear me rap?

300
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,780
The suspect was observed running down the street

301
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,400
with a ball-peen hammer.

302
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,400
The officer apprehended the suspect

303
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,280
and fired six warning shots into the back of her head.

304
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,440
The ball-peen hammer was recovered by the monster.

305
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,440
Oh, it's neat riding the shore out on the coast.

306
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,300
Hey, you know what?

307
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,300


308
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,640
School is where it's at, baby.

309
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,560
That's right.

310
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,260
And just say no to everything.

311
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,220
Even the show.

312
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,220
Be for bliss.

313
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,080
Ah, friends.

314
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,320
Before I continue, I'm gonna try the other deck.

315
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,180
See how the other...

316
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,240
The deck, freshly repaired.

317
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,280
So...

318
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Not new.

319
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,780
Usually used when I'm getting the first post.

320
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,960
Yeah.

321
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,280
19lungs positivist.

322
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:42,220
We can't blame you

323
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,740
for this, baby.

324
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,740


325
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,740


326
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,100
But cigarettes aren't expensive,

327
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,740
which one ever is,

328
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,240
my lips are only insane.

329
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,780
It's just a buddy.

330
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,620
Some usually even unexpectedly 출출기라고

331
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,580
What?

332
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,620
What?

333
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,000
Robbins, Robert Williams, the underground cartoonist, Gary Panner, and Mark Mothersbaugh

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,500
are all represented in these horrible news reports of different kinds. It's just a weird

335
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:12,820
coincidence, a wave, a flap, you might say, of subgenius vocal intrusion into normal airwave

336
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:21,440
reality. Ah, ah, nothing, I see. Oh, well, wait, wait, let's, let's, let's just, uh,

337
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,740
let's just flip the right switch, turn that zombie's nose around, and there. Okay, get your

338
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,600
cheap sunglasses on. It's time to admit to the bad influences we've enjoyed over the years,

339
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,740
and the bad influences we all were, and the bad art we've really loved. Stuff that issue

340
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,500
of Zap Comics into your back pocket, and let's trip back in time a few weeks to an art opening

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,860
at the Otis Parsons Gallery. It's called, what else, Bad Influences.

342
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,220
Here's Georgeanne Dean on the faculty of Otis Parsons Illustration and Commercial Design

343
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,860
Department. She's organized Bad Influences, and she's bad.

344
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,720
None of us have been able to do that.

345
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,800
Unaccepted, or even invited, or we couldn't even get any credence with these, um, galleries,

346
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,900
you know, with respectable galleries around town, and we'd all shown at all these underground

347
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,840
galleries. We like to keep our work within the popular culture. In other words, we like to,

348
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:37,080
we like our work to be mass distributed, so we work in comics, and magazines, and we do album

349
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,320
covers, and things like that as well. Vietnam veteran Doug Wellman. In an 1970,

350
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,820
we were challenging each other to see what kinds of pirate signals we could broadcast,

351
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,940
and my joke had to be taking a turntable up in this aircraft, and on the flight I did it,

352
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,260
we had a crew chief who got an air metal or some metal force shooting down

353
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:08,360
seven of 11 MiGs. He was playing Electric War Game next to me, and I'm broadcasting

354
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,600
Louie Louie and Aqualung 2.

355
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,480
To, uh, to these pilots at the same time.

356
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:32,620
The show includes five other artists whose work you may have seen, but not on a gallery wall,

357
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,640
maybe in your record collection, or in Playboy, or Pep House, or Hot Rod magazine,

358
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,420
and the show features memorabilia of the bad influences.

359
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,960
On these artists, a big hot rod in the middle of the floor, horror movie posters, a robot collection,

360
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,100
cheap toys. Here's George Ann again.

361
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,260
Barbie. Oh, there's a big Barbie dream house over there. Barbie, I just loved. I thought she was

362
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,900
like the most wonderful woman. She just had everything. She was the best body. She had a

363
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,920
gigantic cranium, so you knew she was brilliant. She just had it all, so she was kind of, you know,

364
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,480
subconsciously that became like the woman I wanted.

365
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,260
be I suppose.

366
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:34,980
Next to the hot rod is the many layered graphic comic book art of Robert Williams, along with some of his psychedelic paintings circa 1968. He was one of the

367
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:42,420
pioneers of underground comics in the 60s, starting as a cartoonist for Ed Big Daddy Roth's Hot Rod Magazine.

368
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:55,060
What you got here is you got influences that affected people young and more like poison. In my display over here, I got like early EC comic books that the

369
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:03,780
Kieffhofer committee outlawed in the 50s because they were so good. The draftsmanship was beautiful. The stories were fantastic.

370
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,460
That's cool.

371
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:14,740
They had sex and violence, gratuitous sex and violence. The stories were just a little heavy. They were saying that these comic books were like, you know, poisoning our children.

372
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:27,200
One of Williams' comments in the full color catalog is a key to the show. If it commands attention, it's culture. If it matches the couch, it's art.

373
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,900
Let's face it, you know, that's a fact. And that's not bad. That is not a bad thing.

374
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,440
It's a good thing.

375
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:42,580
If the people are happy and the painting matches their couch, that's all right. A painting like any of these would destroy anyone's living room.

376
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:51,820
The show also includes work by Byron Werner, psychedelic mandalas based on movie stars or other cultural icons.

377
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:02,220
There are wall-sized murals by Gary Panter, the creator of the Jimbo comic strip, and recently the Emmy-winning designer of Pee-Wee's Playhouse.

378
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,440
In other instances, the Northeastern comics are the only ones who have been able to make a living in the world.

379
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,720
For some, J.D. Rischer apparently intended to write a film about the

380
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,960
history of American culture.

381
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:17,180
J.D. Werner was very interested in each human being and came to the knowledge he had of walks by their ancestors, subjects they looked like warriors, and people we saw in the kingdom.

382
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,440
In principle, in terms of the fehltive tranquility, the Chinese heaven, it's indeed very wild.

383
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,720
J.D. For instance, variety of пов together's media outlets is written about one or two different kinds of lovers.

384
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,120
For instance, great writer James weighted one man and —

385
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Dom reperio used

386
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,680
him as a prop image.

387
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,420
Post-C kits and aha, you expectwar and a lot of women.

388
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,520
naming each one of us, telling us what we're having in our box lunches,

389
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,660
maybe naming a couple of things on the aircraft like a book

390
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,260
or something that was there before flight time, a few hours before flight time,

391
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,300
and I would imagine was carefully scoped out by a Vietnamese compatriot on the ground.

392
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,780
And so within an hour or two after takeoff,

393
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,040
they'd have all this info that seemed like they were on the airplane with you,

394
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,600
like a spy was in your midst.

395
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,380
I have a feeling that thing's still alive.

396
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,020
A delicious Blooperton sundae.

397
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,380
It is.

398
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,620
Boy, is this thing ugly.

399
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,520
Wow, does it stink.

400
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,280
Smells bad.

401
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,120
Yes, Topo Jijo, I know.

402
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,020
We still must take it in.

403
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,000
Because it is hungry and has no place to go,

404
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,500
its fur is matched and it needs a place to sleep.

405
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,580
I don't know.

406
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,880
It only wants to be friends.

407
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,580
Friends, huh?

408
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,100
You think this thing has an intellect?

409
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,060
Next thing you'll be telling this thing can feel and think like us.

410
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,260
Smoke.

411
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,460
Good.

412
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,900
Here, take this torch.

413
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,900
Torch.

414
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:52,980
Good.

415
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,180
I think this thing is going to be a good show.

416
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,820
Yes, and so the show crawled toward its end.

417
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,960
I think he's accepted some basic information

418
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,020
and is now ready to go on to the second phase of his monstrous career.

419
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Not a phase.

420
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,960
It didn't phase the show.

421
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,220
Yes, the show monster kept on and on.

422
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,640
It seemed like his brief life had been a long one

423
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,000
as he learned the mysteries of art and science.

424
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,280
Really?

425
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:22,960
Yes.

426
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,960


427
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,960


428
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,960


429
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,960


430
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,960


431
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,860
He learned to calculate the third and most mysterious ray,

432
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,620
the great ray that lies beyond the spectrum.

433
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,300
Come on, I just want the end of the show to come

434
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,100
before we get to fly back to some other city.

435
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,360
I think it's St. Louis now.

436
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,920
Stuart has served me raw eggs.

437
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,380
And then she gave me out-of-date chewing gum.

438
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,880
And then she wouldn't give me a date.

439
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,180
Then she wouldn't let me out of the bathroom.

440
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,700
She didn't say a thing about me.

441
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:52,960
Then she wouldn't let me out of the bathroom.

442
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,260
Then she wouldn't let me off the plane.

443
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,560
And then she kept making me drink more of that coffee.

444
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,280
Treating me like a drug.

445
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,900
And then she gave me a three-day-old newspaper.

446
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,460
And she gave me these pills.

447
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,780
Did she give you any of those?

448
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,740
I was on the plane taking the pills.

449
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,580
That's all I remember.

450
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,880
Then...

451
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,260
Last but not least, there's the lead singer of Devo,

452
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,040
Mark Mothersbaugh, with his wall of hand-drawn postcards.

453
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,940
They're two chunks out of a diary that I've been keeping

454
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,440
for about 15 years.

455
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,440
You're in some radio station about to talk to a disc jockey

456
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,540
who's really into Aerosmith and could give you it

457
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,780
whether he talks to somebody from Devo or not.

458
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,160
Or, you know, you're waiting to show up in court

459
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,080
in a court battle between Virgin Records and Warner Brothers

460
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,940
and you're just like some stupid pawn that's been trapped in the thing.

461
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
You know, so I just sit there with postcards.

462
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,180
And I used to mail them off, and then after a while

463
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,820
I ran out of friends, so I started saving them

464
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,220
and they turned into my diary.

465
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,760
Just like I told Hitler that time,

466
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,120
back when we were just a couple of fronting buddies.

467
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,700
One man's bummer is another man's beautiful thang.

468
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,840
And he always believes in that.

469
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,520
I have sent for you, Dodgers, because we are facing a crisis.

470
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,600
The world's supply of Eludium Fosdex, the shaving cream atom,

471
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,680
is alarmingly low.

472
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,100
Now we have reason to believe that the only remaining source is on Planet X, somewhere

473
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,140
in this area.

474
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,820
And you want me to find Planet X, is that it?

475
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,320
Can you do it, Dodgers?

476
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,900
Oh, in doobly-doobly-doobly-doobly, sir.

477
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,380
I'm Sinbad the Sailor, so hardy and hale.

478
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,620
I live on an island on the back of a whale.

479
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,160
It's a whale of an island, that's not a bad joke.

480
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,920
Its lord and its master is this handsome bloke.

481
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,560
Oh, the most remarkable, extraordinary fellow.

482
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,880
Sinbad the Sailor.

483
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:14,320
I scare all creation on land or on sea, but talk about women, they all fall for me.

484
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,460
I take my adventures wherever they're found.

485
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,500
I go on the brag boat.

486
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,340
I've been around.

487
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,180
I'm the most, the most phenomenal, extra special kind of fellow.

488
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,540
I'm Sinbad the Sailor.

489
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,800
Oh, my.

490
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
Oh, my.

491
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,880
Oh, my.

492
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,060
Oh, my.

493
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,520
Oh, my.

494
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:41,960


495
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:41,960


496
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,260
Oh, my.

497
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,760
Oh, my.

498
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,100
Oh, my.

499
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,900
Oh, my.

500
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,560
Oh, my.

501
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,440
Oh, my.

502
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,700
Oh, my.

503
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,440
Oh, my.

504
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,220
Oh, my.

505
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,220


506
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,600
Oh, my.

507
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,920
Oh, my.

508
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,860
Oh, my.

509
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,060
Oh, my.

510
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,120


511
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,120


512
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,120


513
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,860
Oh, my.

514
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,920
Oh, my.

515
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,160
Oh, my.

516
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,420
Oh, my.

517
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,800
Oh, my.

518
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh, my.

519
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,580
Oh, my.

520
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,400
Oh, my.

521
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,260
Oh, my.

522
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,380
Oh, my.

523
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,680
Oh.

524
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,140
Oh, my.

525
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,180
Oh, my.

526
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,780
Oh, my.

527
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,240
Oh, my.

528
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,380
Oh, my.

529
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,260
Oh, my.

530
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:39,200
Unfalteringly and without ceasing and without pleasure, the long-hanged one proceeded past the little girl's underpants.

531
00:29:39,200 --> 00:30:02,500
For was it not written in the time of Noninglianiox that he who shall be the one of the batteries shall endeavor ever forth and proceeding vastly superior to that which has never been known? And it was so.

532
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
Now we'll try this pair. Ah.

533
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,120
He's just trying to figure out whether his batteries are working.

534
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,880
I can see clearly into the future and backward dimly into the past.

535
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:30,760
Wherefore, I shall secrete not thine fluids from them, because I love the sound of the word them.

536
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,660
It is neither them nor they, and yet it is them.

537
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,000
Thame.

538
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:57,220
I was suddenly struck in the back with an armor-piercing needle, the kind which has never been known before in this realm or any other realm except for all others except this one.

539
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,020
And I said to them, I said,

540
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,640
Thame, am I not Peshi in front of your mother?

541
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:06,940
Mother?

542
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:08,900
Eh?

543
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:19,860
Thine gray-headed, olden, gelatinous, lithide, Grecian mount-beast.

544
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,120
Thine mater.

545
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,860
The one from whence thy came.

546
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,520
Pfft.

547
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,520
As she achieved Sitor Spasm, a large...

548
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,760
...voluminous material shot rapidly out of her.

549
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,320
...igniting thusly on the friction of the hairs of that self-same region.

550
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,840
Who killed Bambi?

551
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,940
Who killed Bambi?

552
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,300
Who killed Bambi?

553
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,420
Who killed Bambi?

554
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,400
Who killed Bambi?

555
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,460
Who killed Bambi?

556
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,500
Who killed Bambi?

557
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,960
Who killed...Bambi?

558
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,980
Who killed Bambi?

559
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,240
Who killed Bambi? Who killed Bambi?

560
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,960
For your story

561
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,520
Bambi is dead.

562
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,200
There may still be time.

563
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,560
We must believe there is time to change our lives.

564
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,600
We have much to overcome.

565
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,120
Our own superstitious or religious faith in power.

566
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,260
Our suicidal self-hatred, the product of millennia of patriarchal training.

567
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,680
And a need to be more than we are.

568
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,640
Consider.

569
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,380
We must approach the future positively.

570
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,180
Monsters like a dead man will be around me all night.

571
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,220
Until we need to look past the door which should be locked.

572
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,100
And back.

573
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,860
My silences will terrify me and bring me no element of balance.

574
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,360
For my spirit is locked away inside the quiet storm.

575
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,440
Which will make you suffer from suspense.

576
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,220
The Exists have landed.

577
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,720
Their machines are following our tracks.

578
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,900
Bob's vision.

579
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,540
Stands proven.

580
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,820
A world without slack.

581
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,720
Thank you, Bucknaked.

582
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,640
But what is the commodity with which Bob will bargain Earth's fate?

583
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,500
Some claim it is the souls of his followers.

584
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,040
The true subgenius does not question Bob's wisdom in such matters.

585
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,640
We have only our simple faith that Heaven will be ours.

586
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,380
If we only believe.

587
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:11,980
Ironically, his mission will not be to sell Earth, but to prevent Earth being sold and transformed into a kind of stuckies in space.

588
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:21,000
Don't forget that Bob has come to his prophecy at the end of the world, July 5th, 1998.

589
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,480
Okay?

590
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,860
When most Americans will have handovers, but it's not just for the Americans, it's for everyone in the world.

591
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,860
I didn't hear that.

592
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,320
Yeah.

593
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,040
Right.

594
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
That is why...

595
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:30,980
I'm gonna start smoking again.

596
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,900
Oh.

597
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,340
Yeah.

598
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,520
Start smoking, start drinking, and live it up.

599
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,480
Start fornicating as if your very life depended on it.

600
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:44,160
But this plan will succeed only if conditions are just right at the appointed time.

601
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:57,140
Otherwise, dark forces of antiquity will be awakened from their slumber of eons and rise again from Atlantis to rule our world in their sizeless nip.

602
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:08,060
These primordial elementals, the Elder Gods, have countless demonic and interplanetary minions carrying out their unholy schemes.

603
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:16,880
They even control Bob's own evil twin brother, Dick God, the Unclean.

604
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:26,960
Now, friends, I ought to mention that what we're hearing right now is actually the soundtrack from the subgenius video.

605
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:38,980
Which you can go see for free at the, uh, Marriott... at the Fantasy Fair, Dallas Fantasy Fair, this Friday night at 10 o'clock at the Marriott Hotel at Coit and LBJ.

606
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:46,900
Now, try to imagine, try to figure out what images did we put with this soundtrack?

607
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,200
Go ahead.

608
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,980
Could God really be defeated by these beings?

609
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,960
Ah, but you must not underestimate the conspiracy.

610
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,680
Its weapons are so insidious, even the human conspiracy leaders are unaware of them.

611
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:17,540
The fact that the conspiracy itself is ignorant that it is a conspiracy gives it such control over our minds that the very thought becomes unthinkable.

612
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,940
You cannot think about your own minds! That's part of the problem. You cannot think about your own mind.

613
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,960
You cannot wash so if you cannot see your own mind.

614
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:25,960


615
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:25,960


616
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,800
You cannot run from your own legs. You cannot hide from the guy who's stupid as you are. You cannot hide from the guy who's buried you.

617
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,080
He's buried you in all reality!

618
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,500
That was my shit, I got my legs pulled away, you got it? My legs are on fire!

619
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,440
The bovinity and temerity of the human mind itself does all the work.

620
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:50,400
The evil ones may just lean back and watch the little humans march gladly, even proudly, to their doom.

621
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,520
But we, too, must be vigilant.

622
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:02,920
For, thanks to the false slack bombarding us daily, it is terrifyingly easy for even a subgenius to slip back into normality.

623
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,380
Why is it that the Doctors for Bob on one hand attack capitalism and all it stands for,

624
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:14,780
on the other hand you seem to be constantly asking for donations, like for KBF or for the Doctors.

625
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,980
Or KANON.

626
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,380
You're always asking for a million dollars up here.

627
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,780
For KANON.

628
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,420
Well Gary, if we want to destroy the concept...

629
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,880
Who needs it?

630
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,400
If we want to destroy the concept of money, it's gonna take money. And lots of it.

631
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,260
We are in danger of losing the entire ministry. I hate to say it.

632
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,860
I'm not just talking about the radio ministry, I'm not talking about just the TV ministry,

633
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm not talking about just my personal jet, I'm talking about the home for slackless children,

634
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm talking about the research center for the causes and cures of normalcy in Dobstown, Malaysia.

635
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:56,840
I'm not asking for this money for myself. I want people to think about the babies, the children that are starving.

636
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:05,540
You can't grow a fruit tree by planting babies. There's 10 million babies that are dropped into the ground every day.

637
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:14,820
And we're asking the people of Little Rock tonight to come in and pledge donations of one million dollars to Doctors for Bob.

638
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,620
We are five million dollars in debt.

639
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,920
If we could only get five people to call in with pledges of one million dollars...

640
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,300
So it's 823-7490. Or 828-9500.

641
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,020
...be so hardened that he wouldn't want to give a million dollars to Doctors for Bob.

642
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,820
But a man knows, you know, you come up here and ask a million dollars, you know...

643
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,600
Is there any truth to the insidious charges that you actively encourage people to do?

644
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,940
...to hate one another and consider this to be a positive thing?

645
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,800
I mean, someone's considering to give a million dollars to the Doctors or the KABF.

646
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,460
K-A-N-O-N.

647
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,740
You know, surely something to think about. It really is.

648
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,900
Think about it, friends. Send those pledges in.

649
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
Oh, there's another one. Praise Bob!

650
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,380
If you really want a first class seat on those escape crafts that are gonna take off in 1998,

651
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,600
pledge in your million dollars to Doctors for Bob.

652
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,800
Escape crafts, huh?

653
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,400
That's right.

654
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,280
Kind of like the shuttle, right?

655
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,560
That's right.

656
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,900
Yeah, in 1998, when the X's invade, only people who have sent money in to Doctors for Bob...

657
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,620
And K-N-O-N.

658
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,720
...will be able to escape on the X's sausage.

659
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,240
And we don't want the money. We take the money and we put it in big piles and burn it.

660
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,580
But the smoke, the part of your soul which is attached to it, it's not gonna be burned.

661
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,280
The price to the dollar goes up with the smoke.

662
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,040
Your soul will be received by our interplanetary space guardian and lobe.

663
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,540
Ye shall be saved.

664
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,600
Yeah, yeah, praise Bob.

665
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,260
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

666
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,060
And that was Jaynor Hypercletes on Sister Station KABF.

667
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,080
It's a show attack here.

668
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,400
And remember, December 6, Jaynor is coming to town.

669
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,660
That's right, Jaynor Hypercletes in a rare, rare public rap.

670
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,760
The Jaynor Hypercletes Comedy Show and Subgenius Revival at Club Dada.

671
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,760
Club Dada.

672
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,540
On December 6.

673
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:42,400
So, you folks, don't you be missing out on the incredible Dr. Hypercletes, the beat poet of the 80s.

674
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,380
Dear friends, you don't have to know anything about Subgenius to enjoy a show like this.

675
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,540
It's a Jaynor Hypercletes show.

676
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,380
He does, aside from the preaching, he also does...

677
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:51,660
Oh, the...

678
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,280
I...

679
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,120
My son Andy, Andy Kerr.

680
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,100
By the way, my name's Graham Kerr.

681
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,300
And this is Negative Land.

682
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,500
Negative Land, dear friends, from Famous Potatoes.

683
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,940
When my son was just 10, he made his first attempt to follow in my footsteps.

684
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,920
And I think he was jolly successful.

685
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,960
You know what he cooked?

686
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,220
His favorite dish, scrambled eggs.

687
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,060
They were soft and creamy, and I really couldn't have done better myself.

688
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,140
I'd like to share our secret for perfect scrambled eggs.

689
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,980
Just whip four eggs together without liquid.

690
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
And season them.

691
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,040
And then pop them into melted butter.

692
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,380
You know, when the butter is just at the point of browning and smells like hazelnuts,

693
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,800
that's the time to add the eggs.

694
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,220
Add the eggs.

695
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,680
Add the eggs.

696
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,160
Stir them rapidly.

697
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,740
Stir them rapidly.

698
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,080
Stir them rapidly.

699
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,080


700
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,160
And when they look just right, add a quarter cup of cold milk.

701
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,340
And when they look just right, add a quarter cup of cold milk.

702
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,640
This little trick halts the cooking process that so often makes eggs dry.

703
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,300
This little trick halts the cooking process that so often makes eggs dry.

704
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,680
Fresh eggs are one of the world's great delicacies.

705
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,740
Fresh eggs are one of the world's great delicacies.

706
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,840
They deserve to be treated with respect.

707
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,760
Right.

708
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,000
Right.

709
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,560
Right.

710
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,060
That was negative land.

711
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,640
Negative land on Ralph Records' famous potatoes compilation.

712
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,380
Negative land on Ralph Records' famous potatoes compilation.

713
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:35,760
Mwurgh!

714
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,020
Mwurgh!

715
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,880
Mwurgh!

716
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,640
Once again, Dr. Philodrumon.

717
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,880
The Philodrumon German Hour.

718
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:36,660
I love the German stations.

719
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,800
They make you always feel like...

720
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,560
drinking beer.

721
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,220
You know, you listen to them and five minutes later

722
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,860
you're ready to chuck down about a quart of beer, man.

723
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,800
Your favorite beer.

724
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,420
It's a fine, manly thing to do.

725
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,700
To be proud of, so don't fear it.

726
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,340
That's right.

727
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,560
Stifle not thine fears of beer drinking.

728
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,160
Even if it's the non-alcoholic kind.

729
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,640
Now, the sweet strains of...

730
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,080
Erich Weinsteinfanker.

731
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,160
I'm going to translate this while they're singing it, Doug,

732
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,060
just for your benefit.

733
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,980
When I fly on Lufthansa,

734
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,260
I'm inspecting your navel.

735
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,420
Delving deep into the crevices in your...

736
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,800
I find nothing special.

737
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,940
The marbles of your eyes

738
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,920
roll themselves in quivering, quaint clusters of simian glee.

739
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,120
While foisting upon my fellow man,

740
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,480
near Valmaria.

741
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,700
Pain and suffering known not to none before now.

742
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,920
I sound my such dead lady.

743
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,240
I kill with wanton pleasure.

744
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,700
Delving deep into the sexual dimensions of...

745
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,800
I'm glad that...

746
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,680
So deep, my dead sinar.

747
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,860
I kill...

748
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,960
My empty one.

749
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,320
I kill...

750
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:40,320


751
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,900
I kill...

752
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,620
My empty one.

753
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,240
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

754
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,800
Ah, yeah, that's good.

755
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah, that's good.

756
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,040
Yeah, that's...

757
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,840
That's...

758
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,140
That's good.

759
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,180
My...

760
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,360
Yeah.

761
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,100
I'm glad that...

762
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,680
I'm glad that...

763
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,040
I'm glad that...

764
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,380
I'm glad that...

765
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,120
Oh, that was a breather.

766
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,160
And here's our goodbye, because it's time to go.

767
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,660
And so, arrivederci.

768
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,520
Would you mind telling me what there is left in that form?

769
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,460
Nothing.

770
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:08,780
Nothing.

771
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,280
Not a thing.

772
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,540
And goodbye, all of you, too.

773
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,760
Good...

774
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,280
Goodbye.

775
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,600
Goodbye.

776
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,000
Well, it's not time to go yet, but it is.

777
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,920
But...

778
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,040
Hello.

779
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,040
Goodbye.

780
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,840
Elliot's heart almost stopped.

781
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,160
But he had to hang in there.

782
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:37,880
Oh, God.

783
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:38,240
Oh, God.

784
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:38,860
Oh, God.

785
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,860


786
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,860


787
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,860


788
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,860


789
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,860


790
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,860


791
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,360
After all...

792
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,620
Keep the show going.

793
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,080
He had to eat.

794
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,740
We've got to eat.

795
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,580
Keep the show...

796
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:44,900
Oh.

797
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:45,800
Oh.

798
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,600
Oh.

799
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:46,820
Oh.

800
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,380
Oh.

801
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,920
He saw blew his mind.

802
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,760
But he saw blew his mind.

803
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,780
We are here.

804
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,180
Where are you from?

805
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,220
I don't like his feet.

806
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,180
Let me feed you a little twerp.

807
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:19,700
Hey!

808
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,260
You can read along with me in your book.

809
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,160
You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear R2-D2 beep like this.

810
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,660
Get ready to turn over that cassette now.

811
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:37,960
Kids.

812
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,460
Oh.

813
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,460
Praise Bob.

814
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,220
You're listening to the...

815
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:51,600
You're listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry here on K&ON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

816
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,980
And it will happen again.

817
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,080
It will happen again every Sunday night.

818
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,800
You can never, ever escape the show.

819
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,460
Totally.

820
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,820
I'll be right here.

821
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,640
I'll be right here.

822
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:07,640


823
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:07,640


824
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,180
All right.

825
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,200
Okay.

826
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,020
I've got it.

827
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,260
All right.

828
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:19,320


829
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,600
I'll be right here.

830
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,300
All right.

831
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,300


832
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,860
All right.

833
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:24,860


834
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:24,860


835
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,240
Oh, no!

836
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,040
Oh!

837
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,040


838
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,260
Oh, no.

839
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,260


840
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:32,280
Oh, my God.

841
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,700
Ha ha.

842
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:32,700


843
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:32,700


844
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:32,700


845
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:32,700


846
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,360
I have to go to the bathroom.

847
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:34,360


848
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,620
Oh, I don't know.

849
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,620
I've got to get to the bathroom.

850
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:37,620


851
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,100
Dream.

852
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,660
End of the tape.

853
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,240
Beginning in...

854
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,980
Oh, my gosh.

855
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,800
This is Doctors for Wotan here in the background.

856
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,300
The first reunion of Doctors for Wotan in about five years.

857
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,800
That's right.

858
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,560
This was actually after last week's show.

859
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:03,020
Dr. Drummond and I went home and did this horrible, horrible noise that you hear behind me.

860
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:10,220
But I think for the next ten minutes, we're going to begin our new Negative Land album series.

861
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:21,460
The new album from Negative Land, called A New Album from Negative Land on SST Records, has come into our possession.

862
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,160
And it's cool.

863
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:30,240
I've played some of these pieces before, but it's got new ones and they've been remixed.

864
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,880
I'm even on this record.

865
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,740
It's the only record.

866
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,220
The world that my voice is on.

867
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:35,680
Going.

868
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,920
We'll briefly here go to...

869
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,160
What song?

870
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,320
Backstage Pass by Negative Land.

871
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,400

Ellie, like the shit.

885
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,480
Whoops.

886
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,340
Give up.

887
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,120
Friends, did you hear that?

888
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,320
I'm going to have to give up.

889
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,060
Give up.

890
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,020
I'm going to have to give up.

891
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,320
I give up.

892
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,220

It's crossed by nine northern parallels.

945
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,740
Ten fair-sized European states could be placed on its territory.

946
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,560
Besides indigenous residents, that is the Komi people,

947
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,620
there are also Russians, Ukrainians, Nenetses, Chuvashis, and Tartars.

948
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,000
And now let's go back into history a little bit.

949
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:56,060
A boy lying on skins behind our backs was turning the knobs of a small transistor radio.

950
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,960
And the tent was suddenly filled with an announcer's voice speaking Komi.

951
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,320
Then with music from Moscow, followed by English and French speech.

952
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,980
The recording was made at the Moscow Theater of Musical Media.

953
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,580
Now back to modern times.

954
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,900
Your attention please.

955
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,020
At the recommendation of the International Time Bureau,

956
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,520
commencing at 23 hours, 59 minutes, 60 seconds UTC,

957
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,820
an extra second will be inserted into the NBS time scale.

958
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,780
This adjustment is required to maintain internationally coordinated universal time

959
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:46,800

It's ridiculous.

We got so much power now.

976
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,960
Do you know how many time zones there are in the Soviet Union?

977

It's not even funny.

00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:32,900

00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,700

981
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,460
It's not even funny.

It's not even funny.

994
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,400
How many time zones?

995
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:52,860
Yeah.

996
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,080

997
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,740

998
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,120

Ew, look.

1003
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,020
It's the colon of the earth.

1004
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,800
Let's pretend like we have a contest going.

1005
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,460
We'll just call people in the phone book and say, you won.

1006
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,080
A little bit farther up the colon.

1007
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,860
Yes, there it is.

1008
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,860

1009
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,900
It doesn't have to be true.

00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,740
Like hideous.

1011
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,280
It takes a little more time.

00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,820
I can't hear a thing!

1022
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,500
Quiet, please!

1023
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,800
Is there any escape?

1024
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,980
Oh, there's so much noise!

1025
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,940
I can't hear the music!

1026
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,580
Is there any escape?

1027
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,940
What orchestra is this?

1028
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,220
Is there any escape?

1029
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:44,440
Is there any escape?

1030
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,700
Is there any escape?

1031
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,580
Is there any escape?

1032
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,120
The noise?

1033
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,820
Hey, that's, uh...

1034
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,100

1035
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,740
and this is KNON 90.9 FM

1036
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,480
in Dallas, Texas.

1037
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,400
Thank you.

1038
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,320
I hear a lot of noise,

1039
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,340
um, because, uh...

1040
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,800
Well, you know, the big city isn't around here,

1041
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,320
and once we do hear somebody shoot off

1042
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,840
a couple of guns in the distance,

1043
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,420
and...

1044
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,740
uh, somebody grabs some tin cans or something,

1045
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,800
that's about all.

1046
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,040
So it's very quiet here in the neighborhood.

1047
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,940
Wahoo! Look out! Here I come!

1048
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,840

1049
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,540

1051
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,960
