1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,760
What the hell do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,980
Are you ready?

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,820
Repent.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,220
Start.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,780
When was the last time you had your hearing checked?

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,320
I would advise him to learn to lip read.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,720
Insert earplugs now.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,620
Watch out.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,640
Can't give up, dude.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,200
It's not what I'd like to listen to,

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,920
but I don't think I should be able to tell the other people what they can or can't listen to.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,380
Deafness is not only uncool, it's endurable.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,380
I'm sure we're hearing.

Call now and receive a coupon for a free hearing test.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,020
Guaranteed, you won't hear any of this music on Elevator.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,260
It's rock and roll!

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,700
Please cut to 11.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,780
11.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,940
I don't suspect a hearing loss, so I thought nothing could be done about it.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,100
Ask your family doctor.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,980
Feel your ears off.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,640
Explode!

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,000
This concludes this hearing test.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,780
Thank you.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm a real enemy.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,320
Repent.

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Don't you want to be saved?

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,980
Don't you want to be saved?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
Fight the real enemy.

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,900
All the devil needs to have you, mister, but I won't let you.

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,160
Fight the real enemy.

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,980
What I'm asking people to do is accept that everything they face their lives on is a lie.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,020
Oh, God, you mind-seeking salvation.

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,740
There are enemies of children's souls.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,460
Oh, Lord.

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,760
Michonne!

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,400
This world is wickedness!

38
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,420
wieder

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,080
inside yourself by yourself!

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,440
In the name

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,720
of the Jesus, I'm going to go.

42
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,380
No, no, no!

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,560
No, no, no!

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Don't come here.

45
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,500
Don't come here.

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,720
Fight the real enemy.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
Don't you want to be saved?

48
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,440
Don't you want to be saved?

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,460
No, fight the real enemy.

50
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,900
We're all looking in the same direction.

51
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,440
We're not seeing quite the same thing.

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,880
You're looking at me

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,980
and I'm looking at you.

54
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,580
But we're all going insane.

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
Don't go this way.

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,800
Don't go this way.

57
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,060
Don't go this way.

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,320
Help!

59
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,420


60
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,960
Help!

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,280
Help!

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,480
Help!

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,840
Help!

64
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,880
The mind is good if the heart is free!

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,860
Fight the real enemy.

66
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,740
We certainly don't want to preach to people.

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,960
Water your fault, God.

68
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,660
To prevent, biblically,

69
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,480
inspire,

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,820
child abuse.

71
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,460
Fight the real enemy.

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,040
Having a right to life

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,600
does not guarantee

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,840
having the right

75
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,640
to use

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,040
another person's body.

77
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,920
The real enemy's inside all of us.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
It's inside of me and you

79
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,920
We've got to come together

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
to understand what's gonna happen.

81
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,880
Fight the real enemy.

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
You've gotta believe in yourself.

83
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,140
Fight the real enemy!

84
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,080
It's inside of you!

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,260
You gotta fight that enemy inside of you!

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,820
You gotta believe in yourself!

87
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,540
Everyone must believe!

88
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,500
Listen to me Mr. Hensel!

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,880
This is what I'm talking about!

90
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,260
Fight the real enemy!

91
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,320
Repent!

92
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,180
Fight the real enemy!

93
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:26,460
Repent!

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,640
Hallelujah!

95
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,340
Big Bill T.

96
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,640
Fight the real enemy!

97
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,620
Bill T. Miller!

98
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,180
King of Slack. BillTMiller.com

99
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,060
Bill?

100
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,860
Yes.

101
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,460
I am alive.

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,940
I am alive.

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,100
I am alive.

104
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,600
although most of the people

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
appear to confine their

106
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
their prefersions to the main river

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,620
not a few of them prefer

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,980
the American G.I. to the Thames

109
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,460
the LeIIiii

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,840
When I don't have my

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,340
Where my mouth is stuck

112
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,280
stuck in a black hole

113
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,780
I always listen to the hour of slack

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,340
Because it makes me laugh and I like to laugh.

115
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,360
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

116
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,760
Oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh.

117
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,520
Oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh-oyeh.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,140
I don't think this microphone is on.

119
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,620
I guess it's not then.

120
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,600
This, this microphone is not on.

121
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,740
Our microphone is not on.

122
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,440
Now it's on.

123
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:01,520
These were liquid microphones that were originally poured by the first microphone makers back in 1843.

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,180
A German company, wasn't it? Schneubert or something?

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,980
Schneubert. Otto von Schneubert was the first liquid microphone manufacturer.

126
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,580
He was the first man with a plastic eye when they plastic surgished.

127
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,180
Yes, and apparently Bob's grandfather, I can't remember his name, but the story goes,

128
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,180
it's apocryphal now, but as it goes, Bob's grandfather was investigating the liquid microphones.

129
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,320
Well, he basically ingested some of the liquid.

130
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,820
And it causes a genetic change.

131
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,060
That's the theory that we're working with.

132
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,080
Nobody was ever the same. The whole family, the line was just twisted and turned like a bad road.

133
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,800
Too intense.

134
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,740
Some of the people were actually like less than three foot high at their very tallest.

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,140
But it made them so different.

136
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,280
They were left with their hands and making the microphones and pouring them all over.

137
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,660
Made liquid!

138
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,460
I've missed several episodes and I just want to know what Bob is up to now.

139
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,860
Bob's been drinking as usual and you know it.

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,260
Can't you just keep your hands out of your pants and her liquid microphone and leave it up to him?

141
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,040
But what's Bob up to now? We know about what he's done then.

142
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
We know about 1998.

143
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,160
We know about 1998.

144
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,620
But I want an update on Bob's activities recently.

145
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,960
What of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

146
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,720
You know what though, so many people think they want to meet Bob, they want to get with Bob.

147
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,520
They wanna party with Bob.

148
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
I just wanna know what he's doing now.

149
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,940
Sorry you fooled by the shame.

150
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,700
What's he doing now?

151
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,020
Oh, they wanna get inside his head, they wanna know...

152
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,060
Because if what Bob...

153
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,260
They wanna do whatever Bob's doing, right?

154
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,360
They wanna wear his lizard skit!

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,580
They wanna feel it!

156
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,720
Do you wanna wear Bob's...

157
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,140
Do you wanna smoke of Bob's?

158
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,140


159
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,140


160
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,580
Is that what you want?

161
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,960
Or you're just curious.

162
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,080
You just simply want to know.

163
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,820
I just want to be informed.

164
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,960
Because these are changing times

165
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,740
that we're in in the modern world of tomorrow.

166
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,680
Indeed.

167
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,380
And Bob might have answers or even questions

168
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,680
that we haven't thought of.

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,060
You know, the change that I'm most worried about coming

170
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,940
is that change will stop coming.

171
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,060
The coming of the equilibrium.

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm worried that change will end.

173
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
Yes, coming of the equilibrium.

174
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,660
At the ego, beware ye, the equilibrium.

175
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,420
Oh, you don't have to call me ye, just my friends.

176
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,760
And the equivalium.

177
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,240
And you can call me go.

178
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,240
Ye and go.

179
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,240
Go ye.

180
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,260
That means get the hell on out of here.

181
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,480
We don't have ego problems.

182
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,900
Ye are here to go.

183
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,860
No ego problems here.

184
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,160
The brain has been completely smooth.

185
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,080
The convolutions are like a baby's buttocks.

186
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,580
And the liquid microphone, liquid,

187
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,800
really just fills in all the gaps

188
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
in between the imidula and bugata

189
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,420
and the brain.

190
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,180
And all the folds.

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,740
Yes.

192
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,140
And it's not an alcoholic liquid.

193
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,580
This is what many people think.

194
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,420
It's a suspension.

195
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,720
You can substitute other things.

196
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,280
It's a velvety sort of liquid, isn't it?

197
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,740
It's like your brain synapses themselves

198
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,520
have become a thickened syrup,

199
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,900
a cold, instead of a thin turpentine-like fluid

200
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,660
through which the brain electric signals jump.

201
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,900
It is preferred by the gods.

202
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,340
Across the synapse.

203
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Normally there is this fine, fine elixir,

204
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
a thin, hot, fast, fine conductive material.

205
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,140
But then, when one has had enough of Bob,

206
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
the word of Bob,

207
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,540
then at that time that liquid,

208
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,500
through which the suspension

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,300
in which the electric synapse jump is left,

210
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,100
becomes thickened.

211
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,500
It's like a horse race.

212
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,320
Is it electrically synapsed

213
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,680
but it's going faster than the others

214
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,400
trying to out-fuck you?

215
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,860
It's electrically sensitive liquid.

216
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,320
It's like a pudding in your brain.

217
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,540
It's much like the pudding which we eat.

218
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,600
It slows down your mind

219
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,720
so that you may become more like unto Bob.

220
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,340
It's the drink that the Olympians drink

221
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,360
that made him smarter on fast and everything.

222
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,540
It's the drink the Olympians drink

223
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,640
to make mistakes and get big money from every mistake,

224
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,480
much like Bob.

225
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,300
Much like Bob.

226
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,660
It's a way of changing

227
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,000
the inside of your very head

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,640
as well as your pocketbook

229
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,740
and your living room.

230
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,700
Change.

231
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,340
But you know that change could stop coming.

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,140
That's what they want.

233
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,580
They want all change to stop.

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,620
They want your income to be fixed.

235
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,180
They want you to sit at that same job.

236
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,700
But I want to come some more.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,120
You can no longer come anymore.

238
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,700
As long as you've came before,

239
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,120
now is the time for change.

240
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,820
You must stop and then resume for it to be change.

241
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,380
But Bob comes again and again and again.

242
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,600
And his short change.

243
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,180
No, no.

244
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,560
They will stop him from doing that.

245
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,680
And he is the forbearer of a changeling word.

246
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,820
How can they stop him from doing that?

247
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,360
Well, that is, we don't know.

248
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,760
But that is precisely what would happen

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,820
if the changing ever stopped happening.

250
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,420
Is it our job to stop it?

251
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,020
The stopping began.

252
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,860
Or keep the change stopping

253
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,200
or stop the change from keeping.

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,580
They move more quickly as they're heated

255
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,240
and we see the big embeds surround this chamber.

256
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
It's a vacuum chamber

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,140
and the molecules are bouncing hard.

258
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,080
Harder and harder now.

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
We notice the...

260
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,500
Surrounded by a thin, thin, thin

261
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,920
16mm shell.

262
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,300
The absolute image of the brain of Bob is complete.

263
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,500
I see.

264
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,200
Your wish is granted.

265
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,460
And it's true.

266
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
Now you can have changelessness

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,200
and change at the same time.

268
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,720
Slack and slacklessness.

269
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,880
Yes, there's no laughter in heaven

270
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
as Mark Twain said,

271
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,900
but we're laughing.

272
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,000
This isn't heaven.

273
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,600
You idiot!

274
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,380
This must be hell.

275
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,720
Don't put the change at the screen!

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,980
This is not...

277
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,800
Comedy.

278
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm getting a little warm now.

279
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,720
Yeah, I am too, man.

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm confused about what I...

281
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,240
This isn't fun anymore.

282
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,840
What did I do?

283
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,560
Was I alive and I did it?

284
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,480
I know I did...

285
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
I can't remember what I did.

286
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,240
This is a memory camp.

287
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,780
No, this is not...

288
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,900
Hey, there's some liquid microphone

289
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,560
dripping out of your nose, man.

290
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,060
All right, you kids.

291
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,200
Stop mixing the mix of Lydian microphones

292
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,960
and sit down in your cots again.

293
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,960
It's not time for your suspension yet.

294
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,720
You know what's going to happen

295
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,840
if you keep fooling around with Bob's brain.

296
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,940
I'll be back in a very, very short period of time.

297
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,380
Is it colloidal?

298
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,800
Just say no and stay on.

299
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,520
Beware colloids.

300
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,840
Say no, honey.

301
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,840
Your eastern name, say no.

302
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,960
Say no.

303
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,540
No, no.

304
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,400
No, I don't want to say no.

305
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,280
Friends, our guest tonight,

306
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,400
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

307
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,820
Yes.

308
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,940
And hailing this time from the planet...

309
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,840
The land of fruit and flowers.

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,060
Can't you read those notes right, Stang?

311
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,240
The land of fruit and...

312
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,800
Just here.

313
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,780
The land of fruit and flowers

314
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,020
and Hawaiian dancing hula girls.

315
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,080
And also that beautiful...

316
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,280
Heading out towards...

317
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,180
There's that outrugger...

318
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,960
Dugger...

319
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,880
Whatever it is out there.

320
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,440
We're on page seven now.

321
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,700
He's from...

322
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,180
He's from...

323
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,880
Between...

324
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,780
Zero and Google.

325
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,440
He's beyond zero, man.

326
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,180
He's losing it.

327
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,720
Look, finances...

328
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,060
What number are you from, Mr. Bleepo?

329
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,460
I'm from number 23.

330
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,120
The numbers just get incrementally...

331
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,200
That's a very popular mystical number.

332
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,140
I've had a lot of people say...

333
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,800
I was from number 23 long before...

334
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,840
The integral numbers don't change.

335
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,140
They keep moving up and down.

336
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,100
I can't understand either one of them

337
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,780
when they do that.

338
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,100
It's a part of my...

339
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,960
He came from the land of numbers

340
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,560
to conquer the idea of Bob.

341
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,820
Hey, do you guys remember Captain Beefheart?

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,460
Yeah.

343
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,120
Yeah.

344
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,940
Yeah.

345
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,860
enngies.

346
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:29,860


347
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,180
We gotta speed up.

348
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm gonna go to bed already.

349
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,120
I guess we gotta...

350
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,500
The morning was December gray

351
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,300
of the thousandth and tenth day

352
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,860
of the human totem pole.

353
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,120
The man at the bottom was smiling.

354
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,820
It's...

355
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,920
He had just finished his breakfast smiling

356
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,380
It hadn't rained or manured for over two hours

357
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,180
The man at the top was starving

358
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,060
The pole was a horrible looking thing

359
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,140
With all of those eyes and ears

360
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,700
And waving hands for balance

361
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,060
There was no way to get a copter in close

362
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,160
So everybody was starving together

363
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,360
The man at the top had long ago given up

364
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,280
But didn't have nerve enough to climb down

365
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,020
At night the pole would talk to itself

366
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,960
And the chatter wasn't too good

367
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Obviously the pole didn't like itself

368
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
It wanted to walk

369
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,220
It was the summer and it was hot

370
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,040
And balance wouldn't prove it

371
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,960
It would admit a skinning to undergarments

372
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,420
It was an integrated pole

373
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,020
It was taking on a reddish brown cast

374
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
Exercise on the pole was isometric

375
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,580
Kind of a flex and then balance

376
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,260
Then the eyes would roll together

377
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,240
The ears wiggle, hands balance

378
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,700
There was a gurgling and googling herd

379
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,600
A tenth of the way up the pole

380
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,040
Approaching the pole, the pole was moving

381
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,320
The gurgling was a small child

382
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,680
With Statue of Liberty doll

383
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,180
There was no word of what can happen

384
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,940
If the positioniot said

385
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,220
It's redneck screech

386
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,380
Nauru

387
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,120
Headbanging

388
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,120


389
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,380
Go away

390
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,640
To the

391
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,260
Dove

392
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,860
ufen

393
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,680
Tengность

394
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:11,960
Go

395
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,600
To the

396
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,020
Hong Kong

397
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,940
Ab Dot

398
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,460
Here's Bob.

399
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,060
Ow!

400
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,100
Notice Cleveland.

401
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,920
You're all only granted one wish.

402
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,920
So what do you wish for?

403
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,600
You must tell me now.

404
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,120
I really like it.

405
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,500
Dragon, I want my home and my village restored.

406
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,340
No more monsters.

407
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,180
And bring back peace to us.

408
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,180
I see.

409
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,040
Your wish is granted.

410
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,900
The Naughty Bit

411
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,540
Sir, hadn't you better buckle up?

412
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,160
Of course.

413
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,800
Buckle this!

414
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,020
Yeah, buckle this, punk!

415
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,040
Oh, shit.

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,680
Oh.

417
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,660
Oh.

418
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,420
Slap.

419
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,680
We're not so swift for Bush campaign.

420
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,600
And we're going to just make sure that people in your area are going to vote this November.

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,240
For George Bush and Dick Cheney.

422
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,040
Can we activate the chips now?

423
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,240
All their fluids have been taken out and stored in these containers here.

424
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,220
I think the listeners are ready for the chips to be activated now.

425
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,900
Those are the squeakiest chips I've ever heard.

426
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,960
Once they start bouncing a little bit, the timing may not be quite right at this moment.

427
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,220
Were those the chips that were squeaking?

428
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,660
Self-sacred.

429
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,160
No, those are the same ones we're just wearing.

430
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,160


431
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,800
They're vibrating to see if they're matriculating at the right rate.

432
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,420
Some of them go faster.

433
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,180
Squeaky was involved in that matriculation, I believe.

434
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,760
Squeaky?

435
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,420
Originally, yeah.

436
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:21,980
Oh, of course.

437
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,020
Captain Bee Fart was into that.

438
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,440
Was one of the Mansonites?

439
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,160
He was a blind man, wasn't he?

440
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,260
No, he has a van, fly, fly, fly man.

441
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,900
But he could see where others could not.

442
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,300
He was horoscopically blind, however, though.

443
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,160
He had another eye, a third eye, that he was sitting on most of the time.

444
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,540
Hey.

445
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,300
His pineal gland.

446
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,480
In the back.

447
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,260
A vestigial third eye.

448
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,460
His pineal gland.

449
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,440
Captain Bee Fart's pineal gland was unusually located at his coccyx.

450
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,620
Coccyx, coccyx, coccyx.

451
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,920
And to in order to fix.

452
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,200
Coccyx, coccyx, coccyx.

453
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,960
But he could see in a way that no other eye could see and he could bring it out in a way

454
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,320
that no ear had ever heard, such as that song we played earlier, the thousand and tenth

455
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,000
day of the human totem pole.

456
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,400
Hmm.

457
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:10,720
Poof.

458
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Such an inspiring song.

459
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:19,540
I wrote a short story about that recently called The Man Who Could Neither Crap Nor

460
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,460
Get Off of the Pot.

461
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,060
And you know this man as Steve Davilaqua.

462
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,460
He is still there.

463
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,580
That man is still.

464
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,720
Trying vain gain.

465
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,360
Straining.

466
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,760
Vain gain.

467
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,040
And straining.

468
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,320
But nothing will come.

469
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,720
And when he gives up and it's just as he is about to leave the chem can at the great relief

470
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,480
of all the long thousand blind people.

471
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,900
Outside.

472
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,000
Suddenly he knows he's ready to go again.

473
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,040
And he slams the door shut and locks it and they all grumble and he sweats and strains

474
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480
but it does not come.

475
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,160
Ping pong.

476
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,840
For half an hour and he knows he can hear him out there making fun of him.

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,940
Sounds like someone dropped a damn penny in the commode.

478
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,780
Making horrible comments and hating him.

479
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,120
They come up behind the tidy, the chem can and urinate against the back of it and he

480
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,520
can hear the drumming of that.

481
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,440
He can feel it on his hands, man.

482
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,120
That urine that's frustrated.

483
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,140
And he wants to get off.

484
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,200
He wants to leave.

485
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,460
He wants to leave.

486
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


487
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


488
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


489
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


490
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


491
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


492
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,460


493
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,780
He wants to finish.

494
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,840
He wants to go.

495
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,260
But keep urinating on his hands.

496
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,680
He knows they're all waiting.

497
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,300
He is making a noble effort.

498
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:26,200
But the more he tries the less, the more reluctant his little brown children are to leave the

499
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,920
nest so to speak.

500
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,240
Yes.

501
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,160
They're like that when they're that age though.

502
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,140
And then how can you blame them?

503
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,640
They don't want to get the hell out of there.

504
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,840
You know when you look down inside the bottom of that chem can.

505
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh we try not to lick down there.

506
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Dang I know there are different.

507
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,440
His children.

508
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,540
His children.

509
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,580
The children of those who came before.

510
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:49,320
Some of them like black dairy queen curly Q laid in a huge pile.

511
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,180
Horrible with Coke cans that you know are going to wreck that honey wagons hose when

512
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,300
you come to clean it out.

513
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,320
Friends are you like the man stuck in that chem can?

514
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,460
Are you like the honey dipper coming around to clean up the mess?

515
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,800
With a line of a thousand complaining burners.

516
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,680
Trying and trying.

517
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,640
Complaining outside.

518
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,520
Strangely.

519
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,240
And then you try to make.

520
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,040
The more you try to make.

521
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
White knuckle grinding.

522
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,660
The less results you have to show for it.

523
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,580
My desire.

524
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,900
That's where Bob comes in friend.

525
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,320
That's where Bob comes in.

526
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,040
Bob can help the pea shot.

527
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,480
He can put his long smooth hand on the top of your tiny little skull and rub it until

528
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,660
you're fine again.

529
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,860
Bob has sat on the toilet of the man with spastic bowel.

530
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,280
Irritable bowel.

531
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,260
Spastic colon.

532
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,500
Bob has sat on the toilet of the man with spastic bowel.

533
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:38,500


534
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:38,500


535
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:38,500


536
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,680
Bob has been in the pants of that man.

537
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Bob knows.

538
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,220
He knows your pain.

539
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,340
He's worn his diaper.

540
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,660
He knows your pants.

541
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,740
He can't feel your pain.

542
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,280
Yeah.

543
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,660
But he knows it.

544
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,400
And he knows that you'll pay anything.

545
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,160
He feels your pants.

546
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,760
To get rid of it.

547
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,540
From the inside.

548
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,020
He is.

549
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,060
It's like he is your pants.

550
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,540
Is that what that is?

551
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,860
He's your depends.

552
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,080
That's what Bob is friend.

553
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,940
He is that.

554
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,980
That diaper.

555
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,960
That's what.

556
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,040
That catches.

557
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,120
That depels.

558
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,640
That depels on Bob.

559
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,120
You're laced.

560
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,160
To stop my.

561
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,420
It's all coming together for me now.

562
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,860
From becoming enormous.

563
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,480
It's all coming together for me now.

564
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,020
It's not a waste after all.

565
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,280
From making the moisture.

566
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,000
Moisture come on down on like the rain that's falling on my thing there.

567
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,840
Bob loves you my friend.

568
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,180
If he could he'd help wipe you up.

569
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,440
He'll help you up.

570
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,380
He would lock you up?

571
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
He will wipe you up.

572
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,840
He'll help you.

573
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,340
He'll take clean you.

574
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,720
Bob will.

575
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,080
Bob will cleanse you.

576
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,600
He's the moisture.

577
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,700
He's like the little handy wipe.

578
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
He is the handy wipe.

579
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,380
He's not only your pants outside but he's the handy wipe.

580
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,200
Bob is like.

581
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,220
You know everything else.

582
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,500
The other religions are just the rough toilet paper.

583
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,380
Bob is like that medicated diapy wipe.

584
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,580
That.

585
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,760
That reminds you of babies and children.

586
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,600
A medicated diapy wipe for adults.

587
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
That's Bob.

588
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,320
Tom.

589
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,060
Now don't get.

590
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,260
Ginger is crying again.

591
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I'm about to slap her upside the head.

592
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,560
What can I do?

593
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,540
Well perhaps these might help.

594
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,000
What the hell are those things?

595
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,320
I can't even pick them up.

596
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
They're glowing.

597
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,420
Bob.

598
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,620
Bob.

599
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,900
Tom.

600
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,620
Tom.

601
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,960
The dispenser doesn't work unless you give your money to Bob.

602
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,740
I'm sorry but if you pledge five dollars you'll see right now that will open up and you'll

603
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,900
be able to use the moist wipes.

604
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,880
That's right.

605
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,140
But only if you commit.

606
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,440
If you make that commitment of faith.

607
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,480
That's right.

608
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
Colloquial eyeballs.

609
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,520
And the more you commit yourself to faith.

610
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,880
This is a magic dispenser.

611
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,460
It is magic.

612
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,140
That can be yours.

613
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,400
As well as a magic dispenser.

614
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,120
As well as many other things.

615
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,240
Real and imaginary.

616
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:39,900
Wow.

617
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,560
I prefer the imaginary things but hey they're free to do with what they want with it.

618
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,920
And if you order now you get this beautiful operation on the computer of nine by twelve

619
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,580
rugs so call today.

620
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,280
What does this man have to say?

621
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,400
You're wearing a mask.

622
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,240
I'll explain the mask later Mr. Jackson.

623
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,000
For those who believe in Bob no explanation is necessary.

624
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,480
For those who do not believe in Bob no explanation is possible.

625
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,260
Hail Bob.

626
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,380
It's so true Bob.

627
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


628
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


629
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


630
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


631
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


632
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


633
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


634
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


635
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


636
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,380


637
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,600
Well done Bob.

638
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,600


639
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,100
Howdy.

640
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,720
I'm Edelmeister and I'm a pagan.

641
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,540
The capital P.

642
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,540
Now with a small casket.

643
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,360
Enjoy your little nap.

644
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm off to the warm embrace of my afternoon enema.

645
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,440
Now listen C I see you hanging around this schoolyard for far too long and you and that

646
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,900
dame over there C now listen up here.

647
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,540
Come on over here.

648
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,220
I want to talk to you.

649
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,380
Talking to me?

650
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:31,940
Yeah I'm talking to you.

651
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,340
Hey are you talking to me?

652
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,120
Yeah listen here.

653
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,420
Try and square up with me.

654
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:34,560
Talking to me?

655
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,800
You're going to have to do some talking first see.

656
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,360
Now listen look now what have you been doing over here?

657
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,360


658
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,360


659
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,360


660
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,560
I don't like the cut of your fedora.

661
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,680
I don't like the cut of yours neither, but that ain't the point.

662
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,880
The point is, what are you doing here?

663
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,720
Well, listen, pal, this suit suits belongs to someone else.

664
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,880
Yeah, it looks pretty sharp.

665
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:45,980
That's someone else's bob.

666
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,100
And I don't know what Titler and Hojo would have to say about that.

667
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,660
What are you doing out of uniform, Squeaky?

668
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,720
Here comes Titler and Hojo right now.

669
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,180
And the evil foul musselina.

670
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,940
Oh, my God, just monstrous.

671
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,680
Titler is huge, bouncing and writhing.

672
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,920
And Hojo is as much as 5,000 feet tall.

673
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,620
Genetically mutated 5,000 times.

674
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,940
Look at the mammaries.

675
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,360
They're enough to kill whole continents.

676
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,420
And this is how they had planned to smother Europe?

677
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,720
With a motherly bosom of Titler and the strange drinks of Hojo?

678
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,600
Oh, my God, and this is our alternative to Bush?

679
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,120
Oh, my God.

680
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Now, listen, I ain't going to die.

681
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,360
I'm going to go and fight.

682
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,340
I don't know about you guys.

683
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,960
I don't know about you and your small shirt, your big zoot pants,

684
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,620
but I'm going over there and fight Titler and Hojo.

685
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,020
Yeah?

686
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,520
Yeah.

687
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,980
I'm going to go there, too, because we're both on the same side, pal.

688
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,320
Yeah.

689
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,900
We're on the side of the...

690
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,280
Bob, you understand?

691
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,820
All right, well, put it there, then, someplace.

692
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,760
Yeah, we're...

693
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,240
Help me, you boys!

694
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,380
For crying out loud, get it out of...

695
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,920
Hey, yeah.

696
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,380
Yeah, Bob!

697
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:40,980
It's a problem.

698
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,600
Bob depends.

699
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,860
Get your thing out of there.

700
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,120
Yeah, don't think about your depends.

701
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,240
Think about this dame in trouble.

702
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,620
Yeah, we depend on this dame in trouble.

703
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,320
Yeah, the dame.

704
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,380
Yeah, the dame.

705
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
Without the dames, then we're nothing, pal.

706
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,740
Yeah, that's right.

707
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,840
And if Titler and Hojo get a hold of them dames,

708
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,100
see, there ain't going to be no dames left.

709
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,440
And there'll be, like, those cows over there.

710
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,220
They won't have any more milk to give.

711
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,040
The population will die out.

712
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,260
You need dames for the whole population,

713
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,260
because, well, you know, they're all part of it.

714
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,780
They're half the...

715
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,680
They're all part of it.

716
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:01,900
Half the world.

717
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,960
They held up half the sky, as Yoko Ono said.

718
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,420
Oh, they hide it right out in the open.

719
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,100
Sounds like there's Stalin in Russia right now

720
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,220
on the eastern and western...

721
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,580
Yeah, but...

722
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,320
Yeah, I'm sure.

723
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,100
Just because Yoko comes from over there

724
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,080
doesn't mean she's wrong.

725
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Doesn't mean she's right, either.

726
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,080
Check her out.

727
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,360
Yeah.

728
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,680
Let's see.

729
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,300
Let's look in here.

730
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
Joe McCarb, Trouble.

731
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,160
Trouble for the Information Committee.

732
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:19,840
Trouble?

733
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,420
It's been a capital T.

734
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
The House of American Activity.

735
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,380
That rhymes with T.

736
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,540
It says Yoko Ransom T.

737
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,320
That's the name...

738
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,840
That's the end of this station

739
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,080
that we start out this show from.

740
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,480
Oh, jeez, I'm looking for Yoko Ransom T.

741
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:27,820
That's how it ends.

742
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,000
WCSB.

743
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,580
Understand?

744
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:29,980
B.

745
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,560
B is for bleepo, too.

746
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,940
Don't make any mistake.

747
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,360
And they're the monkeys that are here right now,

748
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,540
right here, before you.

749
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,740
And after them.

750
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,480
Without the other barrel.

751
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,240
And the other monkeys you're talking about.

752
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,820
Well, whose turn in the barrel is it, anyway?

753
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,440
It's not my turn.

754
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,600
I've still got the red pen on,

755
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,620
and I'm gonna wear it proudly.

756
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
Listen here, I'm a worker.

757
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:47,880
See?

758
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,840
My dad was a worker,

759
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,640
and my mom was a worker.

760
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,440
This carnival is working well before I get there.

761
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,180
As long as we can think.

762
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,980
As long as we got our brains, we can think.

763
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
Oh, they'll get that too short, you'll see.

764
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,980
But, but, but, but, but, but.

765
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,300
It's a B.

766
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,820
Mamma mia, that's a spicy meatball.

767
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,800
You never knew me.

768
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,480
There always was something big about her.

769
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,560
It'll be great.

770
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,020
Be one of the few.

771
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,380
Proud.

772
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,960
But, but, but, but, but.

773
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,340
B.

774
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,560
B.

775
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,560
B.

776
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:18,700
B.

777
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:18,980
B.

778
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:19,820
B.

779
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:19,960
B.

780
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,200
B.

781
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,900
B.

782
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:21,800


783
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,260
B.

784
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


785
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


786
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


787
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


788
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


789
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


790
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


791
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


792
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


793
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


794
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


795
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


796
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


797
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


798
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


799
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


800
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


801
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


802
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


803
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


804
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


805
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


806
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


807
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


808
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


809
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


810
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


811
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


812
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


813
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


814
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


815
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


816
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


817
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


818
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


819
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


820
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


821
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


822
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


823
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,260


824
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,540
Over men prefer beheading another B word.

825
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,240
You know, the heading.

826
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,340
are conspiracy. I think not.

827
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,780
I think if...

828
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,340
Nah, forget that game.

829
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,140
Hey, have you guys been to the circus lately?

830
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,680
I've got this great circus song.

831
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,860
No.

832
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,020
I love the circus.

833
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,960
Have you ever seen the flying guy?

834
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,480
By this...

835
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
Okay, this band boiled in...

836
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,280
Gargantians, the carcass canis...

837
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,460
This here, this here band boiled in lead.

838
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
That's the name of the band.

839
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,080
Can you believe a band would have a name like this?

840
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,280
I think I just saw what you do for fun, man.

841
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,120
It's a real thing.

842
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,180
We saw these guys called Thelonious Bach at Starwood, and they also...

843
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,320
I think I just saw what you do for fun, man.

844
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,320


845
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,320


846
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,320


847
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,580
They also have played under this name of boiled lead and...

848
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,840
I hate rings, they're jumping monkeys

849
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
When a fat lady sings

850
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,720
It just ain't funky

851
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,600
Nothing is real, nothing is sense

852
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,680
Life is a drag underneath the tent

853
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,860
Fuck the circus!

854
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,720
I said God is the ringmaster, Satan is her clown

855
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,920
Everything is getting better

856
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:25,480
Nothing is real, nothing is sense

857
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,240
Life is a drag underneath the tent

858
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,300
Fuck the circus!

859
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,720
Fuck the circus!

860
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,080
Fuck the circus!

861
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,040
The silly train's bill

862
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,000
The clown's in the room

863
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,900
And the poor wife's free

864
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,800
The trick's for me

865
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,840
Let's talk, let's service, let's talk

866
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,420
Let's talk, man is it?

867
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,220
The big shot's a fraud

868
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,620
Fuck the circus!

869
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,820
Why?

870
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,440
Trust me and believe me

871
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,220
Set aside

872
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,900
I'm going

873
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,260
Today

874
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm going

875
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


876
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


877
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


878
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


879
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


880
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


881
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


882
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


883
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


884
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


885
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,300


886
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,060
Occupation, please.

887
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,800
A libertine and a seducer.

888
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,280
Sex fiend.

889
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,800
Oh, yes.

890
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,860
Pure and simple.

891
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,760
A libertine and a seducer.

892
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,620
State your address, please.

893
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,360
Paradise.

894
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,240
Paradise?

895
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,480
Paradise.

896
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,140
I can well understand that.

897
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,700
The first night's the toughest.

898
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,320
No doubt about it.

899
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,100
They march you in naked as the day you were born.

900
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,460
Skin burning and half blind from that delousing shit they throw on you.

901
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,120
And when they put you in that cell,

902
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,640
and those bars slam home,

903
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,340
that's when you know it's for real.

904
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,020
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

905
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,560
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.

906
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,500
Questionable.

907
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,520
Ejaculation.

908
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,100
Unemotionally.

909
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,640
Ejaculation.

910
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,480
That's kind of funny, too.

911
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Oh.

912
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,920
I'm a brain dysfunction.

913
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,520
Yeah.

914
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,540
Bizarre.

915
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,140
I'm that kind of a guy.

916
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,180
Minimal.

917
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,640
Minimal dysfunction of the brain.

918
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,120
Speaking of crapping or getting off the pot,

919
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,840
King Jehoram, the grandson of Asa, does not meet with God's approval.

920
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,400
God strikes him with an intestinal disease that takes two years to kill him,

921
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,620
causing his bowels to slide out of his body little by little.

922
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,540
He died in great agony.

923
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,300
The Bible notes,

924
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,840
with no one's regret.

925
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,360
2 Chronicles 21, 18, 20.

926
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,920
Would you prefer this world, my friend,

927
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,700
or would you prefer the world of Bob,

928
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,680
where your intestines are slid neatly as a coconut cream pie

929
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,300
back into your intestinal cavity,

930
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,600
reformed in the way that you desire,

931
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,220
with your most ultimate, ultimate point of view,

932
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,380
punta de vista, as you used to say,

933
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,920
and your own articulate garden hanging off the front of your abdomen?

934
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,140
Which is it, friend?

935
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,260
If you want to, you can have your intestines put

936
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,380
into the shape of the Aztec, what is that?

937
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,600
Teotihuacan.

938
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,600
Yeah, the calendar.

939
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,920
You're not supposed to say that on the radio.

940
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,300
It ends in 2012.

941
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,140
Yeah.

942
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,600
Yes, the Mayan calendar.

943
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,480
The Mayan calendar.

944
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,980
You can have your intestines actually put in the shape

945
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,160
and the exact design of that Mayan calendar.

946
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,040
There's enough intestinal fortitude, as it were,

947
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,280
to do that because of the length of the intestines.

948
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,360
And Bob's pipe can actually guide these intestines into the shape,

949
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,460
which is most advantageous.

950
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,540
It can actually guide the intestines through your skin

951
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,740
without actually operating.

952
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,320
These are called operations without operations.

953
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,100
These are performed with Bob's healing pipe

954
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,780
and his healing surgical-handed glove.

955
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,620
So that's just one of the things that Bob has been up to lately.

956
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,460
Bob has been up to a lot.

957
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,080
Yes, yes.

958
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,500
Oh.

959
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,160
Yes.

960
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,860
What on your end of the spectrum is your analysis of Bob's activities?

961
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,760
Well, Bob has been involved in, uh,

962
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,920
investments.

963
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,360
Investments?

964
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,020
What kind of investments?

965
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,140
Long-term investments.

966
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,020
The finest.

967
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,980
The finest long-term investments.

968
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,640
Of course, he can only have the finest.

969
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,200
Of course.

970
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,640
And it's, uh, I'm sorry.

971
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,200
Bob, in my opinion,

972
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,640
Yes?

973
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,560
I humble

974
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,520
Humble indeed.

975
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,480
I will be to learn opinions.

976
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,520
And do we not all have opinions?

977
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,500
Yes, they are like the anus.

978
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,400
Everyone has one.

979
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
Everyone has one.

980
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Oh, I see.

981
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,200
I couldn't live without one.

982
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,160
Oh, given keeping that in mind,

983
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,180
Ah, Lord, I'd love to try, though.

984
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,940
That having been said,

985
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,460
Yes, that having been said,

986
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,200
In my opinion,

987
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,520
I'll strictly, uh,

988
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,660
Prove my, uh,

989
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,160
In my opinion,

990
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,260
Yes, yes, of course.

991
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,920
Bob himself,

992
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,720
Who's Bob?

993
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,740
Oh, yes, Bob.

994
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,500
The Bob in question.

995
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,040
As opposed to, say, Corny, or the sex

996
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,320
Female, yes.

997
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,060
The sex Corny,

998
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,520
Not in this club, dammit.

999
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,320
Not for long, long, never.

1000
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,780
As opposed to Yeti A, or Yeti B,

1001
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,820
No, not them yetis in this club, that's what I say.

1002
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,260
Or Pink Boy A,

1003
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,680
No, no, damn Pink Boy, never, never, never, never.

1004
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,000
Or Pink Boy B.

1005
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,720
And turn them upside down the royal knife.

1006
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,040
Right.

1007
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,760
In my view, Bob should just throw in the towel and give up,

1008
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,280
Because they're not going to get,

1009
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,380
Bob, stop, I tell you, man, you can't.

1010
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,680
They're not going to get, uh, slack.

1011
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,760
Teach slaves to be subject to their masters and everything,

1012
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,320
To try to please them not to talk back to them,

1013
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,960
So that in every way,

1014
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,900
They will make the teaching about Bob, our savior, attractive.

1015
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,660
Our savior.

1016
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,460
He was also worker's savior.

1017
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,280
Many people do not understand,

1018
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,440
Bob was not savior in strict way of a Euro-Christian,

1019
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,240
He was actually savior of working man.

1020
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,520
We only work four days a week when Bob take home.

1021
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,980
Yeah, yeah, I know, that is, that is fake.

1022
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,540
Bob,

1023
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,900
Bob was not only gave education to everybody,

1024
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,780
He also redistributes the land to,

1025
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,980
Especially on the space vessels,

1026
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,260
Everyone had their own little chunk of pie.

1027
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,660
Yes, yes, I know, I do not.

1028
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,240
It looked more like a dead potato,

1029
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,920
But was a good chunk of pie.

1030
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,620
We working for Bob, he gives you cigarette break.

1031
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,380
Yeah, Bob, that's what she did for a while.

1032
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,980
She would sit back and just,

1033
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,420
How long we been loading this dog?

1034
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,540
To everything without complaining,

1035
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,720
Or arguing,

1036
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,340
In order that I may boast on the day of Bob,

1037
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,640
That I did not run or labor for nothing.

1038
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,020
Did I run or labor for nothing?

1039
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,480
I do not think so.

1040
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,920
Well, you ran away when you went into labor,

1041
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,000
Just like your great-grandmother, Jinka, did.

1042
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,620
And that's why we had to pull your pants down,

1043
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,240
And put your socks and your bowels back,

1044
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,360
The way Bob wanted them,

1045
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,800
And the way you planned it,

1046
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,840
When you said you would take that X-vessel.

1047
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,180
If Bob had not been there,

1048
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,380
Our preaching is useless,

1049
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,900
And so is our faith.

1050
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,400
You signed the application.

1051
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,580
A mental case.

1052
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,680
Without Bob, it's useless, really.

1053
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,580
It's just...

1054
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,300
Pointless.

1055
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,200
Not much point, no.

1056
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,960
Slacklessness, as far as...

1057
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,460
I've got this boat, this damn boat,

1058
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,040
And the star ideas,

1059
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,360
And the stars to cruise, or whatever,

1060
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,420
Navigate out, you know.

1061
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,560
Oh, the centuries!

1062
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,520
The millennia of evolution,

1063
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,940
Crawling up,

1064
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,560
Natural selection,

1065
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
Killing off thousands,

1066
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,500
For every one that managed to get

1067
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,100
A tiny bit of slack.

1068
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,080
And what has it all brought us to?

1069
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,220
Where do we find ourselves today?

1070
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,920
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

1071
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,280
Everybody says,

1072
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,380
We've come such a long, long way,

1073
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,160
We're civilized,

1074
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,520
Isn't that nice?

1075
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,760
We've gotten so smart,

1076
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,920
We know how to build a whole world upon,

1077
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,560
When it comes to the simple things,

1078
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,620
Like living together,

1079
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,420
Ha!

1080
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,580
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1081
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,540
Is anything easier to understand?

1082
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,540
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1083
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,180
Our life is better than we ever planned,

1084
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,280
Ha!

1085
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:22,780


1086
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,140
We're civilized,

1087
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,500
We know better,

1088
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,700
Is anything more to say to God?

1089
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,760
Stop wasting all my time,

1090
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,900
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1091
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,500
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1092
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,960
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1093
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,820
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1094
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,040
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1095
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,320
We couldn't quit while we were ahead

1096
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,160
Why'd it have to end up like this?

1097
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,380
We should've just stayed at the stand

1098
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,240
The road was long and the journey was hard

1099
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,200
That we're even dreaming that we've come so far

1100
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,360
We swing on my dime

1101
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,480
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1102
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:32,620
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1103
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,900
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1104
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:23,980
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1105
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,940
Did it have to end up like this?

1106
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,520
Did it have to end up like this?

1107
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,560
Did it have to end up like this?

1108
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,600
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1109
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,100
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1110
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,600
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1111
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,120
Why'd we have to come all this way?

1112
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,120


1113
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,540
But, but, but, but, but, but

1114
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,920
Listen up, you have the right to remain silent.

1115
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,860
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

1116
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,140
You have the right at this time to talk to a Bob.

1117
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,220
Why did you let a turtle man in say I want to fight?

1118
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,820
You said you wanted to meet him.

1119
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,320
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I want to fight him.

1120
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,400
Hey, that's enough. Don't argue.

1121
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,920
I suggest we split right down the middle if that's alright with you.

1122
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,240
Not me.

1123
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,780
If you want to.

1124
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,060
Phew.

1125
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,260
It's gone!

1126
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:38,980
God, no!

1127
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,080
Oh, yes.

1128
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,020
Oingo Boingo did that song, Why'd We Have to Come All This Way.

1129
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:04,780
The collages in the whole show are mostly by the great Mr. Fernando Nande Lemur.

1130
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,600
And if you want to know more about that band Boiled in Lead, the circus song,

1131
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,480
check out www.omnium.com.

1132
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,060
O-M-N-I-U-M dot com.

1133
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,500
The music in the live Hour of Slack segment recorded at WCSB in Cleveland,

1134
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,820
which is coming up, is by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1135
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:39,840
Pastor, could you touch upon a little bit, what's it mean to twist my own mind?

1136
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,600
I can become to be a family man. I need to know that Jesus can do these things.

1137
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,420
And the results are thicker, greener lawns.

1138
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,300
Huh?

1139
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,680
Digital copy of a digital copy of a digital copy.

1140
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,220
Thicker, greener hair.

1141
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,320
Does that hurt?

1142
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,080
Do.

1143
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,180
More beautiful, illiquid sinuses that resemble this liquid microphone here.

1144
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,960
Liquid microphone.

1145
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,260
A new thought.

1146
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,800
A new idea.

1147
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,580
A new age is coming with liquid microphones.

1148
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,540
It reads your senses.

1149
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,760
It feels your moods.

1150
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,880
It absorbs everything at once.

1151
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,140
You don't have to talk for liquid microphone to convey your message.

1152
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,160
It amplifies your thoughts in five different ways.

1153
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,260
Number one.

1154
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,800
This.

1155
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,380
Number two.

1156
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,600
That.

1157
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,240
And number three.

1158
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,840
Baaaaa.

1159
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,380
The other numbers are identical.

1160
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:38,800
But.

1161
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,600
The cynical monogram on your forehead.

1162
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,880
I see what you're trying to do.

1163
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,640
You're trying to turn people's heads inside.

1164
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,060
Inside out.

1165
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,740
Turning the head inside out.

1166
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,680
Been there, done that.

1167
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,620
Well, it can be easily slipped inside out.

1168
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:57,280
But look, there's a head laying right in front of us that needs to be opened and examined.

1169
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,160
And no one wants to look inside.

1170
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,980
Well, it needs to open and examine itself, you know, and that's the problem.

1171
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,180
So few can do it.

1172
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,260
Hardly anybody wants to.

1173
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,700
After you've done it, you never ever want to do it again.

1174
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,960
But it's like a parachute.

1175
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,940
If it's not open, it won't work.

1176
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,600
Despite what you may have learned in Sunday school, David did not kill Goliath with a stone.

1177
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,140
The messy truth is that David only knocked Goliath unconscious and stoned him.

1178
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:33,200
No, he killed him with Goliath's own sword and then hacked off his head and stoned him.

1179
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,460
And turned it inside out.

1180
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,700
Hey, man.

1181
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,600
They didn't just cut that head off.

1182
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,940
They didn't, man.

1183
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,940
They did not just cut off his head, dude.

1184
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,420
That's like a wild man.

1185
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,520
Check that out, man.

1186
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,000
They did not just, like, leave it at cutting the head off and walking away, dude.

1187
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,740
I mean, take a look at that thing.

1188
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,220
They launched it, man.

1189
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
They launched it.

1190
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,220
I'm telling you, man.

1191
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,760
They launched the damn head, dude.

1192
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,720
Dude, where's my head?

1193
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,360
They say it's still going, man.

1194
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,700
Parts of Galilee, you can still see it flying by and stuff.

1195
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,760
And lower Simon eyes and whatever, dude.

1196
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,240
I don't know.

1197
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,000
They have some...

1198
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,040
Who was Simon and why did he eyes?

1199
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,940
Because he was shinier than the rest of the kids.

1200
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,360
You know, you can only have sis done so many times and then you have to eyes.

1201
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,780
Unless you have bladder problems.

1202
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,960
And certainly all of those people do.

1203
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,200
See them down there trying to swim their way out of trouble?

1204
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,960
See them trying to shoot their way out of a paper bag?

1205
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:35,880
Swimming.

1206
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,800
Yeah.

1207
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,520
Swimming in their own suffering.

1208
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,380
Where do they all come from?

1209
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,160
Spike stuck in there.

1210
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,940
Spike stuck in there.

1211
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:48,860
Wallets.

1212
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,500
Stuck in their wallets.

1213
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,920
Pinning their wallets to their behinds, friend.

1214
00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:00,920
As if you got a ten-foot spike piking your wallet into your butt.

1215
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,380
Are you staked to that job that way, my friend?

1216
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,780
Are you handcuffed?

1217
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,520
Are you handcuffed via your wristwatch to that paycheck?

1218
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,520
Are you trying to serve two masters?

1219
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,480
You can't do it.

1220
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,000
Are you trying to juggle a million oranges and make out with that pretty girl at the

1221
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,440
same time?

1222
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,300
You can't do it.

1223
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,360
You can't do it.

1224
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,080
So why don't you just give up?

1225
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:29,980
Give up.

1226
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,700
Give up.

1227
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,380
Forget about it, man.

1228
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,760
Forget about it, man.

1229
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,840
Just get some...

1230
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,460
Multiplier.

1231
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:36,760
Multiplier.

1232
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,580
Multiplier.

1233
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,320
Multiplier.

1234
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,480
You've got to pull back and step away.

1235
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,080
Just withdraw.

1236
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,860
Just disconnect.

1237
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,840
Wait, did I just kind of...

1238
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,180
That's it, man.

1239
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,200
Bob teaches disconnection, man.

1240
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,420
You've just got to break things.

1241
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,540
Hope I liked your looking down jokes.

1242
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,720
You're gonna break your mind, you're gonna crack it.

1243
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,200
You must be like there Bodhisattva.

1244
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,420
You must smash the mind for the mind to flourish.

1245
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,640
You must crack your skull for your brain to heal.

1246
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,860
We're making an omelet, we're breaking eggs.

1247
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,340
Get with the program.

1248
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,260
Well, cute.

1249
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,280


1250
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,380


1251
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,460
And come on!

1252
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,220
We're killing two birds with one stone, man.

1253
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,280
We're wiping out whole communities with one stone.

1254
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,880
We're putting all our eggs in one basket.

1255
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,740
We're making, we are successfully now manufacturing silk purses.

1256
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,340
Perhaps in your own town, we're making them everywhere.

1257
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,720
We're making silk purses out of sow's ears,

1258
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,760
and we're turning pigs into little bunny rabbits with third eyes the size.

1259
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,060
Well, we're doing it, friends.

1260
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:32,960
How big is Reverend Ivan's stand?

1261
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,920
You can get something for nothing, and it's only $30.

1262
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,320
Nothing.

1263
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,980
If you just go to subgenius.com right now.

1264
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,300
Subgenius.com.

1265
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,560
But beware.

1266
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,600
Be very careful.

1267
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,180
Because as you get closer and closer to the circle, to Bob's orbit,

1268
00:48:53,420 --> 00:49:01,940
you are, by scientific nature, pulled ever closer by the four seas of gravitas.

1269
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,240
You are pulled in.

1270
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,360
As if by magic.

1271
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,380
Closer and closer to that looming face.

1272
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,080
The grinning dots.

1273
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,720
The filthy, stinking pipe.

1274
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,880
Have you ever noticed that buildup of crud around that pipe stem near his lips?

1275
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,020
What is that stuff?

1276
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,920
Is that congealed spit?

1277
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,800
Or dog's lip cell?

1278
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,200
Dead skin?

1279
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,500
Grot?

1280
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,500
What is it?

1281
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:34,720
And how does the pipe just hover against his clenched, shut teeth?

1282
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,340
He's not closing it.

1283
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,500
He's not closing his teeth on that pipe.

1284
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,760
The pipe is jutting as if by magic.

1285
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,600
Exactly.

1286
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,780
From closed teeth.

1287
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,360
It's the tar.

1288
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,440
It's the tar.

1289
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,160
We've mined that tar.

1290
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,000
And now you can too.

1291
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,760
Is it a trick?

1292
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,120
No, no, no.

1293
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,120
It's the Supernatural.

1294
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,340
It's a beautiful product.

1295
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,500
We've successfully mined this and made it into really the basic component for all of our products.

1296
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:56,980
Right.

1297
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,500
It is a genuine article of faith of the Church of the Subgenius.

1298
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,840
And it comes in this attractive little bottle right here.

1299
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,300
And how much is that amazing article of faith?

1300
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:05,940
$30.

1301
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,360
$30.

1302
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,360


1303
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,360


1304
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,360


1305
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,360


1306
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,360


1307
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,700
Only $30?

1308
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,260
I can't believe that.

1309
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,500
This is blasphemy.

1310
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,280
This is blasphemy.

1311
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:17,320
Don't you know that is the talent of Bob's lips that keeps the pipe attached?

1312
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,860
It has nothing to do with any kind of artificial product.

1313
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,620
You don't question these things, friends.

1314
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,300
It's supernatural.

1315
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,220
It's magic.

1316
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,320
Actually, it is alien science.

1317
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:35,000
But to you, it will always appear as magic because you are mired in this dense earth plane.

1318
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,100
Stuck.

1319
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,920
In the quicksand of these sad three or four dimensions.

1320
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,020
Milling about on your little leg things.

1321
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,480
And in your little cars.

1322
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:57,900
Oh, you could follow Bob out into such a grander, more open world.

1323
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,400
A new universe.

1324
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,700
All yours.

1325
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,700
Inside.

1326
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,140
And all inside your own little noggin.

1327
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:06,820
Isn't that wonderful?

1328
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,280
Bob has enabled you to bell your own cat that is your head.

1329
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,940
You can hear it coming, friends.

1330
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,740
The bad thoughts won't be able to sneak up on you anymore after what we do to you.

1331
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,200
Oh, man, I can't focus anymore, man.

1332
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,300
He keeps slamming into this.

1333
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,100
My head.

1334
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,980
I had another bad thought.

1335
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,580
You can tell whether you're coming or going.

1336
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,600
Yeah, yeah, man.

1337
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,220
I know whether I'm coming or going.

1338
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,480
I had another bad thought, man.

1339
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,300
You don't know exactly what you think.

1340
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:29,920
Oh, yeah.

1341
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,700
That's right.

1342
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,680
I don't know exactly what I'm thinking when I'm thinking it, man.

1343
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,340
That's why.

1344
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,220
Not so fast.

1345
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,820
You've got to pay.

1346
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,140
To know.

1347
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,700
And you must pay lots and lots of slow money.

1348
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,080
Slow money.

1349
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,180
Slow money is accepted by the Church of the Sub-G.

1350
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:55,700
Just as dark matter comprises most of the universe, so slow money comprises our bank

1351
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,160
account of the Church of the Sub-G.

1352
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,120
Truer words were never spoken, unfortunately.

1353
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,200
Although that could change, actually, if you happen to look at my phone, it's still

1354
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1355
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1356
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1357
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1358
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1359
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1360
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1361
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1362
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,200


1363
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,440
here.

1364
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,140
This is the end of my talk.

1365
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,400
I'll see you in the next one.

1366
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,340
Bye-bye.

1367
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,320
Bye-bye.

1368
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,520
Bye-bye.

1369
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,360
Bye-bye.

1370
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,380
Bye-bye.

1371
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,000
Bye.

1372
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,220
Bye-bye.

1373
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,340
Do not remember the sins of omission which we have omitted from the earliest Drax brothers

1374
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,100
And we see here this perfunctory on the bottom of its glass

1375
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,320
Bob's face as we know it now

1376
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,760
The universe must squirt in order for us to survive

1377
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,140
And that's why we

1378
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,620
To fulfill its very destiny

1379
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,580
It must squirt

1380
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,440
Then my brain let go of it

1381
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,680
And we look at these older pictures of Bob in his early stages of squirting

1382
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,080
His teeth were quite dense in those days

1383
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,060
He had strong forehead muscles

1384
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,320
And he was quite a little squirt

1385
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,140
Oh Bob might as well be the squirt

1386
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,260
The squirt essence

1387
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:13,380
To maintain the equilibrium the squirts must continue

1388
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,200
The squirts must need scum

1389
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,720
Equilibrium must stop now

1390
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,980
There must be a balance of no balance

1391
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,440
It's between the match that there must be

1392
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,300
It's the end of equilibrium

1393
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,540
Things must change

1394
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,460
It's a balance

1395
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,660
It's a balance

1396
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:27,660


1397
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,940
It's a balance of unbalanced forces

1398
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,940
And you're expected to join like the lemming you are

1399
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,200
The exact science of random chaos

1400
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,380
Just how much universal squirt do you think it can take?

1401
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,120
Thirty dollars worth

1402
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,480
More than you think

1403
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:50,140
How much universal squirt do you get for thirty bucks these days, Dr. Sinister?

1404
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,200
Oh wait, Dr. Sinister's not on the air yet

1405
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,920
But he will be on soon in this time continuum

1406
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,280
Perhaps he'll answer the question now

1407
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,420
I forgot what the question was

1408
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:09,780
You can get approximately one metric load of squirt for thirty international galactic credits

1409
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,480
How many?

1410
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,220
How much?

1411
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:16,660
For thirty intergalactic credits, I'm sorry, you can get exactly one metric load of squirt

1412
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,320
Ah, to share the load

1413
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,740
Oh, share the load

1414
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,380
You can use that one metric load

1415
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,400
Master Frodo

1416
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,060
Over and over and over again

1417
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,280
Master Bobo

1418
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,900
And it also causes a foreshortening of the board

1419
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:26,900


1420
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,460
I don't know about as much as the same way in the early prescriptions

1421
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,800
You squirt, you ingest, you squirt, you ingest

1422
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,260
And it allows you to squirt the same squirt

1423
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,680
There's no

1424
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,320
That's the loop, that's the loop, that's the loop

1425
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,460
Look, mine's become oblique

1426
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,800
And I need some sort of random punishment or help or something

1427
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,660
Well, it's the loop of life

1428
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,480
Oh speaking of random cripes

1429
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,000
Share the load, share the load, the load, the load

1430
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,360
Speaking of random punishment, there's a devival

1431
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,640
Devival?

1432
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,340
There's a devival in Detroit

1433
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,040
Detroit

1434
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,900
There's also September 4th

1435
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,200
It's at Alvin's, that's it, Alvin's in Detroit

1436
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,500
There is some kind of a devival

1437
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,100
The amino acids are not necessarily on the bill

1438
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,340
But Reverend Angry Larry will be preaching

1439
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,280
And Reverend Senator Speck will be there

1440
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,420
And I think all of my listeners know what that could really mean

1441
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,540
In fact, I should take off this Joe Secretary on the phone

1442
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,440
We and I will play at the Beachland on the 17th

1443
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:28,920
Oh, that's right

1444
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,200
In front of Ten Huey, probably about three bands in the beginning

1445
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,480
But no, Ten Huey will be at September 17th

1446
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,980
At the Beachland Ballroom

1447
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,400
And?

1448
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,880
And Lonesome Cal-men-dave?

1449
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,240
And Mondo's Retardo Band

1450
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,180
Wow

1451
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,740
With the Wii and Mondo's Retardo Band

1452
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,020
That's like what it is

1453
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,240
Is it Mondo's Retardo Band now?

1454
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,260
It thinks it is

1455
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,500
That's a pretty good one, isn't it?

1456
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,160
That's a pretty good name

1457
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,800
That's a pretty good band name

1458
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,340
And we had, it's it, that should keep you off the radio out of any

1459
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,420
Right, and out of trouble

1460
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,820
Out of any kind of money

1461
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,280
Any stern discipline which we need

1462
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,260
It must be administered

1463
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,440
House Chief Administrator for the hospital here

1464
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,280
I'd like to thank all the LPNs and RPNs and ZPNs that have gathered about in Bob's head here

1465
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,080
And if they'd given us all our support this past coming year

1466
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,480
And also the members of the Steering Committee are still on the, still on the line

1467
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,960
I'm a little scared on the bottom of the ship, and you know

1468
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,000
You know, the only devivals that I'm invited to

1469
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,200
I'm not invited to any of the cool ones

1470
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,200
I'm invited to, there's one in London, in Amsterdam

1471
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,060
Oh cool

1472
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:39,920
And there's one from Annenberg

1473
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,600
In Amsterdam

1474
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,440
And we're gonna have so many cool ones

1475
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:42,760
In November

1476
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,720
Yeah I know

1477
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,420
Paris sucks

1478
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,380
I know, actually it's quite cold in November

1479
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:46,820
Rome sucks

1480
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,800
It's the third annual Fracht Cup is happening in Amsterdam

1481
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,380
And this time it looks like we're gonna be able to go and be helped judge

1482
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:55,460
Because we have a couple of people here

1483
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,080
the new crop of frappy.

1484
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,040
This is not the,

1485
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,140
we're not using code words

1486
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,160
for common street drugs

1487
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,280
like marijuana.

1488
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,720
This is habifrop ziplops

1489
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,320
we're talking about.

1490
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,320
It's a subgenius thing,

1491
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:08,880
totally different.

1492
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,300
But the, you know,

1493
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:10,980
it's kind of a fun

1494
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,460
party time there anyway.

1495
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,500
It's in the pot

1496
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,520
from the crop.

1497
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,480
Where can people

1498
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,000
get information

1499
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,940
on this, Reverend Stang?

1500
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,420
It's a little bit

1501
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,820
of something

1502
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,720
just called Tom.

1503
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,120
Of course,

1504
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,260
the subgenius website.

1505
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:22,700
It's a little bit

1506
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,280
of something

1507
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,360
just called Tom.

1508
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:25,640
It's a little bit

1509
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,500
just called Tom.

1510
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,140
It's here

1511
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,500
in this rough cave

1512
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,200
near the artichoke

1513
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,900
of Norway

1514
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,460
where the fjords

1515
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,320
are so deep

1516
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,480
that the polar bears

1517
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,120
and seals

1518
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,180
actually die

1519
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,620
from lack of nitrogen

1520
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,040
in their hair.

1521
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,080
But here we see

1522
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,300
the chief seal

1523
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,060
marking the doorway

1524
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,380
with several spindles

1525
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,700
of, well,

1526
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,280
these were the spindles

1527
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,080
that were originally used

1528
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:52,580
to spin

1529
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,860
the very first

1530
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,380
doctor band record

1531
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,360
which were made

1532
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,400
on wax tablets.

1533
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,620
It's a strange way

1534
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,220
for a seal

1535
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,980
to mark its territory.

1536
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,320
It was the wax seal,

1537
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:04,940
actually,

1538
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,280
and the wax seals

1539
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,540
that the wax seals used

1540
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,200
were actually made of wax

1541
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,060
and were some

1542
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,840
of the earliest known

1543
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,700
sound recordings

1544
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,600
of the first yeti

1545
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,000
doctor bands.

1546
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,760
Those were the first seals,

1547
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,160
but when the seventh seal

1548
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,120
is opened

1549
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,400
and disemboweled

1550
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,260
on that day,

1551
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,400
we shall know

1552
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,740
that Bob has finally

1553
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,380
left the chem camp.

1554
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,480
And he has finished

1555
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,220
his task

1556
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,720
set before him.

1557
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,300
The trick is

1558
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,420
you need an opener

1559
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,720
to break the seal

1560
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,780
and only Bob

1561
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,780
has the opener.

1562
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,800
Bob can work

1563
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,440
with any kind of

1564
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,180
port-a-potty

1565
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:36,800
that you may have

1566
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,460
laying around.

1567
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,180
You don't need

1568
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,480
the actual old ones,

1569
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,440
the Johnny Reds

1570
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,100
or the Johnny Blues.

1571
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,260
You don't need those for that.

1572
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,700
You know,

1573
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,780
the modern kind of conveyance

1574
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,260
you're going to need

1575
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,040
to get out there

1576
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,700
past the ionosphere,

1577
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,140
is it?

1578
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:47,960
Is it the ionosphere?

1579
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,280
The ectosphere.

1580
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,620
The ectoplasm is there.

1581
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,080
The ectosphere,

1582
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,420
the lactosphere.

1583
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,680
The arachnosphere.

1584
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,480
The morphosphere.

1585
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,420
And the morphosphere.

1586
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,220
There's a lot of spheres.

1587
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,040
Okay, so you've got

1588
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,560
all these different...

1589
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,040
You've got to get through

1590
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,840
all those layers.

1591
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,440
Hey, hey, hey,

1592
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,580
enough of the science.

1593
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,040
Okay, science lesson

1594
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,520
is over.

1595
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,400
The hour of slack

1596
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,440
is coming to its end.

1597
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,220
And the...

1598
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,860
Ah, you morbid

1599
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,720
shite, yeah.

1600
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,740
The sad, sad, sad end.

1601
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,540
Actually, there's...

1602
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,460
I'm sure there's

1603
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,500
some sort of

1604
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,320
good talk

1605
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,520
or good music

1606
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,240
coming up.

1607
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,020
This is the amino acids

1608
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,920
in the background.

1609
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,220
But I got that

1610
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,000
at Otakual.

1611
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,040
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1612
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,040
And we thank

1613
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,120
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

1614
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,100
for flying in

1615
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:34,960
all the way

1616
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,020
from Manhattan.

1617
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,380
It's hard to thank you.

1618
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,900
I don't want to be

1619
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,740
a cynical bird,

1620
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,900
but I am.

1621
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,380
I'm a freaking bird.

1622
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,940
You're a bad boy.

1623
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,160
Maybe you're just too slow.

1624
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,040
No, I'm not slow.

1625
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,720
I hear everything

1626
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,060
you say.

1627
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,460
No, I'm not.

1628
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:51,820
I hear everything

1629
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,700
you say and the other guys say.

1630
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,940
I'm not slow.

1631
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:54,220
And I hear it again

1632
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:54,740
in the radio.

1633
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:55,180
I hear it again in the radio.

1634
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:55,180


1635
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,640
It's the best of all time.

1636
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:56,680
Bob!

1637
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,220
Bob!

1638
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,480
Bob!

1639
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,360
Are you hurt?

1640
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,060
Bob!

1641
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,420
Bob!

1642
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,080
Hi.

1643
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,180
You faker.

1644
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,560
Steve, you know

1645
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,460
what this is, don't you?

1646
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,860
It's a time-space warp.

1647
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,680
I'm not sure

1648
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,200
I know exactly

1649
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,840
what that is.

1650
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,480
I don't suppose

1651
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,540
anybody really does.

1652
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,620
We've seen some

1653
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,720
strange things tonight.

1654
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,860
Strange creatures that we know

1655
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,120
don't belong on our planet.

1656
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,380
God only knows

1657
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,360
where they came from.

1658
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,300
Jenny and Beth.

1659
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,480
The vortex took them.

1660
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:41,800
Just...

1661
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,380
Just took them away.

1662
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:53,940
The...

1663
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,080
The final...

1664
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,400
The...

1665
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,460
The final...

1666
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:01,780
The...

1667
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,280
Do you have a bathroom problem in your house?

1668
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,380
It's a very busy place, isn't it?

1669
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:12,240
Where everyone in the family has to brush their teeth, wash their hands...

1670
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,420
Take a shit...

1671
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,980
Let's get some hot chicks on the phone and talk about Mars or something.

1672
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,200
Why don't you get off the phone because our phone lines are pretty much clogged up on

1673
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:22,860
your dumb ass.

1674
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,340
I'm a worker, a generator, appointed to work.

1675
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:23,520
If you need help, call an ambulance or someone from your neighborhood.

1676
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:23,520


1677
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:23,520


1678
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:23,520


1679
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:23,520


1680
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:23,820
There you go.

1681
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:23,900
There's a pigeon.

1682
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,780
Videotaped the whole thing.

1683
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,440
Well, come on.

1684
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,680
There's got to be some redheads out there.

1685
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,920
Real redheads.

1686
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,700
We interrupt to bring you an important announcement.

1687
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,900
The world will end at 12 o'clock tonight.

1688
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,580
I'll just repeat that.

1689
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,900
The world will end at 12 o'clock.

1690
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,260
This is not a hoax.

1691
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,260
World leaders have been meeting in Washington over the past week

1692
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:12,060
to consider the ever-worsening problems of inflation, overpopulation, racism, pollution.

1693
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,060
You name it, they've considered it.

1694
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,620
They have come to the conclusion there is no point in going on.

1695
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,280
Friends, you're listening to...

1696
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,400
This is the end of...

1697
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,180
Friends, you're listening to...

1698
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,240
This is the end of...

1699
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,040
Friends, you're listening to...

1700
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,080
This is the end of...

1701
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,740
Friends, you're listening to...

1702
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,940
This is the end of...

1703
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,720
Friends, you're listening to...

1704
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,900
This is the end of...

1705
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,560
This is the end of...
