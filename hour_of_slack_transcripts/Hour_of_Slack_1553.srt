1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,300
The Self-Genius Power of Squash

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,980
It's hard to believe they were attacked by an owl.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,640
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,480
My memory could be incorrect.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,580
They had dance runs and tunics and stuff.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,240
I remember that day.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,300
Are we secretly at war with everybody now?

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,180
Pretty much?

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,260
Yep.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,540
Pretty much the entire rest of the planet.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:35,160
Ever since that Marvel Comics series, The Secret Wars, came out.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,660
And everybody in the United States is at war with everybody else in the United States.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,520
If they're not, they keep acting like they can't wait for the Civil War to start.

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,840
That's another thing America's got going for it.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,380
I'm kind of happy about that.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,860
The threat of constant Civil War,

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,320
especially from...

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,980
different media sources

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,000
that are known to be not always accurate.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,040
I heard that Texas is actually going to have

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,460
an item on their ballot next year

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,820
asking citizens if they'd be interested in secession.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,940
Not officially saying we're going to secede,

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,860
but asking the populace,

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,660
would you be interested?

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,020
Just to peel it out?

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,740
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,260
Well, I think that'd be a great idea,

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,160
although the state would go broke almost instantly.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,860
Yeah, that's the...

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,980
I mean, you know,

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,340
half the people here are totally reliant on the government.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
And the military, you know,

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,100
military bases and stuff like that,

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,160
if they pulled out...

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,260
Yeah, you know,

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,680
when the Ukraine broke off from the Soviet Union,

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,560
there were a lot of nukes left behind.

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740
Yeah, no, that's true.

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,080
There's probably a few good nukes,

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:57,160
and plus we've got the companies that manufacture the nukes and the jets and so forth.

42
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,540
There's quite a few of those here.

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,860
You know, I like to make fun of...

44
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,040
I like to make fun of Texas,

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,380
but everybody loves cowboys and everybody loves astronauts,

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,800
and Texas is full of cowboys and astronauts.

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,640
No, it's not.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,300
It's full of Yankees that moved here

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,100
because the Sun Belt is cheaper for corporate headquarters.

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,320
There's no cowboys left.

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,700
Where have all the cowboys gone?

52
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,400
I saw an episode of Larry's...

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,460
They became gun-hoosers.

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,600
...in the weeks that discussed...

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,580
Texas is insisting on all these pro-American,

56
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,860
inaccurate textbooks that whitewash the bad parts of our history,

57
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,220
like slavery and all that.

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,980
Oh, there was no such...

59
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,940
Those Negroes were so much better off with slavery, you know,

60
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,800
because if it wasn't for slavery,

61
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,840
why, they'd still be in Africa.

62
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,220
They'd be the majority.

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,320
And they'd all be going to hell

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,140
because they...

65
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,000
They never would have met Jesus.

66
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,520
Right, because, yeah,

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,600
nobody would have turned them on.

68
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,700
Well, you know, now in Africa,

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,380
Jesus is all over the place.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
But so is the prophet.

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,220
So you've got all kinds of problems.

72
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,940
Who's going to win?

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,460
Jesus?

74
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,920
Who's going to win?

75
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,800
Bob or Bob?

76
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,920
You know, I think Bob Dobbs is exactly the kind of savior

77
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,560
that this whole planet needs.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,080
I do, too. I agree.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,260
Say it to the Texans.

80
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,840
Say it to the Ugandans.

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,200
Say it to the Indians.

82
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,340
Say it to the Russians.

83
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,540
You just need Bob.

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,180
What kind of relationship does Bob have

85
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,540
with the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

86
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,040
Oh, that's just a satire.

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,940
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

88
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,940
Well, actually, they do get along pretty well.

89
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,320
I mean...

90
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,120
Someone would believe that kind of thing.

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,820
But really, they're just making fun of...

92
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,180
No, Reverend Stang, no, you understand.

93
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,960
I mean, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is real,

94
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,420
but the thing is, is that, you know,

95
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,820
Bob has to eat something, right?

96
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,940
Right.

97
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,540
You know, you got to get your carbohydrates

98
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,660
from someplace, right?

99
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,480
You can't just, you know,

100
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,220
Bob cannot live on frop alone.

101
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,700
Yeah, you got to think about it.

102
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,480
You know, he's been known to slurp up

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,940
a few of those noodley appendages.

104
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,560
I'll have the Flying Spaghetti Monster, please,

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,020
waitress, and extra Parmesan cheese on that.

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,360
Yeah.

107
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,840
They do have a relationship with each other.

108
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,680
No salad afterwards,

109
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,700
because everybody's already fried.

110
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,580
Hey, here's a good phrase for you.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,960
I haven't figured out where to use this,

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,520
but I just have a phrase here.

113
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,800
Okay?

114
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,520
Okay.

115
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,080
The self-terrifying whites of Damasica.

116
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm not sure what that means exactly.

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,340
I have my theories.

118
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,300
The self-terrifying whites of Damasica.

119
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,460
The American Tala T. Billy Band

120
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,480
and their Super Jesus Squad.

121
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,320
These are just notes I'm looking for.

122
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,580
Okay.

123
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,340
It's just going right over my head.

124
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,600
It is male overcompensation

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,480
for not bearing sufficient numbers

126
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400
of very large penises.

127
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,480
I think that has to do with...

128
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
Unless you have at least eight.

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,060
Unless you have at least eight,

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,840
you're not a real man.

131
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,760
I mean, I don't want to go to heck, you know.

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,900
You know, what if...

133
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,500
Hey, man, hold on.

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,320
What if there is a gosh?

135
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,460
And what if gosh could actually darn us to heck?

136
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,820
I was just thinking, man,

137
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,460
I'm in trouble if that's the case.

138
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm going to be darned really bad.

139
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,780
Gosh, has darned me to heck.

140
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,660
Darned all the way to heck.

141
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,260
And yeah, Christ.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,640
I took a sleigh ride to heck.

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,240
I like to smell it.

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,780
Go ahead, man.

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,220
Oh, what fun it is to sing a Slayer song tonight.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,440
Yes.

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes.

148
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,180
Yes.

149
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,440
Yes.

150
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,700
Yes.

151
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:56,760
Yes.

152
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,100
Yes.

153
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


154
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


155
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


156
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,140
Yes.

157
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,140


158
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,140


159
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,140


160
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,140


161
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,600
Yes.

162
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,620
Yes.

163
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,280
Yes.

164
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes.

165
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,540
Yes.

166
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

167
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,680
Yes.

168
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,780
Yes.

169
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,180
Yes.

170
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,180


171
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,180


172
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,180


173
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,640
I think that Ewing will never say dalam.

174
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,140
I'll tell you the truth, pal.

175
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,780
I told him no.

176
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,340
No.

177
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,040
The world on the street.

178
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,480
Well, in my personal opinion,

179
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,140
are ruining America.

180
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,560
And should be genociding like me.

181
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
Every day I pray is DNA a genetic.

182
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,820
It seemed to be so enticing.

183
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,740
It seemed to be so entertaining.

184
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,560
It seemed to be so provocative and scintillating.

185
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,420
I thought all the lights was in their multifarious colors.

186
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,240
I thought it looked so good to the natural eye.

187
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,760
It looked like it was the very thing to enjoy yourself on.

188
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,320
Push the button and it would be all over.

189
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,500
Just enough thrill for a kick.

190
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,480
And then the excitement could end and they could stop.

191
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,780
But it's not quite that simple, my friend.

192
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,360
It doesn't conclude that easily.

193
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Fire time, every way.

194
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,020
Fire time, every way.

195
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,900
Fire time.

196
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,780
Fire Station.

197
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,840
Fire Station.

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,600
Fire Station, fire station.

199
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,320
Yeah.

200
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,580
But all doctors live by%er.

201
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,780
Can't you make the complex simple for the simple minded?

202
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,360
I've heard there's a lot of money in that.

203
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,560
It's been done in a small fabric.

204
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,260
It fits neatly.

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,160
You know, I spent two years working as a snake oil salesman,

206
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,240
and I never want to go back to that.

207
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,160
Yeah, but it tastes pretty darn good sometimes when you're all alone, you know.

208
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,760
It was actually homeopathic.

209
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,280
It was called oleum serpentus.

210
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh, I would never go that way.

211
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
Bunch of homeopaths.

212
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,760
Thanksgiving?

213
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know if it would work by then.

214
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,640
It's not the kind I'm using.

215
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,840
Have you ever taken one of them huge pythons and tried to stuff it, like, for Thanksgiving dinner?

216
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Boy, what a mess that makes.

217
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,400
Like in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom?

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,900
Yeah, eating snakes and spiders and stuff.

219
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,240
Baby snakes!

220
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,400
A friend of mine who had visited China actually did have what they called fresh fish,

221
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
meaning that the fish was alive.

222
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,220
When it was fried.

223
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,980
And he said it was quite tasty, but...

224
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Fry them alive.

225
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,080
Bob predicted you'll all be eating roach crap by the year 2000.

226
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,280
And look, he was right.

227
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,500
And actually, we've been eating a certain percentage of roach crap all along.

228
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,580
There is a minimum allowed percentage of roach crap in food

229
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,920
because you just can't get completely away from it.

230
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,460
There's always going to be some minuscule amount of roach.

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,840
There's always going to be some minuscule amount of roach crap.

232
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,740
Pretty much every structure...

233
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,020
One rodent hair per can.

234
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,900
You know, cockroaches are fascinating.

235
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,040
You know, they say that the roaches will survive any kind of apocalypse we can create.

236
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,260
But they are tropical insects by nature.

237
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
And if it weren't for human beings building our structures with heating,

238
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,740
roaches couldn't live at this latitude.

239
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,740
But did you know that roaches were impervious to nuclear attacks?

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,320
And that's why we have to make medicines out of them.

241
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
And that's why we have to make medicines out of them.

242
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,740
So that we can survive terrorism.

243
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,080
See, you're all up on the wrong track.

244
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,560
Cockroaches are a good thing.

245
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,480
Yeah, right.

246
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,140
I mean, that's why when you go on some of those right-wing websites,

247
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,340
they'll have ads for cockroach suits.

248
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Basically, you put on a wetsuit, but it's completely covered in dead roaches.

249
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,060
You just glue them all over your body, and you'll be safe when the nukes...

250
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,300
You know, you can withstand a rocket ship.

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,860
Yep, you gotta cover up...

252
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,260
The thing is that you have to cover up your ears and your eyes and your nose and your mouth, too,

253
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,500
with all the dead roaches.

254
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,980
But sure enough, you will survive the nuclear apocalypse if you do that.

255
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,960
You might twist your head, but...

256
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,660
And that would solve that problem right there.

257
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,300
Pucker your lips for apocalypse and kiss your ass goodbye.

258
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,500
Add more inches to your cock, roach.

259
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,280
That's right.

260
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,180
Who's scraping the barrel for the dirtiest cognate?

261
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,860
We are all insects.

262
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,800
We are all insects in the eyes of Jehovah One.

263
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:14,860
We are all insects in the eyes of the sex goddesses, Jehovah One, the exists.

264
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,240
Gregor Samsun, the metamorphosis, and Moses Berman.

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,460
He's probably one of them.

266
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,840
He woke up one morning and became some sort of monster,

267
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,400
and it's because of his belief system.

268
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,340
He had a rotten apple stuck in his shell.

269
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,940
We are all roaches now.

270
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,820
That's what it comes down to.

271
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,060
That's profound, man.

272
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,600
We're all mighty fucking roaches.

273
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,580
Muy profundo.

274
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,020
If the sex goddesses think we're insects, why are they willing to have sex with us?

275
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,500
Do they have, like, an insect fetish?

276
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,760
It's not that they want to.

277
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,620
Yeah, really.

278
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
It's not that they want to have sex with us.

279
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,080
Well, they're going to use us for their amusement.

280
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,380
But they have powers of illusion, and it will seem to some of us like it's a sex thing, but it's really not.

281
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,420
They're really just going to crush us under the grill.

282
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,120
They're really just going to crush us.

283
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,660
Well, we'll be getting screwed either way.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,940
Some ways are fine.

286
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,760
Yep, yep.

287
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,740
Tender as a cotton tan.

288
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,220
And we got a savor from those girls.

289
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,740
Boy, you're going to love it.

290
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,740


291
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,740


292
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,740


293
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,740


294
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,740


295
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:20,740


296
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,900
Ugh, you're the worst kind of autistic.

297
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,200
You can't even count.

298
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,060
Good luck with the angry mob, Bob!

299
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,440
Leave me alone!

300
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,640
Bob!

301
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,820
Come inside.

302
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,920
I like men with big appetites.

303
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,500
Only I could never find one to match mine.

304
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,660
Well, now here's something you'll really enjoy.

305
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,400
138 Smith & Wesson Revolver.

306
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,180
Condition good.

307
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,100
Five rounds of 158 grain.

308
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,180
But each other ammo.

309
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,520
Number of rounds fired by combat forces.

310
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,780
Seven rounds.

311
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,820
As for being brainwashed, the idea is ridiculous to the point of being beyond belief.

312
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,300
We were speaking of belief.

313
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,760
Beliefs and conditioning.

314
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,080
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning.

315
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,900
Thus, the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs deposing another.

316
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,160
What cut they get?

317
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,380
Oh, no.

318
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,960
What cut they get?

319
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,080
Oh, no.

320
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,200
Bob, no.

321
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,520
They ain't getting no cut.

322
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,420
No percentage.

323
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,420
Zero percentage.

324
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,240
Zero.

325
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,440
No dough.

326
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,080
Angry, heavy metal subculture.

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
Where were the parents?

328
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Violent movies.

329
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,380
So fun.

330
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:32,900
Video.

331
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,900
Bob, I'm everywhere!

332
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,180
Television.

333
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,620
Entertainment.

334
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,320
Bum.

335
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,380
I almost forgot.

336
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,240
A letter from Bob.

337
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,700
The year 1984 is over, and we lost.

338
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,080
Sure, it all seemed perfect.

339
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,460
We all have our ID number.

340
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,240
We all pay our taxes.

341
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,220
We all watch our television.

342
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,380
We all take the medication prescribed by our employer.

343
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,820
But do we have any real choice?

344
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,200
All the soft drinks seem the same.

345
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,460
All the hamburgers look alike.

346
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,240
And all the politicians speak the same nonsense.

347
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,800
Listen to the lawmakers enough, and you'll start to believe that you should take your

348
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,220
soma and be happy to be a beta.

349
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,880
Take too much soma, and you'll start to enjoy daytime talk shows.

350
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,060
Possibly they'll be the same.

351
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


352
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


353
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


354
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


355
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


356
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


357
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


358
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


359
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


360
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


361
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


362
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,060


363
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,060
But you'll be the only example in our civilization where we have too much choice.

364
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,060
The selection of the choices is the same as the selection of the decisions.

365
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,080
You control the choices, and you control the outcomes.

366
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,280
Eliminate the choices altogether, and you have high school.

367
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,460
Now all of you voters had better behave, or I'll pull this country over to the curb and

368
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,180
we'll wait a while until you can act straight.

369
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
Take a number at the deli.

370
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,580
Press 1 to get your balance.

371
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,500
Sign the form and initial here.

372
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,660
And each decision roots you down a tunnel which ultimately puts you exactly where they

373
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,040
want you.

374
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,380
The only way out of this box in which X only takes the center square when they wanted to

375
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,840
is to make your own decisions.

376
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,060
When the machine says choose 1, 2, or 3, pick 4 right outside the lines.

377
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,220
Fail to fully fill the circle with a number 2 pencil.

378
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,320
Don't use a ballpoint pen.

379
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,480
And most importantly, fold, crumple, and mutilate that form.

380
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,400
Failure to do so will relegate us and our descendants to a lifetime of tyranny.

381
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,280
Why should man be free?

382
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,800
Freedom is the only thing worth dying for.

383
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,400
It's the only thing worth dying for.

384
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,840
There are people, and people should be free.

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,400
Freedom's a thing you have to deserve.

386
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,060
You have to work for it.

387
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,960
Without freedom, there's no reason to live.

388
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,120
But what is life if you're not free?

389
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,080
It's hardly life.

390
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,400
Without freedom, man can't exist properly.

391
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,720
A man has to be free because it's his nature to be free.

392
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,980
Well, I'm glad you said something because I totally forgot because I'm past my youth,

393
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,220
and we all forget.

394
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,780
Oh yeah, I always, you know, you know, I just forgot what I was talking about.

395
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,620
Well, you ain't dead yet, man.

396
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh.

397
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,960
You still have it in you.

398
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,100
Whatever it is.

399
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,300
It's swollen now and it hurts, but it's swollen.

400
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,440
It's swollen now and has occasional diarrhea.

401
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,960
You know, I'm a very indecisive person.

402
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm a very indecisive person.

403
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,960
I have a hard time making up my mind with a lot of things.

404
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,000
I have a lot of big life choices, and you know what people always tell me?

405
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,160
They just say, go with your gut.

406
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,580
But what if my gut can't make up its mind either?

407
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,300
You know, you ever had diarrhea and constipation at the same time?

408
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,640
You ever had diarrhea and constipation at the same time?

409
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,380
Even my gut can't make up its mind.

410
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,220
Well, at least you're consistently indecisive.

411
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,720
I know somebody else who's that way.

412
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,580
Me.

413
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,260
I just leave.

414
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,100
I just leave.

415
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,460
I just stay angry from the other room.

416
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,400
I just stay angry from the other room.

417
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,140
Stan deals with these people like us all the time.

418
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,520
Stan deals with these people like us all the time.

419
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,160
Like right now, he's talking about somebody he's with all the time.

420
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,200
He just hates it, too.

421
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,440
He just hates it, too.

422
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,960
It's just like, well, why can't he?

423
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,120
Well, we would just as soon say back to Stan, under such conditions,

424
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,260
it's what I was going to say.

425
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,280
How come you can make up your mind so easily?

426
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,220
Don't you see the infinite possibilities we can explore?

427
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,720
Don't you see the infinite possibilities we can explore?

428
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,380
Don't you see the infinite possibilities we can explore?

429
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,100
There are infinite possibilities, indeed.

430
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,920
The trick is to not care.

431
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,380
The trick is to not care what happens.

432
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,380
You're making a rough guess of what's going to happen next after this choice you make.

433
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,600
What you mean is a coin that's the same on both sides,

434
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,280
where it always comes with heads, no matter how you flip it?

435
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,640
That can solve a lot of problems right there.

436
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,100
Well, I'll tell you what.

437
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
If you ever find yourself flipping a coin,

438
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,520
and then you see the result and you say two out of three,

439
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,820
then you know what you really wanted.

440
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,420
Right. Yeah, exactly.

441
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,800
Well, that's the same way if you have the double-headed coin,

442
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,020
you go heads like wind tails, you lose, you'll always win.

443
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,900
But you'll kind of automatically pick the one you hope is going to come up.

444
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,960
The two-headed coin, man.

445
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,220
How does this principle apply to the magic eight ball?

446
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
The magic eight ball is a piece of commercial junk.

447
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,960
Well, yeah, but at the same time,

448
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,880
it's every bit as effective as, say, the I Ching

449
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,320
or older prognosticative techniques.

450
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,240
Is that a D20 inside the crystal ball?

451
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,380
Are they like not today or something?

452
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,780
I forget what some of...

453
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,280
Right.

454
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,580
You know,

455
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,240
sometimes it would say yes, definitely.

456
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,220
And other times it would go,

457
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,280
need more time to consider.

458
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,260
You just keep asking.

459
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,400
Why not use a brand new electronic Ouija board now?

460
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,920
The new ones they've got and stuff that can light up and everything.

461
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,160
Why not just do that?

462
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,940
Ask the spirits to choose.

463
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,700
They're different.

464
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,200
They have normal way, of course,

465
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,100
but, you know,

466
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,100
something they can relate to.

467
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,880
I hate to say it,

468
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,720
but I saw the other day in the store,

469
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,160
in lieu of,

470
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,140
the magic eight ball,

471
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,920
I saw a magic Batman head and a magic Iron Man head.

472
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,400
You would shake Batman's head and said,

473
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,160
well, should I ask her out or not?

474
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,820
Yeah.

475
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,520
Oh man, we need to shake his dang head.

476
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,980
Like we need a dang bobble head.

477
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Plus that's also, you can ask questions.

478
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,460
Well, you'd swing it around by the ponytail.

479
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,040
You wouldn't shake it.

480
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,820
You'd swing it around like a robot.

481
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,880
You know, and, uh,

482
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,880
and it would always give you a vague answer that would really kind of mean anything.

483
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
I like the real magic eight ball.

484
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,120
You'd be forced to make up your own mind.

485
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:05,260
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.

486
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,180
I tell you that.

487
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,360
Obama is going to be out playing golf.

488
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,860
He might even be on one of my courses.

489
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,720
I would invite him.

490
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,560
I actually would say,

491
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm not saying they're stupid.

492
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,120
I like China.

493
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,400
I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.

494
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,340
Am I supposed to dislike them?

495
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
But we don't know because we have no protection.

496
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,640
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.

497
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,940
They become rich.

498
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,340
I'm in competition with them.

499
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,480
They just built a hotel.

500
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,320
In Syria.

501
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,280
Can you believe this?

502
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,760
We have losers.

503
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,960
We have losers.

504
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,460
We have people that don't have it.

505
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,540
We have people that are morally corrupt.

506
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm really rich.

507
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,820
I'll show you that in a second.

508
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,500
I have a net worth.

509
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,320
I'm not doing that to brag because you know what?

510
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,960
I don't have to brag.

511
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,300
I don't have to believe it or not.

512
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,900
I think I am a nice person.

513
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,240
People that know me like me.

514
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,060
Well, that just goes to show you how insane our political culture has become.

515
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,320
Well, he's got us talking about it, hasn't he?

516
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,640
What are you talking about right now?

517
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,980
The lack of intelligence?

518
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,100
We're talking about Trump.

519
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,060
Therefore, he wins.

520
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,380
Oh, yeah.

521
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,200
Oh, here's the okay.

522
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,340
Because he's a winner and we're all losers.

523
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,060
Oh, here are the 20 answers inside a magic eight ball.

524
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,440
Okay.

525
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,880
I'm not going to give all 20.

526
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,160
But here are some of the answers skin Flint.

527
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,680
It is certain.

528
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,400
It is decidedly.

529
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,580
So outlook good signs point.

530
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:50,860
Yes.

531
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,360
Then there's the other category reply.

532
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,800
Hazy try again better not tell you now.

533
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,080
I like that one.

534
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,480
Concentrate and ask again and then the negative ones are don't count on it.

535
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,920
My reply is no my sources say no.

536
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,800
That's kind of creepy.

537
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,360
Be coming from a Ouija board.

538
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,240
But out of all of those 20 answers 10 are positive fiber negative and five are neutral.

539
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,160
Well, these are all mind control techniques developed in Langley and then skewed is inherently

540
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,920
skewed towards positivism.

541
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,380
Well, these are like ticker ticker words.

542
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:39,100
These degenerate certain spot in the nucleus of the person's brain and and suddenly.

543
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,320
They will pick up an AK-47 and run down the street saying, you know, shouting weird epithets to the wind.

544
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,060
I think I'm pretty sure this is how they do it.

545
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,900
Jerry stuck your ear up to one of them little, you know, crystal ball oracles and stuff.

546
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,080
This is really in there doing the talking.

547
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,520
I actually own a crystal ball.

548
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,040
I can see you with the turbine and stuff.

549
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,540
I look pretty good in a turbine.

550
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,780
That's one of the few good things about getting older.

551
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,340
I look better in a turbine now.

552
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,680
In my 30s than I did as a teenager or 20 something.

553
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,220
Yeah, it kind of looks like Omar Sharif on acid.

554
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,120
Omar Sharif on acid.

555
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,420
Oh, that's down the mystic smoking head of Bob magic Oracle.

556
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,220
It has answered over a million questions.

557
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,500
One million, six hundred and twenty five thousand.

558
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:50,120
Three repeating repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating

559
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,300
and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating.

560
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,020
They listen to your calls and they film you in the stalls

561
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,720
They track your every move just so they can prove

562
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,400
They know your name, they know your face

563
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,780
You're just a number in their super database

564
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Climb to a similar place

565
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,860
Climbing up the walls of suburban shopping malls

566
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,300
They're kicking down the door of your local dollar store

567
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,040
They know your name, they know your face

568
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,500
You're just a number in their super database

569
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,020
Climb to a similar place

570
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,720
You're just a number in their super database

571
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,580
You're just a number in their super database

572
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,340
They know your name, they know your face

573
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,920
You're just a number in their super database

574
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Climb to a similar place

575
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Climb to a similar place

576
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,100
Now is the time to a similar place

577
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:08,060
Now is the time to a similar place

578
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,980
So please don't do that

579
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,500
Please don't scare anybody else

580
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,460
And I thought, walking in with your, you know

581
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,500
And I thought all this time it was required by law to carry a gun

582
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,200
Yeah at this point it's really kind of confusing

583
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,500
You must wear your weapon, your concealed weapon

584
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,120
On the outside of your body

585
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,360
My body itself is a lethal weapon

586
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,460
That's what I was just thinking about

587
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,380
You could spit bullets out of your belly button

588
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,880
Since you've had a shower, Dr. Sinister, that's terrible.

589
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
It's only been a couple weeks.

590
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,500
They call them golden showers.

591
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:57,380
No, but seriously, it's guns all the way down here in North Texas.

592
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,340
In fact, my two grandchildren got their first rifle for Christmas.

593
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm not kidding.

594
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,860
Yeah, a little .22, a nice little .22.

595
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,380
They've been getting gun safety lessons.

596
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,560
Is it bolt-action?

597
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,480
I haven't had any gun safety lessons, but nobody gave me a rifle.

598
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,720
In fact, they couldn't find a way.

599
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,680
You were a seditious thing.

600
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,240
You were like a Yankee lover or something.

601
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,560
You were oddball.

602
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,800
We loved everybody.

603
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,620
You were a cosmopolitan type of person.

604
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,820
Everybody else was like rustic devils and whatnot.

605
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,340
Especially when they put on those...

606
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,200
They pretend like they're...

607
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,300
They're Welsh miners or something.

608
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,400
But that's something else, I guess.

609
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,020
Okay.

610
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,120
I could smell his feet from miles away.

611
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
Everybody could.

612
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,580
You know, it's hard work.

613
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,040
When will the people wake up?

614
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,680
What do I do?

615
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,700
Do I put her in jail or do I buy her a tombstone?

616
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
Bleeding sensitivity that he unfurls like a flag.

617
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,820
Because he's such a rather dull, quite uninspired, average type guy.

618
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,240
With an appetite.

619
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,680
They didn't do it quick enough.

620
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,460
Now he's like caught in between some weird, goofy place.

621
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,980
He can't figure out what to do.

622
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,920
He's damned if he doesn't.

623
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,360
He's damned if he does.

624
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
It isn't quite as simple as we'd like it to be.

625
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,300
But I hope it makes you very rich.

626
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,520
Harry, I am out of control.

627
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,880
Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I want.

628
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,180
People still smoke that.

629
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,360
That weird shit around here.

630
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,900
But you still get high around here, yeah?

631
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,440
In cases countries recovering from war suffer from extremely high unemployment,

632
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,740
environmental illness, limited access to resources, and an absence of democracy.

633
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,620
You're all shook up, aren't you, baby?

634
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,900
We're given this gift, don't you know?

635
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,640
The ability to understand if no one wants to understand.

636
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,080
What do you dream of when you imagine a perfect life of wealth and success?

637
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,020
Freedom.

638
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,000
Free from financial worries.

639
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,180
A new car.

640
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,720
The home of your dreams.

641
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,980
Early retirement.

642
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,620
Or just the comfort of knowing that you're financially independent and completely debt-free.

643
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,580
Now all this and more can be yours once you've got the power to have it all.

644
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,780
I predict public executions will be shown on television sponsored by your local gas company.

645
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,760
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

646
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,880
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

647
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,160
In it, he demonstrates how the power of the future is a key to success.

648
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:46,420
He demonstrates how anyone can acquire tremendous wealth without special training, without inside connections, and most amazingly, without any money of their own.

649
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:53,320
He's turned the art of being rich and successful into a simple and repeatable formula that's changing people's lives in record numbers.

650
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,560
A true formula is both predictable and repeatable in its results.

651
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,440
When will the people wake up?

652
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,180
The effect of a bug.

653
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
In its results.

654
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,360
This is bug.

655
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,460
Money everywhere and still not enough.

656
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,880
And then no money, or little money, or less money, or more money.

657
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,620
But money.

658
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,580
Always money.

659
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,680
And if you have money or you don't have money, it's the money that counts.

660
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,520
And money makes money.

661
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,940
But what makes money make money?

662
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,600
Double the silos and double the bucket.

663
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,860
I doubled my income.

664
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,660
I doubled my income.

665
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,620
More than tripled.

666
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,540
I quadrupled my income.

667
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,220
I literally multiplied my income by about eight times.

668
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,660
And now I am a millionaire and getting close to being a multi-millionaire.

669
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,360
And my income has gone from $151,000 to as much as $14 million in one year.

670
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,860
The money that you'll spend on this program will come back to you thousands of dollars.

671
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


672
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


673
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


674
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


675
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


676
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:57,340
I've never been a millionaire in a decade.

677
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,120
This is a mil 걔 grill.

678
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,120


679
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,120


680
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,120


681
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,280
Now, I've changed for better.

682
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,280


683
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,280


684
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,100
Four differentadow, pior, and Kerri only wowed at making money using less money than

685
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,100


686
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,100


687
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,100


688
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,460
do.

689
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:02,980
And now y'all get fucking free from this book piece.

690
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,000
I even read more people's news now if you don't live enough and go home through

691
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,280
the work model.

692
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,840
I still go to the movies with my next word, right after Dead in出 soil.

693
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,000
I get it.

694
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,500
So, hey, we got another caller here.

695
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,480
Where's the sub-tire?

696
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,420
I'm taking a chance here with this caller.

697
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,280
Hello, you're on the air.

698
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,140
Okay, hello.

699
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,520
Hello.

700
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,500
Hello.

701
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,160
Hey.

702
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:27,960
Hey.

703
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:28,760
Hey.

704
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,920
You guys are fascists.

705
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,680
That's right.

706
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,340
Hey, at least our trains run on time.

707
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,100
You got it, buddy.

708
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,980
We are fascists, and you're the next one into the camps.

709
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,180
Fascist pigs.

710
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,660
No, I like fascists.

711
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,220
You do, huh?

712
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,300
Have you ever heard that phrase?

713
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,120
Fascist pigs.

714
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:56,960
Fascist pigs.

715
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,260
You know, the modernist movement was quite fond of...

716
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,160
I thought it was the modernists.

717
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,900
No, it was the futureists.

718
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,700
You know what?

719
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,200
You might be right.

720
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,900
You're a German expressionist, my lad.

721
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,820
I liked the technocrats.

722
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,160
Those were my favorite.

723
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,240
That was my favorite cult movement.

724
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,540
They had one of their first places out here in northeastern Ohio.

725
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,940
And my parents knew their parents,

726
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,540
and they believed that machines were going to take over the world

727
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,320
and that it was going to be a good thing for everybody.

728
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,140
The technocrats?

729
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,100
Yes.

730
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,700
Is that who you're talking about?

731
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,160
Technocracy and technocrats, yes.

732
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,340
The actual group.

733
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,560
The group.

734
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
Technocracy, or whatever they called it.

735
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,240
Right.

736
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,400
Yeah, that was a little-known cultish movement of intellectuals and would-be technocrats.

737
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,620
Well, the greatest trick the technocracy ever pulled on us

738
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,860
was convincing us that they had gone away.

739
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,660
They actually took over.

740
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,040
Oh, is that it?

741
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,680
It's their world.

742
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,320
We just live in it.

743
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:04,600
Well, there were a number of reasons that their particular little society didn't take off.

744
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,840
For one thing, they insisted...

745
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,300
They insisted everybody wear gray suits.

746
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,320
Right.

747
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,740
And they had a strangely Nazi-like set of rules

748
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,480
that just didn't sit well with Americans after World War II.

749
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,660
Although it has come back into style.

750
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,900
It might be, judging by what you see in politics these days,

751
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,680
I would say it was time for the technocrats to come back.

752
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,100
Would they allow you at least to pick which shade of gray you wanted to wear?

753
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,580
No.

754
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,420
Because I look better in darker gray.

755
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,140
It was inefficient, you see.

756
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,080
To...

757
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,020
For people to, you know, show off and wear different colored things.

758
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,200
So everybody...

759
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,600
They were kind of like a computerized Amish.

760
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,980
It was very strange.

761
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah.

762
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,920
They didn't have computers because the technocrats were before the Internet.

763
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,380
That was another reason that they didn't really make it.

764
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,060
And they also used to wear these pins that were the yin-yang sign,

765
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,340
which, you know, was the first time I ever saw the yin-yang sign.

766
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,360
I thought, oh, it's the technocracy.

767
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,400
Right.

768
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,560
Yeah.

769
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:05,760
Yeah.

770
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:05,820


771
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,200
Yeah.

772
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,200


773
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,280
Gray and red.

774
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,780
Chaos.

775
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,900
I guess the gray machine part.

776
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,320
Chaos.

777
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,620
You guys promote chaos.

778
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,280
Chaos.

779
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,100
Oh, yeah.

780
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,800
Oh, yeah.

781
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,180
Oh, yeah.

782
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,620
Oh, yeah.

783
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,160
Oh, yeah.

784
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,600
I can say words over and over again, too.

785
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,060
It's fine.

786
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,740
Why do you guys talk about circling nothingness of endless confusion?

787
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,400
Maybe you're just too feeble-minded to wrap your brain around these supreme,

788
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,260
mysteries and truths that we have uncovered.

789
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:43,940
This is like, so you drop acid and then you just talk about, I like it.

790
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,740
Don't get me wrong.

791
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,400
I like it.

792
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,000
No, no, no.

793
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,080
We drink tons and tons of beer, then wine, then hard liquor.

794
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,380
And then we get on the radio.

795
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,900
Can you tell?

796
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,880
Seems like you can be tuned into that kind of thing.

797
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,000
And a couple of quaaludes doesn't hurt.

798
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,880
Tune in.

799
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,580
We're doing it just for you, man.

800
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,740
I know.

801
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,220
So that you can understand us.

802
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,720
I used to, I know.

803
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,460
We're trying to drag our IQs down as far as we can so that we can be popular.

804
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,920
It's not working.

805
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,140
I'm surprised you haven't really talked this long.

806
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,140
There's just not enough advertising space for the whole monkey to go around.

807
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,140
Yes, you have definitely exposed me as a closet fascist.

808
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,200
But now I guess it's out in the open.

809
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,080
Hello, you're on the air.

810
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
I for one welcome our fascist overlords with open arms.

811
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
With open arms.

812
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,200
Welcome to the closet.

813
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,600
Good idea.

814
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,840
That's a really pretty smart approach.

815
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,260
Yep, it's a good way of getting back.

816
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,260
Timber with arms open.

817
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,960
Most of us in the manual doesn't say how to get the hell out of here.

818
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,440
But at least if you hold your head down and you worship the fine leadership of a pew,

819
00:35:52,620 --> 00:36:00,260
an oligarchy, perhaps a business oligarchy, perhaps war profiteers and us together,

820
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,140
I don't know.

821
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,140
Can make a lot of sense.

822
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,060
La la la la.

823
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,780
Mm.

824
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,740
Little bird with one in my head.

825
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,160
I'm sorry.

826
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,440
It's okay, guys.

827
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,460
It's all right.

828
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,320
It's not okay.

829
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,380
Stan, I know it's not.

830
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,780
But you can say that.

831
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,540
Oh, yeah.

832
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,800
I think, you know, welcome a fascist with open arms and they won't kill you.

833
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,500
I know, but I think we're complaining.

834
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,740
Hello, you're on the air.

835
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,680
My nature.

836
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,340
How can you be in two places at once when you're not anywhere?

837
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,860
Where?

838
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,700
At all.

839
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,900
Oh, I remember those guys.

840
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,240
That is one of the last ones.

841
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,120
Just that color was old, really old.

842
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,520
Because you remember the fire sign theater, Mr.

843
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,000
Schumer?

844
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,380
Yeah.

845
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,900
There's a lot of people who never even heard of the fire sign theater.

846
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,460
You know, they memorized every Monty Python line, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

847
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,900
It plus all the new cool comedy stuff.

848
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,740
Never, ever heard of fire sign theater.

849
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,320
In fact, I.

850
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,620
I had to school a person in that the other day, brutally.

851
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,600
Mm-hmm.

852
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,200
Brutally.

853
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,980
I knew you were going to add that part because sometimes school and news are sparing the

854
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,560
rod and you will.

855
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,300
Well, they weren't interested.

856
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,860
They thought, well, if it was cool, I'd already know about it.

857
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,800
So I beat it into their heads.

858
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,200
They didn't know everything yet.

859
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,140
We'll make you like it.

860
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,000
And they thanked me in the end.

861
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,840
And now they call radio shows, quoting fire sign theater and singing their little slogans

862
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,320
and songs.

863
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,120
Just like when they call, they get on the subgenius Facebook page and go, too much

864
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,880
is more than not enough, lol.

865
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,240
Pull the wool on my own eyes, lol.

866
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,420
Praise Bob.

867
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,600
And they can't even spell Bob right.

868
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,200
What are they teaching the kids in school these days, huh?

869
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,360
Is our children learning?

870
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,680
They teach them creationism, fascism and false American history.

871
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,200
The same kind of.

872
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,020
They used to teach back in 1950.

873
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,720
Yep.

874
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,280
That's what they're teaching now.

875
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,300
I can attest to that.

876
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,940
Except for on the college and university level, you get quite an eye-opening.

877
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,880
In a college university, everybody's Marxist.

878
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,120
Every single professor in college is a deadly Marxist evil man.

879
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,280
They're turning our children into homosexuals and other worse things.

880
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,820
I know about this because all my friends said so.

881
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,620
Not that they've ever been to college, but they know.

882
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,180
Because they're not.

883
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,900
Because they've heard it on the show.

884
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,220
No, not that they were actually my friends.

885
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,820
They were antagonistic.

886
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,940
They get the college news from TV, don't you see?

887
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,000
They say they know.

888
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,400
But you're telling me a news network is going to lie?

889
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,940
Well, it wouldn't be news.

890
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,780
It'd be entertainment.

891
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,580
Well, that'd be crazy.

892
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,920
Yeah, they'd just be a bunch of laughing baboons.

893
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,240
They're just there to sell ads to the dumbest people in the universe.

894
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,440
And we're not one of them.

895
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,060
We're never going to make any money this way.

896
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,700
Selling complex thoughts to the poorest people in the universe.

897
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,920
What were we thinking?

898
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,280
Sell dumb stuff to rich people.

899
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
That's the idea.

900
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,100
Yeah.

901
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,800
That's why Bob is the sign of sales and we're just followers of him.

902
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,160
That's right.

903
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,720
That's it.

904
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,020
Simple as that.

905
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,760
I've seen recent sussing of such a degree now.

906
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,540
I see people that I knew as foremost into my mind as martial artists and great creators

907
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:44,580
of unusual objects, usually someplace miles and miles away from any earthly abode and

908
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,880
stuff like that.

909
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,580
And they've learned to tailor their markets just like their haircuts to their clientele,

910
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,560
then to tell them.

911
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:51,860
And they're fine.

912
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,660
A clientele, carbon niche and covered up with mud.

913
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,540
I'm sorry.

914
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,820
But I agree.

915
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,580
That's what I'm saying.

916
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,280
I agree.

917
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,620
Now, David, have you been taking seriously my suggestion of if you can't find news to

918
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:19,380
report on, make some news, you know, make something happen that is exciting and, you

919
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,040
know, if it bleeds, it leads.

920
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,440
Right.

921
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:21,680
Right.

922
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,380
Something bleeding.

923
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,520
With my no neo-Marxist beliefs, I could probably, you know, be accused of all kinds of things.

924
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,620
I just thought something.

925
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,440
UFOs.

926
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,640
Everybody loves UFOs and Bigfoots.

927
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,160
Find some co-bucker who's willing to, who has seen a big UFO or a Bigfoot.

928
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,960
Do a story about them.

929
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,280
I've got a bunch of wild shots, man.

930
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,660
I've got, I got a whole stock full of wild shots and they all have these big blind shots

931
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,400
with Stalin's face on it.

932
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,560
Or any other hero.

933
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,620
I mean, he was one of the heroes of the revolution, even though he wasn't one.

934
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,960
He was a British agent for a long time.

935
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,300
Well, that's news, right?

936
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,560
Yeah.

937
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,300
I mean, you have to provide stories.

938
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,260
Well, you know, make some up.

939
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah.

940
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,120
That's what the big guys do.

941
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
That's what, I mean, look, that's what the biggest networks in America do.

942
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,080
They just make stuff up and everybody, you know, sounds good.

943
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,320
People believe it.

944
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,140
They're pulling wool over their own eyes.

945
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,420
That is very true.

946
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,760
That is very true.

947
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,760
And then the spinmeisters take off from there because everything, the consensus has been

948
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,160
prearranged and driven by market forces beyond our control, especially if we have no more

949
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,320
power control like many, so many people do nowadays from the nuclear waste and the pollinator

950
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,800
flowers.

951
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:45,020
I do wonder how it is that so many pundits manage to stay in business when they are consistently

952
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,920
wrong in their predictions all the time.

953
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,980
It's in the hole.

954
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,260
Show me the money.

955
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,120
He's a liar!

956
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,840
Hello, gorgeous.

957
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,940
I know you are, but what am I?

958
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,120
You just put your lips together and blow.

959
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,920
Yeah, baby, yeah!

960
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,980
I don't have to show you any stinking lashes.

961
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,960
Go ahead.

962
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,940
Make my day.

963
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,040
We rob banks.

964
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,260
Pass in your seatbelt.

965
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,560
It's going to be a bumpy night.

966
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,720
I just don't want to grow anymore.

967
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,660
I don't want to grow anymore.

968
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,960
They call me Winnie the Pooh.

969
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


970
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


971
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


972
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


973
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


974
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


975
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


976
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


977
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


978
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


979
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960


980
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:30,880
is living. Why don't you ask me what it feels like to be a freak? Ask me what it feels like

981
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,980
to be a freak. You do think I'm a freak, don't you? But you want to know something? With

982
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:46,380
me, it's different. I think you're the freak. I think you're the one that's different.

983
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:57,140
Can you dig that? Yeah, man, I can dig it. You got your shit? Yeah, I got it. Well, I

984
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:05,740
got mine. So come on. These new ways, all this paper, all these machines, they record

985
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,800
everything. They tell me nothing.

986
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:29,020
You're all shook up, aren't you, David? You're all shook up, aren't you, David? You've got

987
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,760
a weird sense of humor. Try again. I get funnier. Look, I don't know what the hell your point

988
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,900
is, but I don't. The point is of no return, and you've reached it. He's got a thing for

989
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,500
women. A rising tide of fascism lifts all boats. Unless it's one of those rafts that

990
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,840
the Syrian refugees are coming to Europe on.

991
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,540
I can tell you're all getting a rise out of fascism.

992
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,240
I don't find it amusing, though. I'm serious about some things. Human suffering? Ha! Who

993
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,760
cares about that? My goats, that's all I care about. My little baby, baby goats.

994
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,420
You have a goat? No.

995
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,620
I realized when I said goat, I was going to say, can I borrow it?

996
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,720
I'm a liar because of the family goat.

997
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,900
Why a goat as opposed to why a duck and the other transmissions.

998
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:32,240
Yeah, if you're going to do it right, take it deeper. Take it deeper and just, you know,

999
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:39,500
go keep walking. Just keep walking until you get lost, but then you find your way eventually.

1000
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,840
You know, the funny thing is if I took off walking just due west, I'd run into a goat

1001
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,880
farm in about 10 minutes.

1002
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,760
Right.

1003
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,640
I'd be surrounded by goats. So when you talk about fascism being a problem, man, just try

1004
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,680
living among the goats. Try being a goat boy.

1005
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,880
They're very flat-sounding, aren't they?

1006
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,120
Yeah, in the morning... I mean, their horns are huge, and they're also easily aroused.

1007
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,140
And they eat anything.

1008
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:08,680
They're always climbing.

1009
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,300
Yep, they're very hersine.

1010
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,740
I think caller number three is crying.

1011
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,860
One of my favorite things about this podcast is that it's a great way to get to know the

1012
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:17,860


1013
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:26,380
One of the favorite words in the English language is hersine. H-I-R-C-I-N-E. It means goat-like,

1014
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,660
especially in odor.

1015
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,380
Oh, I'll have to remember that one. That would come in handy.

1016
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,880
Anyway, it's fun to practice your fascism down on the goat farm. You know, you stand

1017
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,840
out and just make speeches and say, I'm going to make goat land great. I'm going to make

1018
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:47,840


1019
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,020
them great.

1020
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,740
Our thick fur has been walking around today.

1021
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:48,740


1022
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,660
And when you say, again, just the right way. Boy, the goats all just faint. They fall down.

1023
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,500
They're so thrilled.

1024
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:03,940
These are Tennessee fainting goats, so they're designed to do that as sacrifices. But it

1025
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:11,320
works. That's the point. Fascism works, man. The trains run on time. The bouffant hairdos

1026
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,440
get booffed up. And the babies get kissed on the forehead.

1027
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,300
Well, Mussolini shaved his head.

1028
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,920
He's a slobbering butt-mouthed people.

1029
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,960
Yeah, the cheese.

1030
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,300
The cheese is great.

1031
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,540
The fascist cheese.

1032
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,180
I don't like regular goat cheese.

1033
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,240
But see, we can't find any Mussolini or Hitler to condone or condemn anymore

1034
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,400
because the leaders of this oligarchy are much shadowier.

1035
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,140
I don't think they're all that shadowy.

1036
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,860
I think they're operating right in the open.

1037
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,780
Do you really?

1038
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:47,560
Oh, yeah.

1039
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,640
But yeah, at this point, why not?

1040
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,640
It actually sells.

1041
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,200
You can sell a hell of a lot of Make America Great Again hats.

1042
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,420
Just think of all the sporting events.

1043
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,340
All have these big Army and Navy and Marine Corps advertisements constantly

1044
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,240
more than anybody else even beer.

1045
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,760
I wondered what that was all about.

1046
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,640
What?

1047
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,440
You watch commercial?

1048
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Well, I think they're getting rid of World War III

1049
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,760
because...

1050
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,880
Because Iran and Saudi Arabia don't like each other, as everybody knows.

1051
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,160
But as this cover comes off, everybody's like,

1052
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,000
oh, that means...

1053
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,080
Yeah, because we're allied with the Saudis

1054
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,340
and the Iranians are different than them and they're different.

1055
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:33,800
Right.

1056
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,740
It's complicated, isn't it?

1057
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,080
Yes.

1058
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,800
And yet it's quite simple when you look at it with the eye of perhaps a war profiteer.

1059
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1060
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,960
That's the idea.

1061
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:55,240
Do you have any of those eyes of war profiteers around that I could borrow, Dave?

1062
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,200
Because I think it would do the church good.

1063
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:01,900
That's it.

1064
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,200
Church of the subgenius needs to start a war for profit.

1065
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,220
Yep.

1066
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,580
Well, we tried the war against God, but that's more of a philosophical thing to amuse God.

1067
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,080
We're not seriously spending any big money on that.

1068
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,760
Yeah, that's what they call asymmetricism.

1069
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,700
That's definitely some asymmetric warfare there.

1070
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,360
Extremely, yeah.

1071
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,040
But that's kind of the point of it.

1072
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,500
Now, as far as real wars go...

1073
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,420
The noble lost cause.

1074
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,160
You know that I can say this to ensure disbelief,

1075
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,000
because I'm saying it on a silly college radio show,

1076
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,400
but the church actually does have four nuclear weapons.

1077
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,660
We used to have five.

1078
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,920
Actually, we had seven at one point, but we...

1079
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,400
I can't actually say.

1080
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:46,600
I know.

1081
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,460
It happened to two of them, and one broke.

1082
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,680
But we have four working ones.

1083
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,600
How many Disneylands are there now in the USA?

1084
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,680
Six or seven Disneyland now.

1085
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,700
Oh, that's...

1086
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,360
Disneyland.

1087
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,880
We're going to need at least two more of those nukes.

1088
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:10,200
And they're hard to get, because, you know, the Al-Qaeda...

1089
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,440
The Al-Qaeda and the ISILs have a lot more money to put into it,

1090
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,960
and the church of the subgeniuses.

1091
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,900
You know, we still only charge what we used to charge for membership,

1092
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,300
and ISIS is now a lot more expensive.

1093
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,240
The Al-Qaeda used to be only $30 a joint.

1094
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,020
How much are they charging, Stan?

1095
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,340
I believe the Second Amendment gives every American the right

1096
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,740
to have a nuclear missile silo in their backyard.

1097
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,420
I think that's...

1098
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,300
And libertarians say they want to privatize everything except the military.

1099
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:41,920
Well, come on.

1100
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,920
Why should I be paying taxes to defend you?

1101
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,500
No, man.

1102
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,020
If I want to be defended, I'll defend myself.

1103
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,940
Thank you very much.

1104
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,960
Corporations are the same as individuals.

1105
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,320
I mean, think of Scalia's pronouncements and that coming about.

1106
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,540
And does that mean that corporations have the Second Amendment?

1107
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,780
They have, number one, the freedom of...

1108
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,900
And governments are individuals now.

1109
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,760
They've ruled.

1110
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,220
Oh, no.

1111
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,300
Yeah, so governments can now have religious beliefs,

1112
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,100
just like corporations can't.

1113
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,740
So no more Planned Parenthood,

1114
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,180
or...

1115
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,020
birth control for anybody

1116
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,860
under the new government law.

1117
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,860
Since government can be an individual,

1118
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,760
and the individual has personal Christian beliefs, right?

1119
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,200
Then the government, obviously, the U.S.

1120
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,360
As they've been saying for a long time on talk radio,

1121
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,800
America was founded entirely by religious, not Christians.

1122
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,520
And it's written into the Constitution

1123
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
that you have to worship,

1124
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,460
one Christian God, obviously.

1125
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,160
Right?

1126
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,520
That's what they keep telling me.

1127
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,980
Yeah, I get some of that.

1128
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:54,400


1129
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,680
I haven't looked at the document myself,

1130
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,940
but I'll take the word for it,

1131
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,800
because, like, again,

1132
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,000
if somebody's on television or the radio,

1133
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,880
are they really going to just lie or be wrong?

1134
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,840
Give me a break.

1135
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,620
Only if it's the liberal media.

1136
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,620
Most scientists and stuff.

1137
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,720
Let's take another caller here real quick.

1138
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,880
What do scientists know?

1139
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,380
They keep changing their minds.

1140
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,620
That's what you said wrong.

1141
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,800
What the hell is sciences?

1142
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Let's take another caller here real quick.

1143
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,340
Hello, you're on the air.

1144
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,320
They don't even have to get a third degree about it.

1145
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,960
Hello, you're on the air.

1146
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,220
Hello.

1147
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Hello, you have a nuclear weapon for sale?

1148
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,380
You want nukes?

1149
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,040
I can get you nukes.

1150
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,160
Hello, Bob.

1151
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,140
I don't like to buy.

1152
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,620
No, we're trying to buy nuclear weapons.

1153
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:37,980
Oh, man.

1154
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,900
Like I said, I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy.

1155
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,100
I can get you nukes.

1156
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,360
Hey, I know a guy down on 57th and Superior.

1157
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:46,760
What's his name?

1158
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:46,760


1159
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:46,760


1160
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,320
Shell Station.

1161
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,960
He can sell you a nuke.

1162
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,060
Yeah?

1163
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,540
Oh, man.

1164
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,260
See, Stan, you never think of possibilities like that,

1165
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,000
like open street market warfare.

1166
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,380
You can buy plutonium at any corner drugstore nowadays.

1167
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,220
Yeah, man.

1168
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,840
Don't worry about having somebody spend a lot of money on you.

1169
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,800
Just go and talk to Frank.

1170
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,380
No, man.

1171
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,420
No, no, no.

1172
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,620
If things are more expensive, that means they're better.

1173
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,260
If you can get something cheap nearby from mom and pop store,

1174
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,600
that's not nearly as good as getting something from,

1175
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,480
that's more expensive from a bigger company like, you know, GovMart.

1176
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,020
Oh, yeah.

1177
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,400
Amazon charges you up the wazoo when they ship it.

1178
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,540
And they cut one of their breasts off so that they can fire Buzz Narrows better.

1179
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,380
It's crazy.

1180
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,840
What kind of business model is that?

1181
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,880
Next, they're going to use drones to deliver stuff.

1182
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,080
On drones.

1183
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,800
On drones.

1184
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,880
To deliver Amazon packages.

1185
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,900
They'll even cut the breasts off the drones.

1186
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,060
Yeah, there'd be so less.

1187
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,560
Well, there's no paperwork anyway,

1188
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,700
but there'd be so much less, you know, red tape, I guess.

1189
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,340
Well, and only one breast per Amazon.

1190
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,720
Such a waste.

1191
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,240
What do they do with them?

1192
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,020
These can have as many as five nowadays.

1193
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,360
They're bred right.

1194
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,080
If they're, you know, left under the right environmental conditions for long enough.

1195
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,480
But who'd want five breasts and three stumps for an arm anyway?

1196
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,580
What do they do?

1197
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,420
What do they do with the extra breast?

1198
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,980
Well, you would think that they would give them, you know,

1199
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,560
donate them to flat-breasted Slovenians or something,

1200
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,560
but I think there's some law that says they have to throw them away

1201
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,760
because they might get sued, you know, if one of them goes wrong.

1202
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,720
Supposed to make soap out of them or candles.

1203
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,300
That's why you have to throw away perfectly good food in the United States

1204
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,980
because it's not in the right box anymore.

1205
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,020
If you can't give it to the poor, can't sell it, it might be bruised.

1206
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,020
And then the poor person would sue you with their lawyers.

1207
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,120
All the contradictions, I swear.

1208
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,560
I just get confused.

1209
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,560
And they keep contradicting themselves more and more every daily.

1210
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,060
You know, I just think of the Iraqis and the Iranians

1211
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,840
fighting the Slovakians in 1292

1212
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,740
when the Crusaders first invaded Europe.

1213
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,260
It goes all the way back to that.

1214
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,200
And what's the difference between Iraq?

1215
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:16,740
And Iran.

1216
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,360
And Kiev.

1217
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,880
Bring back the Ottoman Empire.

1218
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,400
Seriously.

1219
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,800
The Ottomans were great philosophers.

1220
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,780
I guess Patti LaRouche and Francoise Truffaut.

1221
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,600
No, those are French names.

1222
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,620
What's Solzhenitsyn and Seljman Oligarchs?

1223
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,080
You know what I don't understand?

1224
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,340
Why did they wait until after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire?

1225
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,500
Why did they wait?

1226
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,360
Why did they wait until after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire

1227
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,220
to change the capital city name to Istanbul?

1228
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,820
You'd think that they would have done that

1229
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,900
like right after they took over Constantinople.

1230
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,300
Since it was named after like a Christian saint, emperor, you know.

1231
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,220
You'd think they would have changed the name as soon as they took over.

1232
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,180
He changed the reincarnation.

1233
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,700
He shot of Christianity so he could have a military empire.

1234
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,580
That's a well-known fact among people who think a lot of stuff like that.

1235
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,560
They changed the name of St. Petersburg.

1236
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,940
Well, they had to be.

1237
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,780
For political reasons.

1238
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:23,700
Yeah.

1239
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,240
It wasn't PC.

1240
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,400
You know, because PC, that's what's destroying America.

1241
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,540
That means global warming, right?

1242
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,280
PC is destroying America.

1243
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,580
I get confused.

1244
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:37,980
Destroy America?

1245
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,340
No.

1246
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,000
The Peace Corps.

1247
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,860
Talking politically correct.

1248
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,080
You know, like talking about global warming

1249
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,180
as if it was real.

1250
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,740
That's not PC.

1251
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,460
So you're not supposed to talk that way.

1252
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,140
Well, it's certainly not.

1253
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,240
That's what was destroying America was PC talk.

1254
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,420
Mm-hmm.

1255
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:04,800
If you talk about diversity, that's not PC.

1256
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,180
Unless you're a diversionist.

1257
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,320
Most people don't want to do anything but sit around and loaf and put their feet on the wall.

1258
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,000
Right. They want diversions. Sure.

1259
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,140
That's cool.

1260
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,200
Diversion.

1261
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,620
Cakes.

1262
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,780
Yeah.

1263
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,020
They're different snacks you get at the fair sometimes if there is such a thing.

1264
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,620
We hate humanses.

1265
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,080
We hate humanses.

1266
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,000
We hate demonkeeps.

1267
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,460
We love demonkeeps, don't we?

1268
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,160
Well, I have a Christmas wish.

1269
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:31,840
All right.

1270
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,740
My wish for Christmas is that No Money Mark becomes way too much Money Mark and has to

1271
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,700
give it away to charities like me.

1272
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,440
Well, yeah, I would give away most of it.

1273
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,400
Yeah, if you get rich, you should give all the other callers to this show, especially

1274
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:59,940
Dr. Sinister, one tithing amount of 10% of your annual salary to be deferred in increments

1275
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,440
of 26 and 32.

1276
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,680
Can I just go to his table?

1277
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,980
I have something.

1278
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,860
I have something important to you.

1279
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,360
Go ahead.

1280
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,280
Go ahead.

1281
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,580
Go ahead.

1282
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,100
No, no.

1283
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,660
I insist.

1284
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,120
After you.

1285
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,420
I have something.

1286
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:14,420


1287
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:14,960
I would give you.

1288
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,840
You know why?

1289
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,420
You know why?

1290
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,180
You know why nice guys finish last?

1291
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,620
Why?

1292
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,720
Because they're always saying, after you.

1293
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:32,200
Anyway, I was talking earlier about the Oracle, the magic eight ball Bob that's on the internet,

1294
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,100
and I found it.

1295
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,780
It's still there.

1296
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,480
I Googled Bob Dobbs, the resort.

1297
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:44,400
But if you Google Bob Dobbs, the ultimate Oracle or head of Bob, the ultimate Oracle,

1298
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,280
you'll find it.

1299
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:51,920
And I asked it is Dr. Sinister and it said yes, definitely.

1300
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,940
Is Dr. Sinister and it said yes, definitely.

1301
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,800
I'm asking it should I change the dial and it says yes.

1302
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,720
You should have taken the Oracle's advice several minutes ago.

1303
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,420
No, I just now asked it and it said I should change the dial.

1304
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,240
Oh, hey, hey, don't touch it.

1305
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,540
I'm coming.

1306
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,380
Hey, don't touch it.

1307
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:14,840
Don't touch that dial.

1308
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,760
We got a big steaming pile of crap coming down the pike for you.

1309
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,920
You don't want to miss crap radio, do you?

1310
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,040
Oh, no.

1311
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,100
Of course not.

1312
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,780
I'm coming, Red.

1313
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,260
I'll get that.

1314
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,700
That's why you've got to stay tuned.

1315
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,540
Gentlemen, I want to thank you for your calls tonight.

1316
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:35,600
Nominee Mark, Reverend Stang, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and I hope I will keep in touch with

1317
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,160
all of you and we'll talk to you next week.

1318
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,380
Merry Xmas.

1319
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1320
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,280
Merry Xmas.

1321
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,960
And don't forget, all right?

1322
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,200
The Xmas is not the same as X Day.

1323
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,200
It's not the same thing, all right?

1324
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:57,960
And the reason they call it Christmas is because the angel came down and announced to the Virgin

1325
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:06,800
Mary that she was carrying the Savior of mankind, the Messiah, or the Christ, all right?

1326
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,960
But they knew that she hadn't been with a man.

1327
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,060
They knew she was a virgin.

1328
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,540
So how could she be pregnant?

1329
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,620
It was cancer.

1330
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:16,980
It was cancer.

1331
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,260
It was the Christ mass growing in her abdomen.

1332
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,800
And that is where the term Christmas came from.

1333
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,520
We also knew that he was the Messiah because he was actually born circumcised.

1334
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,340
We know this, too.

1335
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,180
It is written.

1336
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,380
How else?

1337
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,060
How else could you know?

1338
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,860
And how could you try and cut anything off a perfect man?

1339
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,480
Anyway, right?

1340
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:48,600
Thank you, Dr. Sinister, for letting us use three of your shows from WCSB.

1341
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:57,020
Thank you, The Fantastic Plastics, for that song, Time to Assimilate, that we heard earlier.

1342
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,860
The Fantastic Plastics.

1343
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:08,080
And thank you, Reverend Chris Blatter, also known as Cool Hand Chris, for all of the collages

1344
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,140
used in tonight's show.

1345
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,540
Praise Bob.

1346
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:18,980

Praise Bob.

1351
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:51,300
Friends, now for you listening only by internet, not by broadcast radio where this would be

1352
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:51,560
illegal.

1353
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:59,000
We're going to play one of our favorite cuts by the great Rudy Ray Moore from his album,

1354
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,520
Dolomite for President.

1355
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,100
Now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Dolomite for President podcast.

1356
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:15,200
It's my pleasure to bring to you somebody that's for the real people, the down people,

1357
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,700
the whores, the pimps, the man that's going to do the best he can, the man, Dolomite.

1358
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:37,540
Thank you, brothers and sisters of the Fast Freedom fucking party for nominating me, Dolomite,

1359
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,360
for your president.

1360
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,360
I'm not going to lie to you like the rest of those motherfuckers.

1361
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,740
I'm not promising you a chicken in every pot.

1362
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,840
I'm not coming to you with no heavy heart.

1363
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,720
I'm not promising to make every motherfucking thing perfectly clear.

1364
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,060
I'm not promising you a goddamn thing.

1365
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:08,340
But if I am elected, I promise to legalize prostitution.

1366
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:08,340


1367
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,100
Legalize marijuana.

1368
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,720
Legalize stealing.

1369
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:23,360
And any other motherfucking thing you want to do.

1370
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:30,140
I'm going to bring this motherfucker up or all the way down.

1371
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,400
You heard me and you heard me right.

1372
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,320
I'm going to be running this country as president.

1373
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,680
Dolomite.

1374
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,080
You can bet your sweet head I'm going to legalize crime.

1375
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:55,140
Yes, I'll have a constitution to legalize prostitution.

1376
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,200
To all whores, sell your pussy.

1377
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,200
If it's bad pussy, sell it.

1378
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,340
If it's good pussy, sell it.

1379
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,300
If it's just a little shit, sell it.

1380
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:08,300


1381
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,220
If it's juicy pussy, sell it.

1382
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,040
If it's skinny pussy, sell it.

1383
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:17,240
If it's dry pussy, wet that motherfucking celly.

1384
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,840
And I'm going to tell you fellas, sell your dicks.

1385
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,640
If you can't sell them, leave them hanging.

1386
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,320
If it's a big dick, sell it.

1387
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,660
If it's a little dick, sell it.

1388
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,200
If it's a knob, sell it.

1389
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,560
Even if you got one of them chitlin' dicks,

1390
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,780
beat that motherfuckin', try to get it hard enough to sell.

1391
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,000
The reason why I tell you fellas to sell,

1392
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:51,240
cause if you hump free, you are going to get musky.

1393
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,320
Can you dig it?

1394
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,640
And I would not lie to you baby.

1395
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,140
Yes, whores won't pay no tax.

1396
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,820
I'm going to take that shit off their backs.

1397
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,540
I'm going to see that all of you,

1398
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,880
all pimps and preys, have two brand new Cadillacs.

1399
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,440
So vote for me and set the back man free.

1400
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,840
Yes baby, when we take over, we're not going to get rid of all whites.

1401
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,900
We'll need workers, baby.

1402
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,480
We'll need somebody to harvest the watermelons and clean the chitlins.

1403
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,100
I would not lie to you.

1404
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:36,540
Now that shit about bussin' has got everybody cussin'.

1405
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,980
I'm damn near ready to bite.

1406
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,520
I want an education for the whole goddamn nature.

1407
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,900
And especially sex education at night.

1408
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,520
Can you dig it?

1409
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,320
Just to keep the shit straight,

1410
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,260
I'd like to tell you about my opposing candidate.

1411
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,860
Dick Agnew.

1412
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,100
Sounds just like shit.

1413
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,320
I don't know whether to vomit or shit.

1414
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,640
Dick Agnew sounds like a bad disease.

1415
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,280
Both of them motherfuckers together will knock you dead on your knees.

1416
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,760
A young man went to the doctor just the other day,

1417
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,500
and the doctor said,

1418
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,080
young man, for your case, there's nothing I can do.

1419
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,920
Because baby, you got a bad case of that motherfuckin' disease

1420
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,720
called a Dick Agnew.

1421
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,360
Now you take McGovern.

1422
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,740
Promises, promises, promises.

1423
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,660
Promisin' poor people one thousand dollars.

1424
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,200
He must think that we are goddamn fools.

1425
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:48,040
We still waitin' for that forty acres and that motherfuckin' meal.

1426
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,480
McGovern, I'd like to put my foot in his ass.

1427
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,480
And let him suffer from constipation

1428
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,720
while I tell him about all them jive-ass promises that they made in the past.

1429
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,980
Sister Chisholm,

1430
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,740
if that's a lady with a lot of clout,

1431
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,440
I'm gonna get her to teach me for downright real politics

1432
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,200
so I can tell all them jive motherfuckers to kiss my black ass.

1433
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,900
The old, neat-headed hump.

1434
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,740
Dear, dear hump,

1435
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,020
you always ready to run.

1436
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:31,780
All right.

1437
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:36,760
You must be a tired, disgusted, old, molded,

1438
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,120
ancient, decrepit, rheumatism-toting motherfucker.

1439
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Cause you ain't never one.

1440
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,040
I'm gonna give you a map to the shithouse.

1441
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,860
Dress you up in a pair of red lace-trimmed drawers.

1442
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,340
And put some shit paper in your hand.

1443
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,900
Cause you're gonna have the running shit

1444
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,420
when you find out

1445
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,120
that I've been elected the mayor.

1446
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,040
I'm gonna get my satisfaction.

1447
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,960
I'm gonna give this country some action.

1448
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,660
I'm cutting off old Agnew's trip.

1449
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,380
I'm gonna button up his lips.

1450
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,200
Kick him in the ass.

1451
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,820
And give him a night job pumping gas.

1452
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,640
I'm gonna get down with the cabinet.

1453
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,760
And fact about it, I'm goddamn mad enough to fight.

1454
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,920
The first thing I got to do for my black ass

1455
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,540
is straighten out the civil rights.

1456
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,100
The new civil rights bill is gonna be down and funky.

1457
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,260
It'll open up more doors for pimps and whores.

1458
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,120
And find a permanent cure for all junkies.

1459
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,480
The next thing I'm gonna do,

1460
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,900
I'm gonna move on my first act.

1461
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:07,560
I'm gonna get me two thousand raggedy ass painters

1462
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,440
to paint the motherfucking White House black.

1463
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,020
Sire, there is no more money.

1464
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,460
We gotta get some money.

1465
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,100
Black dirty purges,

1466
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:23,560
hark back,

1467
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,720
black and wharton,

1468
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:25,740
philip muck and burton,

1469
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,620
perkaluma,

1470
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,000
burton,

1471
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:27,380
dutch,

1472
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:27,820
musk,

1473
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:28,120
metal.

1474
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,760
B-O-B.

1475
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,200
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1476
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:39,540
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1477
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,620
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1478
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,100
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1479
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,100
But if you truly love Bob,

1480
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,660
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1481
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,600
you should go to subgenius.com,

1482
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,680
front page,

1483
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,160
or especially the radio page,

1484
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,140
or the catalog store pages,

1485
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,460
and help out financially as best you can.

1486
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,840
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1487
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,460
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1488
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,440
But some of you still have jobs.

1489
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,780
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1490
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,820
even if it's only once a month,

1491
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,320
from enough of you.

1492
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,740
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1493
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:23,960
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,060
All we're saying is that

1495
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,460
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1496
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,520
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1497
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,140
We also take checks and money orders to

1498
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,980
