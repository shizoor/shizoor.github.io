1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:10,860
I'm proud of you Bob. Wedge was a great guy Connie. Yes he was. What are you trying to say?

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,440
I'm doing a very bad job of saying I love this.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,260
This is genius. Powerful.

4
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,680
That's right. That's right. It is sure to spread quickly. That's right. That's right. Right.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,020
From PR News in Washington I'm capable of conducting search and rescue missions

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,940
also transporting boats in Wilmington North Carolina. This city uh the the city uh and uh

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,140
so um so um uh still here.

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,020
President Trump's. Oh I think everybody's happy.

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,860
President Trump's sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,060
100% happy.

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,560
The Trumps is accused of being a serial killer.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,440
Investigators say Trump has confessed to killing four women

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,900
to set up a militarized Turkey near the U.S. Mexico border.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,740
Turkey often collide.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,540
The Dow is 93-92-2662-114-2662.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,120
In other news you're listening to...

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,000
PR News.

18
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,900
There's a fellow down in Texas

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,460
They say his name is Bob

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,460
He tells me I should slap God

21
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,540
I should quit my job

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,920
Well, I'm a simple genius

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,820
And I must have my slack

24
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,100
If I don't live forever

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,320
I get my money back

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,780
They said that on July 5th of 1998

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
The earth would be destruction

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,900
Suffering death

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,800
Deadly fate

30
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,200
That day was long away

31
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,420
Now it has come and gone

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,700
There was no fire from heaven

33
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,280
And this old world rolls on

34
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,280
Well, I'm a simple genius

35
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,520
And I must have my slack

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,900
If I don't live forever

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,760
I get my money back

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,040
Poor Stang was made to suffer

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,860
A terrible disgrace

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,000
Of such humiliation

41
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,720
He feared to show his face

42
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,580
Now Bob may be laughin'

43
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,900
But he's a man of his word

44
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,900


45
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,900


46
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,900


47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,900


48
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,900


49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Because we are such chumps

50
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,620
But there is no reason

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,600
To be down in the dumps

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,660
It'll all still happen

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,940
No need to curse or frown

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,460
They got all the right numbers

55
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,420
Just got them upside down

56
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,540
Well, I'm a simple genius

57
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,840
And I must have my slack

58
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,240
If I don't live forever

59
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,820
I get my money back

60
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,900
So welcome to the subgenius devotional hour, here

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,220
Hum

62
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,180
Before the normal scary time

63
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,120
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,440
Despite my ministers body

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,040
And his thick dumb

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,220
That was a stinkle

67
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,120
But it had lots of prophecy involved

68
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm a man of few words

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,980
You hear it right here

70
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,140
You aren't quick as shit

71
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,160
You're wanna quit and shit

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,340
You'll get it from me

73
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,120
In lots of few words

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,280
Good

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,860
And I suggest you get started

76
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,180
I wonder why Fido came home

77
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,960
With his wazoo missing

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
Or wonder why those beefs

79
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Like Buster and Duval

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,480
And the parlor

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,060
And the pasture

82
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,100
Are lyin' out there

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,700
With their throats

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,680
And half their rectums missing

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Well, it's because of those Exists

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,380
who came down to this earth one Christmas day many millennia ago to forge a new link.

87
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,640
One might call it a hot link between the aliens and man,

88
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,780
a giant sausage of knowledge from the center of the universe, the galactic center.

89
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,680
Those little tykes will be able to carry on for us.

90
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,880
Every one of those little kids is a potential Lee Majors,

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
and I hope you're pleased with what we've done.

92
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,380
The rising generations shall have reason to praise us,

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,840
to pour out libations on our smoking altars,

94
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,000
and we shall know this is a non-smoking section.

95
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,460
The book of the subgenius, Lunatic Prophecies for the Coming Weird Times,

96
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,620
out now and on your stand.

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,640
If you don't see the book on your stand,

98
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,080
complain, loudly agitate, and tell the store if necessary.

99
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,440
They are crazy.

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,520
It's a question of bulldada.

101
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,420
And its application, of course, in the society surrounding the bulldada.

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,600
We apply it from a little disposable tube.

103
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,320
That's right, using the power shell and using the spirit code,

104
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,720
the Yakut.

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
The diesel matrix applies the bulldada to the normals and pinks.

106
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,840
And you know, some people get worried about that violent sounding part of it.

107
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,480
But you know, as Dr. Legume said,

108
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,220
to make an omelet, you gotta break a few eggs.

109
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,380
Well, to make the kind of omelet that Bob Dobbs is making,

110
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,260
it's gonna take a hell of a lot of scrambled brains on drugs, my friends.

111
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,940
And many of you have probably heard of the New Age theory about the 100th monkey.

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,980
They never mentioned the 100th Manson.

113
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,620
They never mentioned the 100th Legume.

114
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,120
They never mentioned the 100th Bob.

115
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,360
Because friends, when you release your inner child,

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
sooner or later, your inner Charlie Manson is gonna want out too.

117
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,660
And we are composed of many selves, and it's a good idea,

118
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,300
not to take any of yourselves too seriously.

119
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,000
But seriously, there is a solution.

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,180
And that solution is, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

121
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,620
Ah, yes.

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,920
And you'd think that would be enough, friends.

123
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,540
But the conspiracy has this secret weapon,

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,220
that invisible monster that lives up in the sky.

125
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,480
87% of Americans believe in that invisible monster

126
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,440
that'll kick their enemy's asses if they kiss its ass enough.

127
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,980
And yet,

128
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,140
their so-called God is so pathetically weak

129
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,660
that apparently it has to be defended by illiterate little old ladies against assholes like me.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,760
What kind of a pussy-ass God is that?

131
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,080
Seems like he'd be able to kick my ass himself.

132
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,260
That's why we do say, we still say,

133
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,620
WAR ON GOD, dear friends!

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,540
War on any God that's worried about us making war on him.

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,400
Ah, yes.

136
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,580
Friends, we're just like any other religion.

137
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,620
It's not that we love Bob all that much,

138
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,020
it's that we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell.

139
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,340
And we don't need any reason to hate them,

140
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,540
beyond the very simple fact that we've got Bob and they don't.

141
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,680
That's enough.

142
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,640
Fuck them even if they can't just tell a joke.

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,800
Bob?

144
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,620
I wish I could think.

145
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,680
Bob?

146
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,400
They obviously watch television.

147
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,080
Bob?

148
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,440
Bob?

149
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,480
Uh, who is Bob Dobbs, right?

150
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,420
Bob Dobbs, who, uh...

151
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,020
Professor Dobbs, can you hear me?

152
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,280
Yeah.

153
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,100
Do you have a bathroom problem in your house?

154
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,160
It's a very busy place, isn't it?

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Where everyone in the family has to brush their teeth, wash their hands, take a shit.

156
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,640
Listen to this, sis.

157
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,940
She said, don't tell me lies and try to please me.

158
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,780
I've heard it all so many times before.

159
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,960
And I tell you, I'm not gonna lie to you.

160
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,520
You're fucking a fucking liar.

161
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,940
You're fucking a fucking liar.

162
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,100
I'm gonna kill you.

163
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,100


164
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,100


165
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,100


166
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,700
Bob.

167
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,240


168
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,360
Bob.

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,480
Bob.

170
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,240
Well, sirs and sir-mams, uh, all those insane-sounding collages of bull-dada, including

171
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,100
the news and the ones that'll end the show, come from the great Fernandanande Leamer.

172
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,460
The ranting about the war on God there was me and Einstein's secret orchestra in the

173
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,940
pufferfish's own private lab.

174
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:16,260
Dome at Starwood Festival from apparently 19 years ago. Jeepers. The puzzling evidence clip

175
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:25,840
with Dr. Howell talking about the hot link of X-Day was even older, 1980s. And that song,

176
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:34,200
There's a Feller Down in Texas, was the great Orton Nenslow, recorded at a big devival either

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:43,940
in Portland or Seattle in the 1990s. But now, if he's home, let's call lonesome cowboy Dave.

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:54,540
He's still not home. Hello, Smiley. Oh, how are you? Smiley. Smiley, you've lost your wits.

179
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,660
You're in a pants or something. What happened to your nose? Oh, I just had my hair done. That's all.

180
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,020
That just makes everything look different. I like your nose hairs better with the fronds.

181
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,420
I got a nose cut, yeah. Yeah. No, the fronds were getting in the way. They were like

182
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,360
catching food before my mustache did, you know? Yeah, but you could pass that off as a humongous

183
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,660
mastodon or a piece of

184
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:25,820
person.

185
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:35,100
No, nobody would believe that. I could pass it off as eyebrows, except they're coming out of my

186
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:43,140
nostrils instead of the top of my eyes. That's ridiculous, Dave. Well, of course, at least it's

187
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,080
ridiculous, you know, rather than preemptive or pejorative. Sometimes it just smells too bad,

188
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,980
you know? Wouldn't want it to be preemptive. No, or pejorative.

189
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,960
Well, that's okay. We do that all the time. Yeah, we do. We get no credit for it neither,

190
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,800
neither, either. Hey, I've got great news for you here. I was looking in my...

191
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,720
The baboons have returned. No, not yet, but the internet could be destroyed any second.

192
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:23,540
No, seriously. Headline, massive solar storm threat. Scientists have discovered evidence of a

193
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,820
gigantic solar storm that shatters the atmosphere.

194
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,560
That's

195
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,460
The

196
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:55,800
Power Grease.

197
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,420
and electrical devices,

198
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,000
it would be like Snake Plissken pushing that button.

199
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,020
Yeah, they always talk about Snake Plissken

200
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,260
pushing his belly button.

201
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,200
That's a reference to a 1990s movie.

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,040
Movie.

203
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,560
Yeah, it's a movie.

204
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,180
A pop culture thing.

205
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,060
Escape from L.A. specifically.

206
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,740
Escape from L.A. was the sequel to Escape from New York.

207
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
New York, yeah, from your New York.

208
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,680
But it had, you know, come think of it, Dave, Bob,

209
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,040
that movie had kind of a Bob in it.

210
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,020
There was a Dr. Dobbs who was a plastic surgeon

211
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,240
in the future L.A. played by Bruce Campbell,

212
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,660
who's, you know, already looks kind of inhuman

213
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,720
with that jawbone.

214
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,160
To begin with, yeah.

215
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,900
Yeah, and he was playing a character named Dobbs,

216
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,280
and I happen to know for sure

217
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,820
that the director, John Carpenter,

218
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,920
was turned on to Bob long ago

219
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,460
if by no one else than my friend,

220
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,740
Reverend Nancy Regalia,

221
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,300
or Nancy Collins, the horror writer.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,020
Oh, that's great.

223
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,140
At least, you know, there's something you can count on

224
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,540
that you know that that happened.

225
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,160
Well, yeah, I don't know that they...

226
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
They really could be put in jail,

227
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,740
but Ninth Circuit Court gets a hold of some of the

228
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,220
mastodon parts again,

229
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,120
and talk about mastodons again, but...

230
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm not going to sue 20th Century Fox,

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,620
but here's some news about the mastodons.

232
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,560
Some Japanese scientists have awakened, sort of,

233
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,720
they've sort of awakened cells

234
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,640
from a 28,000-year-old mammoth carcass.

235
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,300
You know, they're trying to make new mammoths,

236
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,380
using elephants.

237
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,800
Yeah, I don't know why they're doing that.

238
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,700
Why not? Because it's there.

239
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,180
Because it's there.

240
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,260
In fact, it's like, let's take some Neanderthal DNA

241
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,700
and plug it in to see if we can start

242
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,580
a new race of humans next year.

243
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,940
I've had such pornographic dreams

244
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,720
about that very subject, Dave.

245
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,140
I have a little...

246
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,600
In the back of my head,

247
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,440
there's this dramatic teen movie

248
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,380
about the...

249
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,240
the Neanderthal teenager,

250
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,740
the world's first,

251
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,920
since 40,000 years ago or whatever,

252
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,040
and she's in high school,

253
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,000
and they're trying to see if she can pass

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,900
as a human,

255
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,020
which she is.

256
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,740
You know, Neanderthals were

257
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,920
technically human,

258
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,280
but very different from their African ancestors.

259
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,820
And hence...

260
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,340
See, that's what...

261
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,140
Like the Pathfinder was saying, too,

262
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,660
and I found that, you know,

263
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,560
if you leave your underwear,

264
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,600
let's say, like, you washed your underwear, right?

265
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,140
Right.

266
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
And that's the first...

267
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,940
That's a big F.

268
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,260
Towards a brand-new glorious day,

269
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,240
you're going to, you know,

270
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,340
start to wake up yourself

271
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,260
and become kind of like a new human race,

272
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,100
you know, infused with all the literal garbage

273
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,560
and sanctimonious BS of before,

274
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,380
only different this time

275
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,700
because it's different this time

276
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,160
because it's different, you know?

277
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,660
And I just get out there and say,

278
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,480
fight the public.

279
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,900
Fight the public?

280
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:25,940
Yeah.

281
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,920
Oh.

282
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,000
They don't have enough teeth to bite back.

283
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,560
There's nothing you got to worry about.

284
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,220
You can give them a kick

285
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,400
like you kick an old chihuahua.

286
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,440
The ones with more Neanderthal DNA,

287
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,060
they've got some pretty big jaws.

288
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,660
Bones.

289
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,500
Yeah.

290
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,540
They got some thick bone...

291
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,140
They're like bulldogs of humanity.

292
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,660
And they make huge, huge tents

293
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,860
with mastodon skin.

294
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,420
If you got far enough to make huge, huge tents,

295
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,480
out of mastodon skin,

296
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,100
why would you want to become

297
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,760
the world's third largest radion importer

298
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,160
and nuclear power?

299
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,080
Unless you had a nucleus to start with.

300
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,960
Well, because why not?

301
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,200
Yeah.

302
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,160
Yeah, it's the old...

303
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,120
Because it's there.

304
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,240
Because why not?

305
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,780
Because humans do that kind of messed up stuff

306
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,880
and cover Mount Everest

307
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,140
with frozen human excrement.

308
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,360
In vast, huge piles.

309
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,760
And quite a few dead bodies.

310
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,520
So there you go.

311
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,360
That there's...

312
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,420
You know, the...

313
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,900
For every mastodon

314
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,020
that's dug up out of the melting

315
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,060
Arctic ice,

316
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,280
there's going to be another human

317
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,760
mountain climber

318
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,280
frozen on Mount Everest.

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,940
For later people to discover

320
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,760
in about...

321
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,500
20 years when all that ice melts.

322
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,440
Even at the top of Mount Everest.

323
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,760
And we get that...

324
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,920
What was that movie

325
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,300
where the whole world was covered with the ocean?

326
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,460
Was it a takeoff

327
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,320
of the J.G. Ballard ground world?

328
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,140
Oh, no.

329
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,940
There's been tons of them since then.

330
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,520
It was that Kevin Costner movie

331
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,560
that bombed.

332
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,820
But I loved it.

333
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,960
But I can't remember the title of it

334
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,820
for some reason.

335
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,980
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

336
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,440
Loving a movie the same way

337
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,940
somebody would carnally love a blissful woman?

338
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,200
Well, the reason I can't remember

339
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,460
might be revealed

340
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,660
by a retina scan

341
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,480
that can identify Alzheimer's disease

342
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,860
years before symptoms appear?

343
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,600
What?

344
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,020
I hadn't read this.

345
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,520
It looks like a little duck.

346
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,060
A little teeny tiny, like about

347
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,120
some size duck.

348
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,680
You just put it up to whatever eye is bothering you

349
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,440
and it screams,

350
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,580
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

351
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,660
Like that, you know?

352
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,360
No, it's more like if they look through their scope

353
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,600
and they see the little duck in your eye,

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,460
then that means you're gonna

355
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,760
you're gonna have the old

356
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,780
you're gonna be getting the Alzheimer's

357
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,480
sooner or later.

358
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,680
Oh, I...

359
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,160
You won't know the difference

360
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
whether it was sooner or later.

361
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,920
Yeah.

362
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,160
Thank God for that part.

363
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank Dobbs.

364
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,820
Yeah.

365
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,760
For that part.

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Yeah, so they have a warning test

367
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
for Alzheimer's.

368
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,900
But they don't have one for

369
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,460
normality or subgeniusness.

370
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
There's no genetic test.

371
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,300
You can abort your baby

372
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,920
before it's born if it's

373
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
not the right species.

374
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,340
You know, if only.

375
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,360
Well, that's exciting.

376
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,260
Well, think about it.

377
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Say your

378
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,740
granddaughter

379
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,140
got pregnant and she could

380
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,820
get a blood test that said

381
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,040
whether the baby was gonna be

382
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,140
a human or

383
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,960
a human.

384
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,480
Like pure human or part subgenius

385
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,200
or a lot of subgenius or

386
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,700
subgenius Neanderthal or what.

387
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,520
And then she could

388
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,360
you know, go to the

389
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,120
abortion mall that the

390
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,640
right-wingers email each other about

391
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,120
and get the human

392
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,900
aborted or the subgenius

393
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,540
depending on where she was coming from.

394
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah.

395
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,940
You know, philosophically.

396
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,140
Yeah.

397
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,960
I know a lot of subgenius parents

398
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,000
whose kids, they don't want to have

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
a subgenius.

400
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,060
They don't want to be subgeniuses.

401
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
They wish they hadn't been raised

402
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,580
by subgeniuses.

403
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,740
Then of course, there's others that are

404
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,380
like the most

405
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,380
beloved and devout

406
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,860
hard workers for dogs.

407
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,040
Yeah.

408
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,240
Like me.

409
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah.

410
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,920
I can all I can do is concurred

411
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,160
monitors.

412
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,660
It's just a spasmodic release

413
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,360
valve once in a while that I have to

414
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,980
take care of.

415
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
But I believe you me.

416
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,420
Believe you me.

417
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,300
You know.

418
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,960
Well, you know, I'm not sure.

419
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:51,960


420
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
Even at our age, we got to release

421
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,140
those valves.

422
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,480
We've got to we got to open up the

423
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,180
main steam stop valve and just let

424
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,340
that steam go out or whatever.

425
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,480
Whatever.

426
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,860
Gas like a gorilla, you know, fluid.

427
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,460
Yeah.

428
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,560
Something you got to empty the flu

429
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,960
nads or the poison builds up, you know.

430
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,060
Yeah.

431
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,660
Mine doesn't build up anywhere near

432
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,320
as fast as it used to.

433
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,280
Oh, God.

434
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,360
That's such a relief.

435
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,900
Well, you're taking on less poison.

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,320
And that's why your release mode is

437
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,060
is going back to the original model

438
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,780
like the sunshine.

439
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,040
Remember the sunshine model that for

440
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,500
a whole year?

441
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,060
I don't know who was Chrysler or

442
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,120
Mount Bank Intelligence Services or

443
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,580
somebody.

444
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,380
I don't remember.

445
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,860
Well, I don't remember either.

446
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,740
Might not have happened.

447
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,620
Might just have been another

448
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,820
hallucination because they're

449
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,440
becoming more frequent now.

450
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,540
And we use the last like what?

451
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,640
More frequent.

452
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,960
Oh, yeah.

453
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,520
You're you got to be kidding.

454
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,440
How could they possibly be more

455
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,540
frequent than they were?

456
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,480
Well, they're almost like one right

457
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,060
after another.

458
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,940
Dave, I've got news for you.

459
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,180
It's been like that for you.

460
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,600
I think since practically since I met

461
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,620
you and that was in the early 1990s.

462
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,080
Yeah, it's been one reality after another.

463
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,900
It's like sneak like constant sneezes.

464
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,020
It's like spaghetti.

465
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,000
It's like spaghetti.

466
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,820
Yeah.

467
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,660
That's exactly like spaghetti.

468
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,260
You want to talk about nailed it.

469
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,060
Yeah.

470
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,620
Edible string theory.

471
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,780
You know, jiggling spaghetti is not

472
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,000
just spaghetti sitting there in a big

473
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,520
mess.

474
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,160
It's vibrating and jiggling.

475
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,760
Yep.

476
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,040
High.

477
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,540
Everyone.

478
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,600
Yep.

479
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,180
Yeah.

480
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,780
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,180
Didn't mean to get, you know, step

482
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,520
on your feet there, but it was the

483
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,420
only thing I could see.

484
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,080
That wasn't my feet, man.

485
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,700
That was my.

486
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,940
Uh, Tom, but that's okay.

487
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,260
Well, I'm not ready for a tongue

488
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,600
lesson.

489
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,200
Believe me.

490
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,140
Um, I'm know what I'm staying for and

491
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,240
what I believe in and, and, and, and

492
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,200
what is it?

493
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,700
Oh yeah.

494
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,160
Praise Bob.

495
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,380
That's all you have to remember.

496
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:06,740
Praise Bob.

497
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,920
And, and, and the hate the conspiracy

498
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,900
and, uh, and get slack.

499
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,480
That's it.

500
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,580
Those three things.

501
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,680
You've seen those pictures on the

502
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,280
internet of Trump's father wearing the

503
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,880
clan uniform.

504
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,440
Yeah.

505
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,080
Yeah.

506
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,660
Those are kind of silly.

507
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,140
I was gonna.

508
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,440
I was gonna photo.

509
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,740
I was gonna Photoshop his face on that.

510
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,780
You know, you're not realized somebody

511
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,320
already did it a thousand years ago.

512
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:27,440
Okay.

513
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,220
If you thought of it,

514
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
over the first master Don's right.

515
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,060
Yeah.

516
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,940
If you thought of it, somebody Photoshop

517
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,740
that Trump had on that photo back in the

518
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,380
stone age, besides since when do you know

519
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,580
how to work Photoshop?

520
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,200
Well, just as poorly as I know how to use

521
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
InDesign and a bunch of other things that

522
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,120
I managed to get a C in it so I could pass.

523
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,200
But if you ask me what these mean next week,

524
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,440
I will have no idea.

525
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,280
Yeah.

526
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah.

527
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah.

528
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,120


529
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,840
Yeah.

530
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm, I'm starting to lose it.

531
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,280
Dave.

532
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,120
I went to download illegal software off of use

533
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,540
nap and I couldn't find it.

534
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,740
It wasn't there or it was coded in a way that I

535
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,100
couldn't, I could no longer translate.

536
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,520
And, uh, I just realized I'm so old now.

537
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:19,880
Yeah.

538
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah.

539
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,520
Yeah.

540
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


541
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


542
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


543
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


544
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


545
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


546
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


547
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


548
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


549
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


550
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,520


551
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm just going to have to buy the update

552
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,360
like a normal person.

553
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,060
I just seemed so unnatural to me after 30

554
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,500
years of thinking you can buy software.

555
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,960
I thought it just all came from that big

556
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,920
spigot called usenet, but no, no, that's a,

557
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,660
they're going to abolish usenet.

558
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,680
No, it's still there, but they've had to lay

559
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,400
so many layers of.

560
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,380
Code and, uh, you know, I don't know.

561
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,240
It's, it's way more complicated than it used to

562
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,280
be in order to be able to do it at all and stay

563
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,760
under the conspiracies, right?

564
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Are it's a complicated story, Dave.

565
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
You don't want to read it.

566
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,620
Um, and Neil Stevenson hasn't written it yet, but

567
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,140
he probably, well, he probably has, we just haven't

568
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,640
seen it.

569
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,180
Yeah.

570
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

571
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


572
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


573
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


574
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


575
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


576
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


577
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


578
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


579
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


580
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


581
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


582
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


583
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


584
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


585
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


586
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


587
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


588
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


589
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


590
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


591
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


592
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


593
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


594
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


595
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


596
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,520


597
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,660
And we thought of Neil Stevenson already did a killer

598
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,760
novel about, I'm so jealous of that guy.

599
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,060
I want to cut his fingers off so he can't type or

600
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,880
write a cursive, which is how he actually wrote the

601
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,480
entire Baroque cycle with a goose quill pen on parchment

602
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,300
paper, because that's how they wrote in the period he

603
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
was writing about.

604
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,880
That's what he says.

605
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,340
Anyway,

606
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
he, that's like a form of insanity.

607
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,280
Right?

608
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,640
Some people find that to be a path to truth.

609
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,140
When in actuality, it's a path to frozen teeth.

610
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,820
Bob, actually, actually, Dave, now, come on.

611
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,960
When you get ideas, do you type them or do you

612
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,860
hand write them with a pencil on a piece of paper?

613
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,520
Ideas, of course, always hand-pickled with writing.

614
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,140
Ask, ask a hundred young people when the last time

615
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,620
they used a pencil was.

616
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,960
I'm full of words.

617
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,580
They'll search their minds and go, I think I had to

618
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,260
hang a picture last night.

619
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,580
I think I had to hang a picture last year.

620
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,460
And I used a pencil to mark where the nail would go.

621
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,260
Well, how do you like signing your signature as a squiggly

622
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,920
line so that nobody can trace what it is?

623
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,880
Oh, I draw little pictures.

624
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,900
I, some people, you know, like when you're getting, you're

625
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,200
checking out with a credit card.

626
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,500
No, but a lot of kids can't actually sign their name.

627
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,540
I mean, you can't, you know, Spencerian penmanship went out

628
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,300
the window about 10, 20 years ago.

629
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Well, they can, they can block, they can hand write, you know,

630
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


631
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,140
write their name in block text, right.

632
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,440
Of some kind.

633
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Yeah.

634
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,380
Or did they not even teach that?

635
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,520
Some fusion of the two, but Spencer, I live in a town where

636
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,240
they have a Spencerian, uh, preservation society because

637
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,160
he lived near here.

638
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,140
But what's Spencerian?

639
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,760
The, the, the penmanship, the original penmanship guy from

640
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,600
the 1790s all the way up to about 1955 or something.

641
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Oh, no, I don't.

642
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,280
That's new to me, but go ahead.

643
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,860
Well, they just, they, uh.

644
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,220
They gave up and they killed him.

645
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:22,840
They, they.

646
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,300
Right.

647
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
And they became communist themselves.

648
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,500
After all the stuff they went through, they couldn't resist it.

649
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,240
These kids these days can't read the original declaration of independence

650
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,420
because it's a, they go, what language is this?

651
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
That's not a joke.

652
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,600
Whereas we were in with the, we're in what is it?

653
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,280
Yeah.

654
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,200
They're coming there.

655
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,640
Nah.

656
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,220
Well, they did use F's instead of S's, uh, by our standards.

657
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,060
So it does.

658
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,600
Look stupid, but it's a little silly, but I guess I have you ever read the, uh, direct

659
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,640
transcriptions of the Lewis and Clark's notes on their expedition across the North American

660
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,140
continent.

661
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,360
Those guys were, they were both the closest thing to college educated dudes you could

662
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,680
get.

663
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,740
And their, their, their notes are like what?

664
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,440
There was no spelling rules.

665
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,320
Everything was phonetic.

666
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:30,740
And it's like little kid writing or very, very primitive internet text writing.

667
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:31,900
You know?

668
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,240
Yeah.

669
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:42,180
Uh, it's, it's very, very strange to read the, the, the way the, the olden people did

670
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,520
that.

671
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,940
And it's, it's strange for the young people to read how we do it or did it, Dave, before

672
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,360
we did it.

673
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,420
Yeah.

674
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,660
But that's more symbolic because they were, they were also another problem with the old

675
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,340
language writers was they were very creative.

676
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,300
They wanted to be, they all wanted to be the next Dickens.

677
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,260
And so that you mother dear, after all you have endured.

678
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,240
Oh, they're very poetic.

679
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,980
And every big, yeah.

680
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,500
Yeah.

681
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,220
Big words were special effects in those days.

682
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,940
And you could get phonetic with them.

683
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,400
Big words.

684
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,140
Pretty easy.

685
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,580
Especially if you were describing a log cabin somewhere out in the Huma Valley.

686
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:17,940
Yeah.

687
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah.

688
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


689
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


690
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


691
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


692
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


693
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


694
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


695
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


696
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


697
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


698
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


699
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


700
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


701
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


702
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


703
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


704
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


705
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


706
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


707
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,420


708
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,360
Well, whereas nowadays you read, uh, say just for instance, uh, a Stephen King book.

709
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,600
Yeah.

710
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,280
And, uh.

711
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,000
Go in your pants.

712
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,160
Well, he's a very good storyteller.

713
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,660
I've said people can put him down, but he's a, he can write a page turner and he's written

714
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,280
about 500 of them.

715
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:49,400
And, uh, uh, but the vocabulary in those is about one 10th of say Mary Shelley's French.

716
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,440
Or, uh, Joseph Conrad's Moby Dick.

717
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,880
So, you don't have to bring that into it.

718
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,480
Oh yeah.

719
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,380
I'm not trying to be sexist.

720
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:58,700
Okay.

721
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,440
Um, well, I just don't like people talking about humongous dicks or finer dicks.

722
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,140
Remember her?

723
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,520
Well, anyway, they, the, the people don't like the big words anymore and they don't

724
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
like long sentences.

725
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,640
And that's why everything's all, you know, politics by Twitter and, uh, uh, trolling.

726
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,240
And they already bought.

727
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,380
Oh, that's fine.

728
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,360
They already bypassed

729
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,480
the formatization by AP.

730
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,940
They already went past

731
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,640
American Press style, which is pretty short and sweet.

732
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,620
Which got

733
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,580
Oh, right. Yeah.

734
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,420
That was supposed to be clear and concise.

735
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,160
But now,

736
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,480
it's reduced to pictos

737
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,460
practically. A few

738
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,540
nouns and verbs when you don't

739
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,760
have a picto for it.

740
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,960
But, yeah.

741
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,440
And also, if you can smash together

742
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,340
any word or two

743
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,800
into one letter.

744
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,380
The smaller you can make it into one

745
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,560
thing, the better.

746
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,000
Right. Yeah. Abbreviate everything.

747
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,840
Because, you know,

748
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,840
they're typing with their thumbs.

749
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,300
I do it too.

750
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,200
Now.

751
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,960
I prefer

752
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,280
to sit at a

753
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
keyboard, or even better,

754
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,220
with a pencil

755
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,760
and a sheet of paper.

756
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,040
But,

757
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,900
I

758
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,400
I almost feel like

759
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm afraid to get caught

760
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,720
using

761
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,560
old media, you know.

762
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,560
People make fun of you.

763
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,840
They go, why don't you just use your

764
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,920
phone, man? Why'd you pull that

765
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,900
piece of paper and a pencil out of

766
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
your pocket? You could just use your phone.

767
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,820
It's like, well, but I'm not gonna

768
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,440
look at my phone for

769
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,700
that. Why not,

770
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,560
you fool?

771
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:41,980
Well,

772
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,500
because I'm old, I guess.

773
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,920
You know, Dave?

774
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,100
Well, at least you're guessing at it.

775
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,480
You know, some people have some really firm numbers

776
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,140
and know exactly what brassiere size

777
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,080
they gotta put on.

778
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,960
Some of my most brilliant friends

779
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,060
can barely

780
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,620
operate a computer at all,

781
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
don't have a

782
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,540
smartphone, and only

783
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,200
have a mobile

784
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,280
track phone type thing

785
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,860
because they absolutely

786
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,000
had to. Because the

787
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
payphones are all gone.

788
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,600
You're one of them.

789
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,320
You're a famous...

790
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,740
Somebody is giving me a phone

791
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,520
which is much better than the track phone

792
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,580
I've got, but it's still

793
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,780
not a top of the line.

794
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,360
I must have it because I must take pictures

795
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,720
in JPEG format.

796
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah, you have to.

797
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,420
Oh, you'll get to where

798
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,660
it's like, how did I ever live without this thing?

799
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,140
This is like the Swiss

800
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,900
Army knife of all media.

801
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,480
And it

802
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:44,780
is.

803
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,700
It's all good.

804
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,160
It'll be gone, as my

805
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,180
article at the beginning of the show said,

806
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,520
massive solar storm threat.

807
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,200
Sooner or later, it's all gonna

808
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,780
or an

809
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,980
EMP, you know,

810
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,120
a giant electromagnetic

811
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,300
pulse nuclear weapon

812
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,160
in the atmosphere

813
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,420
over the

814
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,140
target continent, which

815
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,240
is all seven of them,

816
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,940
plus Atlantis.

817
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,280
They'll,

818
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,420
you know, suddenly it would all

819
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:16,820
be gone.

820
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,700
Nobody be able to get on Facebook

821
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,960
and they'd probably probably

822
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,040
about half of the civilized world

823
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,080
would commit suicide.

824
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,360
Yeah, I'm just realizing, you know,

825
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,980
in my novel name, Neighborworld,

826
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,400
I'm not so sure that even

827
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,080
though things are going to wind up that way,

828
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,680
I think they might be a little bit

829
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,720
deadlier. I think people are a little bit

830
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,180
the basis.

831
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,500
Oh, Dave, you're most optimist.

832
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,720
You're most, you're most

833
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,440
pessimistic predictions.

834
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,640
In Neighborworld

835
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,940
are laughably optimistic.

836
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,820
Pathetically optimistic.

837
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,720
It will be so much worse.

838
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,040
There won't be any Neighborworld

839
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,320
at all after a certain point.

840
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,020
Or people.

841
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,180
That would be the evolution gone awry.

842
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,560
And this would be how things are really going.

843
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,180
No, no, it'd be cool, man.

844
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,660
Things are not good.

845
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,060
No, it'd be cool.

846
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,420
There'd be hardly any people left.

847
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,720
And most of the large animals

848
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,400
would be gone.

849
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,880
I mean, this is all, you know,

850
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,960
this is a foregone conclusion.

851
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,560
This isn't science fiction or prophecy.

852
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,980
This is just the schedule.

853
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,280
You and me won't have to

854
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,160
witness most of it.

855
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,860
I'm really hoping to die before

856
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,080
the last gorilla does.

857
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,140
That's my goal.

858
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,340
I die before the last gorilla does.

859
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,220
Well, you might be dead on Tuesday if you wait for that.

860
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,980
Well, I'm actually, if there was anything

861
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,260
I'd spend money on, it'd be keeping that last

862
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,100
gorilla alive.

863
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,260
Because I don't want to die.

864
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,500
Yet.

865
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,740
There's all kinds of, I mean, the Avengers Endgame.

866
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I've got to live to see that.

867
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,660
Poor Dr. Legume.

868
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,800
For Legume, Thanos won.

869
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,420
The fight between Thanatos and Eros?

870
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,820
Oh, yeah.

871
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,380
Yeah.

872
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,800
You don't, oh, Dave, you don't know.

873
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
It's a big deal.

874
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,860
Half the, half of the life forms in the entire unit

875
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:16,860


876
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:16,860


877
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,300
universe died suddenly, instantly at the end of the

878
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,380
last Avengers movie.

879
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,420
Now, how's that for dark?

880
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,260
The bad guy won.

881
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,560
And then Legume died.

882
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,860
So he doesn't get to see the final movie in the

883
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,100
Quintrilogy or whatever it is.

884
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,920
There's like seven of them now.

885
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,980
And, but they're going to end it.

886
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,860
They're going to kill off a bunch of the old actors.

887
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:46,840
Yeah.

888
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,260
And they're going to kill off the characters, actually.

889
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,700
Not the characters, the characters could live on, but

890
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,340
the actors can't keep playing superheroes when they're in

891
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,320
their 70s.

892
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,800
Although, Michael Douglas and Arnold Schwarzenegger have

893
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,020
both played young action heroes in movies made in the last two

894
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,500
years.

895
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:10,980
Yeah.

896
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,540
Buffalo Jim was a Picayune artist, too, down there in

897
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,560
Mississippi, I guess.

898
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,180
He used to wear the Buffalo chips and decide which way the mail was going to be delivered.

899
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,680
And for a long time, I guess the police were after him.

900
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,280
Once they found him, they didn't want him anymore.

901
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,440
He got rid of him for some reason.

902
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,900
He was because of the nasal obstruction.

903
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:39,520
Maybe he'd be talking, you know, he'd be like, like he'd be whistling at the same time.

904
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,400
And he was so irritating that they had to call the police.

905
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,240
Well, I already told you about the police.

906
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,240
What does that have to do with these Marvel movies that are the main thing keeping me alive?

907
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,140
Well, who said they're not?

908
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,380
Just because you said they're not, all of a sudden they're not have nothing to do with it?

909
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,700
Here's my point, Dave.

910
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:07,320
If you were a movie star, you could appear to be any age they wanted you to.

911
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,960
Now, you wouldn't actually be that age.

912
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,680
You would just look that age in the movie.

913
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,140
But what's real?

914
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,120
Man, what's really real?

915
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,140
Yeah.

916
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,780
Come on.

917
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,500
Get into the neighbor, get into the neighbor world point of view, man.

918
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,140
It's not really...

919
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,340
If you can animix everything, why even have another reality outside your own?

920
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,500
If you can animix everything, you can have the world just exactly the way you want.

921
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,940
You can crawl into a hole or a hovel.

922
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,200
They're making glasses that'll let you do just that.

923
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,660
You don't even have to look at a screen or put on a big headset.

924
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
Just the glasses.

925
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,360
And they've got augmented reality.

926
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,360
So you can look around.

927
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,380
You're just like James Cameron directing Avatar or something.

928
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,520
Or just like Sandra Moses.

929
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:03,980
It's like you look around on the set and instead of seeing a bunch of blue screen boxes and actors in goofy marker suits,

930
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,360
you see these alien characters in a jungle, a beautiful jungle.

931
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,660
Yeah.

932
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,800
It's like really articulate, well, well articulated point A.

933
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,980
I would say a neighbor world point A where everybody thinks they're someplace.

934
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,100
They're all interacting together.

935
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,300
I mean, they're not physically touching because I guess you'd have to feel it.

936
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,920
I didn't think about that part because I was too busy, you know, elaborating.

937
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:32,100
Well, Dave, if you ever want to see a modern day movie that touches on something somewhat similar,

938
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:43,780
Ready Player One, based on a pretty good recent sci-fi novel put together by Stephen King.

939
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:43,780


940
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:43,860
Yeah-

941
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:54,280
And also published by Steven Spielberg's company as one of those virtual reality previews of virtual reality in the future.

942
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:05,300
Of course, the best part of it is when it shows the real reality that the virtual reality aficionados choose not to see.

943
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,360
Instead of Los Limbs, a futurological congress.

944
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,320
Well, it takes place in Columbus, Ohio.

945
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:13,760
It's the плameophiles.

946
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,220
in, I think, 2030.

947
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,760
And when they open the movie

948
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,360
and show Columbus, Ohio in 2030,

949
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,760
it looks like a very, very, very poverty-stricken

950
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,380
and overpopulated other planet.

951
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,160
They've literally started stacking trailer homes

952
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,640
into skyscraper-sized planets.

953
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,680
Well, they have done that in some parts of Asia,

954
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,020
as we know.

955
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,300
Well, it's assumed in this particular virtual world

956
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,520
that that's what the real world is going to look like.

957
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,600
And the virtual world is pretty sexy, of course.

958
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:02,280
I spend as much time there as I can,

959
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,720
but I'm still more tied to the meat plane,

960
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,920
the dirt and mud level of life.

961
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,000
And climate.

962
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,600
Consciousness.

963
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,240
You know, I'm not really up in the ascended planes.

964
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,720
Man, I'm down in the mud.

965
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm a mud boy.

966
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,520
You're a feeling-really guy in the F&D.

967
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm friends with the micro-creatures that live in the mud.

968
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,620
I know their names.

969
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,460
They're not really friends.

970
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,360
They just tolerate you because you're much bigger.

971
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,160
I'm their home.

972
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,320
Yeah, I'm their real estate.

973
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,320
They're not the ones that live on me.

974
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Then there's ones that just live in the mud.

975
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,040
But I'm talking about the real plane,

976
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,740
where everything's really real.

977
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,300
Well, there's ones that live on you.

978
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,980
Not even human thought.

979
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,080
That's the real, real plane

980
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,920
where nobody's doing any thinking at all.

981
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,940
It's just there.

982
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,060
The plants, the dirt, the micro-creatures,

983
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,080
the rodents, the little tiny animals,

984
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,420
and even the big mammals.

985
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,720
Even our dogs.

986
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,900
They're not fretting about the same kind of stuff we are.

987
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:26,320
So all of our pompous human conceits are as nothing.

988
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,400
There is like dust in the wind, to quote Bill and Ted.

989
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,920
To some people, that's a depressing thought.

990
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,780
But to me,

991
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,420
it's like,

992
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,280
no, even after the people are gone,

993
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,060
there'll still be this wonderful, huge planet.

994
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,780
It'll be devoid of 90% of the species

995
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,320
that used to live on it,

996
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,760
somewhat like after the Permian extinction.

997
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,400
Oh, I remember.

998
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,400
That was when the dry cleaners got excited, yeah?

999
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,860
That just gives everybody else a chance

1000
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,720
to get a leg up, you know?

1001
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,720
Maybe it'll be squid,

1002
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,140
and squid women are like...

1003
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,360
If you were a dog and you wanted to lift your leg up somewhere,

1004
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,800
that would be the place to do it.

1005
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,480
Well, except there won't be dogs.

1006
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,200
The dogs are rogues.

1007
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,400
Not as we know it.

1008
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,120
They'd be wearing bow ties and talking in spectator language.

1009
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,840
Oh, if only.

1010
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,600
Dealing cards and stuff like that.

1011
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,100
If only.

1012
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,460
That ancient movie,

1013
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,260
The Planet of the Apes,

1014
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,840
written by Rod Serling,

1015
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,040
I'm not talking about the novel by Pierre Boulet,

1016
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,640
but the movie,

1017
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,260
from 1969,

1018
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,600
which soundtrack is playing in the background,

1019
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,940
that was one of those stories

1020
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,360
that was ridiculously optimistic.

1021
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,920
People thought it was so dark.

1022
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,860
Oh, my God.

1023
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,560
The human race is going to destroy itself,

1024
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,260
and the Statue of Liberty is going to be buried up to its neck in sand

1025
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,100
after climate change,

1026
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,740
and the apes are going to take over.

1027
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,160
But you guys...

1028
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,800
Well, that sounds pretty...

1029
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,700
That sounds pretty good to me.

1030
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,880
That sounds like a real good option to me

1031
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,640
compared to what I think is actually going to be happening,

1032
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,640
personally.

1033
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:21,600
Right.

1034
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,920
As a junior scientist,

1035
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,660
and, you know,

1036
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,660
we junior scientists try to keep our mouths shut

1037
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,000
because it's kind of depressing,

1038
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,840
and there's not really anything much we can do about it.

1039
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,920
The young people,

1040
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,940
my grandkids,

1041
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,520
will probably bust their asses

1042
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,280
trying to save the environment,

1043
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,620
and I hope,

1044
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,200
they succeed.

1045
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,980
But I don't see how they possibly can.

1046
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,520
Honestly.

1047
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,380
Well, some places they have.

1048
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,320
The snowball has gone.

1049
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,300
It's been going since...

1050
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,580
It's been rolling for 70 years now,

1051
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,360
100 years.

1052
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,380
That's a soot-covered snowball, man.

1053
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,540
That's a snowball covered with the most polluted,

1054
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,700
acid,

1055
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,280
rain,

1056
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,380
charcoal,

1057
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,400
black,

1058
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,840
horrible...

1059
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,580
Look how Cleveland looks.

1060
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,660
Three days after it snows.

1061
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,160
All the snow turns black and gray.

1062
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,280
Big...

1063
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,200
Yeah, well, that's the inside of your lungs, too.

1064
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,360
Yep.

1065
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,960
Darn it.

1066
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,680
Like living in Kentucky or West Virginia,

1067
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,480
same thing.

1068
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,140
You bring something out of the earth in great tonnage,

1069
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,380
it's going to be in the air in great tonnage, too, you know?

1070
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,320
Repent!

1071
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,760
Quit your job.

1072
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,340
Slack off.

1073
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,700
It's the end of the world.

1074
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,480
It really is.

1075
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,640
I think...

1076
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,880
In terms of neighborhood, you have to be more contextual

1077
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,560
rather than saying that's not a depleted and sad enough vision.

1078
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,400
It's like it's a real upbeat vision, but...

1079
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,900
Yeah, it is.

1080
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,380
It's not going to be any better than that.

1081
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,080
That's a starting point for things being bad.

1082
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,660
If you'll notice the way the conclusions drawn are like,

1083
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,280
you can't stop the world from being a city play.

1084
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:09,900
Oh, God.

1085
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,760
That's okay.

1086
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,260
And Dave, it's like...

1087
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,240
Standard Mazik, the lead character,

1088
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,660
he comes through okay,

1089
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,520
but kind of like us,

1090
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,120
he knows that after he's dead,

1091
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,420
it's going to be much, much worse.

1092
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,060
But look at it this way.

1093
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,680
They'll think it's normal.

1094
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,420
Yeah.

1095
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,440
We've been over this so many times on these stupid shows, Dave.

1096
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,300
Well, it is a concurrent.

1097
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,500
It is a concurrent.

1098
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,720
I mean, not a concurrent theme.

1099
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,780
It's a recurrent theme.

1100
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,560
How did I get concurrent there?

1101
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,000
We must have been together at one time.

1102
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,620
But it's a recurrent theme

1103
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,160
that things are getting worse and worse and worse.

1104
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,200
They establish a platform for showing that worseness.

1105
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,980
And once you attain that,

1106
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,760
then you can't go any higher or lower than that.

1107
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,580
You have to create a whole other different one.

1108
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,900
Oh, it's like porno.

1109
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,020
End of the world news.

1110
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,260
It's like, oh, I want to see the latest species extinction.

1111
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,620
Oh, I can't wait to see what new...

1112
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,660
How many new glaciers are calving off

1113
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:24,200
so that there won't be any Antarctica at all

1114
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,560
or Arctic as we know them.

1115
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,920
Did President Coolidge get imbibed

1116
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,100
by any of the releases of the gas today

1117
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,320
by the Secretary of Council?

1118
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,920
I know this is in the future, and that's in the past year.

1119
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,220
Well, they don't really talk about that kind of stuff,

1120
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,520
so I haven't...

1121
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
I haven't been following it, those details.

1122
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,120
But, yeah, the gases are escaping.

1123
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,940
The permafrost is melting.

1124
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,740
The ancient viruses are being released.

1125
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,160
The Wendigo is about to start walking the world.

1126
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,640
There's some pretty decent low-budget horror movies

1127
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,040
about this very subject.

1128
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,760
But in the end, in the end, it doesn't matter

1129
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,360
because...

1130
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,820
at least we got a stinking show out for college radio,

1131
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,180
which is all we really set out to do.

1132
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,120
Well, at least they've got something to do

1133
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,020
with their godforsaken time.

1134
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,900
Besides masturbating in a quiet room

1135
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,200
or arguing with some person down the hall

1136
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,280
for making too much noise when he's trying to study.

1137
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,780
Actually, those are...

1138
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,380
Those don't sound that bad compared to what's coming.

1139
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,360
Especially the masturbating part.

1140
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,620
Some of us might just have to...

1141
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,260
spend the rest of our lives masturbating ourselves to sleep.

1142
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,880
Some of us might have to spend our lives

1143
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,200
trying to masturbate one more time.

1144
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,420
Well, one more is always better than no more.

1145
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,160
That's a wretched...

1146
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,640
Exactly, but what if it takes a long time?

1147
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,620
That's a...

1148
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,340
It's a wretched existence.

1149
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,440
Well, just think of it like as a way of a European makes food

1150
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,340
as opposed to the way an American wants one.

1151
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,680
American wants a burger quick, quick, quick.

1152
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,180
Say if a French person wants something

1153
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,360
that tastes kind of good,

1154
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,500
he doesn't care if it takes too long

1155
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,000
because his tummy will be growling more.

1156
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,440
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful way to lose weight.

1157
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,540
You're stereotyping, Dave.

1158
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,180
There are Americans who stop to smell the roses

1159
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,140
and there are Frenchmen who are running around

1160
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,380
like crazy Japanese businessmen

1161
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,660
sweating the textiles contract.

1162
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,100
So don't stereotype.

1163
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,940
We've learned that lesson.

1164
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,120
That's right.

1165
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,240
I take no...

1166
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,780
I take no what you call it,

1167
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,660
what you just said.

1168
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,580
But I know what you mean.

1169
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,900
No umbrage or dishonor or any...

1170
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,620
Americans do tend to be...

1171
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,120
Americans do tend to be more obese,

1172
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,180
shallow, poorly educated,

1173
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,200
worse health care

1174
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,060
than all of our rival industrial nations these days.

1175
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,760
So, you know, it's just...

1176
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,740
It's sad.

1177
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,680
I guess I must hate our freedoms

1178
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,220
if I'm going to...

1179
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,100
I mean, speaking the bald-faced truth like that.

1180
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,420
Think of those socialist fins

1181
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,100
are the happiest people on Earth.

1182
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,020
Why, if you're a socialist country,

1183
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,320
why are you so happy?

1184
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,140
Wait a minute.

1185
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,660
Fins?

1186
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,980
They don't count.

1187
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,840
No, fins don't count.

1188
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,240
They're completely alien.

1189
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,880
They're not from the same background

1190
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,300
that any of the rest of us world citizens are.

1191
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,260
Fins are the weirdest weirdos.

1192
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,380
They're like another species.

1193
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,220
Don't eat them.

1194
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,220


1195
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,220


1196
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,220


1197
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,920
Even try.

1198
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,380
Don't drag the fins into it.

1199
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,000
It's not fair.

1200
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,940
There's no comparison.

1201
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,460
It's apples and oranges.

1202
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,960
Okay.

1203
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,740
And them and the Basque.

1204
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,800
The Basque people also have that unique...

1205
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,400
Their language is so different from everything else.

1206
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,900
They get to think their own thoughts.

1207
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,360
You see?

1208
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:07,760
Yeah.

1209
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,200
And they're not worried about...

1210
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,000
They come out...

1211
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,520
No use for...

1212
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,220
They come out...

1213
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,920
They come out pretty weird.

1214
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,160
Well, what else could you expect, you know?

1215
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,440
With a bunch of noisy Spaniards and Frenchmen behind you

1216
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,160
having a holiday.

1217
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Next thing you know,

1218
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,720
you're one of those dreadful Neanderthals

1219
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,040
you've conjured in your nightmares.

1220
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,520
At least when you're sleeping.

1221
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,140
I actually hung out with two bonafide fins

1222
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,100
when I was staying in Leipzig.

1223
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,820
And they were drunk already.

1224
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,520
We and I...

1225
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,060
Well, everybody.

1226
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,560
Everybody was.

1227
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,420
We met the Large and his girlfriend.

1228
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,420
And they...

1229
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,220
The Large used to send tons of weird little mixes

1230
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,460
and hardcore stuff.

1231
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,340
And he used to call puzzling evidence.

1232
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,080
I think he might have gotten a little disillusioned

1233
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,440
with the subgenius thing when...

1234
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,920
Well, I don't want to go there.

1235
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,720
But...

1236
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,140
Did I say something bad about...

1237
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,140
No, no, no.

1238
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,940
No, I'm...

1239
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,680
No, no.

1240
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,120
He and I had an ethnic disagreement.

1241
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,400
Anyway.

1242
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,960
But he was overall...

1243
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,580
He was an unbelievably interesting, funny guy.

1244
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,560
But he was a Finn.

1245
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,600
And they're completely...

1246
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,780
They're just...

1247
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,860
Everything about Finland is separate from...

1248
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,480
You know, you could say it's Scandinavian, but...

1249
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,900
Not like Denmark and Norway and Sweden and them.

1250
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,020
They're all, you know...

1251
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,600
There's a certain amount in common

1252
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,820
called Indo-European language.

1253
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,500
Yes, and they're not a part of the Indo-European...

1254
00:51:59,500 --> 00:51:59,660
Right.

1255
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,620
They're part of the same language group as Hungarians

1256
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,260
and, I believe, Latvians.

1257
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,860
Oh, I don't think they're the same group as...

1258
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,980
Not sure, but Hungarians for sure.

1259
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
I thought they weren't the same group as anybody.

1260
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,420
That's what makes them so weird.

1261
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,180
No, they're kind of...

1262
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,220
They have connections even with the We Are people of China.

1263
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,760
They stretched all the way from West Central Asia

1264
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,300
where...

1265
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,200
The Uyghurs?

1266
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,040
The Uyghurs.

1267
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,620
Yeah.

1268
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,640
Uyghurs.

1269
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:26,920
We Are.

1270
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,140
I'm sorry.

1271
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,120
Yeah.

1272
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,640
No, that's a real thing.

1273
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,520
And their closest relatives linguistically are Hungarian.

1274
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,500
Hungarian and Finnish are kind of close.

1275
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,460
Oh, God, that figures.

1276
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,500
My wife is half Hungarian.

1277
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,640
Yeah, my wife was half Hungarian, too.

1278
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,640
That explains everything, Dave.

1279
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,880
We were led into a trap by Finns, Hungarians, and Uyghurs.

1280
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,000
Well, the cabbage rolls were good, you know what I mean?

1281
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,380
Well, that's the thing.

1282
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,340
God, the cooking was just...

1283
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,900
It was so great and she's so beautiful.

1284
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,360
Oh, my God.

1285
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,420
Oh, I...

1286
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,940
Well, now I'm distracted.

1287
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:10,680
I'm not there.

1288
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,540
Dave, we better get off this subject

1289
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,720
before we say anything racist and un-PC and everything else.

1290
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,580
Because, you know, you can get in trouble.

1291
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,540
I'm actually in trouble right now

1292
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,260
with a few idiots

1293
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,840
for being...

1294
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,500
With some of the idiots, I'm in trouble for being too PC.

1295
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,460
And with the other idiots, I'm in trouble for not being PC enough.

1296
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,060
Now...

1297
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,840
Yes, you would expect that would happen, yeah.

1298
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,280
Yeah.

1299
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,240
They're the only ones who actually think I'm in any trouble.

1300
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:50,120
Because I can tell from my vantage point atop this flagpole

1301
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,260
over the middle of the road

1302
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,740
that's mounted on the big lane in the middle of the...

1303
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,100
With this model AR-14 that looks so realistic.

1304
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,940
No, no.

1305
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,440
With my magnifying...

1306
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,800
My binoculars, that's all.

1307
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,700
And hearing aids.

1308
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,440
And I'm just looking back and forth and seeing...

1309
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,200
Seeing the overall scope.

1310
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,900
I see the left lane and the right lane.

1311
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,900
I am in the middle of the road,

1312
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,320
but I'm elevated up about 40 feet.

1313
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,100
So I have a more clear, broad viewpoint

1314
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:32,840
than those milling cattle down there in the left lane or the right lane.

1315
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,440
Or, I mean, you know, the north lane or the south lane.

1316
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,560
That's what I mean.

1317
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,320
And there's traffic jams in both.

1318
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:40,980
And there's directions.

1319
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,200
And I'm just sitting here doing my show.

1320
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,660
And anytime I want to, I can just kick off,

1321
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,140
go frop up and walk the dogs.

1322
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,160
I could do that.

1323
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,740
And by golly, I think I will.

1324
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:03,140
Because it's been 45 minutes of philosophy.

1325
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,700
And that's enough for any hour-long show.

1326
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,860
Well, I have to agree with you.

1327
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,940
I need to be physically, because I'm annoying myself right now.

1328
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,860
Well, we both have physical needs, Dave.

1329
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:17,900
Yeah.

1330
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,220
Needs.

1331
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,860
Sometimes they become more particular.

1332
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,500
Needs that must...

1333
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,960
Needs be addressed.

1334
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,460
Or undressed.

1335
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,180
Unzipped.

1336
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,640
Or freed.

1337
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,660
Uncaged.

1338
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,960
Two stamps from Sri Lanka, I mean.

1339
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:36,940
Set free.

1340
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,180
Fixed to the letter.

1341
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:39,980
Temporarily.

1342
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,140
I can hear you sweating.

1343
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:45,480
You think?

1344
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,080
Yeah.

1345
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,620
Oh, yeah.

1346
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,760
It's pooling up.

1347
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,380
I've got to keep it off the recorder.

1348
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,760
Yeah, keep it away from the drat bags, too.

1349
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,540
Because, you know, when they come in wearing kilts,

1350
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,440
they still want to play the vibraphone.

1351
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,820
Well, you're kind of freaking me out a little bit, so...

1352
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,980
No, it's okay, Dave.

1353
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,660
This 45 minutes...

1354
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,100
It's a...

1355
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,780
Or now a 47 minutes we've recorded.

1356
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,480
It'll save the listeners having to listen to all those...

1357
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,000
To all that huge variety of material of old and new subgenius stuff by other people

1358
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,180
that had really good music and really funny jokes.

1359
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,240
So we've saved them that trouble.

1360
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,500
And, friends, you, too, can save yourself that trouble

1361
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,640
or bring it upon yourselves.

1362
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:43,780
You can bring it upon yourself by going to subgenius.com on the internet,

1363
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,640
which has copies of all our old shows.

1364
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,960
The really good ones that had 50 tracks per hour.

1365
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,360
That's exciting.

1366
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,820
And the current type ones that have three tracks per hour.

1367
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,180
One of them 50 minutes long.

1368
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,020
But that's okay.

1369
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,900
Because it's real, man.

1370
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,520
It's real.

1371
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,740
That's the important thing.

1372
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,280
It's exciting.

1373
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,460
It's very, very exciting.

1374
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,280
It may not be exciting, but at least it's real.

1375
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,340
Yeah, but at least it's exciting.

1376
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:24,100
There's nobody else anywhere even remotely like Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the whole planet.

1377
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,880
Imagine the window that you're getting into this alien psyche.

1378
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,400
You may not enjoy it, but by golly, it's certainly alien.

1379
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,640
It might be the ugliest experience of my life.

1380
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,580
It's the ugliest experience you've ever had in your life.

1381
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,500
I mean, that would be the way you would have to describe it, too.

1382
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,640
Or the most sublime—

1383
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,280
Or you could just take a rapid ride without a suitcase, yeah.

1384
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:57,220
No, for many, it would be the most sublime and uplifting ride to hear the liquid logic

1385
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,220
of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1386
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:05,060
Just like the depressing but not so depressing end of Neighborworld.

1387
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,620
It's like you've arrived at a point in time where you're like, oh, I'm going to go to

1388
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:08,780
Neighborworld at this point.

1389
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,480
Now you can stumble around in the dark wondering what else to do.

1390
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:17,280
And friends, you can procure a copy of Neighborworld if you're really interested.

1391
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,900
You may look at subgenius.com.

1392
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,580
You won't have to read down on the front page very far at all.

1393
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:37,640
And that will—I happen to know that not enough of you have heeded the warning.

1394
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,500
The warning.

1395
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,860
This is the warning.

1396
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,500
This shower has been the warning.

1397
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,360
Okay, Dave.

1398
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,140
I had a little music cue going there for a minute.

1399
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,180
It's gone now.

1400
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:06,740
It's Jerry Goldsmith's score for Planet of the Apes, the 1969 version.

1401
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,600
Franklin J. Scherzinger.

1402
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,020
That's right.

1403
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,840
Frank Schaffner?

1404
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,200
Or Shafer?

1405
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,720
Shafer?

1406
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,320
I thought it was.

1407
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:13,680
Yeah.

1408
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,620
Probably Shafer.

1409
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,160
See?

1410
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,440
That's the kind of—those details are starting to slip.

1411
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,980
I need to take that retina test.

1412
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,960
Okay, anyway, friends.

1413
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,420
That's it.

1414
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,700
subgenius.com.

1415
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,600
Price Bob.

1416
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,340
Don't want no more Bob.

1417
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,600
I'm so sorry.

1418
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:38,600


1419
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:38,600


1420
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,640
more more more more fun

1421
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,800
Don't want no more fun
