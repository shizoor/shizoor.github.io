1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,520
Oh

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,660
Yeah portion around with girls girls well sure they start foaming at the mouth

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,620
That sounds me. Uh-huh

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:25,160
Say it's great supposed to be the biggest on the whole world. All right starts real slow

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,040
Yeah, and it goes faster and faster and everybody starts yelling and screaming supposed to scare the socks off

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,140
Yeah, and even got this kind of white coat standing around a case anybody faints. It sounds pretty neat. All right. Well, see ya

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,820
So long fellas

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,880
What's the matter with me? I'll tell you what's wrong with you dad cut off his knees. He was sick for three days

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,240
Uh-huh. Yeah, don't tell me something like that. I just had supper

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,440
To him

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,120
Come fly the teeth of the wind

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,220
Share my wings

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,980
You know, of course that you are living in a power age

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,940
What are you doing with it? I call this power TNT because it is dynamite

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,800
Use it rightly and it can bring you anything you want

16
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,880
Use it wrongly and it can eventually produce for you what you don't want

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,680
But you cannot get away from this power

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,220
Just listening to what I'm telling you now can be the turning point in your life

19
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,740
So Doug Smith radio operator, I'll bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,460
Potential initiate and remain with us for the next 30 minutes Bob

21
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,700
Bob

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,480
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

23
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,700
Every time you say see hear or think

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,360
What about slack that's your key phrase? It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it

25
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,880
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,020
of slack sponsored by

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
the church of the subgenius

28
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:35,860
This is Reverend Ivan stank sacred scribe of the first Orthodox mega fist temple Lodge of the Church of the subgenius

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,940
With pastor buck naked of the first naked church of the subgenius

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,700
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,100
For the sermon a message concerning Bob Dobbs living avatar of slack and saint of sales

32
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,720
on planet earth

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,680
the idea that America or any country values

34
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,740
Individuality is the highest ideal is a cheap myth

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,660
Everybody's an individualist

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,980
But they don't like individuals

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,860
Damn straight perhaps in simpler times it was true

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,960
But no modern industrial death culture can really afford a population of

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,020
Unpredictables

40
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,360
This shouldn't surprise you the long history of persecution

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,140
By subgeni by the conspiracy goes back for generations untold

42
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,060
Sub geniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world

43
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,940
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight on some evening in late

44
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,620
1998 into over men and over women

45
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,360
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,660
Wheels as mere humans for the last million years or so

47
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,340
I think it's a real nightmare that right now when you open a science book

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,780
You'll find creationism on one page. You'll find the evolution on one page, but where's the page on where sub geniuses came from?

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,880
Oh

50
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,540
Yay yay, yay friends, that's some old hour of slack material there

51
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,220
We're playing tonight a rerun of one of the oldest shows hour of slack number six

52
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,580
from

53
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:19,540
1985

54
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,580
And I believe most of it was recorded when?

55
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,340
um

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,640
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon came to visit us in Dallas at our home studio.

57
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,300
And a lot of it is taken from Hour of, not Hour of Slack, the Media Barrage No. 10,

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,620
which is even older.

59
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,700
The Media Barrage tapes were done before the Hour of Slack started.

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,660
They turned into the Hour of Slack.

61
00:04:49,660 --> 00:05:00,780
So join the baby Reverend Stang and the ordinary middle-aged G. Gordon Gordon

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:12,440
back in time as we examine the use and abuse of the souls of normal human beings.

63
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,640
Do you feel like in your teens?

64
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,580
Are you more than a man of means?

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,420
Is everything less than rough?

66
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
Are you middle class enough?

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,800
Five monsters in my family.

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,900
And we all have a lot of fun.

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,020
Two fairy sisters.

70
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,500
Scary husband.

71
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,460
Bowsy wife.

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,540
And hairy son.

73
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,640
That's me.

74
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,300
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,460
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,600
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,700
But you're dead as a beaver hat.

78
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,260
They're gonna think you're insane.

79
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,780
These people want to hypnotize us into cutting their brains out with chainsaws.

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,980
I mean, people.

81
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,820
If people psychically will us to beat their ass.

82
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,940
I mean, I don't see how we're responsible.

83
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,540
I mean.

84
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,960
I mean.

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:26,960


86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,940
It's sub-genius boot camp.

87
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,320
Drinking coffee and staying awake.

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,300
Stand up there!

89
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,100
Here, stand out in the rain, and keep your wake.

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,300
Here, have some old Bob cologne.

91
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,800
You call yourself a sub-genius coming to drill with a beard?

92
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,820
That's two demerits.

93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,540
Alright Mr Hugh.

94
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,480
Three more demerits, and I'll get that new baseball glove.

95
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
Look at the knees of your uniform, Vance.

96
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,060
That's disgusting.

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm docking you five more demerits, Mr. Heister.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,820
Oh gosh gosh!

99
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,660
Get a new car!

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
What are you smiling about?

101
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,640
Buy a white truck.

102
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,640


103
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,700
I hate Bob. Bob made my daddy go crazy.

104
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,660
My daddy used to make money, but now he just sits around all day.

105
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,260
I hate Bob. He's a bad man. I wish he would die.

106
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
This is part of the conspiracy.

107
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,820
It would appear that the government at the moment is practicing a lot of this religion in absentia for many folks.

108
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a trendy thing.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,220
What do you think?

110
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,600
Well, we're actually the conspiracy. You've always heard of the conspiracy, right?

111
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah.

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,660
Well, we're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,980
We've decided to come out in the open.

114
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,080
You're the unnamed source.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,220
That's us.

116
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,080
One of them.

117
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,580
Well, you've certainly heard of the Public Creatinization Society.

118
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,800
And now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures and to bring back to normalcy and a state of perfection

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:47,440
any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation of matter, any given plane, any given depth.

120
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
I can easily do anything that I want to do.

121
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
I can.

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,680
I can.

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm a winner.

124
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,640
Pursuant to Section 28A, Article 4B, Paragraph 2 of the Internal Security Regulations,

125
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,100
I now hand over to you rejected applicate number 578-293-BO21.

126
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,940
And so, right on his face.

127
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,800
Hey, when am I going to get paid?

128
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,500
I hate myself and I hate everyone else.

129
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm not done.

130
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
Can you hear me?

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,040
What the heck is going on out here?

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,380
Anyway, I need to talk to Bob.

133
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,000
Bob.

134
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,500
Bob.

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,080
Bob.

136
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,060
Bob.

137
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,500
Bob.

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,740
Bob.

139
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,000
Bob.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,160
Bob.

141
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,320
Bob.

142
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,340
Bob.

143
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,500
Bob.

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,820
Bob.

145
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,140
Bob.

146
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,220
There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices, to be found only in the minds of men.

147
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,960
There is no typical subgenius.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,660
There's no profile subgenius.

149
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,720
The subgenius is the person who is an outsider, who has been different somewhere or another since birth.

150
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,580
A person who is born with slack.

151
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,380
And we're all born with slack.

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,100
Original slack.

153
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,000
Original slack.

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,640
But the...

155
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,260
The conspiracy...

156
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,820
The conspiracy of normalcy, really, is what it is.

157
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,940
It takes it away from the minute you are born.

158
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,820
They give you that first whack on your behind to make you cry.

159
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,920
From that moment on, they're taking away your slack.

160
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,920
He was alive one minute, then he was dead.

161
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,960
Can't be.

162
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,220
Why not?

163
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,100
There must have been a reason.

164
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,680
They couldn't just barge in here and drag him away.

165
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,860
No reason.

166
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,460
They can totally barge in this group of coworkers.

167
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,460


168
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,460


169
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,840
Whatever...

170
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,640
graphic,

171
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,680
all hacia 22 from,

172
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,780
Aah!

173
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,460
,

174
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,200
ador quickly,

175
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:42,180
So much pamięhake and

176
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,440
Arihского C-B Konic.

177
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,020


178
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,680
Too bad today.

179
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,380
Yes, they creep up on you.

180
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,000
Conspiracy bugs.

181
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,900
Conspiracy bugs.

182
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
They creep up on you.

183
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,880
They breed fast, don't you see?

184
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,500
And also, they don't need much to live on.

185
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,900
Just a constant supply of mindless entertainment.

186
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,480
And food.

187
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,380
And false slack.

188
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,160
That's all they need.

189
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,080
False slack is so much easier to get than real slack, my friend.

190
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,200
So much easier.

191
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,200
All you have to do is work a 9-to-5 job.

192
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,460
Or, you know, the equivalent.

193
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,540
Whatever you do.

194
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,880
It doesn't have to be a 9.

195
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,660
You can be your own boss, entrepreneur, whatever.

196
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,900
It doesn't matter how you get the money.

197
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,700
But the money can buy, can...

198
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,140
False slack can only be had...

199
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,760
for money.

200
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,060
Uh, true slack can be had for money.

201
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,700
But you've gotta have...

202
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,980
You've gotta have a...

203
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,880
a slack...

204
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,140
a slack awareness, my friend.

205
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,360
More than you need money.

206
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,220
You don't need money.

207
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,500
You don't have to have money to have true slack.

208
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,440
And that is the God's truth.

209
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Oh no.

210
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,540
I'm dreaming.

211
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,040
None of this is true.

212
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,220
I'm dreaming.

213
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm dreaming.

214
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,920
I'm dreaming.

215
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,220
I'm dreaming.

216
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm dreaming.

217
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,460
I'm dreaming.

218
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,780
I'm dreaming.

219
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm dreaming.

220
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:16,800


221
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:16,820
I'm dreaming.

222
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:16,820


223
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:16,900
Oh no, don't...

224
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:16,920
They're agnostic.

225
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,520
If you cannot see it, you think it's not there.

226
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,320
It doesn't work that way.

227
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,460
They don't know that this is a conspiracy.

228
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:23,820
They're agnostic.

229
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,560
This is for real.

230
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,240
They're agnostic.

231
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,620
They don't know.

232
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,060
They have to see it in front of them before they know...

233
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,620
Yeah, they have to see it.

234
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,700
And even then they deny it.

235
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,080
The thing is, is that these people are real, and, uh, the Pinks are the ones who actually

236
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,100
do not exist, because they're not awake enough to actually have consciousness...

237
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,440
They're not...

238
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
that haven't turned into dogs yet.

239
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,280
...things.

240
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,900
They're just tubes...

241
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,720
to be filled with video images.

242
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,580
They're shadows, they're spirits,

243
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,480
but they're not real.

244
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,640
By recreating body and mind

245
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,780
out of remembered fragments,

246
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,200
I was to program my own inferno.

247
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,140
Good God.

248
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,720
Well, he certainly lost his mind.

249
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,140
Listen.

250
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,480
In effect,

251
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,380
my soul was a monstrous cancer.

252
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,300
Continually creating within itself

253
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,800
the means of my destruction.

254
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,860
A lost soul

255
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
is one that no longer controls its own circuitry.

256
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,600
The virus has been taken over by the enemy

257
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,300
which uses it to destroy me,

258
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,080
to destroy you.

259
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
The sensation is like spontaneous combustion.

260
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
I should have taken it off the hook.

261
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,620
Oh, let it ring.

262
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,840
Annie, take a message, would you?

263
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,260
And leave it off the hook.

264
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,880
Yeah, okay, okay, I'll get it.

265
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,540
Go on, Linda.

266
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,140
Go on.

267
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,680
It is this control of the circuitry,

268
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
this ability to send phantom signals

269
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,180
to real bodies through their remembered images,

270
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,900
like pins stuck in a doll,

271
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,120
that gives hell its power on earth.

272
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,380
Hell is not a place,

273
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,500
but a system for disrupting the plans of God.

274
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,280
She thinks you can cure the world

275
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,780
by kindness and rules,

276
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,540
but it's too small.

277
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,360
The Lord's Prayer on a Pinhead.

278
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,600
Some make rules, some obey,

279
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,100
but the rules are for the fools,

280
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,440
is what I say.

281
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,320
The system makes me sick.

282
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,900
I wear the wrong clothes.

283
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,380
I see the wrong things.

284
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,180
You know I can't dance,

285
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,240
my feet are much too wide.

286
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,740
Who thinks you set the trends?

287
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,300
You wear your head as white.

288
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,800
Your clothes are out of sight.

289
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,860
Your house is modern, really kitsch.

290
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,120
You got it so macho in there.

291
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,900
You got it, bitch.

292
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,740
I see them go to the web.

293
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,220
I see them go to sleep.

294
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,280
I see them on the street.

295
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,580
I see them on TV.

296
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,360
I see them laugh and cry.

297
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,780
I'm on the outside.

298
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm on the outside.

299
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm on the outside.

300
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,140
It happens.

301
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,960
Look around you.

302
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,840
Look all around you.

303
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,680
The rude clerks in stores that hate their job

304
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,800
and take it out on you.

305
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,960
The thing about the normals is that they

306
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,660
they conceptualize themselves to be

307
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,640
hot sinus effluvia on silver platters,

308
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,060
but in reality reveal themselves to be

309
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,860
cold mucus incrustation on a paper plate.

310
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,860
A tuxedo container of hot steam for voirist dogs.

311
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:26,860


312
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:26,860


313
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:26,860


314
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:26,860


315
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:35,360
o Мы Carson are pressure.

316
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:43,280
If folksoccassion costs

317
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,940
memory take those bad memories take those horrible training regimens that

318
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,300
you were subjected to as a youth flush them down the toilet as you

319
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,280
excrement a take let me ask you let me ask you sister did you ever own a guinea

320
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,900
pig I ate my guinea pigs I grew them and I ate them

321
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,700
take some more of this maybe the show will finish and we'll get to make

322
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,260
another tape

323
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,820
weird

324
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,560
the door doctor these days your medic

325
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,400
they want to know things they want to know how to run their lives or what

326
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,780
you're saying about this about my girlfriend

327
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,760
my girlfriend that one don't want me to worship

328
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,840
what should I do man

329
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,380
I'll tell you what you should do it's like doctor you should do this

330
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,020
no head launching doctor

331
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,880
take

332
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,640
the pills

333
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,860
the right way like the fire

334
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,700
try some of this false slack

335
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,400
but we can't talk about that because it would leave this station live open to libel and slander

336
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,700
that's our lawyer now oh my god he's here

337
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,780
I feel much better now

338
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,180
oh man

339
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,200
that's because

340
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Bob sent this for you

341
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,080
these normal souls are amazing

342
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,360
you can drink them you can smoke them you can eat them

343
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,420
I don't know who knows what you can do with them

344
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,160
you can even snort them

345
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,900
I can try rubbing one up under my gums here

346
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm gonna try a line of this human soul here if you'll excuse me a minute

347
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:58,800
I'm gonna

348
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,580
now that's what I call soul

349
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,780
let me try some of that

350
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,720
Jesus

351
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,060
remember that?

352
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,260
remember that?

353
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,420
that must have been a fairly intelligent normal

354
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,880
oh no that wasn't a normal that was

355
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,800
god I think I got some of his memories off of that

356
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,280
wow

357
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,540
yeah

358
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,560
it's like I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s

359
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
just for a second

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,580
that's probably the guy's mom

361
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,480
yeah

362
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,080
god you can snort their souls

363
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,940
and these little primal memories come to me

364
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,440
you've just got to give them final unction and dry them out first

365
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,900
okay

366
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,600
how long have you guys known about this?

367
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,900
I mean was this something the Indians had down there?

368
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,480
yeah yeah

369
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,760
it's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times

370
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,740
so they just uh they dry it and keep it in with volcanic rock as an absorbent

371
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,960
and they just grind it up and snort it through huge huge caves

372
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,520
they didn't have the technology to extract souls

373
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
I mean how'd they get them under pressure?

374
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,740
how'd they get them into the canisters?

375
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,620
they don't do it that way

376
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,140
they just feed them the right amount of

377
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,300
herbs and plants and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal

378
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,780
you're kidding

379
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,240
no

380
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,660
why can't we do that?

381
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,360
we can if we got the right pills

382
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,860
it's kind of you know it's it's all organic

383
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,340
I mean you know there's two ways you can extract

384
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,760
you go high technology or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys with a barrel

385
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,420
why did Bob set up these these these extraction machines?

386
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,520
I mean what's this?

387
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
all you're gonna do is you dig a little pit

388
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,240
you dig a little pit in the ground you line it with plastic

389
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,760
peg down with wood

390
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,760
and then you put the body in

391
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,800
a normal right?

392
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,140
yeah

393
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,120
any normal?

394
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,800
any normal

395
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,460
I mean it

396
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,560
any normal isn't dead yet the stole is still in him right?

397
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,960
uh-huh

398
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,580
okay then you cover him with kerosene and acetone

399
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,780
and then you just jump up and down on him until it turns kind of green and thick

400
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,460
then you remove him strain the liquid

401
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,100
then you boil it you add sulfuric acid

402
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,140
but then there's some kind of ritualistic I mean what actually causes the transmutation?

403
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
well there's a group of people that are doing it and they're doing it for the sake of it

404
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,120


405
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,120


406
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,380
yeah

407
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:20,640
people around the pit adding a psychic element of the of the alchemy you say that's they concentrate

408
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,200
and oh yeah because they don't have the the sole amplifier

409
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,100
right so it's done with psychic methods and then after its boiled

410
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,980
that's incredible

411
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,840
after it's boiled

412
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,580
a bunch of brazilian tribal jungle people

413
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:40,680
ambolybians ambolybians both they both do it in the lowlands on both sides there and then you you boil that they boil a soul they actually boil

414
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,800
little combo souls

415
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,840
yeah they boil

416
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,500
And little coya soles too, you know.

417
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,740
And they boil them.

418
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,380
And then when it starts to thicken, they add another liquid.

419
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,440
It's some kind of corrosive, I believe.

420
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,540
And it turns into a thick white paste.

421
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,400
And they just spread the sole out into the sun.

422
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,480
And it dries.

423
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,000
And then you just have to chop it up.

424
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,980
They'd probably think we were idiots for crystallizing them and compressing them.

425
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,640
Yeah.

426
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,060
I mean, it probably doesn't cost them, you know, it costs them a couple of necklaces or a taper.

427
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,520
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

428
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,580
They're pet taper at the most expense they've got.

429
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,280
And it costs us $100,000 a year to keep these things pumping.

430
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,780
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

431
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,800
And not to mention the bodies and the soles and getting rid of them.

432
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,900
See, the body dissolves.

433
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,760
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

434
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,260
Well, do you do up the body too?

435
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,800
No, they just strain it out with a solid waste.

436
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,580
What do they do with that?

437
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,940
With that?

438
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,800
They press it into little cakes and burn it, like for fires and stuff like that.

439
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,500
They usually give it back to the...

440
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,220
To the guy's family.

441
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,900
How come this was...

442
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,040
How come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

443
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,660
Well, you see, it's because...

444
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,620
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

445
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,720
How come we didn't rip them off?

446
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Well, because we can pay for sole and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up here.

447
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,760
Because, you know, like down there, nobody complains if you go through 400 or 500 bodies in one night.

448
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,140
You know, you can sit around and smoke all the sole you want.

449
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,480
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of...

450
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,180
That's right.

451
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,640
...questionable to...

452
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,760
They got a lot more...

453
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,140
...to be digging pits in your backyard and throwing normal bodies in there.

454
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,380
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,780
Noisy, if nothing else.

456
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,980
It's just little pressed cakes.

457
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,860
Most people barbecue on them later, you know.

458
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,840
You see?

459
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away to the...

460
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,520
Wherever they're taken on Jupiter.

461
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, of course, the thing about a lot of...

462
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,120
That weirds me out, man.

463
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,060
A lot of things weird me out.

464
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,300
The fact is that you can't get any good sole here in the States, dry or liquid.

465
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,020
It's always been cut with something.

466
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,140
And I like my sole unstepped on myself, you know.

467
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,120
Oh, yeah.

468
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,520
They'll use monkey soles, chimpanzee soles.

469
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,220
Hell, they just take up crystallized...

470
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,380
There's probably two-thirds...

471
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,360
They just take crystallized emotions and mix them in, for God's sake.

472
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,600
I mean, you get a bad blast of rage mixed in with your sole, and the next thing you know, man, you...

473
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,160
That's probably what happened to me last week.

474
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,700
...to the salad bar.

475
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,940
And that took a lot of...

476
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,500
They put a lot of anguish in it, too, you know.

477
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,320
It just makes you depressed.

478
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:21,320
Whereas pure sole is nothing more than a psychic and, you know, almanic amplifier.

479
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,640
And, you know, if your sole's in good shape when you do pure sole, I mean, it's even better.

480
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,360
But, you know, like, you put...

481
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,720
Stuff that's been stepped on and mixed with monkey sole or alligator.

482
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,580
Yeah, next thing you know, your sole is...

483
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,640
It's tainted.

484
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Very tainted.

485
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,380
Got holes eaten through it, you know.

486
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,680
Man, I wonder if that's what happened to Janer.

487
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,400
What happened to Janer?

488
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:44,980
Yeah.

489
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,340
Janer shoots sole.

490
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,220
I know.

491
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,120
He's like, hey, you're going to magnetize my Palmer head.

492
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,540
He calls it.

493
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,240
Yeah.

494
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
Hey, give me some of that remagnetized Palmer.

495
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,520
I won't do any demagnetized Trevino head.

496
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,500
See, that's a problem.

497
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Janer is doing it.

498
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,960
That Palmer head, and, you know, it was not a good molecule to begin with.

499
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,360
And, you know, he's just synthesizing...

500
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,400
more and more of bad stuff and making it purer and purer.

501
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,640
And each time he makes it purer, it's more pure bad.

502
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,060
That's his basic problem.

503
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,320
Running up demagnetized sole, bad golfer soles.

504
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah.

505
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
Can you imagine?

506
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,540
And it is this doctor's opinion that anal sex was performed on the dead bodies

507
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,420
after the brutal slaughter and was done.

508
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,340
Details at 10.

509
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,700
Oh, my God.

510
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,180
My baby, my baby.

511
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
My baby, my baby.

512
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,600
My baby, my baby.

513
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,600
My baby, my baby.

514
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,060
My baby, my baby.

515
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,960
My baby, my baby.

516
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,760
Very air spray.

517
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,220
Water bed for two.

518
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,400
Jogging, health foods

519
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,660
And lots of social goods

520
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,380
Khaki pants

521
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,680
White shirts with those alligators

522
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,500
Mercedes Benz

523
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,540
How about tennis later?

524
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,400
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

525
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,580
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

526
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,440
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

527
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,120
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

528
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,780
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

529
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,040
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

530
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,640
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is

531
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,120
And don't you wish you did

532
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Oh dear, that ding

533
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,460
Well, Dr. Howell, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects

534
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,260
And tell us about the relationship between the demopods and the ussopods?

535
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,560
Well, the demopods and the myriapods got together

536
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,600
No, the demopods and ussopods

537
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Oh, the demopods

538
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,380
It says right here on the script

539
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,100
I can tell you

540
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,780
I understand that

541
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,920
I thought you meant this script right here

542
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,620
The one with the red lines on the cover

543
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,500
Listen, never read anything with red dots

544
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,180
I never believe anything with red dots

545
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,060
It says read addresses that I don't like on the show

546
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,820
Too many buttons to push

547
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,900
Too many tape recorders to watch

548
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,160
It was obvious that during the game

549
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,200
They should not have launched ahead with that size of rocket

550
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,880
They should have used a smaller rocket

551
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Not hurt so many people

552
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,940
Some, perhaps, but not so many

553
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,460
As it turned out, JFK was turning to Governor Connolly

554
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,020
To tell him the name of the band

555
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
That dare not speak his name

556
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,680
And was shot because of that

557
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,940
We thank you for your input, caller

558
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,440
What does it sound like where you are?

559
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,500
Perfectly well-known

560
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,900
But what does it sound like where you are?

561
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,560
What is weird?

562
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:42,860
Huh?

563
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,280
It's a weird DJ dressed up in a crown of thorns

564
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,320
And a dirty, dirty sheet

565
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,060
What's going on here?

566
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,180
Starts kissing on you

567
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,980
I'm...

568
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,000
And don't forget to...

569
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:34,020


570
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,460
In mood

571
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,320
While rats run up my trouser legs

572
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,000
Roaches share my food

573
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,640
Rats and roaches nuzzle me

574
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,420
When it's dark and hot

575
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,100
Love, love, it's all the same

576
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,760
Mixing speed and part

577
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,460
First a rat and then a roach

578
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,080
Are both as like as not

579
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,680
If I can't find a fix tonight

580
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
My marrow bones will rot

581
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,060
Goodbye, transcendent pumpkin square

582
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,840
I haven't long to stay

583
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,000
A double jolt of pain

584
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,440
Heroin and I'll be on my way

585
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,340
Let...

586
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,860
Ah, yes, dear friends

587
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,800
Here we are

588
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,220
At home

589
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,900
At, uh...

590
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,020
On the airwaves

591
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,880
This is Reverend Ivan Stang

592
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,040
With Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

593
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,540
And we'd better stop and explain

594
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,320
Just...

595
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,600
And credit, at least

596
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,300
We can't ever explain

597
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,000
Who those fools making those weird noises were

598
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,660
That we were playing on your radio

599
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,000
Quite a bit of their...

600
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,040
Was the, um...

601
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,680
The show

602
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,740
Less than an hour

603
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,220
More than...

604
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,920
Or less than a show

605
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,700
More than an hour

606
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,840
From San Francisco

607
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,560
Or the Berkeley show

608
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,820
Puzzling evidence

609
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,980
Dr. Gary Brobe-Fran

610
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,240
Dr. Howell

611
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,680
And, um...

612
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,580
Various insidious guests

613
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,100
Mobius Rex and so forth

614
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,140
And evil subgeniuses

615
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,080
Intermixed with a, uh...

616
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,300
A tape from, uh...

617
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,740
Bishop Huey of Houston

618
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,680
The Bishop of...

619
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,660
Archbishop of Houston

620
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,900
On, uh...

621
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,400
A sister station down there

622
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,560
He sends these tapes

623
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
That are always labeled

624
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,540
Collages from Hell

625
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,280
Of volumes 19 through 46

626
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,480
So, yeah, some...

627
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,500
So, dear friends

628
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,140
Once again, as we saw it

629
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,800
Uh...

630
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,360
We come to the end of this side of the show

631
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,400
Once again, you'll have to...

632
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,080
Turn your show over

633
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,540
Turn...

634
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,520
Turn your radio over

635
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,260
Flip it

636
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,440
So that you can hear the rest

637
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,560
The subgenius radio ministry

638
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,620
Hour of Slack

639
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

640
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

641
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah

642
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

643
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,460
All over again

644
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,460
Over and over and over

645
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,040
Send the audio...

646
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

647
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,320
Too much.

648
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,340
Too much.

649
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,340
I already know

650
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,400
alaraching orders

651
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,100
outweigh everything

652
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,280
Formal sitting

653
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,180
Welcome to side two of your radio show

654
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,120
Ah, yes, dear friends

655
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,700
We're back and boy it's getting tough doing these shows night after night after night. It's easy for you

656
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,940
You only have to listen once a week, but we do ten shows a day. We have to keep up stay ahead

657
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,980
What is that noise I have no idea I think it might be the exits on the outside of the hall

658
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,780
Yeah, I can hear the hiss the air noise

659
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,020
But we're still on the fringes of the atmosphere. You know that's just now what happens if I push this place a problem

660
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,160
Oh

661
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,240
Running up deep magnetize. Oh, you can hear us

662
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,280
What if we

663
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,460
Here we go

664
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:51,840
There with the mystery in the magic right there, why did you have to say that heroic legend ages past time?

665
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,480
Is this a time magazine about

666
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,800
Okay, a

667
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,960
feast for the

668
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,800
Eye minded we don't want to do that. So I think he's right

669
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,760
No, I use the term he to describe all aliens of color show

670
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,980
I think you and your family with adventure as the ingenious human if that's an it

671
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,920
What is that? I want to get to get to first time by the editors of the book of the subject

672
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,120
Yes, all of the show was getting fixed. They were fixing the show

673
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,460
And nobody knew exactly where it was publishing guides you through this intriguing

674
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,620
I'm an unique and spectacular family library the book of the subject

675
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:43,840
There with the mystery in the magic right there, why do you have to say that?

676
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,580
Gary we just

677
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:52,840
The mystery in the magic yeah, it's all you use a million gigawatts of electricity to extract souls up here

678
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,180
The energy is released psychoactively and with simple chemicals down there

679
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,540
And we never free base soul either. I mean that's really bad

680
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,860
Just drinking it. That's all

681
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,940
drinking it and snorting it I

682
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,300
like a little I

683
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,780
Like a little iced soul myself. I

684
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,920
Like it best out of balloons to tell the truth

685
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,280
That is my favorite way of

686
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,660
Doing up some soul

687
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,100
Yeah, tank souls good stuff

688
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:31,480
High pressure tank so this the pure stuff straight out straight out. That's just the cook it, you know

689
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,820
And then it turns into a gas

690
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:39,500
And then they pump it under pressure. They scrub it. They scrub it through dogma filters and and

691
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,840
Stuff like that to make sure because when you get into that excited estate every little part of the soul

692
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:51,320
Separates from every other so you get little pockets of you know stuff that was like childhood dogma rammed into you

693
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,660
So they scrub that all out so it becomes it's the most pure form in gaseous form. Oh, yeah, but the only

694
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,240
problem is that you know the people that

695
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,160
End up banging their head against the wall all night long because I can't stop there in such ecstasy or whatever

696
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,520
people fall down floor being this the beingness of it

697
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,380
They you know makes them for some reason chew the ground. I had that's what I did. That's how my jaw got messed up

698
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:26,040
You know you can talk up chewing the ground. Yes, woke up. I loved Mother Earth. I woke up chewing made a big mess

699
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,100
Yeah, you can tell that

700
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,400
That the soul really affects people more in gaseous states

701
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Because the minute they speak out their voice isn't the same you know that goes directly

702
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,440
Directly to the to the main gland

703
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,060
It just diffuses in the blood so fast

704
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,400
Slow it down and it's like old TV shows, but in between

705
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
the lines are these even more

706
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,800
These incredibly fast

707
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,260
micro

708
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,800
Blips of sound we have not been able to stretch out and I'm a stress even I mean the best

709
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,340
I mean see the one space between the blips

710
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,380
Maybe the spaces between the blips of the actual message. Yeah, but we can't slow it down that much

711
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,640
I mean you can't differentiate the machines won't

712
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,300
It's alien it is that it is the truly a great signal. It's like your music but

713
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,500
What?

714
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,840
60 gigahertz band right?

715
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,940
Yeah, that was a great band then their whatever happened to them

716
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:41,800
They're they're playing the hydrogen flying now, I think I think it's just one of their numbers coming in right now on Channel 7

717
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,000
I

718
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,420
Love

719
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,420


720
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,620
Love

721
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:44,960
You

722
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,680
Love

723
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,140
You

724
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,640
Oh, oh

725
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
I'm sorry.

726
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,240
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,060
I'm sorry.

728
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm sorry.

729
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,640
I'm sorry.

730
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,060
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:03,980
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,040
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,400
I'll take you out with me so you can hear what it's like outside where I live.

734
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,520
I notice you don't hear too many cars.

735
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,460
But you hear a lot of bugs and a lot of birds.

736
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,660
That was Bubba Gee.

737
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Say hi to the people.

738
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,480
You care about your special friend, and it cares about you.

739
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,360
That's how the Care Bears came to be.

740
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,420
Just listen, and turn the page when you hear the music box.

741
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,420
What do you think?

742
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,600
The resulting whine was almost unbearable.

743
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,620
We've entered the final tribulation period.

744
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,460
I believe we'll know when it happens.

745
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,080
I don't know yet exactly how we'll know that it has happened,

746
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,940
but I believe with all my heart that when we get there,

747
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,340
we're going to know what has happened.

748
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,320
The true believers will know because they know what the character

749
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
of the final tribulation period is.

750
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,740
The final tribulation period is that time when no one else is being saved.

751
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,120
And when the church has become so apostate,

752
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,020
the denominations and congregations,

753
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:39,400
it's almost impossible to find one that is left that is true to the word of God.

754
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,080
The day the world ended is here.

755
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,980
Shocking, terrifying horror.

756
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,740
See the world ended by atomic fury.

757
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,080
See the horrible mutant who seeks a mate.

758
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,400
See the terrifying beast on the ocean floor.

759
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,700
See the battle for life at the bottom of the sea.

760
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,060
Yes, see the fantastic world of death and horror

761
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,820
in the...

762
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,480
Top Shock Show of all time.

763
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,020
Generic giant crab music with Overlord Huey.

764
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,060
Good fight to the gods with your personal friend, Bishop Huey.

765
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,400
Well, this is your pal, Colonel Huey, and this is Nightcrawler's Lament.

766
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm going to teach you to talk like a horrible Texas trucker in no time.

767
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,520
Well, despite numerous protests from the leading substantial citizens,

768
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,220
here I am again, your pal and temporary father figure,

769
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
Mr. Huey with another danger run.

770
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,660
This is the club car on the hill-bound train.

771
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,080
Why it's called that...

772
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,580
Go!

773
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,820
Don't forget, boy.

774
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,240
Look over your shoulder,

775
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,820
cause there's always someone coming after you.

776
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

777
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,800
Ha ha ha ha ha.

778
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,180
Save me! Save me!

779
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,640
Save me!

780
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,080
Okay, it's about...

781
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,740
We are advancing constantly, and we're not interested in holding on to anything except the enemy.

782
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,160
We're going to hold on to him by the nose, and we're going to kick him in the ass.

783
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,480
We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time, and we're going to go through him like crap through a goose.

784
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,920
I thought she was born a long, long time ago.

785
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,400
You have reached the correct number.

786
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,800
However, your call has already been analyzed and rejected.

787
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,880
This matter is out of our hands.

788
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,960
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on Earth,

789
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:45,160
and gain control of the situation, we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

790
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:53,080
If this had been an actual phone call, you would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time, and message when you hear the tone.

791
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,200
Thank you.

792
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,800
Somebody please.

793
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,100
Thank you.

794
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,900
Thank you.

795
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,900
This is oral fixation.

796
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,040
This is oral fixation, which is a bunch of members of the Severn Institute.

797
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,540
It's their selection of material that is the best thing.

798
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,320
And these guys play on stage.

799
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,180
They do this as a live show, but they don't actually sing.

800
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,260
They play the tape.

801
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,240
So it's true.

802
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,140
Thank you.

803
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,120
Oh.

804
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,300
Thank you.

805
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,640
Thank you.

806
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,880
Thank you.

807
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,980
Thank you.

808
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,820
Thank you.

809
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,140
This is real neo-psychedelia.

810
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,540
This is when, after the day after, this will be rock and roll.

811
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,860
You know, this is a vision of our future.

812
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,200
Yeah, well, nothing electrical will work.

813
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,300
No magnetic motor will work.

814
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,200
Except tape decks.

815
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,020
No, the tape won't work.

816
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,900
Nothing will work.

817
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,460
And this is going to be rock and roll after the apocalypse,

818
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:16,580
after the kiss, the lightning kiss of Wotan's judgment.

819
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,540
Oh, yes.

820
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,040
Yeah, this is their breeze.

821
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,980
This is a gentle breeze from Wotan's armpit.

822
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,640
Oh, no, they've stuck.

823
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,220
The craze of greater boldness.

824
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,320
Baltimore.

825
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,080
As related to the Crank Boys.

826
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,920
Yeah, they're part of the Crank Boys, too.

827
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,720
They never sleep.

828
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,820
That's right.

829
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,720
They never sleep.

830
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
Car mechanic boys.

831
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,120
Yes, sir, if you want to get your heads milled at 445 in the morning,

832
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,020
go to Crank Boys.

833
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,960
All Crank Boys.

834
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,580
Ask for Doug Zero.

835
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,400
I hope they do it.

836
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,980
Oh, no.

837
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,300
Oh, no.

838
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,400
Oh, no.

839
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,780
Oh, no.

840
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,480
Oh, no.

841
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,380
Oh, no.

842
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:16,660
Oh, no.

843
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,340
Oh, no.

844
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,660
Oh, no.

845
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,240
Oh, no.

846
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:18,660
Oh, no.

847
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:18,860
Oh, no.

848
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,320
Oh, no.

849
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,620
Oh, no.

850
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:22,980


851
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,180
Oh, no.

852
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,180
Oh, no.

853
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,180


854
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,180


855
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,180


856
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,180


857
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,520
Oh, no.

858
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,020
I love it.

859
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,480
Oh, no.

860
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,020
Oh, no.

861
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,500
Oh, no.

862
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:28,860
Oh, no.

863
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,540
Oh, no.

864
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:29,540


865
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:29,540


866
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:29,980
Okay.

867
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,580
I can't keep up with this stuff anymore.

868
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,580
Look at all this trash.

869
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,480
It's too many shows.

870
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,080
It's, uh...

871
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,420
Yeah.

872
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,700
We're going to go to Missouri for their show now.

873
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,420
We need some help from 1,000 doctors.

874
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,540
We need, yes, at least 1,000 doctors.

875
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,560
Once, doctors for Wotan.

876
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,800
This is Dr. Philo Drummond and his...

877
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,540
And the band of...

878
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,080
now called Swinging Love Corpses, or The Cups,

879
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,220
a great neo-psychedelia band that started out once as Doctors for Wotan,

880
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,440
now including other members such as Sphinx Drummond and Crazy Ray Hay.

881
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,360
Oh, Ray Hay.

882
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,960
He's a wild guitarist.

883
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,180
Ooh, there's a man.

884
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:24,340
Oh, Ray Hay.

885
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, Ray Hay.

886
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,660
Oh, Ray Hay.

887
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,300
Oh, Ray Hay.

888
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:28,640
Oh, Ray Hay.

889
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,100
Oh, Ray Hay.

890
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,020
Oh, Ray Hay.

891
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,940
Oh, Ray Hay.

892
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:14,780
Oh, Ray Hay.

893
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,600
I mean, my love for you is so great, so real, so large.

894
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,820
And you and I are too small to hold on to.

895
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,700
You've got to understand it takes a big man a day to get up to that bottom.

896
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,360
All the love I have for you, baby.

897
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,440
And sometimes I just can't even bottle up inside.

898
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,920
I've got to get it out of me.

899
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,040
I've got to get out and I've got to shout about it.

900
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,140
I mean, baby, I mean.

901
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,880
I don't know what it's like.

902
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,400
But sometimes it's just too much, even for me.

903
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:56,440
A man like me to handle all the love that I have for you.

904
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:02,040
I mean, I can't even hardly get a grip on it, if you know what I mean.

905
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,960
Yes, ma'am.

906
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,520
Oh, honey.

907
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,200
You know, I love you.

908
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,200
Whoo!

909
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,820
Yeah.

910
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,680
Whoo!

911
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,880
Oh, baby.

912
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,280
Ah, sometimes I just get all heated up.

913
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,020
I've got to play a song for you, mama.

914
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,900
It goes like this.

915
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,140
Whoo!

916
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,260
Whoo!

917
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,040
Whoo!

918
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,640
Whoo!

919
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,000


920
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:46,440


921
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:46,500
Whoo!

922
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


923
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


924
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


925
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


926
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


927
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


928
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


929
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


930
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


931
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,500


932
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,320
History.

933
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


934
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


935
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


936
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,820
Over here, baby.

937
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,300
This love ain't so bad.

938
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,060
Oh, baby.

939
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,460
I gotta love for you.

940
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,540
My love, yours is all.

941
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,980
Massive-sized, industrial striker.

942
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,580
Love, for you, baby.

943
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,420
Let's butart.

944
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:16,480
Oh, yeah.

945
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:30,060
I mean, I tell the boys about what it was like last time.

946
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:37,280
They all know what kind of a love we have because I've told them many times that your love is like God in love.

947
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,980
And honey, you know what it makes me feel?

948
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,060
It makes me feel...

949
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,460
Oh, baby, I mean, I just can't love you like I love you.

950
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,460
Is that thing for real, baby?

951
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,420
And I just got to tell the boys about it the next day because that makes me feel like I was such a man when they say,

952
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,560
Charlie, man, you got to love like I never heard about it before.

953
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,880
Is that thing for real, baby?

954
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,400
Oh, baby, I mean, baby, it makes me...

955
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,700
Oh, damn it, bitch.

956
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,180
I mean, hell, mama.

957
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,320
It makes me have to...

958
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,800
It makes me have to play a song for you, mama.

959
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,320
It goes like this.

960
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,120
It has to be technician.

961
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,060
It's a...

962
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,140
First, with electronic mind control.

963
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,000
Know what I mean?

964
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,280
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

965
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,920
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

966
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,040
Satanic radio at its finest.

967
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
Can you repeat that?

968
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:58,500
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

969
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,300
Yes.

970
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,660
There's no one to hire me.

971
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,380
There's no one to hire me.

972
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,360
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

973
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:14,840
It's a...

974
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,460
It makes me feel...

975
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,000
It's a war.

976
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,480
And they couldn't tell me what it was for.

977
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,920
But there's a starting line.

978
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,200
Something we can try.

979
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,600
You know.

980
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,540
You know.

981
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,380
My God, I...

982
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,080
Actually pity those poor bastards.

983
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,020
We're going up against...

984
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,660
By God, I do.

985
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,240
We're not just going to shoot the bastard.

986
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,060
We're going to cut out their living guts.

987
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,460
And you...

988
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,280
Use them to grease the treads of our tanks.

989
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,980
We're going to murder those lousy hun bastards by the bushel.

990
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,980
What about itching from within?

991
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,740
Some people have persistent skin diseases which make them itch.

992
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,220
At times, things we swallow.

993
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,700
From a particular food to a medication can cause us to itch with or without a visible rash.

994
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,520
He'll be a man.

995
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,500
They'll test one day.

996
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,400
Have him win.

997
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,240
The Green Beret.

998
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,880
Now that I've made this promise,

999
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:48,880


1000
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:55,700
And all I'll get is...

1001
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,140
Holding .

1002
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,980
Knowing.

1003
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,360
Closing all.

1004
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,820
Yeah, yeah, it's a long story, you SillyBoy.

1005
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,240
Time back up my entire Also Hannah�ル.

1006
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,240


1007
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,240


1008
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,240


1009
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,240


1010
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,600
I think...

1011
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,140
I'm going to talk to you and everything will end up...

1012
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,140


1013
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,580
Congrats.

1014
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,700
See you later, Linda.

1015
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:15,720


1016
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
My baby, my baby.

1017
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,240
My baby, my baby.

1018
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,920
How many more times do we have to listen?

1019
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:29,560
How many more times do we have to hear the worst song ever?

1020
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,300
This band is terrible tonight.

1021
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,060
They just want to fall asleep.

1022
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,320
And the audience is going in every different direction possible.

1023
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,700
They're sick of us.

1024
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,720
They're sick of the Cafe de Preso.

1025
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,100
Yeah, they're sick of everything here.

1026
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,420
They only know three chords, but you're only going to see them play one.

1027
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,960
I'm so tired of these guys.

1028
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,120
This band's bad.

1029
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,740
It's no surprise.

1030
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,040
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away.

1031
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,460
Well, how many times...

1032
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,080
Do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

1033
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,640
Goethe, Goethe, Goethe.

1034
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,300
Oh, Goethe, let me clean your toes with my mouth.

1035
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,480
Sonny, if you want it, here it is.

1036
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,900
Come and get it.

1037
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,760
But you better hurry, cause it's going fast.

1038
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,320
You better hurry.

1039
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,460
I told you that faulty autopilot module was going to give us some trouble sooner or later.

1040
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,500
You got the whole damn side of the show caved in.

1041
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,820
Oh, well, it's my cousin worked on it, see?

1042
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,160
That was the problem.

1043
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:05,480
I took it to my cousin instead of letting the Tibetans, the old experts, fix them.

1044
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,280
Well, we got to dock with the show in eight minutes and 32 seconds.

1045
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,700
It's show number four, and look at that.

1046
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:15,720
And if we run out of tape before that, then we won't be docking with nothing.

1047
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,680
We'll be cast adrift in the airwaves.

1048
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:25,720
No, if you're not on tape, friend, on the airwaves, you just, you're ripe for piracy.

1049
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:26,900
Yes, indeed.

1050
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,040
Airwave piracy.

1051
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,700
They're bootlegging us right now.

1052
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,840
Everything we say right now is being sold.

1053
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,600
Sold somewhere.

1054
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,340
Somewhere.

1055
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:39,200
Being sucked out of the heavens, out of our orbital transmitter by some big old pirate ground dish.

1056
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,640
Bootleggers.

1057
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,080
Stinking bootleggers.

1058
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,200
But they're going to find out.

1059
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,480
You can't bootleg Bob.

1060
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,360
You can't bootleg Bob for too long.

1061
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,120
You got to pay your dues to Bob and the Foundation for Salvation, friends.

1062
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,980
Any old Bob show, you just pirate and start sending around.

1063
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:00,840
People are going to start falling down and not remembering what they listened to and foaming at the mouth and having strange hallucinations.

1064
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,180
Yeah.

1065
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,820
All kinds of excess buzzing around their rooms.

1066
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,300
Confusing.

1067
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,680
It can get really tough.

1068
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,240
Beating on their walls.

1069
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,720
It can be difficult.

1070
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,700
Making their TV sets not work right.

1071
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,740
And they're saying, why me?

1072
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,640
What did I do?

1073
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,500
Yeah, you didn't pay your dues.

1074
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
That's very, very interesting.

1075
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,080
That's not interesting at all.

1076
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,280
I mean, that's very interesting.

1077
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,880
That's not interesting at all.

1078
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,740
I know they have to be listening to this show.

1079
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,380
And why do I even care what the answer could be?

1080
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,980
I'll take your earphones off.

1081
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:38,120
I'll tell you because deep down inside, deep down inside, friends, you know that this is the truth.

1082
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,300
The ultimate truth.

1083
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,500
Oh, man.
