Hi Bob! Hi Bob! Hi Bob! Hi Rick!
Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan! Hi Satan!
You better get out of here fast before I call the police.
Okay. Let's have a scene with the Bobbies.
Let's get them all in here. I'll tell them the whole thing.
What whole thing?
The show begins.
Power of the One.
Come on, Bob. For old time's sake, huh?
Did you just call me...
Blob?
I don't know, but...
I told you not to mention his name. Why'd you call him Blob?
I didn't call him Blob. I said Bob.
Enjoy, Bob.
It's Bob.
Aw, crap. When I want to laugh, I'll take Bob. Thank you very much.
What is that?
Pause it.
A Bob?
Well, this is a full-fledged aggressive Bob, alright?
And I don't know what's going on, but it should not be in this man's kitchen.
And if it is, he should turn and run.
Not try to reason with it.
What's your problem, Bob?
Oh boy, look out. Look out, here it comes.
We are building a Bobtopia.
Oh, it's all coming together.
What the fuck is going on here?
They're all pink on the inside.
It's a sea of Bobs.
I say hey to Bob, they say back hey to Bob.
Say hey to Bob, hey to Bob, hey to Bob, hey to Bob, hey to Bob.
Bob, hey, you look good. Bob, Bob, you look good.
I got some surprises for you, too.
I'm looking forward to a surprise, then.
Good.
Um, I'm gonna need a little help.
And I would like to bring out my assistant, Bob.
Ah! Pink!
Oh no, pink! Pink! Pink!
It's all over. It's all over.
No one's going to notice if you're pink.
Wait a minute. Go back.
Zoom in.
Where's that man, Pink?
Oh, sorry I can't open the door, but I don't want Bob sneaking back in the house again.
Oh, that's okay. I just came by to see how you're doing.
Oh, I'm working through some things.
I've gotten past denial and I'm well on my way to acceptance, so...
Yeah, yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. Anyway...
Take Bob back.
I bet I can't do that right now.
I've talked to Bob and he's really sorry.
Now be a sport and take him back.
I can't.
Take him back!
No!
Take him!
No!
Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.

I'll let him go or who are you?




Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.
Zip, zip, zip.
Well, who are you?
I'm Bob.
Interesting gene pool.
Don't cast aspersions at my family.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Why is Pink?
Whose is Pink?

Whose is Pink?

What?
It's pink!
Oh, hey!
The sky was on fire
when I walked to the mill
To take up the slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky, slacky
wonty, round and round the cobber's bench
the monkey chased the weasel
The monkey thought it was all in fun
goes the weasel
A penny for a spool of thread
A penny for a needle
That's the way the money goes
goes the weasel
Uh, hi.
Uh, y-yeah, okay.
Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.
We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you.
They're experts at what they know
our viewers. Today's guest is Bob. Hi, Bob. So, Bob, so you just get in town? So,
so what have you been up to? He was my best friend before Bob was my best friend.
He's been with me through so much. And that's the way Bob has set that system.
I'm a mental slave. So if you could just free yourself. Free your mind. From mental slavery.
That is the key.
Feel my altitude flowing high through salvation. Distracting me from the rules.
It's right.
The wind, a wave of blues
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Fluttering like a butterfly through the trees
Crossing all the lines of limitation
Now I'm finding all of mine among the leaves
Releasing all my hesitation
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Feel my altitude
Flowing high through salvation
Distracting me from the rules
Drive the wind away from blues
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Distracting me from the rules
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Passing birds I see
Rainbow clouds are luxuries
Feel my mind erased
It's all adapted from the earth
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Fluttering like a butterfly
Through the trees
Crossing all the lines of limitation
Now I'm finding all of mine among the leaves
Releasing all my hesitation
Dressing like a butterfly
Through the trees
Crossing all the lines of limitation
Now I'm finding all of mine among the leaves
Releasing all my hesitation
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Blasting through the hymen
Not because Simon says so
Sucking juices from leaves, stems and roots
Far away from passports
Number one still told who?
Wiggle army, wig outs
Flutter, not parquet
I'm talking about flutter
Flutter butter
Fly butterfly
And the dream catcher's calling you again
And the bees I've seized
And all of these
Fluttering like a butterfly
Through the trees
Butterfly
Dab, changes in alle the Forever
From all of me
Together we are
Ready for a new
Nemesis
The world is fine

Let's go
guitar solo
guitar solo
guitar solo
That was Fishbone,
the song Flutter Butter
from their 2011 album
Crazy Glue, which I think
the band itself sent me last
year, which is strange,
because they've been around exactly as long as the
Church of the Subgenius, and are pretty
well known, at least among musicians,
especially bull-dotted musicians.
More of them next
week. This is
Hour of Slack number 1420.
13, and the collage parts,
such as the beginning,
are all by The Large,
who sent quite a large
stash of pretty incredible bob-ish
clips from here,
there, and everywhere.
Much more of that coming up, as
well as music by a band he
found for us,
Sultans of Blin,
and, of course, some fresh
new Rudy Schwartz project,
but the gapping, yakking, gabbing,
and gibbering part of this show all
comes from the Ask Dr. Hal
show of February 22,
2013,
on Radio Valencia in
San Francisco.
Welcome,
friends,
and

am not
sure about things tonight.
For some reason,
I'm not even
hearing myself, but the compressor
never lies. So, welcome
again to the Ask
Dr. Hal show, live
on
radio.
Radio.
And now, ladies
and gentlemen, prepare yourself.
The Ask Dr. Hal show
is here
upon you.
Get it
off!
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
it is I, Dr. Howland
Owl, and I'm
here with my
dear friend,
Ivan Stang,
of the Church of the Subgenius.
Yes, our atmosphere
is not what he's used to.
Different atmosphere, different
pressure.
Oh, that's so much better. Oh, thank you.
And so Stang struggled,
as only the nobly
born must, with the
horrible clouds of toxins
surrounding him.
But with that music comes
air.
Yes, it's so airy.
Monster music provides the
air, the atmosphere of our
lives. Although no
other microphones are viable.
This is the same situation that we had the other night.
It requires a K-Rob
or a Pete Goldie to set things
to right.
Somebody knows what that
O-N symbol
means on that.
Well, you're welcome to
fly.
There must be a button.
On the other hand, I don't see why
we can't simply use
two microphones and each
share one.
Rather than go endlessly
dithering and nattering about the equipment.
Possibly altering it
and making things worse.
Does anybody have any chiclets?
If we're going to share microphones.
I mean, for Philo. Have any whatlets?
Chiclets, or breathless.
I can offer you a piece of root
beer float
flavored sugarless gum.
No, that's for Philo.
Give it to him.
He hasn't cleaned his false teeth in a while.
Do you need a piece of that gum that I
described to you?
This is a new gum that has just come out
from Dessert
Delights, from Extra.
Part of their Dessert Delights
series. I think you'll be...
What does it do with that thing?
That...
Once again, the thing...
Well, when K-Rob fixed it the other day,
he used this thing here.
Well, here's where those mics are going in.
Do you dare to
push buttons on the thing?
Not me.
Not I,
said the lazy horse.
Not I, said the big fat pig.
Get back there and arrange yourself
in a comfortable way, because we're in
for the long haul
here on this show.
That was good.
Greetings in the precious name of our
beloved Lord Satan. This is Jack Chick
speaking. As believers in Satan,
we have great powers of darkness
given to us by Jesus.
Because we are his joint,
but if the Lord touches your relatives,
friends, or whoever, please feel free to
reproduce. This tape is going
to share with you how to confront
Jesus Christ. I call
this tape, The Bible, Part 1.
And it is a very
heavy tape, heavy information.
And I doubt if most
Christians can handle it.
The only ones who will are lost
souls of men who will travail
before the Lord and those on the street
and those whose hearts are really burdened.
This tape is also for pastors who mean business.
Pastors who believe the Bible to be
the word of Satan and who know
that business is alive and well on this planet
Earth.
I don't know if
listeners can hear it, but the phones are
lighting up. They're just going crazy
here.
You know, that could be one of those
excess technicians
advising
Is anybody there, said the listener?
to push.
Come on, speak up. You call.
I need to know if someone is speaking.
Everything is turned on, according to
Hoyle, but it could be that we can't receive
calls either. That may be.
Can I talk to you about Jesus?
No, we don't wish to talk about
Jesus, who was a sorcerer of the left-hand
path. On this...
What?
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
He fits the pattern. He fits the pattern
completely. But what...
An angel of light. Are you going to come down
here where we have Ivan
staying in Philodrome
and where we're supposed to have puzzling evidence
but don't?
Because he's gone.
He's a gone gosling.
Jesus has been helping me
with some drywall and painting all week.
You don't even want me to tell you about him?
Not right now, because this isn't
the Jesus show, but the Dr. Hal.
The Lord is not slack, as men
count slackness. Amen.
Abadiah 9.17.
And
Yehob
smote Sinab
upon the crown, and
lo, his knees
smote together, and his bowels
turned to water, and he
fell, staining the
ground.
Very good,
Dr. Goldie. You will
make sense of this electronic spaghetti.
And liberate the station so a thousand
virile subgenius voices
can chant their...
Oh, there he's gone.
Was that that hearing expert, Pete Goldie?
Who's over...
Wow, all of a sudden everything's
shaky. Oh, don't worry about it.
Pete Goldie's going to come down. He's going to fix everything
up. He knows how to turn these
knobs and twist these dials
and so on. And maybe he won't do it at
60 miles an hour, so I'll be able
to see how he does it. Or maybe
he'll even have the patience, though this is
not likely, to let me
do it, because doing something
yourself is the way to learn
it, not watch somebody else
perform slate of hand
with a vastly complicated
array of instruments,
switches, flashing lights, and
what have you. What about this
shiny candy-like button?
The history erase button?
Oh, there's no candy here.
I assure you,
we don't have candy on this
program. Did I just hear
a car go by outside?
Yes, because we believe
we believe in the
ambient noise of our pulsating
mission neighborhood being part
of our sonic record.
So those screams weren't just a sound
effect record.
I think somebody out there
was sincerely calling for help.
I thought it was just
crazy sound effects
and movie soundtracks
that these radio shows...
Incredible what they can do with special effects
these days.
But the electro-hypnotic ray,
are you sure this experiment won't hurt him in any way?
Oh, absolutely sure.
Well, but
what's that thing up near his head that looks like
a miniature power plant with a loudspeaker
on top of it? That, Wilma,
is my latest scientific achievement.
My newly perfected
electro-hypno-mentalophone.
Your what? Well,
you remember the mentaloscope, don't you?
Sure. And this is an adaptation of it.
With this,
the electro-hypno-mentalophone,
the memories of the subject will come to us
verbally, through the loudspeaker here.
The music.
Back! I created you! Back! Back!
The wolfman.
The wolfman.
Larry Talbot.
Yes, he went searching
for Viseria
in the company of the old
wise woman of the gypsies,
Malaifa.
The path you follow
is thorny, my son.
Hey, how'd you like the new Wolfman movie
where Claude Rains
turns out to be a werewolf
and tries to kill his own son?
It's Anthony Hopkins in the
mod version.
You mean that wasn't
Lon Chaney in the junior?
Sir Lawrence Talbot's
unlikely offspring
is Guillermo del Toro.
But, I gotta say...
No, I'm sorry, Benicio del Toro.
I got those mixed up on a show
the other day.
Yeah, and that's no bull, too,
but it's important to keep them apart.
Anyway, even more unlikely
is it that Claude Rains would sire
Lon Chaney Jr.,
this bumbling stumbler who says,
I can't get my hands around
this werewolf thing. Give me something to do
with my hands. I can build a radio.
You know, even as a kid,
I intuited
that Lon Jr. was,
a bad actor.
Or, not a great actor,
shall we say.
What about his immortal interpretation
of Lenny in
Of Mice and Men?
Now, you know, I never saw that, but he got an Academy Award
or a nomination or something for that.
And he was eternally imitated
on Warner Brothers cartoons with
Which way did he go, George? Which way did he go?
His whole performance became
a meme
in the world of that time.
I want to squeeze a little bunny
and squeeze him and squeeze him
and love him so much.
Well, that was in that satirical cartoon
by Tex Avery called Lonesome Lenny.
Boy,
Dr. Howell
truly knows
all and sees all
and has seen all
kids programming.
As many cartoons as I could.
Sure. I still watch all the
cartoons that I can.
That's right.
Every now and then there's a good one.
That's right.
Even the modern ones are sometimes good.
I saw a cartoon just about an hour ago
in your house that you had drawn on a flip-it book.
Oh, yes. I have plenty of those things.
Those animation things.
You know, Dr. Howell, I have a sad story
I can tell very quickly.
But in third and fourth and fifth grade
I made over 100
little animated flip-it books
including a series
called 101 Tortures.
Although I ran out after about ten.
I'll bet those were great.
Well, the sad thing is
when my family moved from Fort Worth to Dallas
I thought, these Dallas kids don't know I'm a weirdo.
I'm going to destroy all my comics
and burn them and then I'll
become a normal person and I'll get a girlfriend.
Friends,
don't even bother.
It doesn't work. Keep your comics.
You can't. You can try to pass.
But they'll still know.
Instead, what you should do is
embrace your abnormality potential
and drive it to the hill.
In their faces.
Easy for me to say.
It may not be the best way to get a job
or a girlfriend, but
believe me, it beats burning up all your
handmade torture comics.
I wouldn't have a single one
except that good old school teacher
of mine, say, from fourth grade.
That the teacher confiscated from you?
No, she helped me.
She encouraged me.
I had a good teacher
in fourth grade.
Great Mrs. Neendorf.
She will be elevated our next day.
Very good.
Mrs. Darden, my fifth grade teacher,
shall be resurrected only so that she may
experience pain forever.
Yes, I know what you mean about that, too.
You had a Mrs. Darden or two, I suppose.
Yes, third grade was good,
but fourth and fifth got weird.
Well, kids, no matter how bad it is,
it could be worse.
And it'll probably get worse before it gets better.
But you don't know.
It just might get better.
My dad always told me
about a chemistry teacher
he had in his youth who went insane.
A huge man
with a black, square-cut
Assyrian beard
who came roaring into class
and shook up a bottle of Coca-Cola
and sprayed it all over the front rows
yelling,
Analyze this!
And was hauled away.
By the stereotypical men in white coats.
He later founded the band GWAR,
which stands in front of audiences
spraying them with yellow-colored liquids,
red-colored liquids,
and foamy, white, gloopy liquids
out of their costume parts.
What of the limitless sex and violence
in the wake of red?
Is it on the way to murdering your horse?
It is to suck up

which are melted into juice
and are aproduct of the
aggression laid great by Chinooks.


such as the
196 ice- horizons
from the
rockby of the old
Thank you, GWAR, our old buddies.
In fact, the vocals on that cut were by Reverend Chuck Varga, also known as the Sex Executioner.
Believe it or not, I actually performed the wedding of the Sex Executioner on a tugboat in Manhattan,
about two blocks from Ground Zero of the World Trade Center.
And the clips from Jack Chick and the electro-hypnomenal phone came from Reverend Decapitator.
Anyway, back to the somewhat low-res recording, streamed from Radio Valencia of the Ask Dr. Hal show, which was real.
I must assert, again, this is not a tape of Ivan Stang.
You're actually hearing Ivan Stang because he's physically present here in our studio tonight.
Driver, driver.
And perhaps you think it's my journalistic duty to grill him intently about certain subgenius practices which have lately been in the news.
Uh, well, I don't need to tell your audience that they shouldn't believe everything they read or see on the news.
Even the internet sometimes can lead you astray.
And those supposedly scandalous X-Day films are actually...
...computations done at great expense and computation power by people who weren't actually present.
Well, and there were some that we just, you know, filmed as a joke, you know.
A joke?
Yeah, just a put-on. That's all. That's it. Yeah, it's a put-on.
It's a satire on mental illness.
Oh, yeah, like Mad Magazine. Right, yeah, like Mad Magazine. Right, right.
Yeah, yeah, like Mad Magazine, officer. You've read Mad Magazine, right?
Well, I guess so.
Oh, everybody seems to like it, so I guess you can get on your way.
No, please, really, keep your applause. It was nothing. Nothing at all.
Oh, it re... oh.
And now you see...
It wasn't nothing.
You can... a little more applause would hurt.
It does sound good on the album.
The album.
These fan-io-bums are not available in any store.
Not stored in any store.
They're sold in stores.
Did you eat at Papa Lotte, as I recommended?
No. Dr. Vredes took us to another place. I can't remember the name of it.
A good one, I trust.
Oh, it was great. It was wonderful.
It was...
They were handing out free soup to people who stood in line, and they preached the word of Jesus, and they had some nice free soup.
You had to listen to the Jesus stuff to get the soup, and is that the story?
Yeah, yeah. It was... yeah, but it was... the price was right.
Well, there is that.
All we had to do was listen to the...
The preacher was pretty good.
You can listen to all kinds of speech, if I...
So, yeah, Jesus is just all right with me.
He... we did have to part ways after that child custody case.
The Lord...
How are they doing over there in their foreign land?
Of Columbus, Georgia?
Oh, I thought they were in England still.
No, no, no. I've seen the child convo.
And?
The kid who was disputed. He was a surly teenager at Chris Lee's wedding.
Surly, eh?
For the first... he was with a buddy, and they made a big deal of how uninterested in all the silly wedding stuff they were,
until they got bored with being surly, and then they became the most helpful, pleasant teenagers.
Yeah, helping to clean up, probably snitching alcohol here and there, but they ended up being good boys, real good boys.
I see.
And there was another infant...
Ah, they're up to their boyishness.
...who was a little boyish.
There's a little infant, uh, Jesus Jr.
Jesus Jr.
Named, uh, Valentine...
Valentinos.
...Smith, uh, Devalaqua.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Valentine Smith as in the, uh...
Stranger?
No, I threw that in as if they named it after me, in my other, uh, when I'm from Ohio. I'm Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith goes to Washington.
I can't... people, you know, they... they approach you...
You go for donuts.
...and they'll... they'll... like, in my case, they'll say, uh, say, Mr. Stang, as if to let on they know that I'm not really a reverend.
Well, Bob, darn it!
I... I didn't go to Dobstown Divinity School for nothing. I am indeed a minister, and I am reverend... the... uh, Reverend Stang.
And if you have to say Mr., you can call me Agent Smith.
You didn't bring any of that pecan divinity along, I take it?
Uh, actually, I got a little bit in the... in the refrigerator. I almost said icebox.
Oh, buh-buh-buh-boy.
It gives away your age.
Oh, buh-buh-buh-boy.
When you call it an icebox, that's like, uh...
I know, it's a giveaway.
...saying LP or records.
It's a giveaway, uh, about... that one comes from an earlier cycle.
Uh...
You have to watch your language and not use archaisms or...
What record is that?
What record? Why...
What record?
I was playing the immortal music of Hans J. Salter, but otherwise...
I was, I was, uh... no, you're supposed to say, what's a record?
Oh, I see. What's a record?
You call CDs records.
CDs, those are grandpa things, aren't they? I mean, nobody uses those. So, you download it all.
As Lila said on Futurama, Fry's so funny, he still says ask instead of ax.
It's a sweet mellow cracking sound.
Individual circles smack flat on the surface, fry up to a golden brown.
Fryin' up to a golden brown.
Untold spatulas flick madly the pancakes that the crawdaddies crave.
The pancake's just like homemade.
Uncle Louie dances a light jig,
reservedly as if holding back the conclusion
for the lady batfish he most wishes to impress.
Each of them restrained, but not in such a way as to cause sexual tension.
A tray of crawfish is wheeled across the ballast,
but dear lord, somebody forgot the corn.
Oh, don't worry about it, they cackle,
with a chorus of overwrought cocksuredness.
They'll soon be gone,
there'll soon be a new crop,
and the harvest has been good.
Yes, there'll have to be a better crop,
because the harvest has most certainly been good.
Hush puppies snapped into clarity,
fried to a peppery golden brown.
Let's hope the Ku Klux Klan has cleared the litter from their mile of road.
East of town, a puckernut bush has yielded its crimson bounty,
but now its leaves betray a trace of sadness.
Is it the dryness of the season,
or are we just passing through another of those peculiar phases?
You know, when the billows piss a saline mist,
and the batfish begins to ponder,
we may be leaving this here bayou.
Yep, it might be time to be leaving this here bayou.
Oh, my God.
Welcome to tricks and tricks.
Appeared a little.
Well, yeah.
It's always a creep to understand

Dr. Drummond and Palmer Vredes are over by the window.
They need no broadcasting to entertain themselves.
They are happy with the social fabric seen so tellingly through the window,
the living tapestry which is the pulsating heart of San Francisco's mission district.
That's not the window. That's Philo's big smartphone.
Oh, well, your phone is so smart, huh?
Well, it's huge. It's one of those bay window sized phones.
It's a circus inside this tiny phone.
It's a drive-in theater sized smartphone.
Well, I want to watch Lawrence of Arabia on that.
I haven't seen a bunch of movies that I'd like to that have come out recently.
I kind of miss them. I miss them. I have to try to catch up later.
But, of course, since I'll ever watch our old monster movies,
I'll watch them when they're old and I'm older.
I suppose that's the only consolation I can give myself, eh, Stang?
Uh, no. Actually, if you wanted to read up on how to steal movies off the internet,
you could watch first run shows on your DVD player at home.
With Hulu, uh, Vudu, and, uh, well, uh...
Actually, I'm, I don't want to say exactly where the media ditches.
No, you should. You should, certainly.
But they leave, they leave movies laying around on the side of the information.
They're just littering the information highway.
Just, I mean, they're going to waste if you don't pick them up.
They're just litter. I suppose so.
I'm helping keep litter off the, uh, information highway
if I happen to get one of those Oscar review copies of, say, Argo or whatnot.
Well, I suppose, uh, you'd have not to mind that occasional lettering comes up saying,
This is the property of so-and-so motion pictures.
Do you get the, uh, instructions that come with your review copies for the Academy?
Yes, I do.
They tell you how to cut the seat, the DVD in half and, and strap it to the space shuttle reentry.
No, I haven't seen that one.
So it'll be burned up properly.
I haven't seen that one. And I'm not seeing Pete Goldie.
This is a matter of some concern because I did say only he could, uh, make it possible for a fire to...
That's not true. I think that puzzling evidence or K-Rob or God...
But none of those that you mention are present here.
We are bereft of God.
God is ev- but God is everywhere. Why, why don't we have God fix that thing?
God... I'm the holy man. I'm gonna do a prayer now.
God, would you come down here and fix that preamp?
Show us where that on button is, but don't blow up the station.
Thanks, God. Amen.
That should work.
Mighty talk from one who's running a well-publicized war on God.
But not only is Pete Goldie here, but he brought wine of the dreamers.
Wine is a mocker. Strong drink is raging.
Yes.
Lies.
That's- oh, that stuff's on sale around- on the corner.
Is that lies?
Yep.
Lies is here.
Philo is here.
I'm telling you.
I was told this wasn't Vredi.
Vredi's lies upon the couch, patiently waiting for some- something to happen.
Well, he might get hooked up with, uh, someone.
Yeah, we'll hook you up with somebody.
Boys?
Remember the old Good Sex for Mutants dating league in the early church of the Septuagint?
Well, you remember that well, I know.
No, I don't really.
Reverend Stang was-
Buck Naked invented it, and then it backfired on him, so he sold it for a dollar to Reverend Cat Lady in Salt Lake City.
That's what I remember. The Cat Lady's, uh, revenge, as it were.
She used it to get herself some good dates.
And, uh, so in that respect, it paid off for somebody.
Well, you see, a mutant got good sex, just as, uh, advertised.
I don't know about the good part, but it was something like-
It was sex, and it was judged to be good.
The mutant's part was definite.
We call them mutant.
The trigger for this journey is a childish word game, but there's something else to it.

One of my best friends, Bob, is Iranian.
And he's a really great writer.
And he's a really great writer.



But unfortunately, I've heard a lot of negative stuff about his country lately.
So, I'm gonna run it and find out the other side.
So, I'm gonna run it and find out the other side.
Bob, be careful. Don't hit yourself in the head.
Oh no! Bob! Bob! Are you okay?
Oh no.
Now watch the fight, Bob.
I'm not into boxing.
Same boxing kid.
It's politics.
Having a hard time with male potency?
Well I don't and I'm Bob.
What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob and I can get it up.
Whoa! Forgive me, Father.
Hey, Bob. Hold up there, Wonder Muffin.
Ratings are up another five.
Ugh!
You guys should give me another raise.
Actually, we've got an entirely new contract for you, Bob.
Five years exclusive with having his own age.
A-level storyline. Twenty minutes guaranteed screen time per episode.
Script approval.
That's a tall order, Bob.
He's in deep focus out there, Bob.
This obviously means a lot to him.
He shoots! It's going? Going?
Looks like Coop has made a dream come true for a very brave little...
Wow. The Lord must really have it in for that little boy.
Step out of the vehicle, please, sir.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Policeman, sir.
Right, I'd like your full name, please.
It's Bob.
You any idea how fast you were driving, sir?
Mega churches with his skills? Garbage.
It's like a bar, baby.
After the assassination...
Who's there?
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I got your message. His only visitor is his wife.
As a matter of fact, she's in with him...
His wife? He's been divorced for 20 years.
Call security, have him block the exits.
Connie?
Yeah. Alias brainwashed no more.
Ha.
And guess what? My ex-wife is now the proud owner of her own travel agency.
Life does go on, you know.
You know, losing you to another woman I could have dealt with,
losing him to the Foundation, that was too much.
Wait a minute here. Wait.
How come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
Who?
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
Well, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
That's not what the Harrisons said.
Who are the Harrisons?
The new people that moved in down the street.
Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus,
and they told him none of the religions were right.
Oh, did he now? What are they, religious kooks?
They're not kooks. They're cool.
How'd it go?
We're, uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
See? That's what happened to me.
Did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a New Testament to the Bible buried here in America?
What are you talking about?
Well, it's just that the Harrisons are really nice people,
and you should see how loving and together their family is.
I think there's something to that religion.
That's what the Harrisons are.
They made me think, too.
Bob's your uncle.
Here you go, Bob.
For some reason, Bob thinks that I am going to become a big old blimp again.
I know where Bob is hiding.
When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal.
And what makes your voice high?
Tight-bending underwear.
Helium!
Bob is in a blimp!
For the might of Bob.
Blasted helium.
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.
Ha, ha! That's better.
Dr. Howe don't know how to work the whole word.
Don't be bored, my dear friend.
You're a...
Dr. Royce will be heard presently.
What's that?
I'll translate for you, Phyla, since you're not heard yet.
Phyla said, what's that?
And then he said,
Translating to the heart first characters of birth and death.
Oh, there you go.
Now we...
I think I'm starting to hear you.
What do you do it again?
No, I'm just hearing you over my mic.
Why, this one...
My mic is not my mic.
My mic is not my mic.
Don't whine, little...
We will take you to the circus and on.
My mic!
Yes, your mic is an endless reverberation.
I'm falling like a dead man through the ten years of my life.
Through the ten years of my life!
Boy, those cheap special effects.
It's like when the zoom lens was invented in the 60s and suddenly...
And suddenly the 70s movies became unbearable.
With zooms everywhere.
And worst of all...
Only true folk would get away with it.
Quick zoom.
Zooming in time to music on zoom.
Rock and roll movies.
That was the worst.
What's that?
Knob Creek?
What is it?
It's Knob.
Urban whiskey.
But, you know, of course, Dr. Drummond is joking,
since we are not supposed to have any liquor or alcohol here present.
And we're not supposed to do all sorts of things.
All about those cool sound effects.
Yes, there am I.
Record.
There it is.
Broken radio stations of the 60s.
Ah, puzzling evidence uses sound effects records.
He's not too...
Hey, what happened to my mic?
Oh, there it is.
It's right there.
It's a chocolate M&M, but don't make large bumping, crashing, thumping sounds.
I played that thumping mic stand sound effect again, Dr. Howell.
I love that.
I won't do it.
That's cut number...
I won't do it.
23.
Microphone stand being thumped.
You know, hollow sound board.
Here it comes.
Thump.
Please.
Please don't.
That's my favorite one.
That's a good one.
You hear that in movies all the time.
Yeah, you could make a...
Put a music track and...
Don't blame me.
Put a music track and have a hit single based on the repetition of that particular sound.
Help.
Help.
I'm in trouble.
Help.
I've been clutched by a giant clam.
Um...
It is a shame we don't have a white pen that writes with luminous glowing.
Ink.
But, uh...
See if my pink and watery eyes can...
I have one.
Who is that that said, who was that?
Who dat?
Who say who dat?
That's the...
Yeah, okay.
That's the mic with the echo.
That is the...
One echo mic.
Asked by the icht of the nicht ich.
Ich.
Yes, uh...
That's a new subgenius god.
Right.
Ich, mich, ich, mich.
The me or the I and the not I.
I.
Yes, sir.
Some people have a knot head and some people have a wart nose.
Where did Dr. Goldie go?
He came and he bailed us out and...
Who was that masked man anyway?
Is he coming back?
Some people's nose runs and their feet smell.
They're bailed upside down.
Ye, ye, ye.
Uh...
Well, that's...
I just don't know why.
Jokes from a crackerback jock.
Part of these shows always plummet to the very depths.
Before rising to the...
Ice.
From ancient childish childhood playground rituals and rhymes.
To elevated scholarly rituals and rhymes.
Notions, lingerie.
All out.
Oh, wow.
Who has another bobbin like a new bobbin?
I hope you're not taking bobbins.
I'm taking your bobbin, your machine.
I think we've all reached the state of loopiness.
I'm freaking out because I pretty much have to tear.
I'm gonna tear apart my entire bag.
How's yours coming?
It's in like 15 pieces.
My brother knows Karl Marx.
He met him eating mushrooms in the people's park.
He said, what do you think about my manifesto?
I like your manifesto.
Put it to the testo.
Took a trip down to meet the anarchist party.
I met a goofy guy.
He was hardy fart.
He said, I know a little Latin and a cousin of Kai.
Said, I don't know what it means.
He said, neither do I.
Eat natural food.
I'm a man of the past.






I'm a man of the past.






Face whites deli.
Fill your nostrils.
Up with gravy!
Don't drink tea and don't drink coffee.

Dancing in the disco regarded, wait a minute,
world's me jumper.
World's me jumper.
World's me jumper.
World's me jumper.
World's me jumper.
I Έ��
Could I prowl through this field,

Disco, oh no, oh no
It's alright to say things can only get better
You have lost your brand new sweater
I know I had it on when I had my tea
And I'm sure I had it on in the lavatory, oh no
Dancing in the disco
Go, go, go
Dancing in the disco

Dancing in the disco, bumper to bumper
Wait a minute, where's the jumper?
Where's the jumper?
Where's the jumper?

It's alright to say things can only get better
You have lost your brand new sweater
Pure new wool and perfect stitches
Not the type of jumper that makes you itch, oh no
Dancing in the disco

Dancing in the disco
Oh no, oh no
And my mother would be so sad
And my sister would be so angry
And my brother would be so, so angry
And my girlfriend would be so, so angry
And my dog would be so, so angry
Cos I was dancing in the disco, bumper to bumper
Wait a minute, where's the jumper?
Where's the jumper?

The Sultans of Ping did that amazing song which reminds me of the Swingin' Love Corpses in its spasitude,
and which was embedded in the collages sent by The Large,
who sends those from Finland instantly, perhaps explaining why his English spelling is better than that of most Americans.
The music and spoken word piece about Louisiana Pancake Batfish was by, who else?
The Rudy Schwartz Project from the album Full Frontal Klugman.
The music behind me now is Ghetto Princess by the Psychoskeletons on SoundClick.com.
You're listening to The Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius.
Information about this show, all past shows, all our books, videos, our live events, all can be found at subgenius.com.
Including the May 31st Castro Theatre Agents of Chaos show.
And now, to end it, until next time, more from the Ask Dr. Hal show.
Praise Bob.
The thick black cloud was cleft, and still the moon was at its side.
And I could read each written word, and by the moonlight, not absurd, I swallowed my pride.
Oh, I see.
All the microphones are, uh, well, they're just covered by...
They're hatching from their little eggs.
The mics are working.
They're leathery eggs.
The little microphones are coming out one by one.
So, the whole stand, I mean, it's a mic and a stand.
So this is the only show that cares about using more than one microphone at a time.
Well, we have more than one performer, and it is a necessity.
But other shows on this station don't care about that.
That's because they're DJs who spin platters.
In the archaic, uh, term.
They call them records.
They call CD records.
Yes, they play some bully phonograph records on their gramophones.
But, uh, but we also, uh, participate in celebrating various forms of technological achievement.
How miraculous it is that a machine may speak in the breathy voice of a human being.
Well, the one that Palmer's standing in front of isn't speaking.
I don't think that, I don't think that mic there is on.
Colonel Roosevelt, please restrain yourself.
Audience, I'm referring to the mic on your, uh, what would be your left.
Now, this, uh, endless reverberation, is it possible to ameliorate that particular special effect?
Do you mind wandering in a labyrinth of echoes?
It's, that's a pretty subtle echo.
That was a good one.
Ah, it was a good one, all right.
It was a good echo.
So, uh, blow, beautiful.
Set the wild echoes flying.
I'm a hearing expert.
It adds.
It adds to the ambiance.
Hmm.
Well, uh, most people, uh, do wear earrings today, so you're not in any kind of a minority, if that's the case.
What we're going to do is explore some of the lesser known facts of subgenius history.
As we go slogging down that well-worn pathway.
Well, oh, all right.
Well, then we won't.
Instead, uh, let's throw it open and you, Ivan Stankin.
Oh, my God.
We said that.
Ah, that's a terrible, um, do you want some root beer float flavored gum to wash away this?
Oh, no, that makes me, oh!
Well, that would be a waste of some damn good gum.
Don't mention that stuff again.
All right, I, I won't speak of gum then.
That's quite all right.
Yeah, don't talk, just don't talk about gum.
Don't talk about Bob.
Don't talk about anything that's going to make me vomit again.
How about the, uh.
Unseemly.
Unseemly.

Going chat stream, uh, Dr. Pete Goldie, worker of miracles.
I'm not going to look at that.
Can we look at that and see what they're saying out there?
I don't know what that guy said.
The, the little people, uh, Billy Barkey.
I don't want that.
Or Vern Troyer or Mickey Looney.
We want to see what they're saying right now about us.
I don't want to outlaw that one guy.
I saw him last week and they were mean.
We're going to whoop that one guy.
I can't believe people would be rude on the internet.
Don't, don't whoop on no one.
Now, what about Palmer's microphone over there?
How does it go?
Is it sounding?
Microphone.
Oh my God, he's not, uh.
That's not funny, Palmer.
That doesn't help things.
His mind and his mouth are disengaged.
Yes, we do have some, uh, some people paying attention to us on the chat stream.
I see.
I suppose they don't want, they want to stop us from talking.
Oh no, they are approving, uh, everything.
Yes, it's true.
There's no subgeniuses.
They're so old, older than me.
Horrible old things.
I wish we.
I wish we.
I wish we could ask them a question about the old times.
But, uh, Ivan Stang said it was too well worn, a path that would, uh, acidly eat through the soles of our shoes.
We're just saying, we're just saying what the callers are saying.
We don't, we're, we're actually, we do not want to.
Let us not presume to, uh, speak for our beloved audience.
Nay, let them speak to us.
Let a thousand flowers of evil bloom.
Something's wrong with Palmer's microphone.
But, uh, once again, we shall fix it.
Because we've got top scientific assistants, experts working on the problem.
And at any moment, the light of rationality and enlightenment will flood this labyrinth of darkness.
And we will even be able to hear the voice of lies.
Significance.
Promises, promises, promises.
Just like X-Day and all that.
That's slack.
And you complain of that, uh, Reverend Stang?
No, I'm complaining on behalf of all the people who, the little people who didn't get, uh, the sex goddesses and the, that's the bank accounts.
That's the hose.
Uh, we've got a hose problem.
Uh, we're going to...
We've got a microphone problem.
That's, uh, Mike O'Phone.
That microphone is not a lot of money.
But, it's, you see, it's just a matter of, uh...
We choke the phone.
And threaten it.
One must, uh, check the connections.
Threaten it with bodily harm.
No, the visible show.
Now, what about this microphone?
Don't worry.
Here's this hardwired one.
That one?
Yeah, you could go around there.
It would freak its mind out.
But I don't know, maybe we're going to require, uh, you know...
What if you choked that microphone within an inch of its life?
I don't believe in abusing the equipment.
But, but, but this is a live mic.
What if we abuse a ghost?
As a scapegoat.
A scapegoat for the microphone.
A scapegoat?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know.
Because, you know, there's no laws against abusing ghosts.
No laws written by men.
Not yet, not yet.
There you are.
That seems to be...
No law of any human terry in the court.
A little more there.
Yeah, we could abuse the ghosts all we want.
There we go.
If we can capture a ghost, we could even make ghosts sue.
There, there, ghost.
We could eat a ghost.
Eat a ghost.
So that's...
Not, uh...
I've got no idea of these ghosts.
I don't care if they're male, female, or anything in between.
Why a ghost?
Well...
I'm not mad at these ghosts.
That's a...
But what about the happy ghosts?
I don't believe happy ghosts exist.
Nobody's ever shown me a happy ghost.
Really?
There's plenty of proof for, uh, sad, mournful ghosts.
Plenty.
Plenty.
They're everywhere.
They're everywhere.
They're haunting houses.
Well, that hasn't stopped you from eating any ghost cheese.
I would eat ghost cheese right now.
The ghost cheese is some of the lightest, most fluffy cheese I've ever had.
I prefer it when it's not...
It's the least...
When you don't know that it's ghost cheese.
I like blue ghost cheese.
The dreaded blue ghost of Martinez.
You've seen...
Martinez.
That's like the wailing woman who goes in for 24-hour martinizing?
There's one in every town.
Every town has, uh, the...
Sanfordizing and son.
The hitchhiking bride or prom girl.
That's right.
It's a hitchhiking prom girl that drowned in the lake and...
Martinez has the blue cheese over man.
Yeah.
The blue cheese over man.
Don't forget the girl with the...
The most horrible smell.
The yellow ribbon around her neck.
Yes, who was hitchhiking.
And when you untie the ribbon, her head fell off.
Ah, yeah.
Who's got my...
My golden ribbon.
The overman was doomed to pick her up.
She's outside.
Somebody has to go down and let her in.
Who's got my golden pie?
The fact is, you can't be...
I'm at the base of the stairs.
Bullied about by spirits.
Now I'm on the first step.
You have to stand up to them.
Now I'm on the second step.
Now I'm on the third step.
The second step that leads to a lifetime of interdependency.
But Dr. Truman, it's a 100-step stairwell.
That's a 100-step self-help course.
Now I'm on the third step.
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with murder as a hate crime,
scheduled to take effect on the 1st.
President Obama is standing in the way of compromise.
President Obama says...
Uh, uh, uh, stuff's difficult to name, but not as grossly.
Uh, uh, uh.
The president gets mad at PR News.
Because I get the big work.
But PR reports 2013 will bring some 2014.
Most of the 2013s are in 2014.
For example, starting January 1st, 2013 actually starts next October 1st.
Things like 2014 start next January 1st.
That's when most Americans will be required to have PR News Washington.
Activists say at least 40,000 New England residents could die in Syria next year.
The international envoy to Syria told reporters this is PR News from Washington,
which hasn't had a...
...functional government since 1991 and is run by various warlords.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says PR's very, very bad and getting worse.
Graham told Fox News Sunday there can be agreement on a small PR News in Washington.
