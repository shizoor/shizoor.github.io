1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
This is Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater, and we're listening to The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,580
Because we're subgeniuses, and we're slacking off.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,700
Is this thing working? Is this thing working?

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:25,740
What do you think, as a radio broadcaster, Reverend Stang, of these new computerized devices that let you see how many people are listening?

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,060
Don't you find that somewhat intrusive?

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,900
Wouldn't you rather not know than look at that readout and see how many listeners there are?

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,860
Oh, you mean by internet?

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,480
Yeah.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,100
Well, in the station that I work at, the top limit is 30 people.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,960
And here's the sad thing.

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,340
We've never had that many.

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,360
It's unusual.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,420
It's always about 27.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,640
Even though...

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,440
Even that's not bad.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,900
It's just enough for me to know that no one else is trying to listen.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,920
That means a radio is on.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,100
You don't know how many people might be listening.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,820
No, those are computer connections.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,540
Right.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,360
It could be broadcast in China.

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:09,900
That's right.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,280
And it's not really how many that are listening that matters.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,120
It's how intently they are listening.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,100
It's better to have one person really listening, listening the hell out of that broadcast,

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,600
than to just have a million people have it playing in the background.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,220
Right.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,620
And I can't imagine...

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,820
I can't imagine anything worse playing in the background than subgenius radio.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,960
But some people like to perform certain activities with this in the background.

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:40,540
Generally, it's not a good idea to perform activities involving calculation, measurement, anything like that.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,740
But on the other side of the brain, if you have some work for your idle hands to do,

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,120
it's an ideal background that can be a companionable form,

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,620
whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirits of its...

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,900
...its own mood's interprets.

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,240
Like an old friend hanging around, constantly talking.

37
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,760
Or perhaps some sort of pleasurable activity...

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,300
Funny you should mention that, Dr. Al.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
Well, it naturally occurs.

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,720
A little audio stimulation along with the other types of stimulation.

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes, all our nerve endings are eventually to be put to use in the magna stimulation of the climax of X-Day.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,320
Okay.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:24,880


45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:38,640
Our soundtrack for this hour of slack in the background music is Hans Salter's Son of Frankenstein.

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,020
The tragic tale of the son of Frankenstein.

47
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,200
Not to be confused with the son of Frankenstein's monster.

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,780
We don't know that the monster himself ever had an actual offspring.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,360
Although we assume that he could reproduce...

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,500
...he certainly was eager to have a bride manufactured for him.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,100
I don't blame him.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
I felt the same way, and I went to the same extremes to make sure that that happened.

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,200
Actually, he couldn't reproduce.

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,680
We have a movie for the Baldotta auction.

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,840
That's right, folks.

56
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,980
It's related to my personal life.

57
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,840
It's called I Married a Monster from Outer Space.

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,560
Are you?

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,320
Are you claiming that one?

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,660
It's pretty good, actually.

61
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,420
No, no, we saw it.

62
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,060
I have a copy.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,320
I actually married a princess from outer space.

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,780
You could almost say a monster married a princess from outer space.

65
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,520
Well, it's a variation on the theme.

66
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:51,440
Now, you know, if this were a real hour of slack, we would start off with about ten minutes of carefully edited collages.

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,120
Of course, those will be added later for the internet broadcast.

68
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,200
As will all sound effects and other things.

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,840
But we have to have the music in the background to inspire us.

70
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,340
Because, actually, let's face it.

71
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,940
Let's mention that right now.

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,400
Everything you see about academic music, classical music, symphonic music,

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,560
all this stuff is the circle jerking of a dying intelligentsia.

74
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,620
Because the real music that this era will be remembered for...

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,160
is the music composed for the movies.

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,420
And that's where our greatest composers have been hiding for the past hundred years.

77
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,960
Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Evolution Control Committee.

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,420
Please stand.

79
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,040
Ladies and gentlemen, I could really use your help, actually, here to start this out.

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,220
Because often in the past, we've done shows with the wheel of mashup.

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,400
And with the wheel of mashup, we've invited someone from the audience up to actually spin the wheel and decide some of the...

82
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,160
It's really two wheels.

83
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,780
Yeah, yeah. It's really...

84
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,740
One has music.

85
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,460
Yeah, and one has the lyrics.

86
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,880
And one has lyrics.

87
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,340
So, we're going to try to do this with you right now.

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,400
And we've got some music here.

89
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,640
And we need some vocal help.

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay.

91
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,660
So, could you help me decide the lyrics?

92
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,300
We need a vote.

93
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,460
One.

94
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:24,640
One.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,080
It's going to be between Lil Jon and Jackson 5, okay?

96
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,460
Okay, so we're going to do a vote.

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,800
So, let's vote.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,820
We're going to choose the lyrics.

99
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,140
Number one, Lil Jon.

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,800
Lil Jon.

101
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,100
And number two, Jackson 5.

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
Your decision, Chloe.

103
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,460
Wow, it's pretty even.

104
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,460
Can we vote one more time?

105
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Okay, Lil Jon.

106
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,920
Okay, Jackson 5.

107
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,220
Jackson 5.

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,680
Jackson 5.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Jackson 5.

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


111
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


112
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


113
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


114
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


115
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


117
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


118
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,440


119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
I think that would be it.

120
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,800
I think it's Jackson 5.

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,180
You think so?

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
Jackson 5?

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,940
I think so.

124
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,420
Jackson 5 it is.

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,700
To go with Frankenstein.

126
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,460
Here we go, now, it's the Evolution

127
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,140
Group Roll Committee.

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,180
Turn up this fucking music.

129
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,380
We need to hear the music.

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
Let's hear the music.

131
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,600
Alright, here we go.

132
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,780
Music.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,020
Music.

134
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,060
Music.

135
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,100
Music.

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,140
Music.

137
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,960
Now I'm gonna teach you all about love, yeah

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
Friendship's a battle, take a seat

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
All you gotta do to be loved to me

140
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,540
A, B, C, easy as one, two, three

141
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,360
All simple, let's go, baby

142
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,000
A, B, C, one, two, three

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,520
Baby, you and me, girl

144
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,540
Easy as one, two, three

145
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,460
All simple, let's go, baby

146
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,900
A, B, C, one, two, three

147
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,300
Baby, you and me, girl

148
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,100
Come on, come on, come on, let me show you what's all about

149
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,900
We take a ride, we're with the team

150
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,700
All the branches of the line and dream

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,860
We're living with our friends, we're all in this with baby girl

152
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,080
Your education makes a big, big, big deal

153
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,160
Just wanna show you how to get an A

154
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Let's go to the baby, the boys, you gotta do

155
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,120
A, B, C, easy as one, two, three

156
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,900
All simple, let's go, baby

157
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,160
A, B, C, one, two, three

158
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,860
Baby, you and me, girl

159
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,140
Easy, easy, easy as I got two, three

160
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,340
Sing a simple melody

161
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,460
So easy, love can be

162
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,700
So easy, love can be

163
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,540
Sing a simple melody

164
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,180
One, two, three, you and me

165
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,120
You hear that?

166
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,780
The music's a-banging

167
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,000
You hear it?

168
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,240
It's a-banging

169
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,480
It's a-banging

170
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
It's a-banging

171
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:05,680
It's a-banging

172
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a-banging

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,080
It's a-banging

174
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,680
It's a-banging

175
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,100
It's a-banging

176
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,920
I assume everyone here has signed the liability waiver.

177
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't think anyone's turned them in, though.

178
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,460
Apparently you're signing them and putting them in your pocket.

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,980
That doesn't do us any good.

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh, and you'll find in your brochure this little thing called the Gorillas and Demons in your life.

181
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,940
This is your Gorillas and Demons form.

182
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,600
You're supposed to fill that out.

183
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,860
Yeah, you fill this out and then leave it up here at the table.

184
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,260
And Dr. Howell and I will read them at some point.

185
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,840
Because they usually are pretty funny.

186
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,840
Depending on what voice the Gorilla and the Demon use.

187
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,200
And this is my first X-Day.

188
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

189
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,960
I got somebody.

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,280
And I gotta tell you, this has been the most unique experience of my entire life.

191
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,180
But I am not afraid.

192
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,260
You guys still can't hear me?

193
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,220
Alright.

194
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,780
And I've been told I can't go home.

195
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,220
But I realized something.

196
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,700
I am home.

197
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,720
Freeze, boss!

198
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:31,660
I spent my life, my entire existence, in one of the pinkest states on the country.

199
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,740
And that is the state of Florida.

200
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,780
I've worked for every pink corporation you know.

201
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,980
I've worked for Disney.

202
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,960
I've worked for Universal.

203
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,520
And even now, I still have a con job.

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,220
But I realized something.

205
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,120
That entire time, I have been a salesman.

206
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm not the best yet.

207
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,760
But I'm getting there, brothers.

208
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,760
I'm getting there.

209
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm getting there.

210
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm getting there.

211
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,900
I'm getting there.

212
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:07,900


213
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:07,900


214
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:07,900


215
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:07,900


216
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:17,360
Come here whoAKE ME BUR Oftом

217
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,580
Come or die or dieعد

218
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,580


219
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,580


220
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,360
You trying to catch somebody peppered like laser stray before it!!!

221
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,800
Am I dead or I'm alive

222
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:23,800


223
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:23,900
It's alright I need on some round of aura

224
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:23,900


225
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:23,900


226
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:34,580
With the people no longer love me

227
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,280
written by Phineas Narco, or not a poem, it's a short rant written by Phineas Narco.

228
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,660
Who unfortunately was not able to be among us.

229
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,220
Yeah, he is normally one of the old time show guys.

230
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:54,040
He's on the Puzzling Evidence show and Over the Edge and Hour of Slack and everything else quite a bit.

231
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,240
Confidentially, it would take a major miracle to get him here.

232
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,320
He's afraid to go out of his house.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,880
But he wrote this right after he got so angry about not being able to come.

234
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,020
He said, I was walking home just now and kind of looking down as I tend to do when I walk along.

235
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:22,020
On the sidewalk face up was one of those name tags people get that stick on and you write your name on it with a magic marker.

236
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,840
See, I've got mine.

237
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,040
And the name on the sticker said Bob on it.

238
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,020
Swear to God.

239
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,240
And I smiled and thought that's a sign.

240
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,100
It's going to be a good day today.

241
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:40,320
I get home and think to myself, you know, I like being a nice guy, even though nice guys finish last.

242
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:47,020
But, you know, there's a lot less pressure at the end of the race and you have a lot more time to enjoy it back there.

243
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,640
And hell, I didn't even give a shit about their prize in the first place.

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,520
It's a carrot on a stick, dear friends, being a success.

245
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,600
That's why we in the church kill time and burn money.

246
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Because slack is neither in time or money.

247
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,680
It's in both at the same time.

248
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,880
Screw their mediocrity and low standards and praise Bob.

249
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,380
But I take that or kill me stuff seriously.

250
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,760
I paid my $30 not once, but accidentally twice, which is impossible to do intentionally, dear friends.

251
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,700
And I'm here to tell you that ever since my life has had an abundance of slack and has been populated by blessed holy mistakes.

252
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,620
Good mistakes, which only had to be recognized as being such.

253
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,280
Or as we call it, involuntary slack.

254
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,440
I've followed the path of least resistance and it fucking works.

255
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:52,240
When faced with any decision in life, I always judge where to go by what gives me the most slack, the least amount of stress and hassle, and the most time and money.

256
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,720
And sure, nice guys finish last, but so what?

257
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,680
At least they have the luxury of being nice.

258
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,040
Nice!

259
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,820
And that's the prize from which all blessings flow.

260
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,900
It's nice to be nice.

261
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Praise Bob.

262
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,500
Praise Bob.

263
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,680
Now I can no more imagine Dr. Legume saying that than Adolf Hitler.

264
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,420
However, if you know Phineas Narco, it's a quite honest thing.

265
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,240
Phineas is a real nice guy.

266
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,580
Oh, he's honest, all right.

267
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,780
He'll tell you about every thought he's ever had about himself.

268
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,560
You know, and honestly, yes, he'll share until you...

269
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,320
...want to terminate the sharing session.

270
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,780
But it's interesting.

271
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,660
He also is a learned fellow who has come up with many intriguing concepts.

272
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,660
Have you ever considered what a modest contribution $30 is to the only true religion?

273
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,180
All the fake religions, they all want 10% of everything you earn.

274
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,920
Well, I think it should be $33, and I've said so for many years.

275
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,280
And I think the next...

276
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,380
...instrumental rise will take it to $33.

277
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,380
It's difficult, of course, to deal with in a monetary way, mathematically.

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,900
But you have the golden mean, so I don't see why you shouldn't send in 33 pieces of silver to become a subgenius.

279
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,580
You know, I don't remember you ever mentioning that, although I don't doubt that you did.

280
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,640
I have mentioned it.

281
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:28,200
I have been thinking, friends, you know our prices, the church of the subgenius, the most supposedly the cult of the super salesman.

282
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,560
Our prices haven't changed since 1995.

283
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,940
They've actually gone down if you adjust for inflation.

284
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, quite a bit.

285
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,840
So I think our next...

286
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,820
We will probably charge $35 for next X day.

287
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,740
And eternal salvation will go up to $35.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,500
$35.

289
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,280
Which means that triple your money back will be harder to calculate for me.

290
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,620
This, of course, is all baloney because we know there isn't going to be a next X.

291
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,140
This is all theological tinker toy talking.

292
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,840
The real inside information is...

293
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,400
We're just building airy castles in the air.

294
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,460
Nonetheless, there are reasons it should be 33.

295
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:16,580
The 33rd parallel on which President John F. Kennedy, President 35, was assassinated.

296
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:23,720
The golden mean, one third, the 33 vertebra in the human body, etc., etc.

297
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,560
On and on it goes.

298
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,260
And if you want to vault.

299
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,560
So 35 after that, who can stop you?

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
But at least your 35 will contain the significant 33.

301
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,860
And that's only if it's not on X day.

302
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,580
On X day, the price goes up exponentially as the 7 o'clock approaches.

303
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,220
By 659, it can cost you $3,000.

304
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
A thousand? Hell, millions.

305
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,640
The guy standing by the saucer saying, how much have you got?

306
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,640
There's some friends for whom the money won't work.

307
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,320
No matter how much they pay.

308
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,540
Because they, at one point in their life, they denied Bob.

309
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,020
Or they insulted me.

310
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
One or the other.

311
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,780
That'll also keep you off the saucer.

312
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,160
That's when they encounter the invisible.

313
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,800
Because I'm the one who controls them.

314
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,280
I have the, in fact, I have a little computer hooked up down here that has the book of life.

315
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,280
It has the list of everyone who will be saved.

316
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,800
And we don't need a list of those who will not be saved.

317
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,040
Because that would, that's...

318
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,800
Billions.

319
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
And who cares?

320
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,120
And it's a waste of paper.

321
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,160
I've got a tape.

322
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,660
I keep it with my secrets.

323
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,820
My lips are sealed.

324
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,620
And there's no whiskey that will set them free.

325
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,660
But I will tell my tale for thirty pieces of silver.

326
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,960
I've got some friends.

327
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,240
They're weighing down in my pocket.

328
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,360
It's buttoned shut.

329
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,600
They mean as much as all the world to me.

330
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,400
But you can't have my friends for thirty pieces of silver.

331
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,260
Come on, step over here.

332
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,960
I'm gonna make you a deal.

333
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,100
I'm not gonna trade, pay, borrow or steal.

334
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,300
I'm gonna keep you safe.

335
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,300


336
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,300


337
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,300


338
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,300


339
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:06,820
I'm gonna do you a favor, there's no way you can lose. Just make me the offer that I can't refuse.

340
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:24,640
I've got a soul, I keep it in the mirror.

341
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:35,660
I left it there, it's everything that it's cracked up to be.

342
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,960
But you can have my soul for thirty pieces of silver.

343
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:36,780
I left it there, it's everything that it's cracked up to be.

344
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:06,800
I left it there, it's everything that it's cracked up to be.

345
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:13,540
There's no way you can lose. Just make me the offer that I can't refuse.

346
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:31,380
I've got a dream, it's way up in the attic.

347
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,720
And more than dust.

348
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,740
Can't get beyond my special lock and key.

349
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,120
But you can have my dream for thirty pieces of silver.

350
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,300
Oh!

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Little Jack Melody did that piece called Thirty Pieces of Silver.

352
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,740
And now, back to the hour.

353
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm in the floor of schlack.

354
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,080
That little special module they have at the door of the saucers,

355
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,820
it's actually a sonic emulator that puts out a sort of force field.

356
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,100
The same concept they use to drive away mosquitoes now.

357
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,560
You may have seen these commercials where it puts a little bubble over the first...

358
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,940
But those things never work.

359
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,380
Yes, well, this is the actual Exus technology, though, it works.

360
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,500
They can get all the way up to the chute.

361
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,000
They can pay their membership fee.

362
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,800
They can be entering the door, but they can't get in here.

363
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,760
You can't quite make it through the door.

364
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,620
The bubble is pushing them out.

365
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,200
And, of course, the rest of the subgeniuses just kind of push them to the side

366
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,420
as they go through without any resistance whatsoever.

367
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,120
You know, of course, my most common nightmare is that I'm one of the ones being pushed out.

368
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,140
Well, that's a real...

369
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,520
That you worked too hard for Bob, Reverend Stang.

370
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,940
Here, play back the tapes.

371
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,560
This is the judgment.

372
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,420
You preached slack, but yet you worked hard.

373
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,400
But, Lord, I'm an emergentile.

374
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,780
That is my slack.

375
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,880
Working too hard, that's how I get slack.

376
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,640
No, you've misunderstood everything.

377
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,560
Slack is drinking beer and watching TV all day, like the conspiracy said.

378
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,160
We banish him to subgenius hell.

379
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,460
Oh, no, not subgenius hell.

380
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,360
Oh, we did that one yesterday.

381
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,020
It happened to Moses, you know.

382
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:32,560
And we've squeezed out every last little module and calorie of potential work that you can do for the church.

383
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,120
So now we can't use.

384
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,000
We can't use you anymore.

385
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,620
Moses was God's man, but because he angered Jehovah in the last decade of his life,

386
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,060
he was not allowed to pass into the promised land.

387
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,440
And he could only view the paradise from afar.

388
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,100
I have seen the saucers, my children.

389
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,560
I may not get on them with you, but I have seen the saucers.

390
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
Praise Bob.

391
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,920
Praise Bob.

392
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,740
Praise Bob.

393
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,920
Praise Bob.

394
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:03,960
Praise Bob.

395
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,160
Praise Bob.

396
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,280
Praise Bob.

397
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,400


398
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,400


399
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,400


400
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,400


401
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,400


402
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,400


403
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,040
Praise Bob.

404
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,040


405
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,040


406
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,040


407
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,040


408
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,020
Well, you will be remembered, Reverend Stang.

409
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,920
That's the good news.

410
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,040
Well, think what the pinks will do to me if I'm left behind.

411
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,000
They'll only have a few minutes to do that, though.

412
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,660
That's true.

413
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,800
So the great Reverend Susie the Flucy is on the land.

414
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,640
However, she is resting.

415
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,740
So I think she drove by herself all the way here from.

416
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,160
Hellwater, Kentucky or wherever she's from.

417
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,200
What's that place?

418
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,660
God's Wrath, Georgia or something like that.

419
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,620
It's a place where everybody else in the town is a celibate blacksmith.

420
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,240
Atlanta, home of beautiful WREK, the station which plays us.

421
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,780
Although I don't think it's paid us in quite a long time.

422
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,600
Well, the important thing is that their spirit was in the right space.

423
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,960
The idea of rewards and of Moses, the lawgiver, still intrigues me a little bit.

424
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:21,500
You know, Moses did get one supreme blessing from the Lord for being such a good servant of Jehovah.

425
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,580
And that blessing took a peculiar form.

426
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,640
And it's there in the Bible.

427
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,760
Moses was allowed, unlike any other...

428
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,800
...any other man who ever lived, to view God's ass.

429
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:43,000
How this came about was that Moses requested that he see God after serving him all this time.

430
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,120
And God said, no, Moses, that wouldn't do.

431
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,460
Because, you see, it's a lot of technical stuff here.

432
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,260
His effulgence, his emanation would utterly blast Moses into smithereens.

433
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,680
Just as flaming Jupiter did to hapless Semele in the pagan...

434
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,180
...world.

435
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,760
But, if when God passed by and then Moses turned around and looked, he could see his back parts.

436
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,340
His grand fesses or buttocks.

437
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,100
And so Moses did this.

438
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,800
He saw Jehovah pass by with his peripheral vision.

439
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:25,780
And then he quickly turned and saw the right side, which is to say the posterior side of the Lord.

440
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,040
And thus was neither turned into a pillar of salt, like Lot's wife...

441
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,640
...nor was he blasted into atoms from the sheer glory of it all.

442
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
He also passed some gas there.

443
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,840
So he got a little divine little church air of sorts.

444
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,080
It was called an afflatus.

445
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,380
And notice with subgeniuses it's just the opposite.

446
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,700
We all get to meet Bob, but he gets our ass.

447
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,760
Some people wonder if our church air is also from Bob's posterior orifice.

448
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,420
Well, certainly, in a way.

449
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,760
We are the excretion of Bob.

450
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:00,760


451
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,420
We're the result of his wisdom coming out.

452
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,200
I just fail to see how this helps anything.

453
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:16,440
Since he can't really open his mouth, because that pipe grown in between the two teeth, upper and lower, he has to speak through his rear.

454
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,760
Actually, that's brand new doctrine.

455
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,880
I just made that up off the top of my head.

456
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,860
So don't go by that.

457
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,720
Although technically, anything it says in pamphlet number one, anything any subgenius says,

458
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,580
automatically becomes doctrine.

459
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,480
Which some certain idiots have tried to take literally,

460
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,280
forgetting that every other subgenius can then say,

461
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,480
No, you aren't.

462
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,460
You say this doctrine is superseded in most cases.

463
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:57,060
And with this great principle has come the formation of other churches and denominations also,

464
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,680
fathering forth.

465
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,840
And branching out like a great tree.

466
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,640
So his idea is that we say praise Bob and fuck Bob.

467
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,080
So we'll start with praise Bob.

468
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
So one, two, three.

469
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Praise Bob.

470
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,100
All right.

471
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,100
Now we're going to do fuck Bob.

472
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,660
Are you ready?

473
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,520
Is everybody ready?

474
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,100
Okay.

475
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,320
One, two, three.

476
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,940
Fuck Bob.

477
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,340
Good.

478
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,820
Good.

479
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
We're playing along so far.

480
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,660
Let's try it a little harder.

481
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,420
Let's try it a little, a little more complicated.

482
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,480
Okay.

483
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,140
Slap.

484
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,240
Slap.

485
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,300
The subgenius.

486
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,380
Must have slap.

487
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,620
The subgenius.

488
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,460
Must have slap.

489
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,460
Must have slap.

490
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,540
Must have slap.

491
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,180
Okay, we blew that the first time.

492
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,100
So we're trying to get it to see if this is coming.

493
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,620
We're trying to do Bob and praise him.

494
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,540
So at least half of you are still in your Bobby stage, including that gentleman back

495
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,920
there with the long gray hair.

496
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,160
I believe he's probably the biggest Bobby in this church.

497
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,800
So let's try this again.

498
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,280
The subgenius.

499
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,780
The subgenius.

500
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,280
Must have slap.

501
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,580
Must have slap.

502
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,580
You're getting better.

503
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,240
I'm not going to sing this one.

504
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,020
Well, okay.

505
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,140
Slap.

506
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,640
Slap.

507
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


508
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


509
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


510
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


511
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


512
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


513
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


514
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


515
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


516
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


517
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


518
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


519
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


520
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


521
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


522
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


523
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,640


524
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm not going to sing this one.

525
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,100
I'm going to sing this one.

526
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,800
Slap.

527
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,440
Slap.

528
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,300
Slap.

529
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,280
Slap.

530
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,580
Slap.

531
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
Slap.

532
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,580
Slap.

533
00:29:59,580 --> 00:29:59,920
Slap.

534
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,420
Slap.

535
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,600
Slap.

536
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:00,960
All right.

537
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,880
So we've got music going on.

538
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,900
And I would like somebody to join this beautiful idea over here.

539
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,520
And let's have a backup singer and we'll sing about what we just learned.

540
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,860
Come on out.

541
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:21,840
You must have slaps.

542
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,040
You must have slaps.

543
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,740
You must have slaps.

544
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,720
I see you in the audience singing as well.

545
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,820
You must have slaps.

546
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,700
Slaps.

547
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,680
Slaps.

548
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,940
Slaps.

549
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,200
Slaps.

550
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,520
Slaps.

551
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,520
Slaps.

552
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,120
Slaps.

553
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,580
Slaps.

554
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:17,960
Slaps.

555
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,060
Think this.

556
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,500
Come your way.

557
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,420
The Python King has become your wayman.

558
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,780
He will devour you whole.

559
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,980
He will devour you whole, my friends.

560
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,640
Yes, indeed.

561
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,360
He will cut you apart.

562
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,180
On the edge.

563
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,680
It's slack time.

564
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,440
Slack, jack, hammer, and attack.

565
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,000
From the slack to the slack.

566
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:36,860
Slack, jack, hammer, and attack.

567
00:32:51,080 --> 00:33:00,020
He must have slack Oh yeah slack

568
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,560
Slack!

569
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,060
You must have our slack.

570
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,500
If you don't have slack, you're gonna be whacked.

571
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,840
If you must have slack.

572
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,840
You don't know why.

573
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Be slack or be whacked.

574
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,900
What's a slack?

575
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,100
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

576
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,200
Slack.

577
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,400
Slack, slack, slack, slack, slack, slack.

578
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,720
Slack!

579
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,040
There's slack, there's slack.

580
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
tieneustark pół

581
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,760
It hurts.

582
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,340
Ah, yes.

583
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,060
Yes, invariably we have to come back to talking on topics

584
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,380
which one might even think we would try to avoid,

585
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,580
but like the magnetic or gravitational pull of a star,

586
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,440
we are drawn into an inward vortex.

587
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,920
Instead, let's talk about our fans.

588
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,320
If you'll notice, right over there is our one fan.

589
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,580
Next to the stage.

590
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,180
And I suppose we could turn it on,

591
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,760
but it would then blow our words back at us.

592
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,900
That's always the most reliable thing we have.

593
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,220
Create a gale of wind if you want.

594
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,000
Unleash the bag of eelists.

595
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,080
It's not like the radio station fan.

596
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,460
If we turn it on, then it makes a horrible noise.

597
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,980
We could plug that in and point it at us.

598
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,560
So it makes a horrible noise, you know.

599
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,160
What's so bad about that?

600
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,360
Aren't we supposed to have minions with red bracelets

601
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,140
that rush up here to do that?

602
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,160
I mean, Father Joe Mama is having to...

603
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,920
He's showing humility by doing it himself.

604
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,660
He's humble. He's right with Bob.

605
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,540
How many can say the same?

606
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,200
Now, remember last year I showed my humility

607
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,020
by constantly asking my fellow panelists if they wanted coffee,

608
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,240
and I would go and bring coffee.

609
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,300
Say that as if I weren't the sacred scribe of the church.

610
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,480
Actually, I am just a mere reverend.

611
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,020
I never claimed to be a pope or even a bishop.

612
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,820
You may have noticed, those of you who've been with the church for a while,

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,420
that oddly enough, the ones who claim the title of pope

614
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,480
are often the biggest assholes of all the church.

615
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,780
Now, that's not always true.

616
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,540
Yes, not always, but very many...

617
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,920
It seems there's a tendency among the ones

618
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,300
who just automatically declare themselves a pope.

619
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,580
Yes, there's a tendency among the ones who just automatically declare themselves popes

620
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,780
to believe their own bullshit.

621
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,820
And that's dangerous.

622
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,480
Now, some would say why that's the key to life.

623
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,980
In fact, one of the stupidest jerks in the whole world said that to me.

624
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,740
A fellow named Bob Dean said,

625
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,120
believing your own bullshit, that's the key to life, Doug.

626
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,220
He's the false Bob.

627
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:25,100
But in fact, the key to life is believing Bob's bullshit.

628
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

629
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,420
Not Bob Dean.

630
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,120
Not any Canadian imitations or...

631
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,640
Marshall McLuhan or...

632
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,940
Or any of those millions.

633
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,100
God, I got on Facebook just to see how many Bob Dobbs there were.

634
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,920
Too many.

635
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
I couldn't...

636
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,020
My finger, tired of scrolling,

637
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,180
it went on for so many pages.

638
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,780
And 90% of them had a trademark owned by yours truly,

639
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,240
used as their personal photo.

640
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,920
That just makes me sick.

641
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,900
As we said before,

642
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,180
the greatest threat to the Church of the Subgenius

643
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,100
is not from without,

644
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,180
it's from those who are burying from within.

645
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,960
That's absolutely true.

646
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,780
The pinks aren't smart enough to do us any damage.

647
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,860
It's the subgeniuses that we have to worry about.

648
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,420
Subgeniuses, their specialty is sabotaging themselves.

649
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,140
And unfortunately, that goes for the Church Foundation as well.

650
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,900
Friends, that kick me sign on your back

651
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,300
is the...

652
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,200
It is written in your own handwriting.

653
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,420
And...

654
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,640
That's why it's backwards.

655
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah.

656
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,280
That explains a lot.

657
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,220
So...

658
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,400
So all you have to do is change...

659
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,240
Pull the sign off your back with a claw hammer,

660
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,380
since it's nailed in using telephone poles,

661
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,700
and change it to say,

662
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,620
pay me instead of kick me.

663
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,720
That's what we did.

664
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,540
And look at us.

665
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,080
That way you don't even have to pay real money for the membership.

666
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,900
You paid yourself.

667
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,300
That's paid your own membership.

668
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,320
$30.

669
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,760
When you stop and think about it,

670
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,720
that's an anti-contribution.

671
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,960
That's a nothing contribution.

672
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,580
It's a bag of groceries, you know.

673
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,740
It's half of the electric bill.

674
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,020
It's a meager bag of towels.

675
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,540
Yeah, you couldn't buy a matchbox of frop with $30.

676
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,920
The only reason they even did the contribution

677
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,720
was because people kept thinking

678
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,340
that they weren't actually in the church

679
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,680
unless they made the contribution.

680
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,380
So...

681
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,700
So...

682
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,680
They had to give them something that they could do.

683
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,120
They had to give us something

684
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,400
because there's nothing more valuable than money.

685
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,160
Because money has no real value,

686
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,160
but all symbolic value.

687
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,940
Which is why they're not giving us anything.

688
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,260
They're just giving us money,

689
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,160
but we're giving them eternal salvation

690
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,820
and triple that worthless money.

691
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,240
But they're giving what they ascribe value to.

692
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,620
Right.

693
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,700
Bob doesn't need money.

694
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,080
He's the richest man in the world.

695
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,980
He uses that for his toilet paper, though.

696
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,360
He needs proof of your faith.

697
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,520
As it is long ago,

698
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:56,860
written,

699
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,440
they may be pink,

700
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,160
but their money is green.

701
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,860
Praise Bob.

702
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,380
Actually, I think L. Ron Hubbard said that to Bob.

703
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,380
He'd be the one.

704
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,880
But that's why also Bob prefers to get pink.

705
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,740
Didn't we already go through this yesterday?

706
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,780
We went through it many times.

707
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,660
That's the problem.

708
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,780
Many times over and over

709
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,780
through epicycles and lustrums of cosmic time.

710
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,600
I remember we were in L.A.

711
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,740
standing outside Scientology headquarters

712
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,600
when you were raving about how come

713
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,680
he gets a ticket.

714
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:26,680


715
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:26,680


716
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,740
It's such a cool thing and you don't.

717
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,980
And that's again,

718
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,600
that identical conversational stream came up

719
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,280
and then subsided.

720
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:35,900
It's a mantra.

721
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,860
It has to be repeated over and over again

722
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,000
in order to have any real spiritual significance.

723
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,020
And over and over again.

724
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,000
Because history repeats itself.

725
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,520
Yes, repeats itself.

726
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,140
Eternal recurrence.

727
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,360
Repeats itself.

728
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,480
Again and again.

729
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,260
Like the tide coming in and out

730
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,640
with tremulous cadence slow.

731
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,680
Or like a song.

732
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,140
Or like a subgenius with echolalia.

733
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,360
The bigger question is...

734
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,300
Who drives you crazy until you realize

735
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,820
it's a condition he has no control over.

736
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,180
Following you around,

737
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,700
repeating maxims, nothrums and so on

738
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,880
that you've heard a thousand times over.

739
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,220
But expecting to achieve brownie points for doing so.

740
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,780
One can't help but wonder

741
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,360
what happens after X day

742
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,880
when we go to the promised land

743
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,740
and reach that great heavenly destination.

744
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,320
What happens in the distant future there?

745
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,660
Will it always be paradise?

746
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,220
Or will sometime...

747
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,160
There's work to do.

748
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,840
It becomes a hell of boredom.

749
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,640
It's like, I've read every comic book ever made.

750
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,320
I've seen every movie I ever liked five times.

751
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,320
I've had more...

752
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm tired of sex.

753
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,740
LSD doesn't hold a thrill for me.

754
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,180
I've had it.

755
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,720
There's a journey.

756
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,820
No, that's actually...

757
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,700
That is the Christian heaven you're mixed up with.

758
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,040
Where you can actually get bored with happiness there.

759
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,220
You get straightened out in the Port Authority terminal building

760
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,660
and you go on the journey.

761
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,280
You go to Asgard and you go beyond, you know.

762
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,360
You go through many sub-heavens and all that.

763
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,040
Or perhaps Bob brings a divine version of Alzheimer's

764
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,440
where we just forget what we did the day before

765
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,760
so we're able to relive that thrill every day

766
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,140
over and over again.

767
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,900
This is new. This is different.

768
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,680
Revelation X, Afterlife Diagram.

769
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,340
Um...

770
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,600
I can only say, um...

771
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,820
Go to the air.

772
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,160
I have a question for the audience.

773
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,660
Can you hear all three of us equally well?

774
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,360
Okay, because I can't.

775
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,520
That doesn't mean much.

776
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,360
But, uh...

777
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,700
Too long standing in front of those giant amplifiers.

778
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,720
You really must amplify when in Thang's vicinity.

779
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,580
Rule number one of subgenius preaching is never to listen to what any other preacher is saying.

780
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,820
I try.

781
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,220
I try. I just, uh...

782
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,880
If there's no monitor, you know.

783
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,840
I'm used to doing it all in headphones turned up all the way.

784
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,640
That's why I can't hear anything without the headphones.

785
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,840
A real preacher never listens to what they're telling anyone else either.

786
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,600
I mean, it's do as I say, not as I do.

787
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,880
That would be anti-religion.

788
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,080
You can't follow your own...

789
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,060
That's...

790
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,320
That would almost be almost anti-Holy.

791
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,120
Right. I don't practice what I preach

792
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,600
because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

793
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,480
Exactly.

794
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,080
Well, subgenius is Lutheran in that we don't believe that, uh...

795
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,160
a mentor or a priest is really necessary.

796
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,480
Your relation with Bob is between you and Bob.

797
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:38,240
But, of course, it wouldn't hurt to pay attention to others who might make it easier for you

798
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,100
to form that perfect attachment.

799
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,460
Yes. In fact, I would strongly suggest

800
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:51,040
that you think about bribing certain hierarchy... subgenius hierarchites.

801
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,440
It never hurts.

802
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,400
Actually, to tell the truth,

803
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,760
you know that hierarchy that people claim to be part of?

804
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,940
No, I wondered who those guys are.

805
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,660
That's how you know they're not part of it.

806
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:05,300
Because I personally couldn't tell you who's in the hierarchy and who's not.

807
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,800
I always thought that meant they were just high.

808
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,340
I didn't get the other part.

809
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,000
They usually are high in that sense.

810
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,240
Um, but I would strongly recommend bribing Priestess Pisces.

811
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,760
Any chance you get.

812
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,320
Dr. Legume is a very important person to bribe.

813
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,940
In some ways it's more extortion, but...

814
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,640
Or protection, rather. You're paying protection money.

815
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,320
Well, other people are bribing them. You just don't know it.

816
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,200
That's why you're not supposed to compare notes in the subgenius church.

817
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,300
Find out the deal that someone else has worked out with one of the other preachers.

818
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,480
Or with Bob himself.

819
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,860
Then it's like going on vacation and asking the guy next to you,

820
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,060
what did you pay for this ticket?

821
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,780
It's just going to ruin your day if you know what a good deal they got.

822
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,300
So the trick is to make sure that you know what you're paying for.

823
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,680
You can make your own deal, but don't tell anyone else about it.

824
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,660
Come on, the time you spend recording ten million things

825
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,260
will never be equaled by the time it would take to watch any of them.

826
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,320
You'll have them stored up in piles, but the ones you see will be few.

827
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,540
You have to make the effort.

828
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,200
Because there is a barrier, there are those forces in the universe

829
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,320
that don't want you to have slack of watching all the things you record,

830
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,220
only the anti-slack intention of trying to record them.

831
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,900
Well, the hour slack is always easier on the ears than it is on the eyes,

832
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,380
and if that's not a terrifying thought, I don't know what is.

833
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,040
Well, it allows us to create pictures, but simply by describing them,

834
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,000
in the age-old fashion of radio.

835
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,140
There's a female voice.

836
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,060
Pantiara, do you want to get on and help us out up here?

837
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,780
An announcement?

838
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,320
Well, please do. We have an announcement from Pantiara Ivakovich.

839
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,860
She's going to get on mic. You can have mine.

840
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,220
I just wanted to say that at the Bulldada auction,

841
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,260
I'm going to have a hard copy of the story that I wrote,

842
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,360
Stick and Pantiara's Big Park Adventure.

843
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:14,340
It's signed by me, Bishop Stick, and if you guys want to sign it too,

844
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,240
then I'll make it even more.

845
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,540
Oh, sure.

846
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,300
So it'll be up for auction whenever the Bulldada auction happens.

847
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,580
The auction is, if you're interested.

848
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,700
The audio book coming soon.

849
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,100
Friends, if you've, well, I guess only the people who are brave enough

850
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,600
to read Scrub Genius News Group would ever have read this,

851
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,260
but I printed it out.

852
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,500
You sent me a copy of it, the whole thing, at once.

853
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,400
Oh, okay, go ahead.

854
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:46,640
It is, for a story that doesn't have Bob in it, it's great.

855
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,640
It is really great.

856
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,360
And if you happen to be a person who has had a lot of experience

857
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,620
at state parks and national parks, it's even better.

858
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,320
Princess Wee and I happened to read this after a vacation

859
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,960
that we'd spent in the great national parks of our land.

860
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,160
Well, the best stories about Bob don't have Bob in them.

861
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,560
That's why they're so great.

862
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,760
Yeah, that's why they sell so well.

863
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,220
Those are all the ones in the airport.

864
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,020
He's hiding in between the lines.

865
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,840
Yeah, Stephen King has made a fortune not saying anything about Bob Dobbs.

866
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:27,140
If you take out a microscope and examine each and every eye in one of his novels,

867
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,420
you may discover the one eye that has the micro Bob's head above it.

868
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,380
Now this special copy not only bears the signatures of Popus Panteara

869
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:45,020
and of Reverend Stick, but also of Dr. Howland Owl and Reverend Ivan Stang.

870
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,000
Indeed, it lasts forever.

871
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,240
It lacks only the stinky paw print of Man Bear Pig to be complete.

872
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,500
And my signature even has a mistake on it.

873
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,100
A divine mistake.

874
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,800
I started to write June and then I realized it's July.

875
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,140
Because only Bob is perfect.

876
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,440
It's July now?

877
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,520
Bob is perfect? I thought that his secret was he was perfectly imperfect.

878
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,320
Well, that is the only perfection that counts, is it not?

879
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,980
Yep, July 1. That means we've got...

880
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Right, we've crossed over.

881
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,160
I'm not very good at math, but it means we have only a few days left of this...

882
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,900
Yes, quite a few. I didn't realize that.

883
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
The countdown clock is counting.

884
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,340
Oh, we have...

885
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,180
Very well.

886
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,840
We have two fans.

887
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,460
Some of our biggest fans are getting set up here.

888
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:36,620
I feel famous now.

889
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,960
I was always hoping we'd eventually work up to two fans in the Church of the Subgenius.

890
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,980
Well, there they are.

891
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,900
You've often wondered about our two fans.

892
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,940
There's one on one side and one on the other side.

893
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,860
The Nelson ratings will explode now.

894
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,800
They'll double overnight.

895
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,300
Okay, we now have two fans blowing up here at Tarzan's radio station.

896
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,460
You know, speaking of...

897
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,920
All we need is a chem toilet, actually, right now.

898
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,720
Right back here. A small little porta-potty.

899
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,800
You know...

900
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,700
I could really use one right now.

901
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,220
Praise Bob!

902
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,780
Yes!

903
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,500
Yes!

904
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,060
Yes!

905
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,880
I'm concerned that the last maintenance record on the porta-potty was from 615.

906
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,160
Should you be concerned that the last maintenance record on the porta-potty was from 615?

907
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,800
No, you should not!

908
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,000
No, it ages like a fine wine!

909
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:34,480
Because we have a special signage that explains that those porta-potties are indeed Chico Poppy Jagers.

910
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:42,040
And that porta-potty that you chose seems to be one of the designated port-potties.

911
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,240
Chico Poppy Jagers, where they are not to be flushed.

912
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,880
That's my six!

913
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,400
Why does it hurt when I pee?

914
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:59,480
Did you catch it from the toilet seat?

915
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,740
Oh, why does it hurt when I pee?

916
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,540
Oh, no, there's a...

917
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,880
Did you catch it from the toilet seat?

918
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,680
I think it might be VD.

919
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,460
Oh, why does it hurt when I pee?

920
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,780
Get on stage, come on!

921
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,680
No, but I don't have anything else to say!

922
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,740
She wants to know!

923
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,820
Why do you never go on stage?

924
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,260
Why not?

925
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,460
Why not?

926
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,320
Why not?

927
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:39,580
Why not?

928
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,420
Why not?

929
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,260
What is she strip of a

930
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,440
nights of

931
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:58,060
Ah, what wisdom drops from the mouth of God!

932
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:05,700
Oh, no, she's shorten now, that's why she must know!

933
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,240
Oh, that's fate!

934
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,960
Oh, no, she said daddy is an perdal.

935
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,000


936
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,000


937
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,000


938
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,000


939
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,000


940
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,360
Who won't throw up his Mexico ante the day as he sees that eliminated 엄마 did just

941
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:10,360


942
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:20,260
And the quantity of vodka in my belly makes you wonder how I'm standing.

943
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,140
That's impressive.

944
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:30,160
The people I was just talking to thought they wondered where I've gone.

945
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,980
It was to, it was to, to the porta potty.

946
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:48,920
And I saw that sign that said it hadn't been serviced since 615.

947
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,720
It is what, 630 now?

948
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,920
630 or is it, is it July 1st already?

949
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,440
Motherfucker.

950
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,260
Why does it hurt when I pee?

951
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,660
Catch it from the porta potty.

952
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,200
I don't know my BBD.

953
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,620
Why does it hurt?

954
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,460
I just realized I stole this song from someone else.

955
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,540
Please don't publish this anywhere.

956
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,780
I might get sued by some hippie in Cleveland.

957
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,280
This is totally fair use.

958
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,160
Okay, that's fine.

959
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,100
Here we go.

960
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,620
Do I have an exit strategy?

961
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,980
Dear God, I don't have an exit strategy.

962
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,840
What do I do?

963
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,500
Sing your, sing your way out of it.

964
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,160
Sing your way out of it.

965
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,740
That's the only thing you can do.

966
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,040
I can steal another song.

967
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,960
Sing your way out of it.

968
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,940
Should I steal another song?

969
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,300
If you must.

970
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,660
Sing your way out of it.

971
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,080
Okay.

972
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,380
Why the fuck not?

973
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,160
Sing your way out of it.

974
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,200
I've had a lot of vodka.

975
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,120
Trouble night.

976
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,340
Trouble night.

977
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:10,400
Trouble night.

978
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,180
Lord, I'm blue.

979
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,120
And now I won't be blue always.

980
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,780
Cause I'm gonna come, my Lord,

981
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,320
come in at my back door someday.

982
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,980
Gonna lay, lay my head

983
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,140
on that old well of mine.

984
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,960
I don't remember the rest of the words.

985
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,600
Make them up.

986
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,220
It's time to go to sleep.

987
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,900
Is it time for you to sleep?

988
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,220
It's really time for you to sleep.

989
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,380
Is it the vodka you can save?

990
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,400
It must have been the vodka.

991
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,920
Was it the smell from the port-a-potty?

992
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,720
It must have been the smell.

993
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,020
Must have been the smell.

994
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,820
Did it weaken your constitution?

995
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,780
My constitution, I do decree.

996
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,780
It stinks in the port-a-potty.

997
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,040
It stinks in the port-a-potty.

998
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,020
It stinks.

999
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,480
And the end note.

1000
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:13,960
Yay!

1001
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,040
Somewhat of a sort of a kind of an answer for you.

1002
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,640
Evidently the people that kept the records

1003
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,380
in their port-a-sands,

1004
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,700
they messed up and it has been serviced

1005
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,960
since you've been there.

1006
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,360
But you just didn't see the markings.

1007
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,740
So don't you fear the port-a-sand is there.

1008
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,020
And it's clear for you.

1009
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,100
It really, really is.

1010
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,200
Then why is it her?

1011
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,260
When I pee?

1012
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,340
I guess it must, it must be V-D.

1013
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,120
Not from the port-a-potty.

1014
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,460
Not from the port-a-potty.

1015
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,340
I guess it must, it must be V-D.

1016
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:09,340


1017
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:09,340


1018
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:09,340


1019
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,680
As I must not try to pursue a political career now

1020
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,880
It's all over, but someone's probably feeling it right now

1021
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:28,560
And it's quite entertaining to listen to your boys and them singing

1022
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:36,640
I had no idea that you had such low pipes

1023
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:45,900
I would be happy to have you on the stage every open jam night

1024
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,160
I love you, Annie

1025
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,280
I love you, too!

1026
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,620
You are so beautiful!

1027
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,740
You are so lovely!

1028
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,220
You are so fishy!

1029
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,600
But you're such a flattery!

1030
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,040
And flattery will get you lots of places

1031
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,600
After all,

1032
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,040
You're a real flower!

1033
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,120
You wanna untie my shoelaces?

1034
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,000
You're a real flower!

1035
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,200
You're a real flower!

1036
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,540
You're a real flower!

1037
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,240
You're a real flower!

1038
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,280
You're a real flower!

1039
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,200
You're a real flower!

1040
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,200


1041
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,440
I've noticed that each, this is the third for me, I've been here, this is my third day

1042
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,620
And I'm getting a little more ragged and worn out each day

1043
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,120
I'm assuming that by the time the saucers get here I'll be almost dead

1044
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,620
My voice worn out, but who cares?

1045
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,560
Well, it's a very significant day, the third day, I know it was my third day

1046
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,380
Because it was the first time I used the extra meditation chambers

1047
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,160
I figured this must have holy significance

1048
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,760
Oh, those, those, uh, Kim, those, oh, those are sweat lodges, those are sacred sweat lodges

1049
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,140
May I ask a question about that?

1050
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,620
Uh, the one near me is peculiar

1051
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,600
You feel like a kid because your feet don't touch the floor

1052
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,440
You don't touch the ground, you know, why are the seats so high up in the air?

1053
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:17,400
Is this just a peculiarity of the one near me or are they all designed to make you feel like a kid sitting on the potty?

1054
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,100
I thought I, I always feel like I'm a king sitting on a throne when I'm high above

1055
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,240
So your legs are long enough to reach the ground?

1056
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:24,800
No

1057
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:25,840
They're not?

1058
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,480
No, no, no, you want to be high up there so that your, your feet are dangling

1059
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,440
Like you feel like you're in Santa Claus's lap

1060
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,840
I feel like dragging a cinder block in here

1061
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,740
But you're going to leave him a present

1062
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,840
It smells like you're in Santa Claus's lap too

1063
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,560
You are, you're in Santa's lap and you want to make sure you leave him a present here

1064
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,840
Pilo do Crescius

1065
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:51,480
What I find especially intriguing about these particular little sweat lodges is that the women usually are the ones who take a flashlight in with them

1066
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,380
And at night you get this wonderful silhouette show

1067
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,300
Well I just, uh, said with men if you're just using the urinal part of it you don't need light

1068
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,580
You just can tell by the, you wave it around a little bit and when you hear a certain sound you know you're hitting the right spot

1069
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,500
You're going for that, that certain timbre

1070
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,180
Yeah, with the, it has a drumming sound if you're missing the little, uh, urinal area

1071
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,840
And that's the same with the potty, you know, you kind of get the

1072
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,500
Yeah

1073
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,040
If it's right

1074
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,580
The rim shot

1075
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,260
Yeah, that came up

1076
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,980
Otherwise you're on the wrong side of the rim

1077
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,860
Wrong side of the rim

1078
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,740
Wrong side of the rim

1079
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,600
Wrong side of the rim

1080
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,400
Wrong side of the rim

1081
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,660
I have to say that Wakers for Bob endorses those activities

1082
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,460
Well, Wakers for Bob, that's a Harley pursuit

1083
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,980
But is that all you're gonna do?

1084
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,180
Is that you're gonna try to better the chips for Bob?

1085
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,700
Are you gonna try to wake with all your might?

1086
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,000
Are you gonna drown the world with your subgenius seed?

1087
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,320
You're serious?

1088
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,700
That doesn't fucking matter!

1089
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,080
You can still drown the world with your subgenius seed

1090
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,280
You can kill the pigs with your subgenius seed

1091
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:03,980
You can kill the pigs with your subgenius spunk

1092
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,200
Ladies, with your subgenius female ejaculate

1093
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,480
You can drown the world and kill people because that shit is corrosive

1094
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,060
It'll kill people right there

1095
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,880
And if you're not flirting with them, probably you're with the wrong guy

1096
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,220
Because the truth of it is, like I said

1097
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,480
What are you gonna do after you pay your $30?

1098
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,640
Are you just gonna lay in your ass?

1099
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,380
If you lay in your ass, that is a holy pursuit!

1100
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,500
Then you can decide, I wanna do something else

1101
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,880
I don't think Bob's really... I'm gonna get to catch your Bob yet

1102
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,520
But what are you gonna do?

1103
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,380
Are you gonna run down to City Hall and dance naked and say

1104
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,100
You guys are full of shit!

1105
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,320
Are you gonna praise yourself?

1106
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,840
Like, what are you gonna do?

1107
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,500
You're gonna say, you know what? I'm a subgenius!

1108
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,120
I can do whatever the fuck I want!

1109
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,260
Are you gonna take your ideas from the book and change them to be an original idea?

1110
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,560
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1111
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,160
Just do as my cock says!

1112
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,560
You're gonna take my ideas and show them the opposite way.

1113
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,620
I'm not gonna be like Y campsite

1114
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,780
You're gonna do whatever the fuck I want!

1115
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:43,680
Sing a whole song

1116
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:43,680


1117
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,440
Those betterin' ain't the other way around

1118
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,940
Y Day

1119
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:59,320
