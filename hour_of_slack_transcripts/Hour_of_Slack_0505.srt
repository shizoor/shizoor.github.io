1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,620
Stand by to play. Stand by to win.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,680
And when the Loomis-Albert car pulls up with one million...

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,760
Stand by to play the show.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,340
I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your show.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,180
You know the more.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,220
It helps and helps.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,980
I want anything like it.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,280
I want something like it.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,300
Within the Great Pyramid, the secret chamber of the subgenius.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,320
My God.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,600
What light and steam come from the special effects department located below the pyramid?

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,160
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,860
The subgenius.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,460
Hour of Swatch.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,880
It's the recombination of its own devices.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,720
Its history is only itself.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
It doesn't touch the ground.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,800
It is simply an endless recycling of what it has already done.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,220
A kind of tedious rehearsal.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,360
With its own promises.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,600
Ready?

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,380
Gotta go, guys.

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:58,820
Let's throw it.

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,240
Here we go.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,480
In.

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,160
The redistribution of its own moves.

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,100
It's the recombination of its own devices.

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,880
Its history is only itself.

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,280
It doesn't touch the ground.

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,920
It is simply an endless recycling of what it has already done.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,460
A kind of tedious rehearsal of its own promises.

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,800
Hey.

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,880
Hey.

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,800
What is this?

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,680
What is...

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,600
What the hell?

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,680
Just catching up.

38
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,460
What am I supposed to do?

39
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,020
What the hell is going on, Jimmy?

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,580
The hell is going on.

41
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,580


42
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,040
What's going on, Jamie?

43
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,860
Jamie, what's the scale here?

44
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,420
They're robbing him.

45
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,060
Tell me what to do.

46
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,520
Do them out, you idiot.

47
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:31,980
What?

48
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,720
Okay, dopamine.

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,520
Hit him up.

50
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,540
Who the hell is this?

51
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,580
This is Puzzle Hammer.

52
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,200
What do you mean?

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,220
This is my show.

54
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,360
Oh, Rose.

55
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,100
There you go.

56
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,000
See, this is Puzzle Hammer.

57
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,760
He gets her blush.

58
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,940
Oh, thanks.

59
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,160
This place is dope.

60
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,280
That's fine.

61
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,560
I'll give you a good time to show.

62
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
I can't.

63
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't.

64
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,020
We have to do it now.

65
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,580
Good evening.

66
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,580
Howdy.

67
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,080
No bright lights for the go-on that protects us at any time.

68
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,380
It's set up for the event.

69
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,280
Out.

70
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
There we go.

71
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,360
Look, it's all clear now.

72
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,560
We shut off the puzzling evidence KPFA and Berkeley Dr. Howell show.

73
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,680
And now it's just the one show.

74
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,080
The one wacky show.

75
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Yes, we're back again with some wacky fun and games and many, many cassettes to spin.

76
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,660
And CD discs and all like that.

77
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:36,400
And yeah, I'm going to go back to a routine that we were playing at the end of the last show,

78
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,440
which for you was a week ago.

79
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
But for me, it was only 20 minutes ago.

80
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,540
So this is what we call the cheapest form of time control.

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,320
Patented subgenius flavored time control, whereby I am able to produce.

82
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,560
I have actually already produced two and one eighth hours.

83
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,680
Hours of slack in only about one hour and 45 minutes.

84
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,180
I'm going to put I'm trying for is four shows in three hours.

85
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,580
Okay.

86
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,280
So we'll what?

87
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,260
Me.

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,420
But I've been feeling very nervous lately.

89
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,140
I don't want to talk about it right now.

90
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,920
I take these long walks in order to relieve myself of my brain problems.

91
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,020
It appears that during one of these walks, I heard screams.

92
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,160
I mean, maybe from within sight the wall.

93
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,640
It was a good thing that I happened to have my spade in my my pickaxe in my my wheelbarrow of submit handy.

94
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,600
So I was able to unearth her, be able to bring her back into the land of the living.

95
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,700
So to speak.

96
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,620
Even as the wind blows, I think I'm getting a slight chill.

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
Perhaps I should be still here in the cellar so that she does not catch cold.

98
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,400
I do this.

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,280
After all, she is rather naked.

100
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,400
It appears that someone.

101
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,480
Has removed her clothes.

102
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,380
I do have a spare setback in my apartment, which I believe to be her side.

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
However, I could be so uncertain.

104
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,240
I believe that it looks like someone has been pretending that she was still alive the past five years.

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,740
Why, yes, they continue to to to stroke and show such love and affection to her body.

106
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,000
As if they were setting her up in front of the television and the.

107
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,960
In the easy chairs, if she were watching TV with the rest of the family.

108
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,860
Certainly a jury cannot convict such a man who obviously was in love with this girl.

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,800
She will replace the oven warmed cantaloupe.

110
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,940
Surely a jury would say that the defendant was mad.

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,940
Remember, we are in America, the land in which mad people are never punished.

112
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,700
Why, when I moved here, that was one of the first things I learned.

113
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,720
Some say that is why I moved here.

114
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,540
So that.

115
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,160
I can help prevent these crimes from occurring in my country.

116
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,200
I have experienced many such instances.

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,240
Why, I have advanced degrees in mental illness.

118
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,120
In fact, I've spent a large portion of my time studying studying the mental ill in institutions.

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:24,900
I have even pretended to be mentally ill so that they would place me in these institutions and I can live beside these disturbed individuals and learn from their sinister and somewhat distorted views of life.

120
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,140
Some thought what I did was very courageous that I would give up so many years of my life to live among these mentally ill.

121
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Shut up little voices, shut up!

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,660
The

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,020
The

124
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,020


125
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,020


126
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,180
The

127
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,980
The

128
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,040
The

129
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,040


130
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,040


131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,600
This can't be happening

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,160
This can't be happening

133
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,220
I think I took too much

134
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,880
It's no video

135
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
Psychotic and abnormal

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,160
It's beyond Satanism

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,560
It's beyond

138
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,580
The long

139
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,140
Unreleased

140
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:31,820
One pill to imagine

141
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,620
I thought I was talking to God

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,040
And I looked up and it was

143
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,180
A police car

144
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:53,340
A minute ago

145
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,080
I was in seventh grade

146
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,700
Trying marijuana

147
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,720
For the first time

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,940
And now

149
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,020
Oh

150
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,600
What happened

151
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,900
A living cow

152
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,140
A living cow

153
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,280
With more free pills

154
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,020
What have I done

155
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,060
And now

156
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,540
And now

157
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,080
And now

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,220
Crimes of the conspiracy

159
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,840
Are truly slimy

160
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,340
And chill out there

161
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,300
Ah

162
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,480
I've been living as a subgenius

163
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,740
As long as I can remember

164
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,440
And I think now

165
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,780
I just like to

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,700
Nothing

167
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,020
He's melting in his sleep

168
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,200
And he's going into the gene pool

169
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,180
Once again

170
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,100
Dave just dilutes back into the slime

171
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,420
From whence he first crawled

172
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,800
Eighty billion years ago

173
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,000
To become a mighty overman

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,320
From the slime of his own genes

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,220
A cosmic pudding created by Dave's own schmutz

176
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,800
Dave has taken the ultimate trip

177
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
He has gone back to his home town

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,800
To his own spermatozoa

179
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,440
And then evolved forward into future man

180
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,300
A brain with two small appendages hanging from them

181
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,900
How am I going to get around like this

182
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,840
I hope this is still a dream

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,160
Man this is ugly as hell

184
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,560
That's right it's only a dream Dave

185
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,140
Yeah this is only a dream

186
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,980
There's no possible way I can be like a brain with two tiny legs

187
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:11,980


188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,620
And two little dangly things hanging from it

189
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,320
Yeah you'll wake up any minute

190
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,820
It's just a dream don't worry about it

191
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,560
You'll be waking up any minute

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,600
Can you believe that idiot

193
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
Little voices

194
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Little voices don't usually talk to me while I'm dreaming

195
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,460
I think little I must now I must still be awake

196
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,860
Then maybe I have melted into gene pool

197
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,660
I never can tell what's really going on

198
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,020
Going on

199
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,840
Going on

200
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,120
Going on

201
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,580
Going on

202
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,080
Going on

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,980
Going on

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,620
Going on

205
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm huge and I'm all stinky

206
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,620
At most I think I'm stinky though I didn't have a nose to breathe with

207
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,980
And you spilled your pudding

208
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,460
I am the pudding

209
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,800
Oh god no

210
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,620
The pudding

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah man

212
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,220
Yeah man

213
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,400
Get this shit up

214
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,400


215
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,400


216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,720
Ha ha

217
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,580
You're stoned out of your mind, man.

218
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm just kidding.

219
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,480
Yeah!

220
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
All right, man!

221
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,560
That was cool, man!

222
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,500
Got anything to eat, man?

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:37,880
Road.

224
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,760
Yeah, check it out!

225
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,660
Twist one up, man.

226
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,440
Let's get wasted.

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,580
Sounds like a good idea, man.

228
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,560
I'm trying to come back a little bit anyway.

229
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,260
Here, man.

230
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,880
I have a step on the magic list.

231
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,400
Go dig it.

232
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,260
Fuck it up.

233
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,860
Seems like all we ever do is get stoned and watch the show.

234
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,020
Too many店.

235
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,020
Ah!

236
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:44,860


237
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,940
Does it have any little throat clusters I can chew on?

238
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,180
Man, I'm still hungry.

239
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,400
Four.

240
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,300
Four bucks.

241
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,520
Loaded.

242
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,460
Eight forty-four.

243
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, wanko, wanko.

244
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,760
Now we're all fat.

245
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,900
Power months.

246
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,380
I love growth, man.

247
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,720
Yeah.

248
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,580
Get ready, man, let's party.

249
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,020
Six one seven.

250
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,480
Lick bone.

251
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,640
Mathan, my mind, man.

252
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,760
I think you gotta know this man.

253
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,540
Yeah, big hit with a bullet.

254
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,060
Oh!

255
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Hey, where have you guys been, man?

256
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,920
We're starving.

257
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,660
We were boobies, man.

258
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Well, we wouldn't have been.

259
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,900
You ate half of them, man.

260
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,020
Oh!

261
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,340
Good.

262
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,980
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,100
Good job.

264
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,100


265
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,940
Good job.

266
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,220
I'm the one who called and said I was in the portal.

267
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
You told me I left you behind and you were in the future.

268
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,540
Now let's stop talking about people behind in the future or the past.

269
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,300
I saw a bunch of mushrooms floating around with me.

270
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,820
Right.

271
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,940
Astonishing the way the callers always seem to be wandering.

272
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,740
Yeah, I'm here, Mr. President.

273
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,220
Yes, sir. It was just some flowers.

274
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
They were sitting down here at the station.

275
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,160
Oh, Lord.

276
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,660
I'm here.

277
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,260
What were they?

278
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,020
Well, there's one flower, actually.

279
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,780
Just one big bud.

280
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,280
Some incredible plants from another world.

281
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,860
And you tore it up, did you?

282
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,020
Yes, sir, I did.

283
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,180
I tore it up into little pieces and I threw it all over the place.

284
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,700
What'd you do?

285
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,300
I said I tore it up into little pieces and threw it all over the place down at the station.

286
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,360
These vegetable organisms count as seeds or seed rods.

287
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,320
Okay, well, let's get past that for a second.

288
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,300
As you know, I was her husband's vice president.

289
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,240
Yes, sir, I know that.

290
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,360
And frankly, I owe a lot to the Carlisle.

291
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
She seconded my nomination.

292
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,800
Yes, sir.

293
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,800
I think you know that, too.

294
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,440
I understand that.

295
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,680
So why don't we all try to get along a little better over there in Ohio?

296
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,580
Doug, what do you say?

297
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Okay, thank you, sir.

298
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,140
Yes, sir, I will.

299
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,440
I'll tell you myself.

300
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,040
One day she calls me, says she can't live without you.

301
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,500
Next day she's calling almost in tears.

302
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,200
So, you know, maybe you two have some kind of sicko thing going on.

303
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,520
No, sir.

304
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,340
No, sir, we don't.

305
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,640
We're just, we're fine down here.

306
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,340
You see this, Doug?

307
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Any more phone calls from her, you're gonna be guarding my dog.

308
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,680
You understand what I'm saying?

309
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,200
Yes, sir.

310
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
So I've probably got the most important job in the world.

311
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, sir.

312
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,840
There's a cue.

313
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,560
What do you say?

314
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,620
You gonna help me out on this one?

315
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,200
Yes, sir.

316
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,580
That's fine.

317
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:29,900
Yes, sir.

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,520
Thanks, Doug.

319
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,440
That's what I wanted to hear.

320
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,320
You have yourself a nice evening, son.

321
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,540
All right, thanks, sir.

322
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,840
Bye.

323
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Bye, Mr. President.

324
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,860
Now, the chief executive is a little bit confused there.

325
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,740
It's actually the morning, not the evening.

326
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
But aside from that...

327
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,580
He's on Air Force One.

328
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,280
I'm behind his platform 100% as he travels over the international dateline backwards

329
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,780
in Air Force One, otherwise known in military lingo as huevos rancheros.

330
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,460
Hey, where'd my homie go, dude?

331
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,500
Well, your home, see, now in the new age, you have to find your home.

332
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,500


333
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,140
It moves, and you don't.

334
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,880
It's where you are.

335
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,420
You got a Concord.

336
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,380
I seem to have lost you.

337
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,140
I can't take it.

338
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,620
Concord, for God's sake.

339
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,540
Okay, check home page, yeah.

340
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,920
And yes, Reverend Hale's on the Concord.

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,640
I'm wondering how old you people are.

342
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,540
Me too.

343
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,740
How old do you think we are?

344
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,420
How old are you?

345
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,860
What difference does it make?

346
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,060
35.

347
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,600
Dude, okay, I'm sorry.

348
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,720
That's the number I get all the time.

349
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,840
Uh-oh.

350
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,160
Sorry.

351
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,480
Oh, you startled that young caller there with that revelation.

352
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,800
No, that's all right.

353
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,720
But, you know, we are older than these callers can imagine.

354
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,380
Give me that crazy dude.

355
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm not crazy.

356
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,500


357
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,720
Crazy dude?

358
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,500
Oh, I guess he must mean me, dear friends.

359
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,980
Well, who, what, and what, what are you?

360
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,220
What have we been listening to, dear friends?

361
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,580
Well, of course, that just then was some of the puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell show,

362
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,560
a recent one for once, on KPFA in Berkeley.

363
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,780
You know, the wind's been telling stories that that show's gonna get canceled too because

364
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,480
of stationery.

365
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
And the station has gone pink.

366
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,580
Oh, pardon me.

367
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,340
I didn't mean to pop the P's on this pathetic microphone.

368
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,320
Yes, the puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

369
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:22,180
And before that, OBE, the Fantabulous Band OBE Outband Experience with their sort of

370
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,820
mix called Groat Clusters.

371
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,480
It's a special bong fest mix off of the main one.

372
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,940
It's a vocals CD, which is a, uh, proceeds from the sale of this CD will benefit the

373
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,420
drive to end cannabis prohibition in Maine.

374
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Well, when they gonna start talking about frop prohibition, man?

375
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,800
How about the, the free frop campaign?

376
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,160
Um, anyway, I'm gonna play some more off of that CD later, cause it's got some, some nifty

377
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,540
stuff.

378
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:59,660
And of course, before that, the, the, um, well, we went into the mind of Lonesome Cowboy

379
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,860
Dave, uh, on WCSB ESO radio in Cleveland, uh, Einstein Secret Orchestra.

380
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:15,320
This show has taken on sort of a mentally ill drug brain damaged aspect this time.

381
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,920
I never, I, sometimes I know where a show is heading to and other times it just, the

382
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,380
subject matter takes over.

383
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,020
And, um, and what led into this particular one was, uh, Father Joe Mama.

384
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,200
It's Saint Jane or Hypercleves on, uh, Suzie the Flusie's show, WREK, Bob's Slack Time

385
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,280
Funhouse, uh, talking about the mentally ill and how they went to live among the mentally

386
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,400
ill so that they could discover them better.

387
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:52,040
I certainly understand exactly what they're talking about because it, I, I mean, after

388
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,100
all, would a crazy man be capable of doing a show such as this one, eh?

389
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,880
My God.

390
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,600
Look at the destruction that has been wreaked upon this, this, this innocent family.

391
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,960
Who would even think of doing such a thing?

392
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,480
Oh, oh, stand back.

393
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:22,240
This garage door opener is connected to 100 tons of TNT and my grasp on sanity is so feeble

394
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,860
I just might press it.

395
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,520
Get back, Robin.

396
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:29,640
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:29,640


398
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:29,640


399
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,240
It's the, the Riddler.

400
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,880
There's only one mind that could be so shaky as to release this man from prison.

401
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,080
I remember.

402
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,280
Surprise!

403
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
It's the Joker.

404
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,160
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

405
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,300
Hey, I'll do the jokes around here, Jane.

406
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,260
You're getting on my nerves.

407
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,440
Almost as bad as that Batman character.

408
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,480
If I can just reach my utility belt, Robin.

409
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,640
I believe there's an anti-aircraft gun.

410
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,640


411
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,360
I believe there's an anti-jigsaw corrosion device that possibly can save us.

412
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,680
Maybe we could call Alfred and he could come on the ALF cycle.

413
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,920
Just a few inches further, Robin.

414
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:21,040
I think I've almost pressed the Bat communicator that can reach communication with the Bat

415
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,160
computer that can in fact achieve communication with the ALF cycle.

416
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
If I can just...

417
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,340
Oh, man.

418
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,620
That was the closest I could get.

419
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:29,940
I haven't had the slightest call yet.

420
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,420
For a moment there, I have to admit, I was scared.

421
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,060
I was never worried for a moment, Robin.

422
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,100
How's that?

423
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,620
Haven't you ever noticed how we always manage to elude the vicious ensnarements of our underhanded opponents?

424
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,860
Don't you know why?

425
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,500
Because we're smarter than they are.

426
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,700
I prefer to think it's because we're pure of heart.

427
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:56,220
If you read your science book, Robin, you'll remember that a jigsaw blade has about 27 gears inside the mechanism.

428
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,600
It was a simple matter to nullify, to...

429
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,640
I had 12 of those gears with the device in my utility belt.

430
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,180
We had precisely...

431
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,740
Collie, you bet me.

432
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,100
Next time I'll have to study a little harder.

433
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,540
We had precisely 2.5 seconds.

434
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:19,140
I happened to be champion jigsaw cutter alongside by champion chip marble shooter and Marlboro smoker, I might add.

435
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,220
Okay, now we got existentialist superheroes.

436
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,260
Now let's go after that child molester that was on earlier in the show.

437
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,600
Why, you two boys.

438
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


439
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,600


440
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,300
Always hither-tither and yawn.

441
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Well, Aunt Harriet, Dick and I were just heading down to the pond for a little skinny dipping, but we'll be right back.

442
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,180
Oh, lookie. It's the bat signal.

443
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,500
Damn. Always at the most inopportune moments.

444
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,540
Very well, Aunt Harriet. We'll be on our way.

445
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,340
I'll be right behind you, Dick.

446
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,500
On the bat pole.

447
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:05,860
And you've been listening to the width and wisdom of Jane or Hypercleets and Father Joe Mama, those two radio clowns of yesteryear.

448
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:16,020
We all remember sitting around the old Victrola radios of the past, listening to that dynamically wacky duo.

449
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,660
We did have one caller wanted to know...

450
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,480
Someone just called to ask about your...

451
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,220
Your website on the internet.

452
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,320
Okay, this is the one factual thing I'm gonna say.

453
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,740
You better have your pencil ready, or if you don't have the pencil ready, find something sharp and carve it in your arm.

454
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:48,860
The subgenius worldwide website, the largest and most complex state-of-the-art website project in the history of the internet, which is actually a pretty short history, thank God.

455
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,340
And we wanted to get this done quick, because we have a feeling it won't last much longer.

456
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
I'm gonna give that address.

457
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,380
It's one of those http:// type addresses, okay?

458
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
And here it is.

459
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,720
Sunsite.unk.edu slash subgenius.

460
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,640
I'll say that again and I'll spell it out.

461
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:23,280
S-U-N-S-I-T-E period U-N-C period E-D-U slash subgenius in all small letters.

462
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,820
S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.

463
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,360
That is all.

464
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,460
And have a nice day.

465
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,000
Love.

466
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,280
Wow!

467
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,060
Wow!

468
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
Wow!

469
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,200
Wow!

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,360
Wow!

471
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,360


472
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,980
Wow!

473
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,620
Wow!

474
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,380


475
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:43,520


476
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:43,940


477
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,960
Wow!

478
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,320
Wow!

479
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,760
Wow!

480
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,840


481
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,840


482
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,840


483
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,840

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,280
Wow.

489
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,320
Wow.

490
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,020
looks like the

491
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,020


492
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Just

493
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,120


494
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,840
that.

495
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,600
and

496
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
rules

497
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,740
just because

498
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:22,760
it,

499
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:22,820
let's

500
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,160
My connection with alcohol and tits.

501
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,140
But maybe there's some notes we play that someone else plays too.

502
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,320
But you don't recognize it, no, you haven't got a clue.

503
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,680
If we're a Zappa copy band, then what the hell are you?

504
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,140
With metal bands galore, we could use a thousand more.

505
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,120
But they don't really sound alike now today.

506
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,320
We're not just another Zappa copy band.

507
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,020
They don't really sound alike now today.

508
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,100
We're not just another Zappa copy band.

509
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,320
Not just another Zappa copy band.

Well, I guess the world wasn't these callers oysters.

534
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,140
Someone talking about Rush Limbaugh?

535
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,380
Yeah, Rush Limbaugh.

536
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,440
Yeah.

537

Hey, stop laughing.

We can send a scary raise to the speaker right into your heads over there.

This is a show.

You like his pizza commercial?

Stop laughing.

It's not funny.

That's something you whippersnappers can't understand.

548
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,080
By God, what's the matter with this generation?

549
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,420
Who's going to fight the next war?

550
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay, that's your cue.

551
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,860
What's wrong with generation?

552
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
Hey, this is Consumer Products.

553
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,600
How's it going?

554
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,480
How you doing, man?

555
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm wondering if the subgenius dating game has started.

556
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,000
Because I'm looking for a tank boy.

557
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,820
Is that like radioactive carbon dating?

558
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,000
Well, what are you looking for?

559
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,060
A tank boy.

560
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,140
A tank boy?

561
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,240
That can hijack a fucking...

562
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,920
We'll hook you up with cat lady.

563
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,160
You've got to put white tape over the little bad...

564
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,320
And we're going to have to excise that portion of the show.

565
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,700
Then, um...

566
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,080
Well, okay, the word...

567
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,360
How's the tank?

568
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,500
Have I got a girl for you.

569
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,500
Maude Findlay.

570
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,660
63.

571
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,920
Yes, you'll really go for her.

572
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,120
Kindly send in your name and your application with the usual fee.

573
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,460
And I will put Ms. Findlay in charge of your personal account.

574
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,600
Thank you.

575
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,980
Those promised sex with it.

576
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,580
Fungus, fungus.

577
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, it's a great promise.

578
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,180
Intergalactic beige.

579
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,900
And a singing contract on Alpha Centauri.

580
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,620
It's all good.

581
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,060
Not.

582
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,120
Fungus.

583
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,620
Sex.

584
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,800
That awaits you, Dave.

585
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:10,680
Sex.

586
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,540
Fungus.

587
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,180
Sex.

588
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,740
Fungus.

589
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,400
Sex.

590
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,660
Fungus.

591
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:16,780
Fungus.

592
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,280
Sex.

593
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,340
Sex.

594
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,340


595
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,340


596
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,340


597
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,340


598
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,340


599
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,820
Hi, little girl.

600
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,760
What's your name?

601
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,620
Oh.

602
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Oh.

603
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,180
Fanny Fungus.

604
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,060
What's yours?

605
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,920
Gerald Fungus.

606
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,740
You're good looking.

607
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
So are you, babe.

608
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,540
I was wondering if you'd like to go out and inspect some toenails?

609
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh!

610
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,940
Oh!

611
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,380
Oh!

612
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,340


613
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:47,960
Oh!

614
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,220
That's so good.

615
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,160
Lots of fun.

616
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,560
Have you ever had sex with an elder god?

617
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,840
Why, yes, I have, but mostly in my dreams.

618
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
Have you ever tasted a real alien shmeg and pie?

619
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,720
Yes.

620
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,620
I'm among the privileged few.

621
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,040
Let's just go over to the bar and have some sushi,

622
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,720
and then maybe we can go and watch a movie later.

623
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,820
Okay.

624
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,460
Okay.

625
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,960
I'll feel very worried.

626
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm worried a lot.

627
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,640
Okay.

628
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,160
Oh, God.

629
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,940
Okay.

630
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,660
Okay.

631
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,300
I hope this tumor is benign.

632
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,700
I hope there's nothing wrong with my arm

633
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,560
and where the cockroach is respiting.

634
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,580
See, I had a dream I had fungal sex

635
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,000
with this ultimate fungus babe.

636
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,700
Maybe.

637
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,240
Maybe I did, and now I'm dreaming again.

638
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,680
Yeah, the dream, it's mixed in now.

639
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,720
You're not hardly there.

640
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,660
It's like the world of No Layer, Elvis,

641
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
and what the heck it was.

642
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,240
I stick my hand right through you.

643
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,980
Oh, yeah.

644
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,060
Lamb, lamb, lemon, lemon flavored rum,

645
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,260
Stanislaus lamb, that's right.

646
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,160
You're from the whiskey planet.

647
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,660
You want to torsecute me and persecute me.

648
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,700
It's because we love you, Dave.

649
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,420
Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night

650
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,540
may become a subgenius when wolfbane blooms

651
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,600
and the autumn moon is bright.

652
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,720
Hey, little voice, I ain't never been pure in my life.

653
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,460
If there's a chance of me having hot sex with a fungus,

654
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,800
you know I'm going for it.

655
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,940
Well, it is a fungus, but it feels almost like a regular woman.

656
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,200
It does feel like a regular woman.

657
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,660
Or whatever.

658
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Well, it's been so long since I've felt a regular woman.

659
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,840
I think this should pass for a regular woman,

660
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,480
except for these little suction cup patches around the bottom.

661
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,540
I wonder what these things do.

662
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,160
Oh, wow.

663
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,380
Do you like that?

664
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,740
Yes, I do.

665
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,940
Well, some of this fungus is now on my hands, though.

666
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,860
It's just...

667
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,380
It's just...

668
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,260
It's just...

669
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,420
It's just...

670
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,180
It doesn't do anything to me.

671
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,620
It doesn't do anything to me.

672
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,480
It doesn't do anything to me.

673
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,740
You'll have to wait and see, Dave.

674
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:57,080
I wish I could get something good to eat around here.

675
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,640
Eat some of this slack chive, Dave.

676
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,060
You can sort of make out on the surface of me the pattern in the fungus that says,

677
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,780
Drink me.

678
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,420
Hello, everybody.

679
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,480
Hello, everybody.

680
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
Eat my red crawfish there, Dave.

681
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,300
Crawfish? Oh yeah, I know about them. I know about them crawfish.

682
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,040
Them Cajun Prairie Squid Gumbo recipes.

683
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,740
Was that what you wanted to hear about? The Cajun Prairie Squid Gumbo recipe?

684
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,700
Well, you know, this is, in Crescent City, this is the number one program for cooking and good eating right here.

685
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,540
And today on the program, you know, what a big town this is for saints and everything like that.

686
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,960
Everybody got their own patron saint.

687
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,880
And tonight, our patron saint is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

688
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,620
And we got a man in the cloth hood as he's going to teach us how to make, what is it again?

689
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,480
It's Prairie Squid.

690
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,280
Prairie Squid Gumbo.

691
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,520
This is a riverboat special, which I'm happy taught me.

692
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,820
How do you make Prairie Squid out of the Mississippi Delta Prairie Squid?

693
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,320
Well, that sounds real delicious.

694
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,540
So we're going to start off.

695
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,380
First up, you're going to butter this.

696
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,480
I mean, you're going to flour this real good, right?

697
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:10,940
You're going to take...

698
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,780
Well, tell us about the Prairie Squid.

699
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,220
Well, first you have to go out in your canoe in the swamp and gig you some squid, boy.

700
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,060
Now...

701
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,660
You got to go out with your squid gigger and, you know, you can dig up some crawdads and mud bugs and things.

702
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,800
And you gig them into your sack along with them prairie squid.

703
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,680
But you get your prairie squid first.

704
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,080
Fill up that sack with prairie squid, boy.

705
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,320
Now, if we were to go out to Bayou St. John or maybe, like, we'll go up to Lake Ponch, say, for instance.

706
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,680
And you could just go off anywhere or maybe by the river and just get these prairie squids.

707
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:40,940
Anything.

708
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,040
Anywhere.

709
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
I've never seen them before.

710
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,560
You know...

711
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,080
Well, the Mississippi Delta squid is very profligate in these parts.

712
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,120
The only thing you got to remember is the Mississippi Delta squid has a poisonous egg sack.

713
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,900
Oh, you got to take that out for sure.

714
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,480
You got to remove that.

715
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:54,840
Yeah.

716
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,980
Now, as you see here, we take this knife and we carefully slit the lip off the squid.

717
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:01,400
Yeah.

718
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,200
Now, that looks like it might be a complicated...

719
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,960
My friend, Thievado...

720
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,260
Well, you have to love the squid while you excise the poisonous egg sack and gallbladder.

721
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,280
Well, that sounds like a very, very exciting experience.

722
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,360
You actually making love to the squid while you're excising the...

723
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,060
As you see, the squid is still alive.

724
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,200
We clip the beak and as we say, suck the head.

725
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,780
Just like a mud bug.

726
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,280
Just like a mud bug.

727
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,080
Now, you notice as I work the squid over, as I have my way with it, so to speak, you'll

728
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,160
notice that we try to shave the squid.

729
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,460
Yeah, I noticed you did.

730
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,840
You did shave it down real tight.

731
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,320
Now, there's hardly no hair left on the squid at all.

732
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,240
The diners do not want to fight.

733
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,440
They find a bunch of curly hairs all over their prairie squid when they sit down for

734
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,060
an expensive meal.

735
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,200
No, drowning in hot sauce ain't going to help that night at all.

736
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:47,680
No.

737
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,020
So anyway, you take that squid.

738
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,760
Now, you've got that squid has been well loved and you've got the special smegma sauce in

739
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:54,980
there.

740
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,680
Now, you take that live squid and you flop that squid on the hottest pan in the kitchen.

741
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Because you want to cook that adrenaline, you know, to get that good adrenochrome.

742
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,620
Yeah, you get that in there, you're going to get a hell of a rush out of that, I think.

743
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,220
And then you take that fillet.

744
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,980
You take that fillet de squid.

745
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:11,980
Yeah.

746
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,260
And you dunk it in hot sauce.

747
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,960
You just literally dunk the whole thing right in there.

748
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,540
Just dunk it.

749
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,160
I noticed there a little taste of filet gumbo in there.

750
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,480
Did you mix in a little bit while you were...

751
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Oh, yeah.

752
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,480
You always take your blackened fish, blackened red fish special peppers and...

753
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,640
Your Popeye smoked sandwich there you put on the bottom of it.

754
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,360
And then you take your grandma's face and you slap it on that loaf of bread and you've

755
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,220
got you a fine, grand filet.

756
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,780
And then you take your grandma's face sandwich and a bowl full of steaming hot prairie squid

757
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,560
gumbo.

758
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,300
Yeah.

759
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,180
You better talk about it.

760
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:10,200
Well, this has been Thibodeau Boudreau with the Reverend Ivey and the Reverend Ivey.

761
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


762
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


763
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


764
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


765
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


766
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


767
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


768
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


769
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


770
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


771
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


772
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


773
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


774
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


775
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


776
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


777
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


778
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


779
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,200


780
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,220
And I ended up staying talking about Prairie Squid and cooking them right.

781
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,100
And I guess, well, I only got one excuse and one alibi.

782
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,640
I was home watching soaps with my auntie.

783
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,440
Bye, y'all.

784
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:30,740
We'll see you Saturday night at Peabody's Down Under, that amazing, trendy disco club

785
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:36,780
where you too can experience the swa-ka-ba-la!

786
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,480
I'll see you then.

787
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:37,640
See you.

788
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,360
Bye, y'all.

789
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,360


790
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,540
Bye.

791
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:38,700
Bye.

792
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,060
Bye.

793
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,440
Bye.

794
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,460


795
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,020
Bye.

796
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,180


797
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,200


798
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,020
¶¶

799
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,280
¶¶

800
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,740
¶¶

801
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,060
You'll fall into the twilight world of the lesbian and the homosexual.

802
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,200
¶¶

803
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,820
You'll see topless waitresses really dishing it out.

804
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,200
¶¶

805
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,160
A tremendously powerful and sordid tale of young people

806
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,940
trapped in a savage world of depravity.

807
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,360
¶¶

808
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,940
The church of false subjects.

809
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,980
An intimate revelation of a way of life

810
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,980
barely imagined by others outside its ilk.

811
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,040
The way of life.

812
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,660
A world of furtive meetings and unconventional love affairs.

813
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,140
Loneliness and shame.

814
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,560
¶¶

815
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,800
Want me to take off my clothes?

816
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,600
Why not?

817
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,060
What did you say?

818
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,640
I said, why not, little?

819
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,120
Pressure never hurt anyone.

820
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:10,900
Hear, hear.

821
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,720
You mean we all ought to play for that kind of bet?

822
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,320
Favors?

823
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:19,880
¶¶

824
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,980
Swingers are made, not born.

825
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,960
And you'll see why.

826
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,760
Sex is the game people play.

827
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,660
It's a sick, sick, sick world.

828
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,340
¶¶

829
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,720
The ever-searching for thrills and kicks beyond description.

830
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,880
¶¶

831
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,040
I want more affairs.

832
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,060
I need it bad.

833
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:50,600
¶¶

834
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,740
This is the sex cycle,

835
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,740
where the imagination goes beyond all barriers.

836
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,240
¶¶

837
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,880
You dig the excitement, baby?

838
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,640
It stimulates me.

839
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,720
Then don't talk.

840
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,680
Swing, swing.

841
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,700
¶¶

842
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,420
¶¶

843
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:07,680
¶¶

844
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:07,740
¶¶

845
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:07,740


846
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,000
¶¶

847
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


848
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


849
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,260
A complex moral standard sometimes causes its own rejects.

850
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,180
Bans, taboos, hypocrisies on sex are overthrown by some.

851
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,780
And they turn on the same society that spawned them.

852
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,960
Raise bar.

853
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,640
The world's deepest, most enjoyable feeling.

854
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,540
Launching the head.

855
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,740
Stafanis.

856
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,980
Let's all be doing it.

857
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,940
Stafanis.

858
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,220
Stafanis.

859
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,660
Let's all launch the head.

860
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,160
Let's go.

861
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,380
You first.

862
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,740
Oh, yes.

863
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,820
Nothing feels quite so good as that.

864
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:53,940
¶¶

865
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,440
Oh, I love a good head-launching, don't you?

866
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,980
Boy, I'm sweating like a whore in church.

867
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,380
I hope all of you are launching some heads out there yourself.

868
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,040
Bob knows Arnold Palmer's head is big enough to go around.

869
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:18,660
But I've got a special treat here for you dues-paying subgeniuses out there.

870
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,620
And I know who you are.

871
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:29,340
I have right here in my hot little hands a church mailing list for the entire Southeast.

872
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:37,020
And while our next election throbs on the turntable, I'm going to be rubbing it all over my body.

873
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:44,380
And, oh, you're going to feel it, seekers, no matter what sexual orientation you think you are.

874
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,480
Even if you're not listening to the show.

875
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,220
I just hope you're not operating any heavy machinery.

876
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:00,580
Oh, so let's let Charo, the eternal goddess of coochie-coochie, lead us in this devotional debauch.

877
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,160
Oh, here we go.

878
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,500
Oh, yes, yes.

879
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,020
There's yards and yards of you here.

880
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,760
Oh, heads up, seekers.

881
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,960
Here comes a wave of Bob sex slack.

882
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,060
Oh, I'm pulling the subgenius train on the entire South.

883
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,480
Oh, I got a lot of Bob and Connie and me.

884
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,500
But there's plenty of room for you, too.

885
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,080
There are 117 subgeniuses in Georgia alone.

886
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,900
This land is rich in mutants.

887
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,280
I'm hitting the Atlanta.

888
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:35,980
I'm hitting the area first.

889
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:36,760
Ha-ha!

890
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,700
Oh, take this!

891
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,660
Oh!

892
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,520
Oh, whoo!

893
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,160
Sean Taylor of Avondale Estates.

894
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,400
Whoo!

895
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,360
Brother Ramsey, Truett.

896
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,800
Oh, the young technocrats of Marietta.

897
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,220
Ah!

898
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,320
Todd Canziani and the evil lymph node contingent.

899
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,980
Take this!

900
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,480
Oh, that's...

901
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,240
Oh, this state of the paper cuts is so good.

902
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,420
Oh, man.

903
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,520
I don't know.

904
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,600
Brother, you're in Harvard.

905
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,440
I don't know, friends, if I can handle listening to Suzie the floozy get off with the entire

906
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,260
subgenius mailing list.

907
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,140
I mean, you can't imagine how horrible that seems to me.

908
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,100
I had to print that mailing list out, friends.

909
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,540
Oh, it's a scary situation.

910
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,880
Oh, but I certainly should.

911
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,800
I suppose.

912
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,020
Give the subgenius P.O.

913
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,460
box because I know at this point you're like going, well, I want my name on that piece

914
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,420
of paper that's rubbing all over that Suzie the floozy's body.

915
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:52,820
Now, I've seen pictures of that Suzie and unlike most of the lovely voices one hears

916
00:49:52,820 --> 00:50:00,020
on the radio, there's actually a fairly nice thing there to back it up, you might say.

917
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,400
So, you want to get on that mailing list?

918
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,460
Well, here's how.

919
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,660
Well, this ain't exactly how.

920
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,020
You can find out how if you write for the free information.

921
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,280
And that free information, wait a minute, that is not P.O.

922
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,160
box given music right there.

923
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:25,140
Friends, this has been an unusually, seems like sort of a sex, drugs, and rock and roll

924
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,000
sort of a show this time.

925
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,040
Let's put in some Cleave.

926
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,320
This is probably going to be real smooth, be Brother Cleave.

927
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,900
Yeah.

928
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,280
Yeah.

929
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,360
Yeah.

930
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,940
Now, that's more like it, dear friends.

931
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:48,380
You just write to Bub and ask for that free information from Bub at post office box 140306.

932
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:56,960
That's box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

933
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Bet you couldn't tell by my accent, could you?

934
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,020
And the zip.

935
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,340
The zip.

936
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,880
I think about Susie and that zip.

937
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,520
A 75214.

938
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,560
Oh, yeah.

939
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:21,400
And I think we gave all the, I think probably not the first time we gave that address on

940
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,420
this particular show.

941
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,060
But that means I can do whatever, now that I've done that, I can play whatever I want.

942
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,020
Why don't I, do you have any requests?

943
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,140
Well, I'm waiting.

944
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm waiting.

945
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,260


946
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,260


947
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:34,660


948
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:35,080
I'm waiting.

949
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,460
I'm waiting.

950
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,040
Oh, not to forget the credits, dear friends.

951
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:55,380
That long sex barrage there was of course put together by Reverend, actually it was

952
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:00,160
re-cut by me, but it was first put together by Rev. Susie the Floozy there at WREK in Atlanta.

953
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,360
Praise WREK.

954
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,500
That's the way you do it, right.

955
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,180
And pardon me, I don't know what this guy's singing about in the background.

956
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,180
And before that, some of that Einstein Secret Orchestra radio,

957
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,360
ESO radio from WCSB Cleveland, starring Alonzo Cowboy Dave

958
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,320
and Mighty Mixin' Chaz.

959
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,460
Michelle George on violin.

960
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,480
Jensen Adelman on percussion.

961
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,700
Ivan Stang talking his mouth off.

962
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,080
Todd Joel on bassoon.

963
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,720
Lisa talking her mouth off.

964
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
Dan Flink started talking his mouth off.

965
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,600
Mark playing bass and Keith playing.

966
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,100
Oh, there's a guitar over there.

967
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,000
My name's Chaz.

968
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,180
I do the zeroing.

969
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,500
I play the keyboard here.

970
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,160
We'll see you all Thursday night, okay?

971
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,260
Don't play.

972
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:42,760
Hey, now.

973
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,540
Hey, now.

974
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,160
Hey, now.

975
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,620
Hey, now.

976
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,300
I go, I go all day.

977
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,320
Jag a motor, be now.

978
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,200
I know that.

979
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,000
Jag a motor, be now, day.

980
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,800
Feeling groovy.

981
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,480
Ah, well, boy, it's a thankless task.

982
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,020
But the bells continue to ring.

983
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,860
For in the midst of life, we are in death.

984
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,200
And death closes all.

985
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,400
Yeah, what the heck are you talking about anyway, Hal?

986
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,240
Well, I'm talking about the fact that everyone we know and love is dying.

987
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,300
And after 98, this is time for the subgeniuses.

988
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,640
All the time in the world.

989
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,400
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

990
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,120
So what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to save y'all.

991
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,920
Oh, yeah.

992
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


993
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


994
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


995
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


996
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


997
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


998
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


999
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


1000
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


1001
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


1002
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000


1003
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,280
And call my women's up here for just another moment.

1004
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,340
Oh, yes.

1005
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:44,080
I'd like to tell y'all that the doctor and his women have come a long way to preach for you tonight.

1006
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,920
And one of the benefits that we're not going to reap from this is monetary.

1007
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,820
And so I'm going to send my beautiful women's out to take up the collection.

1008
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,840
Give till it hurts.

1009
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,060
Give till it hurts.

1010
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,640
Yes, brothers and sisters.

1011
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,280
I don't mind using scantily clad women to take up the collection.

1012
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,880
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

1013
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,500
Put them all to work.

1014
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,800
Exploit them.

1015
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,620
Now, don't be giving these pretty women any of that funny Bob money.

1016
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,720
Because Bob don't want to hear it.

1017
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,600
Oh, yes.

1018
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,580
You must be relieved.

1019
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,240
You must be relieved of the burdens.

1020
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,200
The burden that wait in your wallet.

1021
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,880
You must be relieved of the yoke of money.

1022
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,660
Oh, yes.

1023
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,880
Give till it hurts, brothers and sisters.

1024
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,900
Give.

1025
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,200
Because the sun's going down on the normals.

1026
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,780
The sun is going down on the conspiracy.

1027
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:59,120
But the sex goddesses are going down on the subgenius.

1028
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,460
And the sex goddesses are going down on the subgenius.

1029
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,560
Yes, brothers and sisters.

1030
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,400
There shall be a squirtin's uncounted.

1031
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,580
There shall be a oozing's unmeasured.

1032
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,300
There shall be a lust of flame.

1033
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,340
There'll be power.

1034
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,740
Oh, yes.

1035
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,800
Everybody wants a little power.

1036
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,740
What do you want, brothers?

1037
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,040
You want power.

1038
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,220
You want power to destroy.

1039
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,240
Power to fight the evils of the conspiracy.

1040
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,420
Oh, yes.

1041
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,600
And the only way.

1042
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,000
You're going to get it.

1043
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,000


1044
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,940
You're going to get me this power.

1045
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,540
The only way is to get down on your knees

1046
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,080
and just say,

1047
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,900
Bob, I believe in you, Bob.

1048
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,640
Bob, I want you.

1049
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,580
Bob, I trust you.

1050
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,980
Bob, oh, come and do me up with your pipe, Bob.

1051
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,460
Oh, yeah, Bob.

1052
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,640
Come and put it in me.

1053
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,760
Put it in me.

1054
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,860
Put the slack in me.

1055
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,220
Put the salvation in me.

1056
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,600
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,180
Oh, yeah.

1058
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,640
And that's where the tape

1059
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,220
ran out, dear friends.

1060
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,560
And not just the tape.

1061
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,420
That was where

1062
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,940
Dr. Legumes' span,

1063
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,040
his little span

1064
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,680
on this particular dimensional plane

1065
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,680
ran out.

1066
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,700
Actually, there is a tape, too,

1067
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,280
of that, which we may get to next week.

1068
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,980
But in the meantime...

1069
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,160
Oh!

1070
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,680
Oh!

1071
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:22,480


1072
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,740
Oh!

1073
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,200
Oh!

1074
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,140
Oh!

1075
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,120
Oh!

1076
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,460
Oh!

1077
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:27,680
Oh!

1078
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,440
Oh!

1079
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:28,440


1080
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:28,440


1081
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,020
Oh!

1082
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,020


1083
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,020


1084
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,020


1085
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,140
Oh!

1086
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1087
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1088
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1089
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1090
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1091
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1092
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1093
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1094
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1095
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1096
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1097
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1098
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1099
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,160


1100
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,220


1101
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,220


1102
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,220


1103
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,380
Oh!

1104
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,940
Oh!

1105
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,100
Oh!

1106
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:38,740
Oh!

1107
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:39,060


1108
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1109
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1110
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1111
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1112
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1113
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1114
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,680


1115
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,680


1116
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,680


1117
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,680


1118
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,680
Oh!

1119
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,160
Oh!

1120
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:42,220


1121
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:42,460
Oh!

1122
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:42,920
Oh!

1123
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,280
Oh!

1124
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,280


1125
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,380
Oh!

1126
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,380


1127
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,380


1128
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,700
Oh!

1129
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:43,700


1130
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:43,720
Oh!

1131
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,720


1132
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,720


1133
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,720


1134
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,720


1135
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,720


1136
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,720


1137
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,460
Go on.

1138
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,880
If you need restoration,

1139
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,780
What have you done?

1140
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,840
In the privacy of your own home,

1141
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,600
What have you done?

1142
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,860
All the girls reveal

1143
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,620
But you don't,

1144
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,620


1145
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,560
We've been having too much fun

1146
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,780
And that ain't right

1147
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,020
In the new world, right?

1148
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,760
Going to drug war

1149
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,400
Because that's what we've been calling it

1150
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
A drug war

1151
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,180
Because everyone's a commie in a drug war

1152
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,380
And we've been running though our commies since before

1153
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:26,240
So that's what we're calling it now

1154
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,680
Well your high school chum went bump in the night

1155
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,540
What has he done?

1156
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,460
For twenty years under a prison light

1157
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,320
What has he done?

1158
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,760
Twined his teeth in Dallas and he wasn't white

1159
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,360
Is that all that counts?

1160
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,220
One year, one ounce in a drug war

1161
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,060
Because that's what we've been calling it

1162
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,900
A drug war

1163
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,640
Because everyone's a commie in a drug war

1164
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,880
And we've been running though our commies since before

1165
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:14,360
Yeah, but everyone's a commie in a drug war

1166
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:19,040
And everyone's a hoodlum in a drug war

1167
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,360
And everyone's a hoodlum in a drug war

1168
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,700
And everyone's a Jew in a drug war

1169
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:28,620
I hope that they don't come for you in a drug war

1170
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,140
I hope that they do not hook me in this drug war

1171
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,540
Because that's what they're calling it now

1172
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:37,940
Now

1173
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,340
Oh no

1174
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:52,780
Don't practice your goose- anar thought

1175
00:58:52,780 --> 00:59:05,920
Don't practice your goose

1176
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,980
Oh, that was Drug War.

1177
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Drug War by Mr. Jones on the,

1178
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,100
yeah, that Mr. Jones,

1179
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,940
the same one Bob was talking about.

1180
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,960
And that's on this album,

1181
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,700
Main Vocals, dear friends.

1182
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,280
I'm going to give you the address to write for free information.

1183
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,820
Send an SASE or whatever,

1184
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,560
because I don't know where you'd find this, actually.

1185
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,700
You'd just have to write them.

1186
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,940
It's a RR3B29,

1187
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,900
oh God,

1188
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,500
RR3 Box 29B3.

1189
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,340
Uh-huh.

1190
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,760
RR3 Box 29B3,

1191
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,820
Ellsworth, Maine,

1192
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,060
04605.

1193
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,100
And that's reverse recordings,

1194
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,380
is the CD called Main Vocals.

1195
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,700
A strange sensation

1196
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,760
has seasoned nation

1197
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,540
Man, things are suddenly

1198
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,140
peculiarly odd

1199
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,780
Instead of thugs and thieves

1200
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,540
breaking down our doors

1201
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,580
We now deplore the federal forfeiture squads

1202
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,340
Who have a blessing

1203
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,180
from our Congress

1204
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,440
To take a cut of everything they can steal

1205
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,260
Here in the land of the free

1206
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,940
And the home of the brave

1207
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,520
Things have suddenly become unreal

1208
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,380
So please, please, federal policeman

1209
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,760
Please leave my private property alone

1210
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,740
Please, please, federal policeman

1211
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,240
You've got no jurisdiction here in my home

1212
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,800
When you go breaking in through

1213
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,620
Somebody's private front door

1214
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,340
You do the Constitution bodily harm

1215
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,240
So please, please, federal policeman,

1216
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:02,240


1217
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,380
Please leave my private property alone

1218
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,140
They got new laws now

1219
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,820
They're calling Loan équ�� drummer

1220
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,180
Looks like our law enforcement grew a new arm

1221
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:25,660
You make misrepresentation on your loan application

1222
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,300
You might just have to forfeit the farm

1223
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,600
The crazy fact is

1224
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,180
It's retroactive

1225
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,920
Which lets them loot your life historically

1226
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,220
You may be dead in your grave

1227
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,880
But if you did not behave

1228
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,640
You might just fold up your family tree

1229
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,300
So please, please, federal policeman

1230
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,960
Don't you be seizing my poor daddy's farm

1231
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,640
Please, please, federal policeman

1232
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,340
Sometimes I wonder just whose side are you on

1233
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,880
When you go breaking in through

1234
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,700
Somebody's private front door

1235
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,480
You do the Constitution bodily harm

1236
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,100
So please, please, federal policeman

1237
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,640
Don't you be seizing my poor daddy's farm

1238
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,880
The ATF and the FBI

1239
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,700
Just hired the KGB

1240
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,540
The ADL's got a list for sale

1241
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:27,200
But you're anti-Semitic if you call it a conspiracy

1242
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,860
Now how could they call it a conspiracy?

1243
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,960
My widowed mama, they stole her condo

1244
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,000
On another federal seizure forfeiture spree

1245
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,680
She made the tragic mistake of renting to some reprobate

1246
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,680
They copped with drugs inside her property

1247
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:48,100
They say her condo somehow is guilty

1248
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,340
Now have you ever heard a condo confess?

1249
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,940
Here in the land of the beat and the home of the slave

1250
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,760
It's the tangled legal web of a mess

1251
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,480
And I know it's a mess, but I'm not sure if it's a mess

1252
01:02:59,480 --> 01:02:59,480


1253
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,220
So please, please, federal policeman

1254
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,780
Don't you be stealing my poor mama's estate

1255
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,780
Please, please, federal policeman

1256
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,120
Now this is ten times worse than White Watergate

1257
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,780
Before you bash right on through

1258
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,660
Somebody's private front door

1259
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,240
You better check that oath of office detail

1260
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,180
So please, please, federal policeman

1261
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,460
Don't you be stealing my poor mama's estate

1262
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,860
Don't you be seizing my poor daddy's farm

1263
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,880
Sometimes I wonder just whose side are you on

1264
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,480
So please, please, federal policeman

1265
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,080
Please leave my private property
