1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
Whether or not you believe it, you are listening to true recordings of Bigfoot creatures in their natural environment.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,000
We know these are naturally occurring primate voices. We have the evidence that establishes that much.

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,780
You people of Earth, tell your people and your government that we have created a...

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,280
Some genius, our own science.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,020
At the first sign of robots, they will act automatically.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,700
Your choice is simple. Live in spaceships or grow smaller every day.

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,480
Remember.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,960
Bob?

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,360
The genius from Mars. He has come to San Antonio to address the United States Brewers Association.

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,740
Uh...

11
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,620
Uh...

12
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,720
And...

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,560
Uh...

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,480
Excuse me, gentlemen.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,560
Satellites.

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,100
Here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,860
This is a sonic radar picture taken from extreme altitude.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,340
It shows full details of the Martian nest outside Los Angeles.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,540
Their machines appear as round blobs.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,840
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,480
Uh-huh.

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,420
We know there are three cylinders.

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:26,980
Three machines to each group.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,540
And three machines to each cylinder.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,400
Passengers arriving in flight number Q73 will be exiting through gate gate six.

26
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,180
Q73.

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,840
Please proceed to baggage claim area number three.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,380
And carve your baggage claim tickets ready for inspection.

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,720
Thank you.

30
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,560
You're American, aren't you?

31
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,860
You seemed almost high out there.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,580
I was just playing around, having fun.

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,020
Yeah, so far this has been killer.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,860
Matt, I wanna know why there are so many negative things just the parsing.

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,720
Well, if Europe was to stack up the

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,220
Mars military commander on Earth,

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,280
it'd be just like a heavy shifting connection between Mars and Europe in a�� dunkle.

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,380
There's a bunch of other things people under the tips and do.

40
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,880
Yeah, it's like a모

41
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,900
to the cluster which will have profound implications.

42
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,260
The force commander Lepton Rectilinear is widely expected to say that the extra 20,000

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,760
plus Martian troops sent to Earth since Perihelion have significantly reduced radical Earthite

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
violence and should be extended.

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,420
We've been saying all along that we needed more tentacles on the ground and this proves

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,040
it, stated Rectilinear.

47
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,640
My sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,140
enemies in a number of areas of Earth.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,040
His appearance before the cluster alongside Martian issuer of ultimatums Rhodium Virtual

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,720
Particle comes ahead of a report on the war which Vast Cool Intelligence 42 must deliver

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,240
by Aperhelion to the cluster.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,040
And meanwhile, in the area known as Wales, 27 Martian troops were killed when their fighting

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,560
machine was destroyed by an improvised atomic device or IAD.

54
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,120
.

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:09,860
We need an import of this bake to enable the transfer of craft materials.

56
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,580
.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,680
Here's such an interesting detail that we don't get as a

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:13,700
huge75.

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,660
Ironically, Dr. Howell, I hear the cicadas and other bugs of the desert all the time.

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,960
Most interesting.

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,860
I can hear them even when they're nowhere near. If they're thousands of miles away, I still hear those bugs.

62
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:44,380
Well, those bugs and their sound represent a certain presence in the universe

63
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:52,360
and it's most curious and contemplative to bring to mind the fact that the original title,

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:59,280
Al-Azif, an Arabic title referring to the sounds of insects made in the desert,

65
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,960
is actually the name of the so-called Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred,

66
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,640
which is a Greek name given to the book.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,560
Al-Azif was the original title.

68
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,360
And I think that's the reason why I'm so interested in this book.

69
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,260
And of course, that refers poetically to insect noise

70
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,160
I didn't know that.

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,600
apprehended without knowing the source.

72
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,980
My doctor said it was tinnitus.

73
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,380
Well, of course, the doctors will tell you something that's reassuring and fits into their game plan.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,560
So I really am hearing bugs thousands of miles away, and it's not just a ringing in my ears.

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,080
It sounds just like the bugs that I grew up hearing my whole life

76
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,720
in Texas.

77
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,440
When I moved to Cleveland, Princess Wee would occasionally say things like,

78
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,200
Do you hear that sound?

79
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,920
And I, well, yeah, I hear the bugs.

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,020
Somebody's downstairs.

81
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,340
But one day I realized that it was snowing outside, and what I was hearing probably wasn't cicadas.

82
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,220
Unless you were hearing snow bugs.

83
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,400
There are several species of snow spiders.

84
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
Are there really?

85
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,640
Yes, they are.

86
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,060
Friends, you learn something every day if you're around a tree.

87
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,740
I'm Dr. Howell.

88
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,640
And you know there's snow bugs like snow bugs.

89
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:30,140
But these so-called snow spiders are actually blown up by winds to lower levels of mountains that have snow.

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:38,720
And nonetheless, they run agilely over the snow and catch insect life, which is also blown up by the winds.

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,040
Thus, nature is neat and fastidious and allows not a single crumb to escape.

92
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,240
And the most important thing is that you don't slip from her plate.

93
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:56,300
Have you ever burned a book, invaded a country without verifying intelligence, or sent someone a bomb from the beach?

94
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,500
You will.

95
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,140
And the company that'll bring it to you, AT&T.

96
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,980
The name of this song is Cosmic Pants.

97
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,920
It's what comes through and stays there.

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:27,980
So go get someам

99
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,820
It's what comes through and stays there.

100
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,760
So go get some moral support.

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,060
GiwkwiI

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,060
Be careful.

103
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,880
In a O&R dress!

104
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,280
Where's my fucking cheese fries, bitch?

105
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm not chocolate milk, don't you, my prince!

106
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,620
I'm so happy doing the neutron dance!

107
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,500
Nothing seems to go...

108
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,400
...with my dance!

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Fuck you, you fucking fuck!

110
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,700
I'm so happy doing the neutron dance!

111
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,300
Arctic bunnies took me to a cosmic place!

112
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,720
With me, mushrooms, they came from outer space!

113
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,020
This is all about what's happening!

114
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,260
Here to my...

115
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,260


116
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,620
...face!

117
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,660
I got your cheese fries right here, warbass!

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,960
Oh, you mean you got the beer?

119
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,960
One more time from the top...

120
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,900
Why do people run around like ants?

121
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,160
Or are they happy, are they in a trance?

122
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,460
I've got a happy male in my pants!

123
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,700
I'm gonna kill you!

124
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

125
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:17,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

126
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

127
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,420
Now I've got chocolate milk all down my pants

128
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,720
And I'm so nervous doing that neutron dance

129
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,740
Nothing seems to go with my cosmic pants

130
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,640
Magic bunnies took me to a cosmic place

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,820
They gave me mushrooms and came from outer space

132
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,140
Jesus Christ, what's happening to my face?

133
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm so nervous doing that neutron dance

134
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,080
I'm so nervous doing that neutron dance

135
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:48,500
I'm so nervous doing that neutron dance

136
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,660
For months

137
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:58,040
Barnes and cow chips don't exactly go over like sex starved in a little bondage

138
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,060
It wouldn't hurt if you could uncover some gothic horror

139
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,100
Like sex with a little sex movie

140
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:16,260
Are there any records of black music?

141
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,260
My world

142
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,060
deforms

143
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,920
I wonder if you can trick me

144
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:38,820
pendant

145
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,700
in the

146
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:40,720
out

147
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,020
man

148
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,380
any

149
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,660
neck

150
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,880
I'll come with you.

151
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,320
Bro.

152
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,880
Keep going!

153
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:14,880
Go, go, go, go!

154
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,480
Go!

155
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,380
I remember in MAD years ago they proposed a wonderful sitcom.

156
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,960
Of course it was a satire.

157
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,000
But what a great situation comedy it would make if they have situation comedies anymore.

158
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:39,320
My Hollywood friends on the production side hate reality TV because there's no lighting for them to do.

159
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,800
All the jobs from sitcoms are gone.

160
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,120
But the sitcom that MAD proposed was called Life with Albie.

161
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,080
And it was about that lovable woman.

162
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,560
The beautiful, dim-witted Albert Einstein.

163
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,320
And life in the sitcom world with him.

164
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh gosh, Albie, don't tell me that you smoked your famous serum and mailed your pipe to President Roosevelt.

165
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,980
No, no, no, I didn't send it to Roosevelt.

166
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,560
By God, I did.

167
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,980
I sent it to...what is...Martin.

168
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,060
Do you remember that one, Doug?

169
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,220
Life with Albie?

170
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,840
MAD did it?

171
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,160
Who's Life with Albie?

172
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,560
It was a sitcom.

173
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,500
A sitcom.

174
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,080
An imaginary sitcom.

175
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,340
Well, pardon d'autre chose.

176
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,320
It would make a great sitcom.

177
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,940
Better than Enemies, better than Friends, better than any of them that are out there.

178
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,900
Program, program, program, program.

179
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,700
Hold everything.

180
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,700
Hold everything.

181
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,200
One if I land and two if I carbonate.

182
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,820
That's pretty good, daughter.

183
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,100
But that ain't the way I hear it.

184
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,080
Killer Diller of the cold cuts, King of the caviar cutlers, and cutest kid that ever cooked a kettle of kippers for country kids.

185
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,000
Club campfire cafeteria clam bake.

186
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Cautious and crafty at concealing the calories in coconut cake for curve-conscious cuties,

187
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,840
cutinously crowded in cozy cafes.

188
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:05,220
And the caniest coot that ever combed the countryside for corn on the cob that couldn't conceivably be commanded by the commoner kinds of cat-stand customers.

189
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,260
Crowned by the Cook's Convention in Kickapoo, Kansas as the classiest cupid that ever cut a cantaloupe.

190
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,200
Covered with compliments, cups and confetti, but twice I'm boys I gotta cook this.

191
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
You know how a cocks eats.

192
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,680
But I happen to know that cocks is on a diet.

193
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,100
Well, my goodness, what is going on here?

194
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,320
The sweat, the sweat.

195
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,780
Blathers all over me.

196
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,540
So don't cut.

197
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,900
Well, hey, look.

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,880
Well, hey, look.

199
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,360
Oh, look, I hate to do this, but I promised a fella I'd show him how to polish his...

200
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,460
Cut.

201
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,280
Let's polish your...

202
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,380
Cut.

203
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,680
Now.

204
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,760
And we did it.

205
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,380
You just apply it, let it dry, and wipe it off.

206
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,400
And you get a beautiful gleaming finish.

207
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:37,960
I'll say so.

208
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,660
Quick and easy.

209
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,120
I was through long before I thought I would be, and I came right over here.

210
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,520
Yeah.

211
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,900
Have a piece of cheese, Nick.

212
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,740
Something smells awfully good in here.

213
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,260
Most peculiar fellow seems to know his instrument.

214
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,640
You're a hard man.

215
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,640
Or am I just being a silly girl?

216
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,260
No, sure, sit.

217
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,920
Well, did too much sampling.

218
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,440
Has it ever occurred to you, self-polishing?

219
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,500
Ain't that awful?

220
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,220
Ain't that awful?

221
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,420
Did too much sampling.

222
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,400
Dear Bush, a letter to Bush.

223
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,060
Dear Bush, dear Bush.

224
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,380
Dear Bush.

225
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,900
Bush, Bush, Bush.

226
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,120
Bush, Bush, Bush.

227
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


228
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


229
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


230
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


231
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


232
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,780
We don't like star spangled orations that don't add up.

233
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,040
But we know what we're doing.

234
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,680
You thought dough was all we were after.

235
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,880
We're thinking now, and we're thinking about this war.

236
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,280
Now stick this one in.

237
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,880
Bush, Bush, Bush.

238
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,060
More than 20 million workers.

239
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,660
Bush, Bush, Bush.

240
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,920
11 million union members all over the USA.

241
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,980
Yes, I'm talking about unions.

242
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm talking about CIO and AFL.

243
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm talking about every union man in this country.

244
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,420
Because we know what you do to unions.

245
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,240
You don't fight them and you don't debate with them.

246
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,140
You wipe them out, hide and hair.

247
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,960
But, but, but, but.

248
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,620
We hear the voices of those who would set class against class.

249
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,140
Whites against negroes.

250
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,060
Christians against Jews.

251
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,880
President Bush.

252
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,720
Blow you sky high.

253
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,560
Won't you send in your own letter to dear Bush?

254
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,240
Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush.

255
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,980
Oh, please.

256
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, please.

257
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

258
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm white moron.

259
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,600
A Nazi moron.

260
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,220
How do you like that?

261
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,060
A hateful Nazi would like to cut your throat and kill your children.

262
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,500
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme children.

263
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm a Nazi moron.

264
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,220


265
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,220


266
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,220


267
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,160
wear

268
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,260
mieć

269
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,740
I'm gonna kill you.

270
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,380
I, I, I, I, I'm gonna kill you.

271
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,100
What do you want me to do?

272
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,520
What do you want me to do?

273
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,940
What do you want me to do?

274
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,460
White Moron, Too Far Gone.

275
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,120
Too Far Gone.

276
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,120
White Moron, Too Far Gone by Norrell Preff,

277
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,800
as was the deer bush and too much sampling and et cetera.

278
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,240
Now back in time we go, friends,

279
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,640
to 10X Day with Dr. Howell and the Picnic Table Radio Studio.

280
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,040
Friends, if you ever get bored with television and sci-fi,

281
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,820
books, history is much, much weirder and more twisted.

282
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,060
Court TV is weirder than Star Trek and the history

283
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,020
of Russia is a thousand times weirder than the Marvel Universe.

284
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,020
I know that sounds impossible, unthinkable to some of you,

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,940
but it's, it's actually true.

286
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,780
Peter the Great is more bizarre than Reed Richards.

287
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,800
Take it advisedly.

288
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,220
In fact,

289
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,420
Peter the Great started the Church of the Subgenius.

290
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,940
That was the first thing he did when he was made Tsar of all the

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,380
Russia's, Emperor of the World at age 17.

292
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,220
He and his buddies who were mostly foreigners,

293
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,640
Frenchmen and other devils,

294
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,740
formed a group called the All Drunken Synod of Fools

295
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,980
and gave themselves funny pope and reverend names

296
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,720
and paraded through the streets of Russia in costumes,

297
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,000
mocking the elders of the Russian Orthodox Church.

298
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,140
Smoking Mirshuam pipes.

299
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,440
No one, no one in that country could have gotten away with that,

300
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,280
except the Tsar.

301
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,240
And he, through most of his career, was considered the Antichrist by his people,

302
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,260
who, like us, had no choice.

303
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,320
Especially by those old fuddy-duddies in the Russian Orthodox Church.

304
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,020
Right.

305
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,540
He was so, he was such a subgenius,

306
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,700
Right. He was so, he was such a subgenius,

307
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,140
that he taxed, he put a tax on beards.

308
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,380
Because the Russians had become the laughing stock of Europe,

309
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,380
because of their beards.

310
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,860
It was against their religion to cut their beards,

311
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,300
and they looked like a bunch of bears.

312
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,200
That was the stereotype of Russians, that they were cave people.

313
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,840
And Peter the Great, wanting to drag Russia,

314
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,320
kicking and screaming into the 18th century,

315
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,580
insisted that people,

316
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,920
shave their beards.

317
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,840
And that convinced everybody that he was the Antichrist.

318
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,500
Only the Antichrist would have made you get a haircut,

319
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,840
in ancient Russia.

320
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,240
Funny how things turn around.

321
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,220
I guess I'd have to shave.

322
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, it's expected of you.

323
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,240
And it's suspected that Peter the Great had to throttle his own son,

324
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,620
which, like Ivan the Terrible,

325
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,460
my great-great-great-great-great grandfather.

326
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,940
My great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.

327
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,940
Not by way of the Romanovs, by way of Rasputin.

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,620
I'd say this to ensure disbelief.

329
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,520
They laugh at me.

330
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,740
They mock me.

331
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,780
Well, just as Rasputin was hard to kill,

332
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,900
so is the Church of the Subgenius.

333
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,900
Like some weed, chopped off in one place,

334
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,320
it flowers and flourishes in another.

335
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,860
Like blackberry vines and brambles,

336
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,760
constantly pushing up in new places through the earth,

337
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
with new fruits,

338
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
and new thorns.

339
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,320
Are you that thorn, or are you that fruit, my friend?

340
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,940
It doesn't matter to us.

341
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,180
You can be the thorn that pricks the hide of the conspiracy,

342
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,220
and brings with a jolt of pain that drop of necessary sacrificial blood,

343
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,000
or you can be the fruit which is taken in the bill of birds,

344
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,840
and lofted to heaven,

345
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,480
only to be rained down as a bird dropping on George Bush,

346
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,100
as you can see on YouTube.

347
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,040
Or...

348
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,560
Oh, is there a YouTube?

349
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,600
Yes, you can see on YouTube a bird shed on Bush,

350
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,160
and I recommend this for viewing.

351
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,000
Friends, it happens to all.

352
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,300
No matter how mighty you think you are,

353
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,860
That's right, all those servers...

354
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,880
the little birds of the air will put you in your place.

355
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,840
It happened to me.

356
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,400
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that was going on.

357
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,840
Two starwoods ago,

358
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,660
I was sitting in the little clearing back there,

359
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,060
jabbering like an idiot,

360
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,800
smoking something.

361
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,620
Oh, no, I just cleaned my little pipe out.

362
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,480
And I was about to load my little pipe,

363
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,720
it was just like this one.

364
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,820
Hmm, fancy that.

365
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,560
And it was already filled, I felt a little tap on my hand,

366
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,420
and I looked down and my pipe had been filled,

367
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,800
with a kind of reddish, juicy stuff,

368
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,420
that a nice little berry-eating bird had deposited from overhead,

369
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,460
somehow landed right in the bowl of this tap,

370
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,160
and I was able to get it out of the tiny pipe.

371
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,720
Now, what are the chances of that?

372
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,520
Well, how did it taste when you smoked it, though?

373
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,100
Well, I didn't...

374
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,980
You know, it was a sign, obviously.

375
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,220
I took... I interpreted it as saying,

376
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,680
Stang, you're full of shit.

377
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,860
And I bragged about it on stage a little while later,

378
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,320
proving that I was, in fact, full of shit.

379
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,600
But it was a true story, that's the funny thing.

380
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,520
In the Church of the Subgenius,

381
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,740
you can lie and lie and lie and exaggerate,

382
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,560
and it all turns out to be true!

383
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,460
And they'll always believe the lies,

384
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,860
and never believe the truth.

385
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,620
That's the horrible thing about it.

386
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,520
They get the lies and believe the jokes.

387
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,380
Don't be like that, friends.

388
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,040
Just believe every bit of it, and get it all.

389
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,560
And also realize that you are here

390
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,680
among a group of fellow communicants and believers.

391
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,840
And let's not get into the destructive game of saying,

392
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,440
Oh, well, so-and-so is not as much subgenius as I am.

393
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,900
That person isn't a real subgenius.

394
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,760
We must be homogenized, but not pasteurized.

395
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,120
We must be of a body, but not ideologically pure.

396
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,340
And fortunately, that is the way we are.

397
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,080
All messed up.

398
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,860
Yeah.

399
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,660
Like in a modern cream separator.

400
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,980
Puppet Face!

401
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,140
Go away!

402
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,840
Puppet Head!

403
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,300
Go away Puppet Head!

404
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,320
Go away Puppet Head!

405
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Yeah.

406
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:51,780


407
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:51,780


408
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,600
The Richest Man's Ч 무�cial

409
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:52,600


410
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,820
is重要

411
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:00,800
It is

412
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,100
design

413
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,600
You don't dare look less than him

414
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,220
You are not respected

415
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,440
Push me by my...

416
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,440
I used to be the magic bean machine gun.

417
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,160
Mama, I shoot two beans for some smokes.

418
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,060
I used to be the pill-popping fucking machine gun.

419
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,100
Mama, that was my source of...

420
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Money when I was broke.

421
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,020
Said I wish it weren't so late.

422
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,360
But I'd go quite out of my pill-popping mind.

423
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
If ever I should decide to take a toke.

424
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,200
I'd go quite out of my pill-popping mind.

425
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,680
So I'll just go to bed.

426
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,380
Never noticed anything else.

427
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,140
.

428
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,140


429
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,180
God...

430
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


431
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


432
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


433
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,180


434
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,500
Anyway, there they be, and just imagine how they'll look on many a mantelpiece.

435
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:55,080
In the meantime, it's a privilege to be doing Subgenius Radio here with Lonesome Cowboy Dave at X Day 10 on a beautiful Sunday.

436
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:04,320
Well, Spiro, what I'd like to first mention before we get into the actual awards themselves is the beautiful look and creation of these awards.

437
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:13,000
Some of them were 23 years in the process of being made, many by very, very erudite and elite Hollywood staff.

438
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,640
Older than some subgenius.

439
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:22,120
Spelled with like a staff lococulus, and others were just created out of thin air, but somehow they arrived here.

440
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,860
And what are some of the stats on former Bobby Award winners who haven't made it back?

441
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,480
Well, some of them have retired and taken their swag with them.

442
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,300
Like...

443
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,740
Like the Egyptian pharaohs pulled their loot into their tombs.

444
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:45,500
But as you can see, each Bobby Award rests on a platform of beautifully conceived, sculptured feces.

445
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:56,240
And then the X for X Day 10 is made out of multiple colored and decorated popsicle sticks.

446
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,520
Finally, a floating, severed child head hangs over the top.

447
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,920
As the ultimate comment on...

448
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,280
This form of intellectual aversion and delight.

449
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:17,620
For your nature lovers, we'd like to remind you that the fecal matter contained in these beautiful, beautiful awards is crystal completely contrained.

450
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,980
Contrained is the new word for it.

451
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:30,160
In the syllabus of Elmer's glue, which creates absolutely no hemorrhoids, absolutely no lesions, and no air can get in there to cause disinfection.

452
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,360
And Elmer's glue is a very organic substance.

453
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,760
In and of itself.

454
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,800
Which is why Elmer's face is on every bottle.

455
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,640
Of course, there are many people who don't even know who Elmer is anymore.

456
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:50,020
But in my childhood, I was bombarded with scenes from the domestic life of the Elmer family.

457
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,220
How about you, Stan?

458
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,080
You remember that?

459
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,220
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

460
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,660
There was...

461
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,160
Elmer was the bull.

462
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,200
Elsie.

463
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,180
Elsie, right.

464
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,920
The wife of the milk-giving dairy cow.

465
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,300
Yeah, she was her...

466
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,840
Her logo head was on milk.

467
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,520
Yeah.

468
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:11,560
But his was the thick, white glue.

469
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,240
Yes.

470
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,340
And then there were the kids, of course.

471
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,860
Buster and Beulah.

472
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,740
Buster and Beulah had a tragic childhood.

473
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:29,500
Well, they were destined for the meat factory, but they lived a sort of strange bovine version of the 1950s nuclear family.

474
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,320
At any rate, Elmer's glue, the real substance.

475
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,000
The true.

476
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,720
The blushful hippocrene has gone into making these artificial turds,

477
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,480
which are so realistic that you won't want to touch them, even though you know they're fake.

478
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,700
Handling them will make you uncomfortable.

479
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:54,100
That is how much work has gone into making the shit pile at the basis of each Bobby Award.

480
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:03,160
Now, these X-Day Bobby Awards were drunkenly crafted in one evening by the Reverend I-Don't-Know,

481
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,900
and the Reverend I-Don't-Care,

482
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
Her Highness Hell-No,

483
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
and Dr. Dark.

484
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:17,100
And although it's not on this cheat sheet, there's another name that belongs attached to these strangely feculent awards,

485
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,580
and that is Sister Susie the Floozy,

486
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,240
because when I was up at the snack shack, I caught her putting these things together.

487
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,260
Yes, many hands have labored to create these productions.

488
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,360
And...

489
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:32,920
So it would be...

490
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,280
And...

491
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:39,120
A shame if we didn't get to hang one on every departing subgenius before he scuttles away.

492
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,720
And many hams have caught her putting.

493
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,140
Oh, that took a long time for that.

494
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,480
From PR News in Washington, I'm rising from the worst grease scene in decades.

495
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:56,420
President Bush says success in Iraq won't happen, but Mr. Bush maintains that sexual abuse is working.

496
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,480
This week, a senior Republican called for sexual abuse by as many as 5,000 priests by Christmas.

497
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,560
More than 170 sex fights have broken out since yesterday morning, and police say at least seven people were involved in PR News.

498
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,040
Police expect holy shit.

499
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:20,560
They're honoring a 9th century religious figure who they believe will return PR News to mankind in Washington.

500
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,020
Well, everybody keeps talking about a bunch of freaks or something.

501
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,600
What can we do? And what can you do to prevent...

502
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,460
The Self Genius Powered...

503
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,940
Well, we're all going to suffer for it.

504
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,020
But you're not fooling us.

505
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,140
Don't look at us.

506
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,560
I didn't have anything to do with it either.

507
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,340
I say let's let him talk.

508
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,520
All right.

509
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,080
Well, it won't be funny.

510
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,380
I'm warning you.

511
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,460
Oh, and there are some new quotes.

512
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,600
Bob, for the subgeniuses here, this is really important because he doesn't...

513
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,220
You know, we don't get many.

514
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,260
I mean, we don't get many direct transmissions from Bob.

515
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,700
You can channel him, but not for long.

516
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,480
Like one word at a time.

517
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,020
And in order to get a proper whole sentence, we have to line up a bunch of Bobbies, the expendable kind,

518
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,360
when we get a tape recorder and then run down the line as they each say one word and then flop over.

519
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,960
Because it's like a flash bulb that's been burned out.

520
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,680
You know, it's used once and then it's gone.

521
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,440
But at the expense of about 40 Bobbies...

522
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,500
We got these two new quotes.

523
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,960
The first one is more typical occult-type mystic wisdom.

524
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:43,980
Bob said,

525
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,440
So many look but don't see, and most don't even look.

526
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,480
They just use their eyes to keep from bumping into things.

527
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,100
This is the tomfuckery of foolish-nism.

528
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,200
This is the tomfuckery of foolish-nism.

529
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,760
Now, the second one was more typical of Bob.

530
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,560
No need to watch spilt milk burn.

531
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,160
He said.

532
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,260
And I think what he meant by that is, I'm just interpreting, is don't fret.

533
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,320
Actually, that was, Kim Kesey said that was the one rule of life.

534
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,580
Don't fret. Easy for him to say.

535
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,840
Probably just that day.

536
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,180
So, yeah, no need to watch spilt milk burn.

537
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,220
It's so, someday the real meaning will sink in.

538
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,800
That happens a lot.

539
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,380
We waited for 1998, you know, when the world was going to end, for 20 years.

540
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,980
And just before that date, my son, who was about 10 at the time, pointed out,

541
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:59,500
Hey, Dad, you guys still looking for an out with your 1998?

542
00:35:59,520 --> 00:35:59,820
Yeah.

543
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,440
I said, well, what do you mean, son?

544
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,680
He goes, well, if you turn those numbers upside down, they make another number.

545
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,340
8661.

546
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,120
That had been right in front of us all that time.

547
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,260
We never knew it.

548
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,860
We never, Princess Wee's sister-in-law one time last year said,

549
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,020
Well, are you guys going to go to Starweed this year?

550
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,500
Where had that one been all our lives?

551
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:29,500


552
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:29,500


553
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:29,500


554
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:29,500


555
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:42,040
But, suppose the soul dies if it sits around on a cloud, plunking a harp, praising the center of being.

556
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,180
Well, it might.

557
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,000
That would kill me, I know.

558
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,900
Because there's no progress in such a setup.

559
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,160
And plus, your hands were not made for such an endeavor.

560
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,360
When you move from this plane, to do useful work.

561
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,760
I'll stop.

562
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,300
No, I did.

563
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,760
I just wanted you to notice that your hands were becoming those very hands you were describing.

564
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,280
Those very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very.

565
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,100
The hands of a murderer.

566
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:16,300
They were surgically stitched to my hands, but now they seem someone else's hands.

567
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,700
The glistening.

568
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,580
But they can sure throw knives now.

569
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,100
And little darts.

570
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,440
Can you handle these darts?

571
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,280
These strings and arrows of outrageous force.

572
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,280


573
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,660
Give them a fling, man.

574
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,320
Give them a fling.

575
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,700
I just wanted to say something while I'm still here.

576
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,900
Because I'm about to go, you know, partake.

577
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,200
And I'd just like to say that there's an old game out there for the computer.

578
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,840
It's called Floor 13.

579
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,540
Where you're a member of the British government, and it's your job to keep control through kind of underground Big Brother methods.

580
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,440
Anyway, about an hour on into this game, you have to rescue a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

581
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,420
Really?

582
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,020
It's true.

583
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,640
And I forgot even the name of the company that puts this thing out.

584
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,180
It's like, it's from 1991, Floor 13.

585
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,500
You can get it on almost any abandoned ware site out there.

586
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,680
It's freeware now.

587
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,460
But you have to protect and keep alive a member of this church.

588
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,540
They say the founder, but it's not identified as either a Bob, a Stang, or a Drummond, or anything like that.

589
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,600
Wow.

590
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,740
It's worth checking out.

591
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,700
Interesting.

592
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,020
You know, I watched that Floorist 13.

593
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,080
And I thought it was awesome.

594
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,360
You know, Dark City.

595
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,520
Dark City.

596
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,240
That was a terrible movie, too.

597
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,120
That should have been renamed Kiefer Sutherland just wheezes.

598
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,780
Man.

599
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,300
That was awful.

600
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,120
Does anybody really know the way to Shell Beach, as Stang always brings that up?

601
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,280
I like that movie, too.

602
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,380
Dark City.

603
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,160
A huge satellite in the sky.

604
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,800
Terrible.

605
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,760
Terrible movie.

606
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,760
Well, I mean, the ending, you know, make the ending what you will.

607
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
I mean, like, whatever, you know.

608
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,080
But it was a fun experience to watch.

609
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,940
It was a very mysterious ending.

610
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,060
I don't know how Kiefer Sutherland had any work after that movie.

611
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,900
Byron, there's Russians everywhere.

612
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,420
Hello?

613
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,620
Byron.

614
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,540
Byron.

615
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,040
I can't hear you.

616
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,900
Byron.

617
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,680
Byron.

618
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,940
Byron.

619
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,740
Byron.

620
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:18,740


621
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,520
Byron.

622
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


623
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


624
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


625
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


626
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


627
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


628
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,480
Byron.

629
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:21,900


630
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:21,900


631
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:21,920


632
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,640
Byron.

633
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,400
Byron.

634
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:24,900
Byron.

635
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:24,900


636
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:24,900


637
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:24,900


638
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,140
Byron.

639
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,320
Byron, Byron, Byron.

640
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,420
Byron.

641
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,420


642
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,420


643
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,380
Is it Time multiplied or Inverted?

644
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,380


645
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,380


646
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,480
A Godinian and a Smarty...

647
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,480


648
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,480


649
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,620
Wildере.

650
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,920
Thank you.

651
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:35,000
Rural War Room from myspace.com slash ruralwarroomrecords

652
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:43,420
or ruralwarroomatgothu.com

653
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,800
And now, back to Tenex Day for the last time.

654
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,560
There's some really perverted artwork in there.

655
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,660
That imbature is a real artist.

656
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,400
You know, artists.

657
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,280
Can be as perverted as they want to in their art.

658
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,240
I think he's just...

659
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,040
Actually, he's got a family, too.

660
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,900
Maybe I should shut up.

661
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,680
Well, as Dick Cheney said, you've got to watch what you say.

662
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,340
On the other hand, I have nothing to worry about.

663
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,960
My kids are both grown up and married.

664
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,860
My daughter just got married last week to a real cool guy.

665
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,420
They live in L.A., though.

666
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,360
So...

667
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,460
There's some good news.

668
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,940
Plus, like we said, it could be X Day any time.

669
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,280
In 1998 conspiracy calendar,

670
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,080
I decided generally that it's predictions are a dumb idea.

671
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,580
I happen to be standing in that pond over there covered with honey.

672
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,800
We said it was motor oil.

673
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,240
Fortunately, there were no...

674
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,180
And it occurred to me, you know, maybe you shouldn't believe everything you read.

675
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,140
How about that?

676
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,420
Maybe all those fake magazines were full of crap.

677
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,680
Hard to imagine that, you know, preachers or gurus would, like, lie or be wrong.

678
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,680
But Bob has many lessons, I suppose.

679
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:14,280
As the great Carter LeBlanc preached a couple of years ago,

680
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,820
he brought us the gift of disbelief.

681
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,480
And don't you think those Heaven's Gate people could have used that?

682
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,600
On the other hand, we don't...

683
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,760
No, they might be aboard the saucers.

684
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,220
When we finally get lifted up, maybe old Doe, Bo, and Peep will be standing there going,

685
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,960
we told you so.

686
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,460
Well, my understanding is that their saucers suffer from shoddy workmanship.

687
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,600
Well, they're the kind that crash.

688
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,360
They have a luggage limit.

689
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,680
They're having a big party over that at Roswell.

690
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,800
They can only take one suitcase.

691
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,500
What does that tell you about these saucers?

692
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:49,840
Right.

693
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,860
Come on.

694
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,800
A saucer has to have infinite carrying capacity.

695
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:54,980
Right.

696
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,300
And ability to fold space and so forth.

697
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,080
They're not going to crash in the New Mexico desert.

698
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,100
So a bunch of po-buckers can run off with souvenirs of them.

699
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,480
They're cut-rate saucers manufactured by low-class alien civilizations.

700
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,300
Or else it's those hollow-earth, joy-riding teenager types.

701
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,940
They're terrestrial, but they've been here all along.

702
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,940
They come out from the hollow earth, opening at the poles,

703
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,040
and do buzz earthlings, beam thoughts into your head, that kind of thing.

704
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
They do donuts in the sky.

705
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,040
Yeah.

706
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,820
And do crop circles as sky-riding.

707
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,720
They actually do that from underneath, from the hollow earth.

708
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,880
That's their sky.

709
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,020
So when we see a crop circle, that's like a Coke logo,

710
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,280
backwards and inside out for them.

711
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,860
That's why they seem so mysterious.

712
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,920
Unfortunately, we never get to taste that particular thing.

713
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:53,920


714
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:53,920


715
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,300
It's a particular beverage.

716
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:02,620
It's forbidden and sealed off to all inhabitants of the surface world.

717
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,200
Many have taken ship at the pale beaches,

718
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,240
but few return to the sunlit lands.

719
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,760
So that's what they're calling it nowadays.

720
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,560
Oh, these kids today, I tell you.

721
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,300
You know, it's funny.

722
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,400
When I put on the headphones,

723
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,220
I hear this rich 60-cycle hum down low in the background.

724
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,680
And when I take the headphones off,

725
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,320
I hear somebody singing off in the distance.

726
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,780
Reassuring electronic background.

727
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,740
Somebody's stereo somewhere back there.

728
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,940
You know, this virtual world just doesn't cut it.

729
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,240
Well, they could pick it out if they examined the record close enough

730
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,520
with their special equipment.

731
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,160
You know they could.

732
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,580
Oh, I'm sure we're being observed on some fancy form of Google Earth right now.

733
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,460
You can see right through the roof.

734
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,800
They're looking at little heat forms of all of us.

735
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,860
Predator vision, you know.

736
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,620
And they can easily pick up the sound.

737
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,340
I mean, you can almost do that with Google.

738
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,200
Hal, we looked at your front door through Google Earth the other day.

739
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,020
What was going on down there?

740
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,040
Princess, me and I, they announced this new street scene thing.

741
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,940
You know, our cameramen have tooled down the roads in Seattle, San Francisco,

742
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,560
and we're all available.

743
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,180
We'll eventually come to your town, USA.

744
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,640
Yeah, they look through people's windows.

745
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,980
I'm not kidding about this.

746
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,420
They find embarrassing things going on, and they put it up on the web.

747
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,480
I saw.

748
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,960
We landed on you.

749
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,300
We typed in your address in the mission district

750
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,380
and landed right there on that spot and swiveled around.

751
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,680
It's in swivel vision.

752
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,760
You can't, like, walk up to the door and around it like in Blade Runner,

753
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,200
but you can certainly.

754
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,900
Not for the time being.

755
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,540
And we can.

756
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,820
We swiveled around and saw the door just as you'd gone in.

757
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,980
I know you had just walked in.

758
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,360
And how did you know that?

759
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,020
You could see the heat trail, sort of.

760
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,400
Oh, I left the heat trail.

761
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,480
Because we paid extra for the special Google Earth that has the thermal sensing.

762
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,140
So you could see this little, this Hal-shaped red smear go around the corner and in the door.

763
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,520
They call me the red smear.

764
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,660
But see, so we could easily be followed.

765
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,020
Am I not the red smear?

766
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,000
You think they have better things to do.

767
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,340
But then look at Magdalene.

768
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,220
But then they don't have better things to do but harass all of us.

769
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:33,040
And every time there's some new product in the store that Princess Wee and I both like,

770
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,980
say there's some cheese that's reasonably priced and it's some imported thing that's just fabulous,

771
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,700
as soon as we bought it more than three times, it's taken off the shelves.

772
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,440
Has that ever happened to you, my friend?

773
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,000
Yes, you too are being tracked with negative marketing.

774
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,720
How to deny slack from the subgeniuses.

775
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,240
Now if I was a real kook, I'd believe that.

776
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,100
The thing is, every time I think that, it does turn out to be true later on.

777
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,560
We thought we were kidding about all that stuff.

778
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,780
The denying of slack to subgeniuses, this is the worst of it, is only a byproduct.

779
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:18,400
The actual thing is to increase sales by removing from the stores products that appeal to subgeniuses.

780
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,220
Right, it's just making more room for pink stuff.

781
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,800
And make more room for products that appeal to normals.

782
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,000
Because that merchandise turns over at a greater rate, generating profits.

783
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:36,020
But of course, subgenius is about spiritual profits and spiritual profit sharing.

784
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,080
Savings, friends. Real savings.

785
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,920
Like when they say, have you been saved?

786
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,780
Yes, Bob's got my soul in a canister.

787
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,000
But have you been...

788
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,120
Rusty canister. The valve might be stuck, but it's in Bob's name.

789
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,840
He's got deed title to my soul, friends.

790
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,660
That's when you can say, yes, I've got my savings in a safe place.

791
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,780
It's in the arms of Bob. It's in the vault of Bob.

792
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,600
Canisters don't rust.

793
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,660
The deed and title to it is in the vault of Bob.

794
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,800
Stainless steel.

795
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,380
The actual rusty canister is in Reverend Stank's basement in Cleveland.

796
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,120
That's such a cliche, that those canisters rust.

797
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,260
They're made of stainless steel.

798
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,980
They get pitted sometimes by micrometeorite bombs.

799
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,160
They're not a bombardment, but they're stout.

800
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,360
There might be things to worry about, but rust is not one of them.

801
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,720
Your soul will not be placed in a rusty cylinder.

802
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,340
But this is, of course, good poetic hyperbole.

803
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,940
Well, it also keeps them from looking for the real Dobstown.

804
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,700
They just go, oh, Reverend Stank's slacker mansion.

805
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,800
That must be the headquarters.

806
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,300
That's the Batcave.

807
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,620
Yeah, right.

808
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,160
It's actually a tell being a decoy, folks.

809
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,540
Well, what's really amazing are those giant signs labeling everything,

810
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,520
just like in Batman's cave that you've got at your place.

811
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,580
They're hard to get used to.

812
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,900
You heard they took away my neighborhood committee said I couldn't have the giant gorilla,

813
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,420
concrete gorilla in my front yard anymore.

814
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,680
What a shame.

815
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,520
It looks barren without it.

816
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,140
Yeah, and we lost one of the limousines to taxes.

817
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,080
But for the most part, the slacker mansion is fine.

818
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,800
Yeah.

819
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,840
Earthquake hardly, you know, we hardly felt it.

820
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,440
I understand you're about to open up a new Bigfoot attraction over there.

821
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,240
No, that's at Nenslow's House of Mystery in Portland.

822
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,380
Has anyone been to the Woodstock Mystery Hole in Portland,

823
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,640
which is also near a Bigfoot temple of a kind?

824
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,620
You have, haven't you?

825
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

826
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,700
I've been down in the hole, Dr. Howell.

827
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,820
I've been down in the hole.

828
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:54,620
That hole is something that every subgenius should have the experience of lowering himself into, as I did.

829
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,260
It's the ultimate roadside attraction.

830
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,660
It really is.

831
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,320
It's got everything you'd want in a roadside attraction.

832
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,640
It's really satisfying.

833
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,380
There is a mystery at the bottom of that hole.

834
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,120
That was Dr. Howell at 10X Day with yours truly.

835
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,360
And the background music that you've been hearing in the titles here

836
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,900
is by Speed Cave.

837
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:21,320
You are also hearing Hour of Slack number 1120

838
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,540
from the Church of the Subgenius.

839
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:29,740
And if you want more information from the Church of the Subgenius,

840
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,060
then just check out subgenius.com.

841
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,300
And to Nora Opref will follow.

842
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,660
Dear Bush, a letter to Bush.

843
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,740
This is me, Dog, Dog, Dog, Dog.

844
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,100
Jerk, jerk.

845
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,760
Hack, hack, hack.

846
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,420
A leg man.

847
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:43,960
Rock, rock.

848
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,820
The biggest.

849
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,220
We weren't picked out to chew up small countries that never did us any harm.

850
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,940
But he drilled us well.

851
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,040
We had some poles.

852
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,800
My convictions are that war is evil.

853
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,080
And that the evil men are those who started it.

854
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,260
Wars mean filth and thirst and pain and the scream of dive bombers on top of you.

855
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,880
All right, mister.

856
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,160
You started it rolling.

857
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,080
We know the score.

858
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,940
Blood and toil and long bitterness.

859
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,620
We don't like being ordered around.

860
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
Back and forth and across and up and down.

861
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,400
Bush.

862
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,600
Bush.

863
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,040
Bush.

864
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,660
Bush.

865
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,400
Bush.

866
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:14,860
Bush.

867
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,420
Bush.

868
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:15,760
Bush.

869
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,240
Bush.

870
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,680
Bush.

871
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:16,800
Bush.

872
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,080
Bush.

873
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,160
Bush.

874
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,220
Bush.

875
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,340
Major Corporate Fund.

876
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,560
Major Corporate Fund buy.

877
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,320
Wal-Mart.

878
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:24,620
Late yesterday the retailing giant announced it would rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, create.

879
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,700
Major Corporate Fund.

880
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,160
Customers will be able to rack.

881
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,340
Customers may rack.

882
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:28,720
Borrow.

883
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,020
Boot shops at Wal-Mart.

884
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,900
They don't think boot shops at Wal-Mart.

885
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,680
They don't think, think, think, think, don't trust Wal-Mart.

886
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,960
Wal-Mart sees a huge opportunity to take people.

887
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,100
Take, take, take, take.

888
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,080
And what they'll be able to do is take their check every week.

889
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:41,860
Take everything.

890
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,460
Have you ever watched someone being tortured?

891
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,420
Learn special things.

892
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,000
That's all.

893
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,640
From the School of the Americas.

894
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,780
Now any questions?

895
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,820
From creative interrogation experts.

896
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,560
Where did waterboarding come from?

897
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,380
Good question.

898
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,740
Or bomb the buildings?

899
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,900
From a phone booth.

900
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,020
Okay.

901
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,200
You will.

902
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,780
I will.

903
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,140
It's being a really good machine.

904
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,420
With the AllSpark gone,

905
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,260
we cannot return life to our planet.

906
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,120
And fate has yielded its reward.

907
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,860
A new world to call home.

908
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,240
We live among its people now,

909
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,940
hiding in plain sight,

910
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,920
but watching over them in secret.

911
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,360
Waiting.

912
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,200
Protecting.

913
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,380
I have witnessed their capacity for courage.

914
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,380
And though we are worlds apart,

915
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,260
like us,

916
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,220
there's more to them than meets the eye.

917
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,020
I am Optimus Prime,

918
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,260
and I send this message to any surviving Autobots

919
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,500
taking refuge among the stars.

920
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,420
We are here.

921
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,220
We are waiting.

922
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,360
Before I die,

923
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,280
сам pergunta,

924
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,360
I'll face myself.

925
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,160

926
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,320

927
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,200

00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,400
get movin.

929
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,420
Not much time.

930
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,320
not much time,

931
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,380
not much time.

To the end of such blood

945
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,740
Shake your roof

946

Whatever you got in the trunk
