1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,780
Bob's Bob.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,200
Bob!

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,280
What's the trouble, Bob?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,240
It's Bob.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,880
That's Bob over there.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,060
He's dead.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,460
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,900
Bob, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,940
Bob says it's the last one for him.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,040
He didn't say that.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,020
Bob said we had to get in.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
He didn't say that.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,160
Why don't you ask Bob that?

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,620
To his face.

15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,140
Hello, dear friends.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,960
This is Dr. Gordon once again with a little bit of information for some of you newer members of our great congregation.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,400
Praise Bob.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:59,000
There has been brought to my attention, there seems to be some actual discussion and argument about what constitutes one of our most sacred rights.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:07,680
And of course, dear friends, yes, I'm talking about the hallowed process of extra meditation.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:23,340
Now, because we are the pink inside, but not outside, meat tubes, all of us, we consist of an alimentary canal surrounded by all sorts of things that feed off it, basically.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,220
We put stuff in one end, it goes through a process, and it goes out the other.

22
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,200
It makes sense that what we put in, it's going to go out.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,800
And if we put in bad stuff, it's probably not going to go out good.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,860
Now, we're not getting into dietary habits or anything like that.

25
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,460
There's nothing we can do to persuade people to eat good things.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,340
But first, we probably should try and teach you how to excremeditate properly.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,200
Now, dear friends, excremeditate.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,200


29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,200


30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,200


31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,200


32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:09,980
Excremeditation is often, I am afraid, confused seriously with the simple process of excretion.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,600
And we know what that is.

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:29,200
But to excremeditate is not only to sit on the porcelain throne, squat over the hole in the concrete floor, hide in the bushes, kneel down by the side of the pool, whatever position you're in.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,200


36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,440
It's an extremely sometime, warm place, absolutely Rabblevelgic, bright and relaxing place that is you wish to excremeditate in.

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,980
Hopefully it's in a nice quiet chamber without all sorts of interruptions.

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:49,920
One should then feel the intense joy of being in excremediamn with the limited totally relaxation of your body.

39
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,220
Things that are already fruitless to the original- ones that left Ashes and theeri.

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,660
And then asタ lut lose it would funciona like nothing.

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,260
I guess bon 따라 What else, I possibly should mention.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,260


43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,380
And it's probably true.

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,840
Well, Podcast Is What Thisape Thatre which won't get into the video today.

45
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,180


46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,660
chamber, assume the position and POW! And then they're gone in 30 seconds, 40

47
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,640
seconds. My goodness! What sort of a process is that? It's like praying

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,360
to the Buddha in high-speed Asian languages. It's like doing your prayers

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,680
to Yahweh on 98 when you recorded it on 16. Come on friends, that's not how you

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,900
excremeditate. This process of elimination must be a system of

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,640
cosmic recognition. You are what you are and that's all that you are as the great

52
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,440
sage said. Now, once one is in the position to excremeditate, one must think

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,120
of Bob, relax and realize that you are now

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,660
the God of the universe.

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:04,340
As it starts to happen, as the process of peristalsis begins to drive that inner

56
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:12,700
core of dross out of your alchemical system, as you start to pass that, you

57
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:21,620
must realize that this, this, this is what excremeditation is about. Dear friends, if

58
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,320
we can enjoy putting things in one end,

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,660
we must learn how to do it.

60
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,800
We must learn how to enjoy putting things out of the other end.

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,980
Excremeditation is a joyous experience. One must relax. Sometimes you have to read.

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,280
I understand that. Dr. Gordon has known many people who had many, many troubles

63
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,960
trying to excremeditate. The secret is you must not let things get in your way.

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,660
No, dear friends, excremeditation should be as smooth a process as possible.

65
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,180
It is not as easy as yoga or greasing up a pole to climb up to catch the magic goat.

66
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:11,700
I am telling you, sit, assume that position, breathe deeply. If you need visual stimulation,

67
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,100
make sure it is that related to Bob. Think about yourself, your place in the universe.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,680
Yes, there is the moment of true excremeditation.

69
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:36,300
Yes, you are just processing food into shit like everything else in the universe.

70
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:44,860
So you are glorious, you are exalted, and like everything else, you simply don't matter.

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,500
Praise Bob!

72
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,980
Well, I'm a frogman, baby, diving deep down in the sea.

73
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,780
Well, I'm a frogman, baby, diving deep down in the sea.

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,580
Well, I have all the little fishes just to swim in.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,260
Well, I'm a frogman, baby, diving in the ocean blue.

76
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,480
Well, I'm a frogman, baby, diving deep down in the ocean blue.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,800
I want you to dive down with me, darling. I got something to show you.

78
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:30,780
I want you to dive down with me, darling. I got something to show you.

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm expensive.

84
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,080
President Obama says he's the shortest leader and contrary to American values.

85
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:57,320
President Obama says there's no China, have made statements saying the winter solstice can't be tolerated.

86
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,600
President Obama says the winter solstice is back on the list of shortest.

87
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,520
The president says the offensive solstice is suspected of incitement against PR.

88
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,180
He says this is PR News in Washington.

89
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,300
You can't do a show about Satan unless you get all Christian-y because Satan is a Christian character.

90
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,400
It just goes on and on.

91
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,560
He's a Christian character.

92
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,140
Sure, it doesn't have any meaning outside of Christianity, does it?

93
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,380
Well, actually, Satan was mentioned in the Old Testament.

94
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,200
Christianity.

95
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,940
But he was not necessarily... no, no, the Old Testament was before Christianity.

96
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,420
Well, of course it was.

97
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,840
And...

98
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,080
We're saying the Christian canon as we now know.

99
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,660
As we now know it, I will give that to you.

100
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,360
Satan was a concept that the Christians used to make...

101
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,760
He wasn't his old self until he got to the New Testament.

102
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,560
Yeah, that's true.

103
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,860
He didn't have the horns and look like Buck naked with red paint on him.

104
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,820
Well, he had great privileges.

105
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,920
And he could go to heaven.

106
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
He could go to heaven and hang out with God.

107
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,860
Yeah, he was actually cast down from heaven by God.

108
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:12,940
Well, we know that, but I mean, in the book of Job, he's up there hanging out with God and making bets about Job and his ability to withstand hideous injustice and pain.

109
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:21,260
Yeah, you know, the snake that tempted Adam and Eve was not actually Satan, but it was inferred that he was Satan later on.

110
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,740
He was possessed by Satan.

111
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,500
And yet, apparently, some crime...

112
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,420
And yet, apparently, some crime...

113
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,860
He was possessed by Satan.

114
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:27,860


115
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,460
But this is inappropriate.

116
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,340
This is a timeless whopper.

117
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,640
This is a timeless whopper that is from time immemorial.

118
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,100
The snake walked upright like a human and had arms and legs.

119
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,380
Their whoppers were spoken as if they were...

120
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,460
It looked...

121
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,480
Resembled the dinosauroid recently.

122
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,200
As if they were the verity of...

123
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,620
Constructed by Dr. Dale Russell.

124
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
An indisputed verity of life.

125
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:54,460
These whoppers were so huge that they were insurmountable by other smaller whoppers of the day.

126
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,580
Burger kings, let alone burgers.

127
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,800
At that time.

128
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,080
They didn't even call them whoppers.

129
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,700
The Germans had burgers and the Dutch had burgers.

130
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,360
The kings of the earth were of great status and power.

131
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,860
And they could have cool whoppers and better shoes.

132
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,900
And nicer hats.

133
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,600
Action.

134
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,740
Well, I like the days when they had buckles on the shoes.

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,840
Yeah, pretty presumptuous.

136
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,700
The buckles really hold them on.

137
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,460
That's the way the Lord intended.

138
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,080
The Velcro will always...

139
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,480
Those Dutch guys, I like that aspect of whatever they were doing.

140
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,220
They suffered in the world.

141
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,980
They suffered in more places than any buttons.

142
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,060
But Velcro has to be cleaned up, you know.

143
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,880
And buckles have to be polished.

144
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,120
If it's holding your shoe on, I know this from better personal experience.

145
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,000
It gets all worn out.

146
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,660
You can't just have footwear that never wears out.

147
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,000
You don't have to do something to it like polishing your buckle or brushing your Velcro to get the lint out of your Velcro.

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,280
You don't have to polish your buckle.

149
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,380
You can let your shoes look shabby like a lot of people do.

150
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,780
But have you noticed if you don't pick the lint out of your Velcro over time,

151
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,680
it doesn't stick?

152
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:54,920
No.

153
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,740
Well, because it gets filled up with little bits of bra-do.

154
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,820
You can laugh at Benjamin Franklin's buckled shoes,

155
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,580
but in fact, you just put it on and buckle it, and it's on.

156
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,800
You don't have to sit and lace shoelaces and put them through grommets.

157
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,640
I will admit that a buckled shoe is...

158
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,600
And they look so good.

159
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,360
Buckle it up, and there you go.

160
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,940
One nation under the buckle for all.

161
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,640
You see, it's the next thing from...

162
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,700
Just a sort of a slipper that you slip on.

163
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,840
It actually has a strap that goes across the heel.

164
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,380
Well, they have a heel on them, too, and that's more than a slipper.

165
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah, the heel also helps you, but the strap is what holds the shoe.

166
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,560
The heel is what actually gives you an arch.

167
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
And an arch support.

168
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,040
Arch for men's right to go.

169
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,660
And your arch is completely out of touch if you don't get something done about it.

170
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,120
Arching over and over.

171
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,660
Before the end of the year, this...

172
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,780
Always repeat.

173
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,280
This...

174
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,660
This incentive will run out, and everyone will be out in the cold.

175
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,560
Once again.

176
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,700
Only this time.

177
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,440
Barefooted and buckled.

178
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,980
Or you can even think of it in terms of the subgenius versus the...

179
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,840
Hey, Dr. Hal, I have this bucket here for you.

180
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,260
It's...

181
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,040
Yeah, it's got 10,000 likes.

182
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,780
You can put it on.

183
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,860
You'll get 10,000 likes on whatever you want.

184
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,520
You can put it on a bike more.

185
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,380
Oh, yeah, some sort of fake-like incentive.

186
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,020
Yeah, it's a fake-like bucket.

187
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,900
Bucket.

188
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,140
A bucket of likes, Andy.

189
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,340
A bucket of likes.

190
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,260
Well, you can take that bucket and...

191
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,140
I just love a bucket of likes.

192
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
Lord, love a bucket.

193
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,280
See, not just the Johnny Kennedy conspiracy.

194
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,720
Dr. Hal?

195
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,960
Or any conspiracy.

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,900
Buy a buck-buck-bucket!

197
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,280
They interlock.

198
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,500
They are.

199
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,880
They are at the back of all things.

200
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,720
The same gigantic interlocked conspiracy.

201
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Like the giant Lego of life.

202
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,160
Conspiracy from the Latin con meaning with

203
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,200
and spiro meaning to breathe

204
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,780
as in respiration, inspiration.

205
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
To be inspired is to be full of breath.

206
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,820
To conspire is to breathe together.

207
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,880
So the conspiracy and its members all breathe together.

208
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,280
They may not know that they are aligned in a mighty...

209
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,540
force against the few heroic members of the Church of the Subgenius

210
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,340
and its radio ministers,

211
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,840
but nonetheless...

212
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,100
That's us.

213
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,440
...they act like some gigantic malignant organism

214
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,400
breathing all together, together in throng

215
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,540
to oppose what subgeniuses want.

216
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,480
And, uh...

217
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,380
That's the sound of us breathing together.

218
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,380
What do subgeniuses want?

219
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,660
What do they want?

220
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,000
They just want extended shelf life.

221
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,260
You know what must the subgenius have.

222
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,780
Of course.

223
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,740
Like anybody else.

224
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,480
You know what it is.

225
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,160
I'd like to put my stuff up there and know that it's gonna be there.

226
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,500
Yes, it's slack.

227
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,860
Slack.

228
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,160
Slack.

229
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,600
Slack is the soft voice.

230
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,180
Slack, the luminous power.

231
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,060
The luminous cloud.

232
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,040
We rejoice in slack.

233
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,340
Slack is the opposite of tension.

234
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,020
Slack is leisure.

235
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,280
Leisure, the basis of culture.

236
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,680
Only in leisure can you figure out the next neat thing.

237
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,480
Not while you are in major trouble.

238
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,580
You are enmeshed in the tentacular toils of the bowels of the conspiracy.

239
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,640
Wearing a leisure suit.

240
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,380
At your meaningless job, though you may wear a leisure suit at leisure.

241
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,840
That gives you the pseudonymity that you need.

242
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,860
It is important.

243
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,180
It is unfortunately necessary.

244
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,460
Yeah, and you can play miniature golf in there too, in your cubicle.

245
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,440
Since we are surrounded by the fluid medium of the conspiracy,

246
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
that we breathe it a little bit.

247
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,420
That we kick against it a little bit.

248
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,840
We may have to have a conspiracy job now and then.

249
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,000
On our way.

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
Just to tickle your fancy.

251
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,320
On our voyage to being an art bomb and having no job.

252
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,120
Somehow being miraculously supported.

253
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,660
It is a path beset with thorns, scorpions, and orthopedic shoes.

254
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,580
But it can be surmounted.

255
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,720
You can get sucked into that life.

256
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,340
It is worthwhile.

257
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,260
Although one hears the giant sucking sound.

258
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,960
As you accumulate the money it takes to pay for your slack.

259
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,080
Taking that sinusoidal trail.

260
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,000
The coils of the conspiracy's bowels.

261
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,260
To the mountain of enlightenment.

262
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,740
The punchline of the pot of gold.

263
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,920
Now the conspiracy wants to take away your original slack.

264
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,280
You were born each and every one of you.

265
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,380
Now you can get an alert system that will tell you when the conspiracy is beginning to take away your slack.

266
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,080
But the conspiracy wants to take that original slack away.

267
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,540
Order one now.

268
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,900
Tell you false slack that it is manufactured.

269
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,080
No long term contracts.

270
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,940
And it wants to keep you thirsting and jonesing.

271
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,960
And grasping for each new laptop and palm pilot.

272
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,660
Each new trinket.

273
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
Each new tchotchke.

274
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,740
Each new iPad and iPod.

275
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,040
Which it assures you will complete the ring of your happiness.

276
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,820
But you will never be happy.

277
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,720
Just as Tantalus in the underworld is tortured by having food lowered almost to his parched lips.

278
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,520
And then when he snatched at it has it draw away.

279
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,820
What you think of as part of your happiness.

280
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,480
Will eternally draw away from you as you attempt to approach it.

281
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,860
This is how you know it is false slack.

282
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,480
A production of the conspiracy.

283
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,740
Bring me home and it's been a minute.

284
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,040
Don't say a word and I'm all a bit.

285
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Talk to the human and the slack of me.

286
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,180
Back to the ball.

287
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,440
Doors will not open.

288
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,240
React with panic.

289
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,020
And you won't slow them down.

290
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,180
Just a candy pile of apples.

291
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,180
Some end up in trouble.

292
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,760
Under the weight.

293
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,420
Of their own kind.

294
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,220
Are they keeping the sense.

295
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,560
When they turn to surface.

296
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,540
So typically.

297
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm a little bit.

298
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,160


299
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,620
Of our own.

300
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,780
For when the end is open.

301
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,360
Check this will be love.

302
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,340
For many.

303
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,000
When the law commits.

304
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,280
The precious thoughts are unstaken.

305
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,060
Yes it's the entrance.

306
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,620
And the entrance is a tunnel.

307
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,160
Welcome to the middle of the rain.

308
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,560
Welcome to the middle of the rain.

309
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Welcome to the middle of the rain.

310
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,440


311
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,440


312
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,900
From NPR News in Washington.

313
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm moving to the southeast.

314
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,920
The mid-Atlantic.

315
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,520
And up to southern states.

316
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,020
5% is not 2.5%.

317
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,080
Which is still pretty good.

318
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
But good numbers were not so good.

319
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,640
The Commerce Department says 7 tenths of a good percent.

320
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,620
After an expected good number fell.

321
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,920
NPR News.

322
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,240
On Wall Street.

323
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,520
85, 85, 18, 18, 18, 10, 10, 44, 47, 72, 4, 20, 83.

324
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,260
It appears reports at a bus station.

325
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,620
And another at a market.

326
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,340
Civilians scattered body parts around the area.

327
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,160
This is gross domestic product.

328
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,160


329
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,760
The

The

342
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:50,540


343
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:59,320
Hey, Berkeley, oldest of the subgenius radio shows, had Dr. Hal Robbins and Dr. Phyla Drummond discussing Satan's Shoes and Slack.

344
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,140
The Winter Star Ball last night at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland was a big success.

345
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,820
We saw at least 100 old friends, and I do mean old in some cases.

346
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:20,860
Princess Wee sang in three different bands, and I introduced each of nine bands and conducted a raffle to benefit Ace and the Jeff Rosenbaum Memorials,

347
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:31,840
which managed to involve so many numerological coincidences that if you were a numerology kook or suspicious, you'd think it was all rigged by aliens.

348
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,940
Anyway, we had a great time, but we are post-toasties.

349
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,800
We used up all of our vim and vigor before Dirtbag.

350
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
We're a might peaked.

351
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,000
Plus, we had no idea what to expect here at the station, technically, since big changes have been happening.

352
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:56,620
So we're going to slack off tonight while playing some choice cuts from puzzling evidence shows with Dr. Hal and Dr. Phyla Drummond,

353
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,220
interspersed with some recent original new music from contributors.

354
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,120
The puzzling evidence pieces were all isolated and culled by Reverend Baby Bear,

355
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,720
because editing puzzling evidence clips requires great patience.

356
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,880
But it's well worth it, my friends, so slap on those skull clamps and listen some more.

357
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,860
I was leaving my hotel bedraggled and sleepless or sleep rumpled.

358
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,140
Maybe it was yesterday, I don't know, in a fog of sleeplessness.

359
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,960
Was it you that left, or was it something just looking like you?

360
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,480
I was confronted by a furious group of normals in a van who started asking us about that face on our clothing.

361
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,800
And they were saying,

362
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,060
You mean you're Trekkies, right?

363
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,360
No, madame, not in any sense.

364
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,680
We are members of the Church of the Subgenius.

365
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,220
Subgenius? What's that? Does it mean you're stupid?

366
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,000
Well, indeed it may. There's no point in ruling it out.

367
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:03,020
But as mentioned before, subgenius does not really have anything to do with intelligence and hardly anything to do with stupidity.

368
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,340
Subgenius, when you parse the word,

369
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,300
merely means that each one is under,

370
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,700
the prefix sub indicates his own genius.

371
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,400
And the word genius has an alternative meaning that you will find in the dictionary,

372
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,460
cognate to the word genie.

373
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,860
You have to look in that dictionary to understand.

374
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,520
Because there are spiritual powers in this twisted and tormented world.

375
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,560
The conspiracy doesn't agree that any of them exist.

376
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,800
It can't make money from them.

377
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,660
But we, members of the Church of the Subgenius, are occasionally able to make money from them.

378
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,580
Even these.

379
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,740
The subgenius is one who acts under his or her own genius.

380
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,880
I wish I still had my giant chicken.

381
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,500
Rather than at the behest of the conspiracy.

382
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,160
To the conspiracy you are a chicken.

383
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,360
To be factory farmed and commodified.

384
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
I think the giant chicken had more to die.

385
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,200
As in hideous,

386
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,800
the concentration camp in Blue Lane, one of those typhoon camps.

387
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,860
Where giant chickens die an unspeakable death.

388
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,780
And they have to get rid of those giant chickens.

389
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,300
The giant chicken gizzards.

390
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,700
And how do you think they do that?

391
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,600
Oh those are delicious.

392
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
You don't get rid of those.

393
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,560
Giant fried chicken gizzards.

394
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,100
The gizzards are wonderful.

395
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,960
That's a wonderful part of the bird.

396
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,460
There's plenty of use for the gizzard.

397
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,240
It's not so much use for the...

398
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,840
Don't make light of the gizzard folks.

399
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,300
There are other things that are less...

400
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,560
What about the heart and the livers?

401
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,860
Well the heart is also good.

402
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,140
I'm not particularly fond of the liver.

403
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,340
But the heart and the gizzard are quite good.

404
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,000
I know somebody who recently got...

405
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,900
...tomain poisoning from eating old chicken livers.

406
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,160
The toads?

407
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,600
They got...

408
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,220
...poison from eating the toads of a chicken.

409
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,300
He ate two week old chicken livers.

410
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,460
Oh it's a chicken liverish world out there.

411
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,000
Or something like that.

412
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,820
Two month old chicken livers.

413
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,500
...the best house.

414
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,460
Still cannot accommodate those who do not care for the taste of liver in any way.

415
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,320
Yes that's true.

416
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,280
But some people can...

417
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,420
But some people like the liver.

418
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,680
...they can eat anything.

419
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,100
Even old things.

420
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,340
I haven't had that in a long, long time.

421
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,300
How about beef tongue?

422
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,840
Did you like liver and onions?

423
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,940
I know it's so funny how they used to eat...

424
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,460
I know.

425
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,460
It's good though right?

426
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,480
...the huge tongue in the refrigerator.

427
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,160
But you eat it with a little bit of mustard in it.

428
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,440
So you cut off a slice.

429
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,160
It's quite good.

430
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,040
I've never missed...

431
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Why would it not be good?

432
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,720
I've never missed the liver and onions.

433
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,280
That's what's so strange when I find myself wretched.

434
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,160
My dad used to always demand my mom that.

435
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,420
Maybe the onions make the liver more better.

436
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,800
He demanded?

437
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,240
He loved liver and onions.

438
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,140
Well they both did.

439
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,120
I did too as a kid.

440
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,600
I loved it.

441
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:29,760
Yeah.

442
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,700
It was so weird tasting.

443
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,340
And I can remember coming in the house and it had this weird smell and it always had

444
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,720
this weird texture and...

445
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,960
Can't we just go back to regular meat?

446
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,360
Yeah.

447
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,460
And so at some point...

448
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,780
I don't know.

449
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:39,780


450
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,660
I ate onions?

451
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,000
At some point I ate my last liver and I don't even remember when it was but I decided at

452
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,680
some point...

453
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,000
That's it.

454
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,320
...I never have to have it again.

455
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,900
That's right.

456
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,280
That's it.

457
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,440
Something I'll never miss.

458
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,180
My dad really liked that about rhubarb and I really liked it.

459
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,940
He had some of the...

460
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,660
Oh more rhubarb about...

461
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:53,900
Lizard.

462
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,380
The lizard liver was good.

463
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,440
Lizard liver?

464
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,260
Those are fighting words.

465
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,000
But...

466
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,340
Some people eat radley seeds.

467
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,720
I've got so many tomatoes on my cherry tomato vine right now that I'm about to get tired

468
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,340
of tomatoes.

469
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,020
Just about the beginning...

470
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,220
I can't imagine what you eat.

471
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,120
Well but you can't.

472
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,760
You have to eat.

473
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,080
You can't eat them.

474
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,380
You've got to keep eating them.

475
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,240
They're so good.

476
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,400
You've got to keep eating them.

477
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,600
You can't let up.

478
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,540
That's a task.

479
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:16,900
Those loved apples.

480
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,000
You have to strive to...

481
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,640
Don't you consider those to be possible agents of poisoning and evil filters and potions?

482
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,620
You're talking about the tomatoes?

483
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,080
Yes.

484
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,540
I am.

485
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,040
I am.

486
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,580
I'm talking about them.

487
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,200
They were thought until fairly recently...

488
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,840
Tomatoes have little families and names and stuff.

489
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,660
...to be poisonous and not consumable by humans.

490
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,180
So you're biting their little brains when you eat them?

491
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,280
Not only that.

492
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,740
I'm not sure.

493
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:39,740


494
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:39,740


495
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:39,940
I'm not sure.

496
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:39,940


497
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:39,940


498
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:39,940


499
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,420
What right do you have to do that?

500
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
What right?

501
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,480
Yeah.

502
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,280
Cool, we're bigger.

503
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,380
We're bigger and stronger and have more money than the tomatoes so that's how we win.

504
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,500
I think it's called the right of might.

505
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,600
Yes.

506
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,760
Well don't you...

507
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:51,900
I have the will.

508
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,760
Don't go there because they already did that on Over the Edge.

509
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,140
It's the right of the might of will.

510
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,700
Right.

511
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,780
Right.

512
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:58,780


513
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,000
Right.

514
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,960
Right.

515
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,040
Right.

516
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,040


517
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,060
Right.

518
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,060


519
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,060


520
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,300
Right.

521
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,300


522
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,300


523
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,300


524
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:04,900
Right.

525
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,860
Right.

526
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,260
Right.

527
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,260


528
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,260


529
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,580
It is.

530
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,860
There is.

531
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,600


532
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,600


533
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,600


534
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,600


535
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,140
No sign of a leak, but they're not used to that, emphasize the fact that they've

536
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,980
got the high frequency, and said they could fight eating jelly.

537
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,740
escucha la per algum dato que aquellos garradicos testimonian queائ thick nueva

539
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
I don't get why.

540
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,960
They gave their lives to science

541
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,980
To see what they could see

542
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,600
Becoming an appliance

543
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,320
At one with technology

544
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,900
The years stand in defiance

545
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,000
To all that we achieve

546
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,840
And like all other giants

547
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,320
They were tossed into the sea

548
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,500
Scanners live in vain

549
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:19,300
Can you feel the pain on our eyes?

550
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,500
Tell me what we gain

551
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,500
Who will stop the rain?

552
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,940
A game of rat and dragon

553
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,200
Will lead you to defeat

554
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,180
So don't you go ragging

555
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,260
As you're in the driver's seat

556
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,780
Erase your station wagon

557
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,000
Down every dead street

558
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,460
They simply drop the flag

559
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,500
And you will both be obsolete

560
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,180
Scanners!

561
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Scanners live in vain

562
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,840
Can you feel the pain on our eyes?

563
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,520
The burning of the brain

564
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Tell me what we gain

565
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,220
Scanners live in vain

566
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:55,040
They will're wasting every slot

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:03,360

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,180

00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,920
the man

586
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,900
like Captain Kirk in Star Trek

587
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,760
aboard

588
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,680
the Enterprise

589
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,200
surrounded

590
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,560
by your

591
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,280
high tech fantasy

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,340
without surprise

593
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,880
while jacking

594
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,220
in your tape deck

595
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,820
you listen

596
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,300
to these lies

597
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,220
and fizzle

598
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,320
like a

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,220
heretic

600
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,040
like a

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,840

00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,180

00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,740

thousand

610
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,120
years

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,420
saving

612
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,200

00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,260

617
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,360
three

618
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,720
of

619
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,860
us

620
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:25,880
removing

621
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,520
the

622
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,720
man

623
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,460
We gain

624
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,540
On you

625
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,680
Feel the pain

626
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,840
Sky does

627
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,020
Live

628
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,140
In

629
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,840
The rain

630
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
situations

631
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,940
There could be

632
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:07,960
A bit

633
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,080
But she

634
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,460
Never

635
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,460


636
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,460


637
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,800
This

638
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,180
Round

639
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


640
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


641
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


642
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


643
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


644
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,900
just

645
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
where

646
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,480
in

647
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,660
lo

648
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,220
ab

649
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,360
everything

650
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:29,700
we

651
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:38,260
Anyone who's ever thought of drawing cartoons has probably looked at those books that say,

652
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,740
Everybody can draw cartoons.

653
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,740
I'm looking at one now, Dr. Howe.

654
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
It's really simple.

655
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,480
Draw a circle, and then you draw a vertical line.

656
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,620
And then in about 15 minutes, you are completely bored with it, and you throw it over.

657
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,640
But all these books have one thing in common.

658
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,480
They contain a diagram which allegedly represents how to draw in perspective.

659
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,420
And this is invariably a picture of railroad tracks stretching away to a point on the horizon.

660
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,600
A point which they call the vanishing point.

661
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,820
With telephone poles.

662
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,940
Yeah, telephone poles.

663
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,920
The horizon is always drawn at the head of your characters, at eye level,

664
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,640
because the horizon is the same as everyone's eye level.

665
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,600
And these railroad tracks do appear to draw away into a point.

666
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,620
And throughout your life, you are rushing down these tracks,

667
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,160
toward that vanishing point.

668
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,240
But there comes a time, and it grieves me to tell you this, it really does.

669
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,560
I don't want to bring anybody down.

670
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,420
I know everyone listening is having a good time.

671
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,620
But there comes a time when, as you look forward from the train,

672
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,960
you will see, by God, they do come to a point.

673
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,120
And that point is coming closer and closer.

674
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,740
And the train is going to derail.

675
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,640
It'll go off the tracks, because the tracks will be too thin, too close together.

676
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:50,960
Too narrow.

677
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,180
The rails are no longer wide enough.

678
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,440
Right.

679
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,600
And after that point is over,

680
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,100
you're oblivion.

681
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,300
The abyss of nothingness.

682
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:05,400
It is your job, your duty as a subgenius to indulge in what we call time control.

683
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,840
Yes, you don't have to go pell-mell down this track.

684
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,280
You can goof off.

685
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
You can bloviate.

686
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,820
You can loaf.

687
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,880
You can use your divine subgenius essence.

688
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,680
You can climb a tree.

689
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:18,860
And put it to the test.

690
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Because time is nothing you should have to consider.

691
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,480
It's slack that you should consider.

692
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,720
You can suppress an angry girl.

693
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,240
Time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.

694
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,380
The former live too little, and the latter live too long.

695
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,860
You can get drunk.

696
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:33,880
Or sue me.

697
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:40,140
But you will live your abhorrent span, either in slacknessness or in thirstless grasping

698
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,400
for the conspiracy's worthless udders.

699
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,260
It's a sad business, ladies and gentlemen.

700
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,020
I've simply laid it out for you a little bit.

701
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Yes, you have.

702
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
You've kind of laid it out a bit.

703
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm just trying to explain to you what the end of the world is.

704
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,460
Now you can seek an intimate connection with the world.

705
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


706
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


707
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


708
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


709
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


710
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


711
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,460


712
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:24,440
You'll see when you own an duvet or When you own a great sauvalier.

713
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


714
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


715
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


716
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


717
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


718
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


719
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


720
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,440


721
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,200
I thought you were going to say I was a recruiter into the church of this up to you.

722
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,880
Of this cult leading activity that's so popular with the kids these days.

723
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,280
You know, these kids do it.

724
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,400
They want to do it.

725
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,180
They were there.

726
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,540
You saw they want to do it.

727
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,300
They need that leadership.

728
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,300
It has nothing to do with us enticing them.

729
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,780
They're willing young things.

730
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,800
They just can't wait.

731
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,860
Yeah, they do this entirely on their own.

732
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,980
And I'm glad they do because it's something to look forward to.

733
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:02,040
Well, one thing that helps the kids, they know that they're making the green in the future brighter.

734
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,920
They are.

735
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,740
It will be a brighter color of green.

736
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,460
Some of them are rather bright.

737
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,000
Others are unregenerate to backwoods.

738
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,740
It's as if they took the green and they applied a brightness filter to it.

739
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,000
Massive, high functioning.

740
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,260
Yeah.

741
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,100
Just rearев.

742
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


743
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


744
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100


745
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,100

Thank you.

764
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,200
Thank you.

765
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,760
Science lesson.

766
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,660
Yeah, and it's interesting.

767
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,140
You read about what we were talking about last week,

768
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,520
that Wilkes Land event, that giant mass con,

769
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,880
the asteroid that hit at the end.

770
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,440
Yes.

771
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,520
Certain parts of the Earth, like certain parts of the moon,

772
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,900
have different gravity and different density.

773
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,680
They also speculate that that's when Australia took its shift

774
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,300
and some of the plate tectonic activity was stimulated very heavily

775
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,880
by that.

776
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,700
That asteroid impact.

777
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,380
And we're still feeling the ripple effects of it today.

778
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,620
And the other ones, as the continents move very, very slowly.

779
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,060
But it's just like a leaf floating on a lake.

780
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,360
If you toss a rock in next to it, that leaf is going to move

781
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,080
and it's going to go in another direction.

782
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,320
You must have seen all those pictures I posted of Balls Pyramid Island

783
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,080
sticking out of the Tasman Sea.

784
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,500
Right, right. I love that.

785
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,860
It's so beautiful.

786
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,260
Bizarre looking.

787
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:27,500
But it is only the top peak of a giant sunken continent called Zealandia.

788
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,280
Yeah, right.

789
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,840
That is in the ocean off the, in the waters of New Zealand,

790
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,520
shark infested area.

791
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,940
But only a few parts stick out, but they're very bizarre.

792
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,020
I showed the picture of Balls Pyramid Island to Cheryl in Connolly

793
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,740
and she immediately said, Photoshop.

794
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,320
Oh, yeah.

795
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:50,780
Nothing.

796
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,680
Nothing could look like that.

797
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,440
But no, it does look like that.

798
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,580
And it's even weirder than that because it's thin like a knife blade.

799
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,380
Tell the audience what that is again.

800
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,620
Balls Pyramid Island.

801
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,040
Balls Pyramid.

802
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,980
B-A-L-L-O-P-S-P-Y-R-A-M-I-D-I-L-A-N-D.

803
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,260
Can you get a picture of it on your magic screen there?

804
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,540
Balls Pyramid.

805
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,420
Because that is where the surviving giant phasmid insects were found.

806
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,720
Right.

807
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,780
The big, the big.

808
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,800
The big bugs that there was only a few of.

809
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,100
They were under one bush on Balls Pyramid Island.

810
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,660
The horribly awesome things that live on Balls Pyramid.

811
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,680
Yeah, here's an image of Balls Pyramid.

812
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,600
Can you see it?

813
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,220
Yeah, I'll show you here.

814
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,560
Yes.

815
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,340
The thing is, it looks like, it looks like something like King Kong's Island or something.

816
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,260
It just looks too amazing to exist.

817
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,660
But then if you get an aerial view of it, it's...

818
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,100
It's thin.

819
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,100
It's like a giant knife blade sticking a thousand feet out of the ocean.

820
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,820
Oh, that's a good shot of it.

821
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,080
Yeah.

822
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,820
That's beautiful.

823
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,060
And it's very difficult to land on.

824
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,140
There's no beach.

825
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,380
No, it's vertical.

826
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,360
The cliff's just going up.

827
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,000
And the sea is full of very aggressive sharks there.

828
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:15,920
Nonetheless, scientists around the turn of this century did manage to land on it and do some exploration.

829
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,640
And that's when they discovered that the giant tree lobsters, as they were called,

830
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,640


831
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,640


832
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:26,760
were not extinct, but still living in a small relic population on the island,

833
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,600
which the scientists immediately scooped up and seized.

834
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,900
They left some of them there, didn't they?

835
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,220
They didn't take all of them, did they?

836
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,380
They took them all.

837
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,840
The first ones they took died.

838
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,680
So they came back and they took the rest.

839
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,700
But, but although that sounds bad...

840
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,460
Didn't they go back and put some on there?

841
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,960
You'd think they would.

842
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,040
However, it's hard to get there, you know.

843
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,280
Then they go all the way back and put them back.

844
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,520
The thing is, they...

845
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:56,240
have started a breeding program and now they've bred thousands of them, as you must know.

846
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,260
Someday we'll bring them in and...

847
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,820
Well, you see...

848
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,840
...give them a little education.

849
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,100
They also used to live on Lord Howe Island nearby.

850
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,720
I forget how many miles away.

851
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,400
18 miles away or something like that?

852
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,660
Yeah, you can see it in the distance.

853
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,140
That's Lord Howe in the distance there in that one shot that you've got.

854
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:14,940
Yeah.

855
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,340
There, uh, it...

856
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,420
in, was it the 1920s?

857
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:18,960
Look at this one.

858
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,320
You see Lord Howe in the background.

859
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Ground cloud covered.

860
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,240
Boy, that's beautiful.

861
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:23,800
Not awesome.

862
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,260
Of course, I'll never be there in my life, but...

863
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,200
how wonderful it would be to be on that sea and see...

864
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,380
Look at that, Doug.

865
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,400
Doug thinks it's cool.

866
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:45,340
The ocean-bright blue and the spire-like sphere of, uh, balls, pyramids sticking up out of the ocean.

867
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,120
There's another island there, too.

868
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,000
So, nearby.

869
00:50:51,820 --> 00:51:01,160
You see, it was, I think, in the 1920s that the British freighter Mogambo ran aground on Lord Howe Island.

870
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:08,440
And while they were fixing it or just dithering around, huge rats escaped.

871
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,500
Look, it does look like there's a tiny little beach there. Look where those wave action is.

872
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,840
I see, but still it would be hard. You'd still have to climb vertically.

873
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,580
Right.

874
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:28,580
So the rats devoured all the peaceful, slow-moving giant insects and they became extinct on Lord Howe.

875
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,380
But on the nearby Ball's Pyramid, they managed to survive.

876
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:42,100
It's also said that they show unusual sentiment and sympathy for their own kind.

877
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,040
Many insects are not what you'd call...

878
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,900
Social.

879
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,480
Social.

880
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,560
Social besides the sense of...

881
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,040
Other than their hive mind.

882
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,880
The hive mind.

883
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,640
Yeah.

884
00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:03,040
But the giant insects of Ball's Pyramid and Lord Howe Island tried to protect themselves from the invading scientists.

885
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,460
The males would throw their legs over the females and try to protect them from being scooped up.

886
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,220
But science scooped up both males and the females.

887
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,100
And now, where is it? The Auckland Zoo?

888
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,760
They have a breeding program. They've bred thousands and thousands of them.

889
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,300
I don't know, but Ball's Pyramid is the remnants of a long-dead volcano.

890
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,560
From the sunken continent of Zeelandia.

891
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:28,900
Yes.

892
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,560
1800 feet high.

893
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,020
It's high, all right. And thin in cross-section. And it seems to come to a point at the top.

894
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:46,540
For years, this place had a secret at 225 feet above sea level, hanging on this rock surface.

895
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,800
With that one bush.

896
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:57,480
There is a small, spindly little bush. And under that bush, a few years ago, two climbers working in the dark found something totally improbable hiding in the soil below.

897
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,380
A huge insect.

898
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,220
Out back there, we still don't know.

899
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:13,200
But they're nice insects. They're... you know, they used to call them tree lobsters back when they... before they became extinct on Lord Howe.

900
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,900
And now they're going to be re...

901
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,520
Re-insects.

902
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,220
They're stocking Lord Howe. In fact, they may have done that already.

903
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:30,880
They've created a population of tree lobsters, installed them on Lord Howe, and exterminated the black rats, which have also been reproducing ever since the Mogambo ran aground.

904
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,920
So there you have it.

905
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,900
Also, I like their legs. They look like they're wearing pants. They're very unusual insect structures.

906
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,560
Very nice.

907
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,280
They look like they've got trousers on.

908
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,020
Pants like trouser legs.

909
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,760
Oh, I didn't look... look...

910
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,240
It all shows to go, yeah.

911
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:49,620
Yeah.

912
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,400
Alright, do a search on Lord Howe Island stick insect.

913
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,160
That's H-O-W-E.

914
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:04,060
And I think it'll come up an image. They even have a grizzly close-up of the face of one of these...

915
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:11,060
Oh, yeah. See, they're crawling on that guy. I'd like a pet giant tree lobster to crawl on me.

916
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,220
They don't look like a lobster.

917
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,560
Well, they... that's what they were called by these...

918
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,980
islanders who were descendants of English convicts who lived there.

919
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,380
There's a bloody tree lobster.

920
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,220
Yeah, 1918, a supply ship, the Mogambo...

921
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,380
Oh, it was 1918. Yeah, it was before the 20s.

922
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:33,240
...ran aground, and the rats... one passenger drowned, but the rest were put ashore.

923
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,200
It took nine days to repair the Mogambo, and during that time, some black rats managed to get on the island...

924
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,960
That's all it takes.

925
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,420
...where they enjoyed their delicious new rat food, giant stick insects.

926
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,860
Look at those things trying to get away. They can't move as fast as the rats.

927
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,340
Two years later, the rats were everywhere, and the tree lobsters were all gone.

928
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,740
All gone.

929
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:54,980
Totally gone.

930
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,220
Extinct. Defunct.

931
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,320
After 1920, there wasn't a single sighting.

932
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:10,960
By 1960, the Lord Howe stick insect, Dryococelus australis, was presumed extinct.

933
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,400
So they have only officially announced that in 1960.

934
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:14,400


935
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,240
Yeah. Even though they didn't see a single sighting.

936
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:31,220
But now, the species has come roaring back. Dryococelus australis has been given new life by interfering humans who have tried to rectify their ancient injustice.

937
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,780
Oh, come on.

938
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:44,160
Yeah, they must have said what zoo they were breeding them in. They've bred up a huge, swarming mass.

939
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:51,920
What they don't say is they don't admit the fact that those insects could have also been on Ball's Pyramid at the same time.

940
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,200
Oh, they must have been.

941
00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:02,060
That they didn't leave Lord Howe Island and make it over to Ball's Pyramid as a survival mechanism.

942
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:10,320
You see, I'm sure they themselves are ancient survivors of the lost life forms of the now sunken land of Zeelandia.

943
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:10,620
Yeah.

944
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,140
And since these two bodies never sank, they lived on the land.

945
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:14,700
They lived on them.

946
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:14,940
Right.

947
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:19,500
And then the humans caused them to become extinct on the livable one, which is Lord Howe.

948
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:26,420
And they managed to bumble along under a tiny bush on the pyramid, which is so hard to get to.

949
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,340
Well, they didn't have any predators except for birds, maybe. I don't know.

950
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,280
Until scientists came and started scooping them up.

951
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:34,860
Ah.

952
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,720
Oh, this is a strange world we live in.

953
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:43,760
I want my own pet giant phasmid insect, like that guy has in the picture.

954
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,120
Yeah.

955
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,780
Look at him grinning and there's bugs crawling over him.

956
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,140
Yeah.

957
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,140
Oh, yeah.

958
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,580
He's got a lovely pair of tree lobsters there.

959
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,000
Well, they're sucking at you, kid.

960
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,440
They're harmless.

961
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,440
Absolutely harmless.

962
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,980
Or so we've been taught.

963
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,340
You can allow them to crawl into bed with you.

964
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,080
They'll do nothing.

965
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,760
Or so we're told.

966
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:22,020
You can go to sleep with them crawling freely in your bedroom and no harm will come to you, they say.

967
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,240
But how about harm that'll come to them, huh?

968
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,880
When you wake up, your diggy dog or kitty cat will have killed your pet tree lobster.

969
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,600
So sad.

970
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,360
Some people call Zelandia Tasmanthus.

971
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,580
Yeah, like it's the Tasmanian Atlantis, right?

972
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,600
Tasmanthus.

973
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,120
That's pretty good.

974
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,680
Tasmanthus.

975
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,060
Zelandia always sounded better to me.

976
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:51,320
What does it say about Zelandia there on your magic box?

977
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,920
Well, it says it's a nearly submerged continental fragment that sank after breaking away from Australia 60 to 85 million years ago,

978
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,060
having separated from Antarctica between 85 and 130 million years ago.

979
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:08,020
You see, it sank during the late Mesozoic, during the age of dinosaurs.

980
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,560
It may have completely submerged about 23 million years ago, which was a little bit after the Mesozoic.

981
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,400
Oh yes, that's much after, but it's been slowly sinking.

982
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,280
You see, they don't generally sink overnight.

983
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,780
93% of it remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean.

984
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,420
Oh, I wish I had the money to travel.

985
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,360
I'd get a ship together with Captain Englehorn and we'd go sailing down, I mean steaming down there.

986
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,460
Forward march!

987
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,860
Well, it's about the size of Greenland.

988
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,700
Greenland is fairly large.

989
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,540
It's unusually slender, stretching to mid-town.

990
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,460
It's about the size of New Caledonia in the north, beyond New Zealand's sub-Antarctic islands.

991
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,500
So there's quite a temperature range, including into the lower temperatures for these land masses.

992
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,920
Another reason why they don't teem with life.

993
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,740
It also gives those insects even more...

994
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,260
I guess they would burrow in the ground under their bush and survive the cold.

995
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,840
This would be a great place for the, you know, folks like Prince Namor,

996
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,660
the sub-genius...

997
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,900
The sub-mariner.

998
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,720
The sub-genius sub-mariner, yes.

999
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,420
To be his kind, would love to live here because it has these nice rises.

1000
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,460
I'd like to live there just because the view is so spectacular.

1001
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,300
Of course, there are the sharks.

1002
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:40,300
You've been listening to the sub-genius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1003
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,920
For free information, write to P.O.

1005
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,140
Praise Bob!
