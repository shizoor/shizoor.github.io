00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:13,980
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,120
Welcome dear friends to the subgenius hour of slack.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,740
6-4 Mike affirmative left turn on 7 hold short of runway 3 one right to behind and be behind an eastern electra.

4
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,480
Tower 119.01 holding short.

5
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,900
Okay we'll take it.

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,980
Okay brother.

7
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,580
I'm Bob Zorn pretending he's best...

8
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:28,760
Oh yes dear friends and I don't want to do an hour of slack right now.

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,780
It's a...

10
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,940
I have to do these things at home and I've got a...

11
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,780
We're in the office I mean in the skyscraper and I just got up and it's Saturday morning.

12
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,160
And I think I'm just gonna...

13
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,200
I mean this church is supposed to be all about slack right?

14
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,980
So I guess I'm gonna...

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm gonna take this slack for a while.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm gonna do this hour of slack without any equipment.

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm just gonna walk around with a tape recorder.

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,680
And do my...

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm gonna go about my nice slack full regimen that I do every morning.

20
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,440
Read the paper.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
Eat a burrito.

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,140
I take the dogs out.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,660
You can hear the dogs following me around.

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,760
Tap, tap, tapping.

25
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,360
The guard dogs.

26
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,440
Two of the guard dogs.

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,640
There's a whole bunch that I can't take out.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
Let's see what's in the paper.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,880
Oh soldiers may have hit nerve gas in the Gulf War.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm gonna go to the...

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,820
The Republicans don't want Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,800
The anti-choice Republicans don't want that woman.

33
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,960
Kay Bailey Hutchison who I know is sort of a fascist arch...

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:58,060
A fascist arch Hitlerian crazy woman that scratches her AIDs faces when they mess up.

35
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,760
And screams in your face.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:02:59,960
And yells.

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,720
But she's not conservative enough for them.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,100
Well I can understand where they're coming from.

39
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,860
You know they want...

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,640
They just want less Big Brother.

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,100
Less big government in the...

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,220
You know in business.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,740
Affecting business and our taxes and things.

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,700
Of course they want a lot more.

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,780
The only place they want Big Brother and big government is in the bedroom.

46
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,900
In your personal private sex life.

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,820
That's the only...

48
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,200
You know in your mind.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,740
The inside of your mind.

50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,720
Your beliefs.

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,860
That's the only place they want Big Brother.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:44,660
They're not about to tell some nice innocent hard working business man like the corporate heads of Westinghouse what to do.

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,680
No man.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,460
This is a free country.

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:59,000
But if you start thinking certain kinds of thoughts about those tight round...

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,640
Oh um...

57
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,900
Well...

58
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,740
Okay I've had my coffee.

59
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,200
I'm gonna take a shower today.

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
This is a special event for me man.

61
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,900
I'm telling you.

62
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,880
You can hear that shower going in there.

63
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,260
But actually before I take a shower I should wash...

64
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,320
Wash the dogs.

65
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,900
I should wash the dogs.

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,540
Jesus fixed my shower head.

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,180
Isn't that great?

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,340
He's a healer man.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,260
It used to just dribble.

70
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,760
He took the filter out of it.

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
Now it's...

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,420
Fight.

73
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,680
It's the smitiest, most scalding...

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,920
The hell are my socks?

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,340
Well I'll just...

76
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,720
Let's see.

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,720
I'll grab a long one and a short one out of this hamper here.

78
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,100
You know slack has been defined...

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:50,640
In fact by Dad Townsend who runs this show up in Maine.

80
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
In Portland, Maine.

81
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,620
The Falls Portland.

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,720
He defines slack as...

83
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
Often times it's merely just putting on a show.

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,220
And I'm putting off what you're supposed to do.

85
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,420
And in this case I'm supposed to do an Hour of Slack show.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,360
And I'm putting it off.

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,160
And I am getting some slack.

88
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,400
But I don't know about you.

89
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,020
You may...

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,820
You the listener.

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,860
You may just be going...

92
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,880
What the hell is this guy rambling on and on about?

93
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,360
Why doesn't he play some music?

94
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,100
God.

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Oh alright.

96
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,600
This is Mojo Nixon here.

97
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,060
That I have never played this song on the Hour of Slack.

98
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,660
Put a sex-mo-chine in the White House.

99
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,720
And it's from the previous election times friends.

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,860
It's kind of dated.

101
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,420
But I doubt if anybody would play it then.

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,620
But it's been four years.

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
And after four years of Howard Stern and the new Disney.

104
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,680
I think we can get away with it.

105
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,460
Hit me funky dick.

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,320
Put a sex-mo-chine in the White White House.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Put a sex-mo-chine in the White White House.

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
Put the love up a ton.

109
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,980
Not the nuclear love a ton.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Put the love up a ton.

111
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,000
Not the nuclear love a ton.

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,200
They can't get no tan.

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,000
Put the love up a ton.

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,720
Tom Genau.

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,520
Not nuclear love a ton.

116
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,520


117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,520


118
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,520


119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,520


120
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:47,520


121
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,500
You've got to relax.

122
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,920
It just doesn't.

123
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,960
Jesus, it hasn't!

124
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,040
Don't you think he should have put a man before him?

125
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,040


126
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,360


127
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,860
It's not

128
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,040
Daddy's birthday yet?

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,040


130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,040


131
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,780
For the love of God

132
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,200
Let's go to the bridge

133
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,080
Get in

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,600
I feel it

135
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,300
Put a snake machine

136
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,700
In the white, white house

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,440
Put a snake machine

138
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,860
In the white, white, white, white house

139
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,120
Let me down

140
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,020
Let me down

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
Get your butt over here

142
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,280
I said, yo, fire fear

143
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,400
Get your butt over here

144
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,720
Bang, quail, can't get no tail

145
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,660
Mushy, mushy, mushy, can't get no pussy

146
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm the S-Office in the land

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,460
Gotta be a horny war man

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,600
Stop that

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,260
Step it out

150
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,160
Stop that

151
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,820
Moan, jump on president

152
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,020
Moan, jump on president

153
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,020


154
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,680
Moan, jump on president

155
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,760
Moan, jump on president

156
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,720
Moan, jump on president

157
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
Moan, jump on president

158
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
Moan, jump on president

159
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,080
Moan, jump on president

160
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,580
Moan jump on president

161
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,420
Moan, jump on president

162
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,580
Moan, jump on president

163
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,140
Moan, jump on president

164
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,140


165
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,140


166
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,880
We want monkey dick

167
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,820
Put a sick boy's seat

168
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,600
In the rock, rock house

169
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,280
Why isn't that lovely?

170
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,360
Oh, Mojo Nixon there.

171
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
Reverend Mojo Nixon.

172
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,520
He's one of your fellow ministers, friends.

173
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,200
Put that vote behind that love goat.

174
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,740
Yes, baby.

175
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,000
And I'm gonna...

176
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,020
We'll put that one away now.

177
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,820
Oh, wait a minute.

178
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
I wasn't gonna do all this work.

179
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,440
Well, the musicianship on that song, I thought, was most classical.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,560
And...

181
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,020
So, look.

182
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,220
Let's...

183
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm gonna surprise you.

184
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,740
It is time for us all to decide who we are

185
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,180
Do we fight for the right to a night at the opera now?

186
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,040
Have you asked of yourselves?

187
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,020
What's the right?

188
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,920
The price you might pay

189
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,720
Is it simply a game for rich young boys to play?

190
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,980
The color of the world is changing day by day

191
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,800
Red, the blood of angry men

192
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,880
Black, the dark of ages past

193
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,060
Red, a world about to dawn

194
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,000
Red, a world about to dawn

195
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,040
Black, the night that ends at last

196
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Had you been there tonight

197
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,420
You might know how it feels

198
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
To be struck to the bone

199
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,040
In a moment of breathless delight

200
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,720
Had you been there tonight

201
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,120
You might also have known

202
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,140
How your world may be changed

203
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,280
In just one burst of light

204
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,720
And what was right seems wrong

205
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,660
And what was wrong seems right

206
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,520
Red, I feel my soul on fire

207
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,920
Black, my world if she's not there

208
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,080
Red, the color of desire

209
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,680
Black, the color of despair

210
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,260
Black, the color of despair

211
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,740
Black, no I was born never

212
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:25,740


213
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:25,740


214
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:25,740


215
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,160
But why make involving

216
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,200
Such a

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,420
Mad child

218
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:41,260
Blah, blah

219
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,880
Meh, that was a princess

220
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


221
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


222
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


223
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


225
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,020
Who screwed up

227
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,600
A man's

228
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,760
inadmissible

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,720
F Hate

230
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,740
Up

231
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:54,840
What kind

232
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,180
Of man

233
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,240
Are you?

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


235
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


236
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


237
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


238
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


239
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


240
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


241
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


242
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


243
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


244
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


245
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


246
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


247
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


248
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


249
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


250
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


251
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


252
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


253
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


254
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


255
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


257
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


258
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


259
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


260
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


261
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,240


262
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,220
all

263
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,780
We're all about to lose,

264
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Laugh,

265
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,480
The night that ends at last.

266
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,320
Do you hear the people sing,

267
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,300
Singing the song of angry men?

268
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,220
It is the music of a people,

269
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,220
Who will not be slaves again.

270
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,360
When the beating of your heart,

271
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,100
Echoes the beating of the drums,

272
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,720
There is a life about to start,

273
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,900
When tomorrow comes.

274
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,040
Will you join in a crusade,

275
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,720
Who will be strong and stand with me?

276
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,600
Beyond the barricade,

277
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,480
Is there a world you long to see?

278
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,940
Then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free!

279
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,960
Join!

280
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,120
Do you hear the people sing,

281
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,020
Singing the song of angry men?

282
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,160
It is the music of a people,

283
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,640
Who will not be slaves again.

284
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,880
When the beating of your heart,

285
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,480
Echoes the beating of the drums,

286
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,340
There is a life about to start,

287
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,900
When tomorrow comes.

288
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,340
Crush! Kill! Destroy!

289
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,080
Crush! Kill! Destroy!

290
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,100
Destroy!

291
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,100
Crush! Destroy!

292
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,440
Crush! Destroy!

293
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
Crush! Destroy!

294
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,260
Crush! Destroy!

295
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,560
Crush! Destroy!

296
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,780
Crush! Destroy!

297
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,840
I whispered such ominous,

298
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,320
Slaying all across my path,

299
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,820
Abatting your fleeting hour,

300
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,460
And bathing you into the showers.

301
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,480
I'll push you as I will fly

302
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,980
I'll kill you and I won't die

303
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Destroy you, though I find a meaning

304
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
Devastation never leaves

305
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,180
Crush, kill, destroy

306
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,920
Crush, kill, destroy

307
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,680
Crush, kill, destroy

308
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,420
Crush, kill, destroy

309
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,220
There, friends, the original London cast recording of Les Miserables

310
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,960
with a guava.

311
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,640
And now I'm going to slack off some more.

312
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,100
Why didn't he talk about something religious?

313
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,640
Why didn't he have a prepared proper rack?

314
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,860
Well, I'm telling you, man, slack comes first

315
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,440
in the life of any initiate.

316
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,340
And, uh, yeah, I guess I'll walk those dogs first

317
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,400
before I take a shower.

318
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,480
Of course, that's been my...

319
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,200
That's why the crust has built up.

320
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,940
It's built up so large.

321
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,120
Okay, now listen to this, friends.

322
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,760
This is...

323
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,800
This is the moment that they've been waiting for.

324
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm getting the leash out.

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,600
All right.

326
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,680
Getting the leash.

327
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,240
Okay, they're getting impatient.

328
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,840
The big one is...

329
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,640
The little one says, hurry up!

330
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,720
Hurry up, you fool!

331
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,240
You're...

332
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,380
It's a hog time, isn't it?

333
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a hog time.

334
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,260
Quick!

335
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,800
Okay, got him.

336
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,260
All right.

337
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,560
Quick!

338
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:19,900
Quick!

339
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,760
Come on!

340
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:20,760


341
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:20,980
Hurry up!

342
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,280
Come on!

343
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,920
Right this way, you guys!

344
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,640
No, no, no.

345
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,400
Leave Jesus alone.

346
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,000
Come on.

347
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm over here anyway.

348
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,180
You gotta watch him fight

349
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,920
when I go out the door.

350
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,580
What?

351
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,480
What do you mean fight?

352
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,720
We're supposed to fight each other

353
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,780
when we walk out the...

354
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,100
out of the vault.

355
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,700
Let's go the other way.

356
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,520
There's a neighbor working his yard down there

357
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,860
and I want him to see me talking

358
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,600
to the radio audience.

359
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,060
Yes, it's a nice middle-class neighborhood.

360
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,200
You'd never know...

361
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,760
that inside that nice little middle-class house

362
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,780
with that nice garden,

363
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,540
organic garden, I might add,

364
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,160
you would never know...

365
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,340
Hi!

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,800
...that, uh...

367
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,920
that, uh...

368
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,480
there was an elevator in that house

369
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,220
that went down three stories to a cave

370
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,500
full of, uh, cultish materials

371
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,660
and statues and masks

372
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,200
and, uh...

373
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,080
and voodoo candles and altars

374
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,380
and tape decks and computers.

375
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,960
So the computers are the most unholy

376
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,860
of all those tools in there, I tell you.

377
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,100
The...

378
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,560
the Iron Maiden and the rat

379
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,900
cov...

380
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,780
cov...

381
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,260
provoke far less fear

382
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,520
in the Christian right

383
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,040
than do the computers

384
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,360
because the computers

385
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,360
can, uh...

386
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,100
get you through to a world

387
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,540
where...

388
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,980
where the man...

389
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,900
well, the man can be listening,

390
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,380
but he can't really do much about it yet.

391
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,300
Heh, heh, heh.

392
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Listen to this little dog.

393
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
This little mutated dog I have

394
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,300
named Puddin'

395
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,020
has, uh...

396
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,760
is into autoerotic asphyxiation.

397
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,100
She...she...she...

398
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,140
I'm not choking her.

399
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,060
She's choking herself.

400
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Oh, Beast is...

401
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,340
Beast is dropping him a...

402
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,680
a fine, mighty load of fertilizer

403
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,800
right next to this crumpled-up bush beer can.

404
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,780
Puddin' is trying to...

405
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,960
It's like I'm standing here,

406
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,500
and she is pulling as hard as she can at the least

407
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,040
so that...so that...so as to get off.

408
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,200
That's how she gets off.

409
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,880
She digs it.

410
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
If I went faster,

411
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,540
she'd just pull harder, choke herself more.

412
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,780
Uh...

413
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,080
Uh...

414
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,120
Now, this...this male...

415
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Beast, the great big one,

416
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,840
uh...is...he likes to stop and sniff

417
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,160
these certain places, and, um...

418
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,440
I look at it as he's checking his pee mail.

419
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,220
And he...so he's just like a person reading his mail.

420
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,700
It's like,

421
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,960
oh, well, what does this person have to say?

422
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,340
Hmm...

423
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,220
What? Why the sorry sack of...

424
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,060
Oh, I'll just show him a thing or two.

425
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,120
And then Beast lifts his leg and...

426
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,200
deposits his message...

427
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,700
his signature.

428
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,140
He used to deposit his signature on the wheels of cars,

429
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,560
which I thought was real smart,

430
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,500
because that would take his presence far and wide across town,

431
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,400
but he doesn't do that anymore.

432
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,060
No, that's somebody's flower bed.

433
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,400
Come on.

434
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,320
Okay, now the little one...

435
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,440
You can tell the little one's ready to drop her load,

436
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,900
because she...she starts sniffing around for the perfect spot.

437
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,640
It's gotta be just right.

438
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,360
There it is. Okay.

439
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,300
She hunches over, and since she's part dachshund and part shih tzu,

440
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,160
she looks like a toothpaste tube being squeezed by the invisible man...

441
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,640
as her...her torso sort of...

442
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,700
Oh, that's gross.

443
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,080
He was young once.

444
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,280
He had a mummy who tucked him in at night.

445
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,320
And an adorable little puppy,

446
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,340
called Puddle, the perplexed poodle.

447
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
Causers probably were a Nazi secret weapon,

448
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,680
but that was back in the 40s, when...

449
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,900
...when only you could get a shot for a tactic.

450
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,840
Too many UFOs piloted by Nazis like Errol Flynn from the center of the Earth

451
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,280
were the reason that the government withdrew its plan...

452
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,340
Maybe I'll duck into this disco.

453
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,020
...perfectly mixed by his life in a disco.

454
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,400
Look at that little dog go through those boos.

455
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,280
Not as good as a human, though.

456
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,280
Everybody laughs at him, but his disco's just...

457
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,440
...pint and shiver away.

458
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,960
Oh, you're still laughing?

459
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,500
Oh, fuck, old Bob, let me smoke.

460
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,040
You ain't nothing but a hound dog.

461
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,480
You ain't nothing but a hound dog.

462
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,860
Yeah.

463
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,160
You're a hound dog.

464
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
I can feel this beating down on me like a hammer.

465
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,980
I can feel that implacable foe

466
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,880
trying to get its nasty little fingers of mutating energy

467
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,700
into my skin to make strange

468
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,140
spots form.

469
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,340
But he wouldn't let it,

470
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,820
and me and Beast and Puddin'

471
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,520
we foiled them.

472
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,420
Ah, we're back punching the secret command code.

473
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:22,200
and in, and in, where it's, ah, God, the pressure.

474
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,240
We keep a special air pressure in here, and it's, you know, it costs a fortune.

475
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,780
Well, hey, all perverts laugh through their nose.

476
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,260
Oh, for Christ's sakes, all perverts laugh through their nose.

477
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,520
Fat perverted rebels launching away.

478
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,640
That's right, I'm the guy with the legal notices in the newspaper.

479
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,700
I'll give you some.

480
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,260
So I got, um, so I got my girlfriend therapy,

481
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,260
and then would you please someone else serve this guy

482
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,980
and start the normal process and a peaceful process.

483
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,200
Then I have my ketene in the newspaper.

484
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,680
Don't run to the 60s, 50s, actually, I'm 50s and 60s.

485
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,460
I was in a hospital emergency.

486
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,840
Oh, you're probably tired.

487
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,280
You probably want to hear some kind of music.

488
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,900
confused

489
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,000
Во-мо.

490
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,900
it hair Max

491
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,040
the

492
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,580
dead

493
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,660
tired

494
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,800
dead

495
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,320
tired

496
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,620
father

497
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,040
I love my Rubber Baby.

498
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,900
She'll never leave me.

499
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,940
I love my Rubber Baby.

500
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,700
She don't deceive me.

501
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:58,960
I love my Rubber Baby.

502
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,660
P weeks much better I'll pump them

503
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:13,940
kilometer far I get to feel what found

504
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,320
her I might forget her your

505
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:31,600
might mistake your Robert

506
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,600


507
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,520
Thank you.

508
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:03,840
Thank you.

509
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:41,860
Thank you.

510
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,580
The Klingons, at this point, I believe, they have a CD out now called Time Control.

511
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:19,980
And as far as I know, the only U.S. distributors of this CD are, as of yesterday, the Subgenius Foundation.

512
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:30,160
We've got about 24 copies of them that we need to divest ourselves of at European import prices, if you know what I mean.

513
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,100
But that's...

514
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,440
That's...

515
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,360
Where...

516
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,080
I'm stupid enough to think I'm going to let you get away with this, are you?

517
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,540
No, but no, we're not.

518
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,020
I mean, you wouldn't be stupid enough to pass up that deal after all we've been through, would you?

519
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,680
How humanity gained mastery over all the other creatures...

520
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,900
You mustn't tell them about the flat tire, because they're not my friends.

521
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:52,980
Friends?

522
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,680
But you're my friend, did you see?

523
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,900
Well, because I'm too stupid to give them a lead.

524
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,400
That's why I yelled for help.

525
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,340
You'll yell for help, unless you have the benefit of my seminar.

526
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,040
Just kidding.

527
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,300
Thank you, thank you very much.

528
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,080
Get yourself a good lawyer.

529
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,920
I have no time.

530
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,980
A stupid lie.

531
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,400
We were salesmen.

532
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,280
Flee we.

533
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,080
Grotesque prehistoric throwback or example of modern gigantism.

534
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,760
Mutation toward extreme obesity.

535
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,220
We won't ourselves punish our enemies.

536
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,140
And we'll visit a commune where certain elemental precepts are still...

537
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,620
You're lying.

538
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,140
Blindly, Felix.

539
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,140
Blindly as you say.

540
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,580
Felix, you have to be so stupid.

541
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,540
And you so naive.

542
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,480
We'll take a visit to the roof of a prominent radio station while we let off some steam, as it were.

543
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,280
And we'll see how coffee is brewed in a remote area, which some people don't even understand is actually a part of our own country.

544
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,920
Yeah, how about that?

545
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,140
And how would you like to voyage forward into the uncharted seas of the real estate seminar?

546
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,560
That will make you tingle from your toes to your crown.

547
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,380
I don't want to go to the left page, do I?

548
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,980
Yes, you'll tingle and quiver with pleasure.

549
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:15,220
As I lay upon you the story of true enlightenment in the financial world.

550
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,700
The financial body and the spiritual body are related.

551
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:25,960
They are fastened by an ectoplasmic umbilicus, reaching from the tummy of one to the tummy of another.

552
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,160
And these two tummies are intertwined with...

553
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,580
With financial solidarity.

554
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,320
I know it's not funny, but you know...

555
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,820
Why your spending habits are so erratic.

556
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,220
It is because your etheric spiritual double does not have...

557
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,960
Thank you, thank you.

558
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,680
Does not have a sound sense of dollars and cents.

559
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,560
Of getting and spending.

560
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
The real world.

561
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,460
Well, are there any questions at this point?

562
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,040
Now, no one is allowed to go to the toilet during this seminar and...

563
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,080
The video is here.

564
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm sorry, what was that?

565
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,440
The video is here.

566
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,120
Oh, yes. Well, we're going to watch the video entitled...

567
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,940
Man. Dominator over all.

568
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,980
Thank you, thank you. I'll thread it up. That is to say, I'll...

569
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,860
Even the unknown sea creatures.

570
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,380
The hippocampus duchulatus, or common sea horse.

571
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,900
The hee-haw of the deep.

572
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,820
Yes, the suborder thoracostii.

573
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,880
Thank you, thank you.

574
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,220
And order gastarothiiformes.

575
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,740
The family-synchonathidae.

576
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,540
Old hippo, the sea horse.

577
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,160
Yes, a trifle of a horse.

578
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,040
Yay!

579
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,460
Of course, of course. But whoever heard of an aquatic horse...

580
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,060
Reverend Stagg.

581
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,740
Yes, yes, Lord.

582
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,220
Praise Reverend Stagg.

583
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,840
Yes, I'm going to sit here and do this horrible labor of putting this show together.

584
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,840
I'm so tired of doing these shows.

585
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Reverend Nicky's here.

586
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,420
I'm here today.

587
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah. And Reverend Sivit. And Willa Dobbs.

588
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,760
Reverend Sivit.

589
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,260
And someone else. And Beast. And Puddin'.

590
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,160
It's just one big happy family around here. Just, happy commune.

591
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,400
Friends, I'm glad that this is the radio, because none of these people have their clothes on.

592
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,040
And it's a sorry, sorry sight indeed.

593
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,020
I'm the only one dressed.

594
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,400
I just don't want to make everybody...

595
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,180
The loincloth didn't do a whole lot, though.

596
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,040
It's only covering up one or two of your...oh.

597
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,560
Oh, oh, never mind.

598
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,040
A couple inches.

599
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,740
Come on, Sivit, we got work.

600
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,760
That's right, Sivit's got her new summer job starting up.

601
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,760
Where's my money?

602
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
That's my kid.

603
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,260
All right, I mean, you black-haunted men and women.

604
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,600
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher in Dallas, Texas.

605
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,460
And he's a good man, except that he don't buy me two glasses of pitcher's beer.

606
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,580
And I said, I love you, boy.

607
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,800
And I'm going to tell you, if I can't whoop him, I'll go down.

608
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,560
All right, man, if you can't whoop him, he's going down.

609
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,280
Answers to questions we cannot even formulate today.

610
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:21,280
People often ask, as an idle question, whether the process of evolution began with the chicken or the egg.

611
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,380
It began with me.

612
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Was there an egg?

613
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:24,620
Was there an egg?

614
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,380
Was there an egg out of which the first?

615
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,340
The first chicken came.

616
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,520
Or did a chicken lay the first egg?

617
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
Give up?

618
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:38,380
I am in a position to state that the first thing created was the egg.

619
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,440
The great egg.

620
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
The great glistening egg.

621
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,960
In the center of the universe, it gleamed and sparkled.

622
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,660
And now we jail them.

623
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,080
Its shells flung back the effulgence of the first surges of life.

624
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,560
In the young cosmos.

625
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,900
You know, they make a lot of eggs in Petaluma.

626
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,520
That's where I should be right now.

627
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
What I thought.

628
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,800
Back in the egg, I'm afraid we can't return to the womb in our rocketing ride toward the tomb.

629
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,440
Go back to Ork.

630
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,340
I'm stuck in Berkeley and I can't get out.

631
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,060
Now listen closely and I'll explain some cosmic wisdom concerning the dread albuminites, or, uh, the...

632
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,060


633
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:31,120
egg worshippers, the Bavarian albuminati who pull the strings behind the scenes today.

634
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,380
That is, if I can keep my sanity in this maelstrom of sound effects.

635
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:44,540
This hurricane of nattering voices that seems to drive my intellect and...

636
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,260
and run down endless corridors of hexapodal madness.

637
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,180
Oh, God.

638
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

639
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,940
That coffee's hot.

640
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,720
I hate the religious right, friends.

641
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,280
I hate them probably almost as...

642
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,920
Well, there's no way I could hate them as much as they hate me.

643
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,980
But... and you.

644
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,060
But, uh, sometimes I try to...

645
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:20,500
Well, I, I, in my mind, I distinguish between the religious right and your average, ordinary, everyday, every-man-for-himself Republican.

646
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,180
Which I can, I can understand.

647
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,040
And maybe...

648
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,740
Many, uh, famous subgeniuses are actually...

649
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,620
are what you would call conservatives, who...

650
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,120
uh, as the lesser of two evils, they usually vote the Republican side.

651
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,440
I know that seems strange to some, but...

652
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,360
uh, uh, you know, it's good, in my opinion, you know, that we have...

653
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,800
Father Joe Mama and, um, Philo Drummond are both...

654
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,380
uh, represent the anti-tree hug...

655
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,280
extremely anti-tree-huggin' liberal side of the church, among my friends.

656
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,580
I'm sure there's plenty of other people.

657
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,600
But I love to...

658
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,900
When I'm talking to them, I love to, uh, deliberately confuse them with the religious right.

659
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,580
It's like, well, I'm sorry that, uh, you guys want to kiss Jesus' butt so much.

660
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,240
Or rather, kiss the butt of Jerry Falwell and Ralph Reed.

661
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm, you know, aside from that, I, I...

662
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,220
I can see where you're coming from.

663
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,840
Uh, I'm...

664
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,120
I find it hard to believe that you don't sup...

665
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:31,040
you know, that you would rather have Big Brother tell people what to do in their private lives

666
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
than in their business lives.

667
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
And they'll go, God, give me a break!

668
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,360
You know, it's not like that at all, and you know it.

669
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:38,780
Well...

670
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,620
you know, you guys are jump...

671
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,720
you're happy with this so-called party that's, uh...

672
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,200
you know, that, that refuses to stop kissing the butt...

673
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,720
of the arch-conservative throwback Neanderthal redneck po-buckers out there.

674
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,500
No offense to my redneck po-bucker relatives, uh...

675
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm talking about the throwback...

676
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,960
well, or my throwback Neanderthal...

677
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,260
Actually, you know, the more I think about it...

678
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,560
Uh, we shouldn't get personal here.

679
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,940
The...

680
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,920
faggy, hand-wringing, namby-pamby, limp-wristed, weepy crybaby,

681
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,180
give-it-all-away-to-welfare cheater...

682
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,340
I think liberals don't actually make me any...

683
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,940
They make me happier only in that, uh...

684
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,920
in that I don't think they'd put me in a concentration camp.

685
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,740
Of course, I am a white male.

686
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,380
I could be victimized in the new pogrom, but...

687
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,560
I doubt it, not a... you know...

688
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
As Jaynor said...

689
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,680
It's true.

690
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,300
Old, fat, white men run the world.

691
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,460
But they're all whipped.

692
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,400
Ugh.

693
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,920
Hello, friends.

694
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,560
And welcome.

695
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,440
The sermon tonight is entitled...

696
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,960
Frightened of the Future.

697
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,440
Because the vast majority of folks out there...

698
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,460
are not only frightened of the future...

699
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,560
they're terrified of it.

700
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,780
They just know something bad is gonna happen.

701
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,880
And surprise, surprise...

702
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,980
the conspiracy is right there...

703
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,620
making money off their insecurity.

704
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,640
They sell us insurance.

705
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,360
And every single one of us lines right up to buy it.

706
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,120
We have to.

707
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,020
It's the law.

708
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,480
We buy car insurance, health insurance...

709
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,640
unemployment insurance, disability insurance...

710
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,000
social security, retirement insurance.

711
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,280
Oh, the conspiracy makes billions off it.

712
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,340
Never mind you that the conspiracy...

713
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,520
is most often responsible for destroying our health...

714
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
firing us from our jobs, or injuring us at work.

715
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,120
In effect, we pay the same bastards who hurt us...

716
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,620
to give us some of our money back when we're hurt.

717
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,800
It doesn't stop them...

718
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,540
but it gives us a kickback whenever they kick.

719
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,300
They offer hundreds of other types of insurance, too.

720
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,180
Everything from life insurance to property insurance...

721
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,900
to you name it.

722
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,440
Almost every conceivable problem is insurable.

723
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,280
Except one.

724
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,040
One event that the conspiracy won't...

725
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,700
and cannot cover.

726
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,540
That, my friends, is X-Day.

727
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,500
And it's coming July 5th, 1998.

728
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,700
You see, the conspiracy can't offer protection...

729
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,520
from an event that destroys everything, including them.

730
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,260
They can make millions selling it, even billions.

731
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,820
Because for all the money they'd acquire...

732
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,540
they wouldn't have to pay out a single claim.

733
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,840
How could they?

734
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,920
They'd all be dead.

735
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,940
Yet despite these incredible profits...

736
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,580
they won't touch X-Day with a 10-foot pole.

737
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,300
Why?

738
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,480
Because to even acknowledge the possibility of X-Day...

739
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,060
would be to admit that our savior, Bob Dobbs, exists.

740
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,760
And that their god, the conspiracy, is doomed to extinction.

741
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
Kind of funny, ain't it?

742
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,240
There's companies that actually insured...

743
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,180
Angie Dickinson's legs for $1 million.

744
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,420
And yet...

745
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,920
they won't even give us a penny.

746
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,740
And yet they're not even willing to consider X-Day insurance...

747
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,700
despite the fact they say it can never happen.

748
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,940
Seems kind of inconsistent...

749
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,020
for a business whose business is business.

750
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,760
But then again, just because the normals are idiots...

751
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,080
doesn't mean they're stupid.

752
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,880
They know which side of their bread their butter is on.

753
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,520
There is only one way to get X-Day insurance.

754
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,720
And that is through J.R. Bob Dobbs of the Church of the Subgenius.

755
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,580
Bob Dobbs, a salesman who could sell anything...

756
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,180
especially X-Day insurance.

757
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,480
And he's got an insurance so powerful...

758
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,880
that even the people who don't want it must have it.

759
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,240
Just in case.

760
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,760
Bob makes more money from X-Day insurance...

761
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,780
than any other product.

762
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,760
And for good reason.

763
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,760
Because it's such a good deal.

764
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,040
Just think about it.

765
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,400
A one-time premium.

766
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,160
30 lousy bucks.

767
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,420
And Bob guarantees you won't be exterminated by the X's.

768
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,900
What a concept.

769
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,040
Compare that to conspiracy brands of insurance.

770
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,820
With them, you pay more for less.

771
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,880
And you have to keep on paying every single year.

772
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,080
And the only way you collect is if you get victimized.

773
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,740
Pinks.

774
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,960
Pinks pay billions for Medicare.

775
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,200
But don't get anything unless they get sick.

776
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,040
Unemployment?

777
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
You gotta get fired first.

778
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,420
Social Security?

779
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,380
You gotta get old and infirm.

780
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,380
Life insurance?

781
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,340
You gotta croak or it's worthless.

782
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,660
Talk about a racket.

783
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,820
And yet with Bob...

784
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,160
With Bob, you pay practically nothing.

785
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,020
And that's it.

786
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,060
No more premiums.

787
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,460
No more hassles.

788
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,480
You get protection from the X's before X-Day,

789
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,720
during X-Day,

790
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,080
and after X-Day.

791
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,180
It's the exact opposite of conspiracy insurance.

792
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,000
You're not paid when something bad happens to you.

793
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,760
Because nothing bad is allowed to happen to you.

794
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,600
That's the whole idea.

795
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,240
To avoid all the pain and suffering in the first place.

796
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,380
And on top of all that,

797
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,000
you get slack thrown in at no additional charge.

798
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,140
And you're not paid.

799
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,840
Hell, that's worth the $30 alone.

800
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,100
It's worth millions if you use it right.

801
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,340
Yes, my friends, it's the best damn deal there ever was.

802
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,960
It's so good, even Bob's enemies take advantage of it.

803
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,860
Reverend Tilton, Jimmy Swagger, Jim Baker.

804
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,440
We can't say which ones have paid their $30 and which ones haven't

805
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,300
because that's confidential.

806
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,640
It's between them and Bob.

807
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,060
But if just one of them buys insurance on the sly for X-Day,

808
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,620
then shouldn't you?

809
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,160
Think hard before you answer.

810
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,400
Because July 98 is just around the corner, my friends.

811
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,580
And remember, the price of salvation only goes up

812
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,380
the closer we get to the end times.

813
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,280
By the time those saucers start attacking,

814
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,520
that $30 ticket could cost you hundreds of millions.

815
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,160
And that's assuming there's any left to sell.

816
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,560
If there is, it won't be cheap.

817
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,460
It'll be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

818
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,780
And you could forget about using that credit card.

819
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,060
No can do.

820
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,040
Cash, diamonds, gold, platinum,

821
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,320
that'll all be worthless.

822
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,300
Only bales of Havafrop Zipulops will have any value then.

823
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,540
Now ask yourself this.

824
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,720
Can you afford not to buy X-Day insurance

825
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,740
while the rates are next to nothing?

826
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,440
What the hell are you waiting for?

827
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,760
Stop wasting your time and money on those conspiracy panic waste plans

828
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,100
and get yourself the only insurance that matters,

829
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
the only assurance that matters,

830
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,900
Bob's assurance that he will save your life,

831
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
that he will save your soul,

832
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,180
that he will save your money and give you slack.

833
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,460
House insurance, car insurance, even life insurance don't mean squat

834
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,060
when everything and everyone you know has been vaporized.

835
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,080
Only one thing matters then.

836
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,880
You and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

837
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,740
Close your eyes and make a deal with him right now.

838
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,220
Go ahead. He can hear you.

839
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,480
Send him his 30 bucks and get it over with.

840
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,960
So that you can live like you've never lived before.

841
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,880
Because with Bob, you get something more for your money.

842
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,880
You get peace of mind.

843
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,940
Because unlike those normals who are out bumbling about

844
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,460
and don't know their fate,

845
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,380
you will.

846
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,020
And you will never again be frightened of the future.

847
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,460
Hearing is the word of God.

848
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,540
Praise Bob.

849
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,160
Amen.

850
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,140
So let's call lockdown full and the businesses that burn the stone.

851
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,960
See-through the news and the views that twist reality.

852
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,140
You're not fat to the sunglasses for better this destiny.

853
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,420
Landlines and power holes on my people, they took turns.

854
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,500
Just built a suit, die a knight and then watch them burn.

855
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,100
With the thoughts from a vile intent mind.

856
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,680
Hard line, hard line after hard line.

857
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,840
Landlines and power holes on my people, they took turns.

858
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,020
Just built a suit, die a knight and then watch them burn.

859
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,400
Burn, burn, yes you're gonna burn

860
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,360
Burn, burn, yes you're gonna burn

861
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:14,840
So, uh, see, we sent a bulk mailing out

862
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,380
about a week ago, and we got a letter from

863
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,500
a week and a half ago, and yesterday we started getting

864
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,820
Slack signed. People were getting those and

865
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,480
letting us know, and so far nobody's hated the mailing. I expected

866
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,300
to immediately get, well, see, the hate mail would come

867
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,680
in the mail, because the mailing basically is

868
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,820
not a hundred page stark fist like they want.

869
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,200
It's a half catalog and half of sort of a rant

870
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,220
about how we've decided to

871
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,840
sell out and make a bunch of money. Well, we've been, you know, selling out the whole time, but

872
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,140
it's rather it's time to screw the art and go for the bucks.

873
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,540
We achieved everything we had in mind as far as the art goes,

874
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,160
and it hasn't changed the world for Bob.

875
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,440
You know, it's netted us maybe a few hundred thousand ministers,

876
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,400
but nothing like the millions predicted in Dateline for Dominance.

877
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,240
And by God, to destroy the concept of money,

878
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,560
it shall take money. Vast, gigantic hordes,

879
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,900
entire treasures of money. And not funny Bob art.

880
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,460
No, sir. Money, pure power. Because,

881
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,960
as Chairman Dobbs said,

882
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,700
revolution comes out of the barrel of a bank account.

883
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,160
That's the way the

884
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,880
conspiracy did win. And they got it locked down.

885
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,620
But Bob has the secret code that'll unlock them.

886
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,160
From the inside, though. That's why we have so many agents inside the conspiracy.

887
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,380
I can't tell you who they are, of course. You'd be shocked.

888
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,640
You'd be shocked. You may have voted for some of them,

889
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,280
or voted against some of them at some point or another. You've gone to see

890
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,640
big blockbuster movies

891
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,900
with secret

892
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,480
subgenius operatives in them.

893
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,620
You've, you've, you know, you've seen them on MTV.

894
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,220
You've hated them because they were so rich and handsome and popular and famous.

895
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,960
Couple of them you've even hated because you thought they were Scientologists.

896
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,560
Don't you see? You see, we've got our fingers in many, many pies.

897
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,180
We didn't put all our eggs in one basket. No, sir.

898
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,500
We're out there fertilizing them eggs, as Jim Jones used to say.

899
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,120
Yes, sirree, Bob. We're gonna...

900
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,100
I mean, I think the Alm Supreme Truth Temple in Japan had the right idea. Yes, sir.

901
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:58,280
I think maybe old Mr. Rajneesh up there in Oregon had the right idea. Yes, sir.

902
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,240
Mr. Reverend Sun Yung Moon. Mr. L. Ron Hubbard.

903
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,480
Mr. David Koresh.

904
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:12,100
And Mr. Reverend Ivan Stang ain't no... didn't, his mama didn't raise no foo neither.

905
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,840
So, by gobs...

906
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,320
Anyway, I figured that some of the snail mail subgeniuses out there would go,

907
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,160
Uh, you, I don't want to get a computer and mess with that internet stuff.

908
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,680
That's conspiracy. That's free to conspiracy.

909
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,940
Because I read about that Bill Gates and he's, he's bad.

910
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,800
I can tell because he wears glasses and looks like a geek, Reverend Stang.

911
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,100
And, and, and, and I, and I wanted my real stark fist.

912
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,180
And I don't blame you a bit.

913
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:48,580
But, um, you're going to have to let us completely crush the opposition a little bit.

914
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,660
Unless you wanted to help.

915
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,100
You could help.

916
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,220
I mean, I know we got your 30 bucks, or it was probably 20 back when.

917
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,320
But, uh, you know, um, we do have CDs now.

918
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,500
And, uh, uh, quite a fancy line of subgenius clothing.

919
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,500
And, um, pins and gigas and tapes.

920
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,180
And, uh...

921
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,060
Weaponry and pills and, you know, all that stuff.

922
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:23,280
We thought about getting our 1-800 number, but we're not quite to that stage yet.

923
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,620
It was hard enough to be able to take plastic.

924
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,480
They don't trust mail order companies, my friend.

925
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:39,120
They especially don't trust mail order companies dedicated to the destruction of the, of the entire system of work.

926
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,620
And money.

927
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,880
Not that we're communists.

928
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,720
It's just the opposite.

929
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,200
Because that's just a more insidious, a much worse version of the same thing.

930
00:49:51,120 --> 00:50:09,100
We're talking about a change in human society so profound that it would make the new man and woe man look as different from the present man and woman as the present ones do from, uh, the australopithecus.

931
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,100


932
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,100


933
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,640
Of the beautiful African Welt.

934
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:17,340
As they threw rocks and cracked each other's heads open, sucking their brains out.

935
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,820
Uh, yes, we should...

936
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,340
It would be a new way, starting in two years.

937
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,140
For us.

938
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,840
Not for everybody else.

939
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,080
Just for the dues-paying subgeniuses.

940
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,020
And the ones that never paid their dues will...

941
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:38,980
They'll probably live a normal life span and get to torture the humans.

942
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,800
And the ones that live as gods.

943
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,100
But they'll be without Bob.

944
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,780
They won't have Bob.

945
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,100
And they won't really have slack.

946
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,480
They'll have power.

947
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,660
You'll have money.

948
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,900
Or what there is, you know, which...

949
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,000
Things more powerful than money.

950
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:54,820
But...

951
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,460
It'll all seem so hollow and empty.

952
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,700
And when you finally go to that great judgment, there ain't gonna be nobody there to judge you.

953
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,500
You're gonna be in a waiting room for the rest of your life.

954
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,040
Luckily, you'll be dead.

955
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,120
So you won't know it.

956
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,360
You'll just be, like, asleep forever.

957
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,800
That is the fate.

958
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,260
That's the best you can hope for.

959
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,300
As a subgenius.

960
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,860
Without that membership card in your pocket, friends.

961
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,200
That's the best.

962
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,780
Is an endless sleep.

963
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,620
In the waiting room that never...

964
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,460
Leads anywhere.

965
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,600
And, uh, me...

966
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,020
Well, I actually haven't spent my time...

967
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,760
I haven't spent my 30 bucks yet.

968
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,160
But I...

969
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,520
I've got two years.

970
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,240
And then...

971
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:48,500
And when the exes come, and I've spent that 30 bucks, I'll be welcomed onto the first paradise.

972
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,400
The one that lasts as long as I want to live.

973
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,800
And then the second paradise after I die.

974
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,200
And then the third one after I die from that paradise.

975
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:57,960
And then the...

976
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,980
When I choose to.

977
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,780
And, you know, so forth up the ladder till you get to the final punchline.

978
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,500
Ah, yes.

979
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,980
The punchline at the end of the ladders.

980
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,560
Where...

981
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,960
Where Bob finally reveals it to you.

982
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,900
If he can remember it by then.

983
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,820
So don't get your hopes up.

984
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,320
It's a long ways off anyway.

985
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,180
Infinitely long ways off.

986
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,320
Well, I guess it's time to mix this stuff down.

987
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,660
Probably yabbered an hour's worth.

988
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,460
And it's time to...

989
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,460
Turn it into a show.

990
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,680
Of course, for you, this will be the end of the show.

991
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,340
So...

992
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,580
Well, it's been a nice slackful show.

993
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,440
So far.

994
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,160
Didn't have to mix.

995
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,040
Just cut.

996
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,600
Praise Bob.

1000
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,260
Your friends at Amara.org

1001
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,260


1002
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:56,820
An 화나 drove inconspicuously really.

1003
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:05,740
Used such luxury pr務

1004
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,940
To promote his business.

1005
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:15,400
Ah, masters, if I could only lift up the phone and admit these callers to true enlightenment, I would.

1006
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:27,080
But it is an irony of life that one's ability to help one's fellow man increases proportionally as one's opportunity to do it decreases.

1007
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,680
Let's go back millions and millions of years into the past.

1008
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,240
The tape won't go back that far.

1009
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:49,820
Farther and farther back unwind the tape until beneath arboraceous fronds and palms, huge belching reptiles rumble their empty bellies.

1010
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,820
There's one.

1011
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,880
Yes, note the immense length of this brute.

1012
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,240
And with its small teeth there, it manages to honk off a few leaves from that tobacco tree.

1013
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,100
Now notice that it doesn't chew these.

1014
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,620
Or spit out the juice.

1015
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,940
It swallows the entire disgusting bolus, as you can see by the peristaltic motion of its long saurian neck.

1016
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:22,360
And down, down it goes, all the way down that lengthy tube until it enters the crop.

1017
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:35,720
Here, in this first of a set of stomachs, one of God's finest creations, enormous boulders absentmindedly swallowed by the dim-witted beast grind and crush the fern.

1018
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,060
Into a Fletcher-like paste.

1019
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:48,540
Then, the disgusting mass slips further on into the, uh, body of the behemoth, entering the stomach, which radiates an incredible amount of heat.

1020
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,380
Why, you might ask?

1021
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,140
Yeah, why?

1022
00:55:52,380 --> 00:56:01,920
Because the stomach of these giant dinosaurs is full of sympathetic, symbiotic bacteria, which perform the major action of digestion.

1023
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,560
After these giant stones have, uh...

1024
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,400
Oh, hello, doctor.

1025
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,040
What's up?

1026
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,200
Oh, uh, y-yes, I'm here. I can just see you at the end of my microscope, my boy.

1027
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,680
Oh, uh, yes, I'm here too.

1028
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,760
That means little color.

1029
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,640
Yes, it does. And little color, wax drop. And, uh, and Big Daddy, uh, thing again.

1030
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,060
Oh, oh, it's Clarabelle. Just a moment.

1031
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,380
Who's that? Who's on there?

1032
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:31,480
Ah, well, we've got Clarabelle here, and, uh, Hank Kisham, and, uh, Hank Ketchum, who draws Dennis the Menace, and, uh...

1033
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,100
Cut.

1034
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:36,020
I was going to, uh, describe the, uh, secrets of the...

1035
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:36,020


1036
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:36,020


1037
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:42,600
Life and death, and all the mysteries of time and space, as well as the secret teachings of all ages, if I can work them in.

1038
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:48,040
Uh, of course, I'll have to shout this over the, uh, the Niagara Falls of, uh, noises.

1039
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,260
There's that clown honking his horn again.

1040
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,040
That's, uh, Harpo, I believe.

1041
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,080
Uh, it's the ninth Marx brother, uh, Gummo.

1042
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,380
Lumpo.

1043
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,860
Oh, yes, uh, the one who had to be here.

1044
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,800
Lumpo, the realest Gummo.

1045
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,000
Yes, exactly. Forest Gummo.

1046
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,000


1047
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:17,220
Well, he's been very ill-publicized because the famous family of, uh, comedians never cared to bring this, uh, subterranean scorpion to the light before.

1048
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,240
Have you seen natural-born killers yet?

1049
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,580
Every time I go walking down the street in my neighborhood.

1050
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Why, they'd kill for a burrito.

1051
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,380
Oh, burrito?

1052
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:33,100
And so would I, when I think of the delicious morsels available at Taqueria of Vomitizma.

1053
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,040
Boink.

1054
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,380
Oh, someone imitating a synthesizer again.

1055
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,320
Uh, hasn't that robot revolution taken place yet?

1056
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,960
Did you or did you not?

1057
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:53,960
Dear friends, I seem to vaguely remember having played that little, uh, piece there at some point in the not-too-distant past or future.

1058
00:57:54,100 --> 00:58:01,120
It's hard to tell sometimes if we holy men get, uh, prescience and, uh, book learning all mixed up.

1059
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,740
You don't know what happened in the future and, and, and...

1060
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,260
And if so, what time it was.

1061
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,280
And, uh, but it is time!

1062
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,780
Yes, now it is that joyous time for you to take out that pen or pencil or just use your own blood.

1063
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:31,580
Uh, and, uh, uh, grab whatever, uh, skin you can find and write, uh, the post office box number of J.R. Bob-Dob so that you too can, uh, get a, a ticket to those selfsame escape vessels of the pleasure goddesses from Planet X.

1064
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,860
Come X-Day, only two years away.

1065
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,760
In fact, uh, possibly two years to the day by the time you hear this particular episode.

1066
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:58,180
And that box number is, friends, just write to Bob, you know, old Bob, your old friend Bob, at post office box 140306.

1067
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,380
That's 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1068
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,220
7-5-2-1-4.

1069
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,080
Uh, yes.

1070
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:25,720
And, uh, now that I've gotten this one slackful show done, I've got to do another slackful show because also by the time you hear this I'm gonna be partying down in, in, uh, uh, Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York for the giant X-Day gathering.

1071
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,860
And giant it does appear to be.

1072
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,520
Giant and threatening and horrible.

1073
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,740
Once again, that box number is 140306.

1074
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,420
Dallas, Texas.

1075
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:34,720
14-3-0-6.

1076
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,200
7-5-2-1-4.

1077
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:45,440
Email slack at metronet dot com.

1078
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,800
The calm of metronet dot com.

1079
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,400
Yes.

1080
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,880
What was Hal saying just now?

1081
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,860
I beg your pardon.

1082
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,280
He stuck his tongue down her throat.

1083
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,920
Was this on the Playboy channel or?

1084
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,120
He stuck his tongue down her throat on national TV.

1085
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,360
You were watching an X-Ray film maybe or a CAT scan?

1086
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:10,640
Just to prove that, you know, she is female and she is an adult woman and that he is attracted to, uh...

1087
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,420
It's incredible what they can do with special effects these days.

1088
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,180
He's the world's greatest reclusive freak.

1089
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:34,120
You know, you can hear a babble about celebrities on every station at every hour of the day and usually not on this show, so let us not give ourselves over to this unclean and prurient interest in the lives of others who can hardly concern us in our current perspective.

1090
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,820
Is Michael Jackson a subgenius?

1091
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,340
What an amusing suggestion, young man.

1092
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,960
I think the world laughs as it considers it.

1093
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,440
Is he too mainstream of a freak?

1094
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,140
Well, you know, uh, this is an entirely relative concept.

1095
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:56,760
I wasn't attempting to discuss the abnormal but rather the normal, the genetic paradigm which occurred at the beginning of time.

1096
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,260
If I could resume my sermon, I would explain to you...

1097
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,520
Thank you.

1098
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,980
They just don't take it seriously.

1099
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:03,980
No.

1100
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,980
No, they don't, but you can be the one who does and benefit.

1101
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,040
Benefit, exalt yourself...
