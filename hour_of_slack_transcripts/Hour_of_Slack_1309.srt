1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
In the next 13 or 14 minutes, something good, good, good is coming your way.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,800
So don't leave this radio station. Let's have a good time together.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:23,620
He's all I need. He's all I need. Ah, yeah.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,900
Hi, my name is Bob, and I approve this message.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:37,080
Bob's budging bullfighting. Bob's budging bullfighting. Bob's budging bullfighting. Bob's budging...

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,540
Things get too tough. Head for the safety of the self-genius, our own self.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,960
Bob having a party? Well, I can't go. I'm very, uh, busy.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,340
Well, wait, Bob didn't invite you?

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,620
No, but thanks for the heads up. I'll be sure to avoid them.

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,720
But I'm sure they're having a party. I saw them bring a keg and a lot of chairs into the house.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,880
Well, you don't know that they're having a party.

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,320
Bob's out of work. The two of them might be starting some weird old church.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
The kind of church where you, uh...

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,820
No, sirree, Bob.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,820
Bob. Bob. Bob.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,620
I live in downtown L.A. with my boyfriend, Bobby.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,400
I live in downtown L.A. with my boyfriend, Bobby.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,240
I live in downtown L.A. with my boyfriend, Bobby.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,860
I live in downtown L.A. with my boyfriend...

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,980
boyfriend she got up and followed him into the game room and pretty soon they

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,460
were playing pinball with Bob and getting really

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,860
oh yeah

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:43,480
sounds very important it is Mr. President what is it Bob I was wondering if you had that package

24
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:52,220
ready for me to take home over the weekend oh yeah the musical tapes yeah Bob and I are very

25
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,140
big fans of

26
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,360
you

27
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,420
all right let's just assume the killer is repeating whisper yes I have Bob calling

28
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,340
I'll have to call you back what tell Bob I'll call him back

29
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:20,700
the agent and Mr. Dobbs part four submitted by Reverend Teeters Laverge

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,860
Bob drove if one could even call it driving

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,240
for he never once had his hands on the wheel he appeared to steer with his knees but mostly with

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,940
another part of his anatomy that seemed to have a literal mind of its own at least according to

33
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,900
Connie Bob never looked out the windshield the whole time he was behind the wheel he had his

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:53,160
head sticking out the driver's side window nostrils flared to an incredible degree and his tongue

35
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,260
hanging out like a dog's

36
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm not sure if that's true or not but I'm sure that's true I'm sure that's true I'm sure that's

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,060
true he keptã‚½ãƒ¼Ø¹ and he and a unwittingly

38
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,060


39
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,060


40
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,060


41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,820
I myself had my foot pushed hard on the floor against a non-existent footbreak and my hands

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:25,900
clenched on the door handle Bob was constantly looking around and up into the night skies he said he was looking for them and p-sniffing he actually pronounced it p-sniffing around for the skunk ape a version he told me of the Himalayan Yeti

43
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,860
he

44
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,860
He said there were lots of them around this part of Florida, that they were friendly, but also that they had glands that contained a powerful aphrodisiac.

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,320
So either way, if you run into one, you are lucky.

46
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,880
It was not long until he slammed on the brakes and we skidded off into a ditch.

47
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,320
Bob bounded out of the car and started to run into a swampy area to the west.

48
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,660
I followed out of stupidity, for the bramble and the vines growing in the swamp cut up my legs bad.

49
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,400
I still had no trousers.

50
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,620
I should mention that Bob did not actually run.

51
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,540
He leaped and bounded more like a gazelle.

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
Quite graceful.

53
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:19,600
When I finally caught up with him, he was rolling around in a large patch of trampled down cane that certainly looked like the bedding of a great ape-like creature.

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,300
The smell was sick.

55
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
It was sickening, but it did have a strange allure to it.

56
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,760
Bob was in ecstasy as he rolled around in the stinking muck.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,260
Must be in heat, he exclaimed as he got up.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,100
Oddly, his clothing had not one speck of dirt or mud on it.

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,860
When I mentioned that, he just giggled and for the first time acknowledged that I was wearing no trousers, saying,

60
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,800
We'd have to remedy that.

61
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,300
Once we were back in the car, Bob let out a sigh that sounded like a big sigh.

62
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


63
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


64
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


66
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


67
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


68
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,300


69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,140
He sounded almost sad.

70
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,520
Skunk ape is one hot to trot yeti, he whispered something in a language to himself as he played pocket pool in his pants.

71
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,240
Well now, son, off to get you some trousers.

72
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,520
We had not driven far, maybe a mile to the edge of a small run-down town full of white trash, as they say in the South.

73
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,360
Bob's nostrils started to flare again as he p-sniffed about in the air and chuckled to himself.

74
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,480
We'd pulled off onto the side of the road next to a ramshackle house that was more down than up.

75
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,080
The incongruity was not lost on me, at least.

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,860
Bob, dressed to the T with his battleship-sized Cadillac, compared to this hovel we were now at.

77
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,480
However, Bob showed no sign of noticing. He simply knocked on the door.

78
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,300
Soon, a much degraded man of indeterminate age answered.

79
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,200
Bob, without introductions, offered to sell this man a haircut.

80
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,320
In exchange for the incredibly filthy overalls he was wearing.

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,360
The degenerate hillbilly agreed to the deal without haggling.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,860
In fact, I would say that he seemed ecstatic. He seemed to swoon.

83
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,460
The haircut Bob gave him was perfect.

84
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,460
He even styled it exactly like his own, using hair gel from a tube he had in his jacket pocket.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,980
Telling the man that, now, he emphasized, things are going to change for the better.

86
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,340
Though I don't know why he did that.

87
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:28,020
I did see Bob absentmindedly place one hand on a rickety wooden shelf and grabbed what looked like a government check.

88
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,580
While with the other, he regally handed the man a five-cent plastic comb, grinning as if he'd just done him a favor.

89
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,220
I don't think Mr. Dobbs is a thief, per se, nor a kleptomaniac.

90
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,200
He may simply not have control over himself and his desires in the same way that we normal people do.

91
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,340
For myself, I'm glad that I did not have to do that.

92
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,260
I have a mirror to see myself so shamefully dressed.

93
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:01,620
The standard jacket, tie, white shirt, wingtip shoes, and the filthiest, smelliest pair of overalls that could be imagined.

94
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Bob took an uncomfortably close pwiff of me and nodded his approval.

95
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,820
Hmm, now you smell useful.

96
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:18,320
Again, I must emphasize that this man is, by nature, uncanny and powerful.

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,960
He is a force.

98
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,880
To be either feared or harnessed, if that is even possible, and I doubt that it is.

99
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,320
I have a gut feeling that we may find it advantageous to adapt ourselves to him.

100
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,060
With Bob driving well over 80 miles an hour, we made it to the Cape Canaveral area fast.

101
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,940
By this time, I'd given up worrying and decided to follow whatever path Mr. Dobbs might drag me along.

102
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,320
For it occurred to me that, so far through all the experiences I'd been through,

103
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,500
I'd suffered little, permanent physical damage.

104
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,020
Mental damage, on the other hand, was possibly extreme, maybe.

105
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:06,200
I say maybe, because I think I was beginning to understand this incredible man and his wisdom,

106
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,640
if one can even say that Mr. Dobbs can be understood.

107
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,620
At least with our stunted minds.

108
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,500
Instead of the expected whorehouse, we drove to a large, modern factory

109
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,440
that was at least inside of Cape Canaveral. Bob said that it was one of his disembodiment stations

110
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,380
and that he had to go number three. I assumed that he meant he needed to defecate but was

111
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:45,000
drunk and misspoke. The factory, Bob told me, made a substance called dumbass putty. The substance

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,580
they produced worked in the same way as the child's play thing silly putty but was an utter

113
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:57,540
failure, Bob told me, because of the extreme toxicity of the materials used but I also assumed

114
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,040
because of its name. Mr. Dobbs did not lament the ongoing failure. In fact, he shrugged it off saying

115
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:14,060
something about a few less pinks, possible good mutations, and a huge tax write-off. This man is

116
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,480
sinister.

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,100
This man may be our only hope. I shall explain why later in the report.

118
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:30,080
For a toy factory, it had better security than I had seen even at our base X. Not only were there

119
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,860
20-foot concrete walls topped with embedded glass and razor wire, there were guard posts every five

120
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:44,980
feet or so, so that the guards could pass notes and pipes back and forth. Even Bob was ID'd,

121
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,060
at the entrance, which was more like the heavy gates that lead into a castle than anything.

122
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,740
He even had a moat around it with what looked like alligators. They, I eventually learned,

123
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,880
turned out to be alligator people, the cast-offs from one of Bob Coe's genetic enhancement

124
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,520
laboratories. This factory was like none I had ever seen. Sure, there were huge machines pushing

125
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,960
out some putty-like substance into large vats that, oddly, had stenciled on them, but they were not.

126
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:14,960


127
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,440
They were just the words, Tuna Surprise. And come to think of it, the food canning part of the

128
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,680
factory had machines with the same title stenciled on them. However, I was shocked when Bob led me

129
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,220
into a room the size of an aircraft carrier that was filled with the most advanced computers I had

130
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:41,000
ever seen. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of Nancy Reagan-y Davis lookalikes pushing punch

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,960
cards into the slots. Bob and I walked through the canning room, and Bob and I were in the room, and

132
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:44,960


133
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,100
I saw Bob, and I saw Bob. He was a little bit more of a cavernous affair, me with my mouth agape and Bob

134
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,100
with his typical grin. That is, until he slapped one of the Nancy Reagan women on the behind.

135
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,180
His hand bounced back, wrapped around his midsection as if it were made of rubber, and smacked him on

136
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,800
the back of the head. He glared at the woman and coughed as a key then shot out of his mouth.

137
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,340
He rubbed the back of his head as he picked it up, telling me,

138
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,240
Number 807 is a feisty one.

139
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:21,620
I thought I'd lost this key. It was the same key he used to unlock his office door. This time,

140
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,940
his office, in contrast to the other one I saw, was well-appointed and typical for a powerful

141
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,860
executive. Bob sat himself down behind a large desk and gathered up huge, neatly piled stacks

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:42,520
of paper. He then very deliberately laid them on the floor in two piles. One pile he dove into and

143
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,280
rolled around in vigorously.

144
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:52,900
When he got up, he smoothed his suit, breathing heavily. He told me that those particular contracts would be signed.

145
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:02,780
They, whoever they were, could no longer refuse them. Then he got on all fours and snuffled around the other pile like a hound dog.

146
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,920
Using his tongue, he pulled out a few sheets, undid the zipper on his pants, lifted a leg, and urinated on them.

147
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,840
These were the ones he told me that he had just signed.

148
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:23,140
Sure enough, as if an invisible ink were revealed, the name J.R. Bob Dobbs, Esquire,

149
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,900
slowly appeared on the papers, albeit in thick, childlike handwriting. Bob, exhausted, then laid

150
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:37,200
down to take a nap, but first making sure that he had securely locked me into the room. I could not

151
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,060
be sure at first if he were exactly asleep, for he lay down with his arms to his side, stiff as a board,

152
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,940
like a carpet.

153
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:57,180
I was sure he was trying to fool me somehow. It wasn't until he started passing gas like a snorer would snore that I took the opportunity to search the room.

154
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:10,980
The papers, I dared not touch the befouled ones, were standard contracts, though some seemed to speak of deals for human flesh, human souls, and unimaginably vast amounts of money.

155
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,940
His desk, however, was filled with cottages.

156
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:36,760
I was sure it was urine, for each one was labeled P.E., with a date and the initials J.R., and a little note, like, good vintage, a little salty, though, removes A souls, bad day, and so on.

157
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:44,640
One drawer was entirely filled with money clips. The one below it was filled with severed and

158
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:44,940
unremarkable pieces of paper. I was sure it was urine, for each one was labeled P.E., with a date and the initials J.R., and a little note, like, good vintage, a little salty, though, removes A souls, bad day, and so on.

159
00:14:44,960 --> 00:15:14,940
I was sure it was urine, for each one was labeled P.E., with a date and the initials J.R., and a little note, like, good vintage, a little salty, though, removes A souls, bad day, and so on.

160
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,360
Not with greed, but an animal-like lust, his ever-present grin wider, bigger, scarier than ever.

161
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,940
He pinned me there. His breath smelled like a mix between fresh paint and garlic.

162
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,820
His breathing was heavy, frightening.

163
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,420
He took one hand down and slipped the money clip from my limp fingers, saying,

164
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,900
This is mine. I gave the haircut.

165
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,060
This was the first time that I was truly afraid of what Mr. Dobbs might do to me.

166
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:56,280
Even though he grinned, his lifeless eyes, or maybe eyes too full of life, spoke of some abyss, of something that I could never understand.

167
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,360
He then brought his pipe-filled lips next to my ear.

168
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:10,400
The sizzling of the tobacco in it sounded like bacon, but smelled like some used diaper that had been forgotten in a defunct rubber factory.

169
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,160
The vomit rose in my throat.

170
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,680
He whispered, telling me to look in the forbidden drawer.

171
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,480
Having no idea what drawer that would be, I pulled a drawer out of a file cabinet adjacent to myself.

172
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,660
My hand rummaged around in it while my eyes were fixed to his.

173
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,020
I pulled out a stack of papers and pulled them close to me.

174
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,380
Every sheet had a few typewritten lines on them.

175
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,260
I tried to focus on them.

176
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,940
To my relief, they were all bad, very bad, one-liner jokes that you hear at cheap burlesque houses.

177
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,940
Bob glared.

178
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,200
He glared at me, his grin becoming sinister, or should I say more sinister.

179
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,100
Yet, I must admit, his gaze was hypnotizing.

180
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,860
This was the first time I dared look so deeply into his eyes.

181
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,760
Relief only came when he loosened his grip, chuckled, and said, if I remember correctly,

182
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,560
Seen my secret stash? Head didn't explode. Passed the test.

183
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,620
I leaned more relaxed against the wall.

184
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,960
I was sweating profusely.

185
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,780
Bob rhythmically nodded his head as if to some tune that only he could hear.

186
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:30,800
Now ye shallest gazest uponest the timelessest ofest the mostest gruesomestest of horrors.

187
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,800
Again, he tried and failed to sound biblical.

188
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,700
Yet, now I wondered that if truly the ancients in the good book did not speak with an affected drawl.

189
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,040
This Bob was ungrateful.

190
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,460
Obviously not of our realm as we know it.

191
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,920
Or he may just simply be semi-retarded and very, very lucky.

192
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,560
He ushered me into a room filled with junk that he called Bull Dada.

193
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,480
I assume, what with all the Bobco pills that he'd been popping, that he meant Dada art.

194
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,800
Seriously, it was junk.

195
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,320
Odd balls of carefully wound, used, and dirty string.

196
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,940
A newspaper and magazine clippings.

197
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,000
A series of male models.

198
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,940
But oddly, they all looked like Bob.

199
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,080
Poorly painted monster movie plastic models.

200
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,080
And greenish stone figurines of strange looking sea creatures.

201
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,300
Mr. Dobbs put his hand on my shoulder and gestured wildly with his other hand as if I should appreciate some great treasure of art.

202
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,460
I still don't understand his pride with that room of junk, nor what I should greatly fearest about it all.

203
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,440
It's still a mystery to me.

204
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,640
It was apparently time to go, for Bob, after wiping a tear from his eye, said,

205
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,860
I must attend to bidness, as he guided me down a long fluorescent lit hallway.

206
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:06,580
It was then that I noticed, in my sobriety, that he seemed to be floating a fraction of an inch off the ground.

207
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,960
That would explain the lack of dirt that ever sullied his person.

208
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,360
But it may also explain his luck.

209
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:25,380
I think he is too stupid to recognize his own mortality, let alone the fact that he's walking and that gravity matters.

210
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:36,260
So that just like the leader of that Russian pre-Soviet spiritual movement, Bulatavism, Bob just breezes through the act of living.

211
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,860
Never worrying or contemplating his next or any next movement.

212
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,380
Because he may be too mentally retarded to even understand it in the basic way that rules apply.

213
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,760
We came to a door that had the words, janitor place, crudely painted on it.

214
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,820
I sighed, thinking it was just another of Bob's ruses to get me alone, again.

215
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,220
However, when he opened the door, I was nearly blinded by the bright lights.

216
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,020
It was no janitor closet.

217
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,180
It opened to a huge research center that would put our efforts to great shame.

218
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:24,220
There were hundreds of men, women and things in white lab coats, all scratching away at chalkboards, squinting over slide rules, arguing, generally looking like brilliant scientists.

219
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:34,020
I have little understanding of zero gravity physics, but from what I saw of our quick walkthrough, these people and things were onto something big.

220
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
Bob seemed very unimpressed.

221
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,920
In fact, he pushed me along saying, I really, really need to go number three.

222
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,480
We made it to a sealed doorway.

223
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:52,260
Bob pushed aside a few feeble grays as he inserted his head inside a vertical toilet looking device.

224
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,740
He groaned with pleasure as he turned the pages of a cheap monster movie magazine with his toes.

225
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,000
I repeat, I do not know what he did with his head in that toilet.

226
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,260
I do not know what he did with his head in that device.

227
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,280
But I do know that he said, taking a number three is better than pesex.

228
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,900
Mr. Dobbs seemed much relieved after taking this number three.

229
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,040
He had more of his trademark relaxed self about him.

230
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:27,120
He even gave me back the money clip without the diamonds and cash and patted me on the shoulder like a benevolent father.

231
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,940
The clip did contain a piece of paper that in his childish scrawl said,

232
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,920
I owe you stuff.

233
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,160
This incredible factory seemed to have no end.

234
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,960
We wandered for miles it would seem with Bob either admiring his image that shone from his highly polished shoes

235
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,980
or flipping a quarter that always landed on its edge which he seemed a little ticked off about.

236
00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:02,320
Bob nonchalantly opened a regular looking steel door that led into a huge playground like room filled with primates.

237
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,580
These were no ordinary primates.

238
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,100
They all wore lab coats, business suits, party dresses.

239
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,080
Some even dressed like Harlem Hepcat pimps.

240
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,720
All these primates were most definitely busy at work of all sorts.

241
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,380
Equations were being written on blackboards.

242
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,420
Martinis were being deftly made by the females of the group.

243
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,260
The business ones were hunched, brows knotted with stress over little desks, scribbling away with fountain pens.

244
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,340
However,

245
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:40,640
every once in a while they would all drop their stumpy trousers, defecate and throw the feces at one another shrieking high pitched screams.

246
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,920
Bob said that he liked to come here to relax especially after doing a number three.

247
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,780
They know exactly what they do.

248
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,260
Bob made a gesture all too real with sound effects of defecating and throwing feces.

249
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760
I likes it he declared.

250
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,940
His grin got wider as he too jumped up and down like the primates mimicking their movements and voices.

251
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,100
He bounded around the large room amongst them in essence becoming one of them.

252
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,520
And yes he did defecate and throw his feces around.

253
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,500
But, but it made sense.

254
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,620
And friends that has been part four of

255
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,840
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

256
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:38,940
Written by an unnamed agent and submitted to us by Reverend Teeters LaBerge.

257
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:46,620
It goes up to part seven I believe and then another novel starts The Agent Goes to Dobbstown.

258
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,160
And we'll be reading from that later.

259
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,240
The music in the background is

260
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,860
from the Kenneth Anger underground film Lucifer Rising.

261
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,420
It's just a coincidence kids.

262
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,520
We might make deals with the devil but we don't believe in him.

263
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:23,420
Friends this show will like last show be partly composed of subgenius classic pieces.

264
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:32,040
From our old media barrage tapes and some new collages by the large and possibly others.

265
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:43,820
And some excerpts from Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence and the large calling in I think in most cases.

266
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,440
We'll also be hearing some of the rare rare Firesign Theatre material.

267
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,680
From their second and maybe third radio show from 1970.

268
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,560
Which all of which shows incredible pieces of work.

269
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,140
The inspiration for most subgenius radio.

270
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,120
This can be found on a book and DVD set.

271
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,540
The DVD has MP3s of dozens of their well all of their shows.

272
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,420
Their years of firecrackers.

273
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,640
And their Firesign Theatre weekly shows just amazing.

274
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,560
The book and collection is called Duke of Madness Motors.

275
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,280
You can go to FiresignTheatre.com or SealandRecords.com.

276
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,740
That's where Negative Land.

277
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,800
That's actually Negative Lands company.

278
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,120
And thanks to Reverend Taylor Jessen.

279
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,440
Who presented us with that.

280
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,020
Who did the research actually and got put the whole the whole thing together.

281
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,800
I guess some thanks to the four or five crazy guys.

282
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,280
And praise Bob.

283
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,940
And now this.

284
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,720
I understand them.

285
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,080
They don't understand me.

286
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,560
They are the normals.

287
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,760
They're all that I'm not.

288
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,660
But I'm a subgenius.

289
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,420
A whole different species.

290
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,520
If I had my way they all would be shot.

291
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,960
For when I was young.

292
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,400
The pigs ruled the world.

293
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,820
Now all that has changed.

294
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,460
Cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

295
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,940
I spit on normals.

296
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,880
Cause I hate their guts.

297
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,340
I am a subgenius.

298
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,840
I am a subgenius.

299
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,300
They like their jobs.

300
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,480
For all the wrong reasons.

301
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,720
They wear me down.

302
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,020
With their false holler smiles.

303
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,960
But my kind triumphed.

304
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,000
And now we will kill them.

305
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,100
Dead normal bodies.

306
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,360
For mile after mile.

307
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,940
For when I was young.

308
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,200
The normals held sway.

309
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,780
Now all that has changed.

310
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,920
Cause Bob has his day.

311
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,880
My shoe will soon kick a hole in their butts.

312
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,700
I am a subgenius.

313
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,520
I am a subgenius.

314
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,800
I am a subgenius.

315
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,920
I am not bitter.

316
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,240
For all they did to me.

317
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,700
They're only humans.

318
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,600
They're deaf, mute, and blind.

319
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,700
But I am a subgenius.

320
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,020
And I have a duty.

321
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,700
The utter destruction.

322
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,460
Of all humankind.

323
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,000
For when I was young.

324
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,320
The pinks ruled the world.

325
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,000
Now all that has changed.

326
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,120
Cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

327
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,380
Soon I will grind their face in the dust.

328
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,640
I am a subgenius.

329
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,560
I am a subgenius.

330
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,260
Thank you.

331
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,160
Oh mighty grid.

332
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,320
Give us the filth.

333
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,480
To have strength.

334
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,380
And patience.

335
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,420
In the face of that.

336
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,960
Which cannot be changed.

337
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,860
And to change that.

338
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,280
Which we must.

339
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,380
And to recognize the difference.

340
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,900
Between the two.

341
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,340
Here Tonto.

342
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,860
Have one of these cigarettes.

343
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,360
They'll make your mind go all funny.

344
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,680
Hail Boggs.

345
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,560
May he live in Denver.

346
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,140
How about we go to F. Scott Firesign's corner.

347
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,980
And discuss great movie screenwriting.

348
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,060
Oh sure.

349
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,420
F. Scott Firesign every week at this time.

350
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,240
I saw one of the films too.

351
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,680
You did?

352
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,100
What'd you see?

353
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,640
Solar Time.

354
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,280
Well here's just one I saw.

355
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,540
We just found Millie's body in the slough.

356
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,480
She's been murdered.

357
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,060
Where'd you get that mud on your shoes?

358
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,660
Maybe it is.

359
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
Maybe it isn't.

360
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,620
Yes it could be.

361
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
But it ain't going to.

362
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,720
You're wanted downstairs.

363
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,880
In the library.

364
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,360
A police matter.

365
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,120
The horrible way his face is twined.

366
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,340
Twisted.

367
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,240
As if he was paralyzed with fright.

368
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,660
I've been expecting something like this to happen.

369
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,080
Carry this atomizer with you always.

370
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,640
It will remind you of my power over you.

371
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,020
Here's some from a Danny Kaye movie too.

372
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,580
This is good.

373
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,360
I often bunk with Dr. Feeny during electrical storms.

374
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh Mozart.

375
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,120
I've got a copy like this with a radio in it.

376
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,320
A prairie fire of orgiastic events.

377
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,580
Look at that little guy.

378
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,480
He almost stepped on my hand.

379
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,080
People like that, well, dust just piles up on their hearts.

380
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,280
They'll spot you like a lead dime.

381
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,300
I thought you'd look like the rest of these squats.

382
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,740
Squats, right.

383
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,460
But we're not dealing with an ordinary criminal.

384
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,860
Now if you just step outside I'll explain the rest of my plan.

385
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,040
Okay, okay, Inspector.

386
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,720
It's your show.

387
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,360
I want a pit dug here.

388
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,140
What?

389
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,440
I think we're playing a long shot, but I think it'll work.

390
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:16,580
Yeah.

391
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,700
We want to trap him in that pit.

392
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,060
If it's human, impossible.

393
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,040
I want you to keep an eye out for that mummy.

394
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:24,880
Mummy!

395
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,700
Oh man.

396
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,340
How about a few drinks at the Chinese room?

397
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,580
I'll get to the bottom of this if I never see the back of my neck.

398
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,100
We'll turn this palace upside down and deal with ducks as well.

399
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,560
What?

400
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,140
Well, that's from the great Munchausen.

401
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,520
Yeah.

402
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,560
We'll turn this palace upside down and deal with ducks as well.

403
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,180
We'll turn this palace upside down and deal with ducks as well!

404
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,180
Bawtown girl, she's been living in her

405
00:30:54,180 --> 00:31:02,760
Bawtown girl, she's been living in her Bawtown girl.

406
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,480
I bet she never had a thought from her time.

407
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,520
Thoughts from her time.

408
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,180
Thoughts from her time.

409
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,720
Thoughts from her time.

410
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,800
I'm going to give these credits as fast as I possibly can.

411
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,480
Bob Town Girl just then was done by The Large.

412
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,400
Before that, we heard some of the Fireside Theater and Reverend Onan Kenabai performing his song,

413
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,180
I Am a Subgenius, that was recorded live at some ex-day of the past.

414
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,260
And now, puzzling evidence.

415
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,540
How come I'm not like that?

416
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,040
Yeah, what?

417
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,040
What?

418
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,900
Nothing.

419
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,620
Okay.

420
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,240
I was just looking out your window here and there don't seem to be any transvestites within the view.

421
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
I bet there's.

422
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:58,780
There's a tree.

423
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,360
The dew is back?

424
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
The view is back, yeah.

425
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,220
Oh, and the dew.

426
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,060
And the morning dew.

427
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,640
Yeah, the mountain dew.

428
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
One day rode high and the mules were gone.

429
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,600
Where's Philo?

430
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,340
Right here.

431
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:10,980
Oh.

432
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,100
Flower and tree.

433
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,780
Okay, you're Philo.

434
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,380
Go ahead, call her.

435
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,880
You're Philo.

436
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,020
Mary Day.

437
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,840
No, not you, Mike.

438
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,500
There.

439
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,060
Okay, that guy's Philo.

440
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,760
Yeah, he's kind of like a scratchy Philo.

441
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,660
But for sure, he's Philo.

442
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,660
What is going on there?

443
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,040
He's a fake English Philo.

444
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,840
Wow, he's English.

445
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,560
He's Igrish.

446
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,560
Mine says Igrish.

447
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,700
Speak English, Philo.

448
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,920
What?

449
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,420
Do Philo.

450
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,960
I mean, like.

451
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,740
Yeah, do Philo the right way.

452
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,080
Don't.

453
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,660
Yeah.

454
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,420
I don't know.

455
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,940
Too many buttons here, I think.

456
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,240
Yeah, that's Philo.

457
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,540
He's singing.

458
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,500
It's not the buttons, the elevator operator.

459
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,200
Oh, this is the part of the show, the last three or so minutes where we talk about Philo.

460
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,460
Yes, we're talking about the last temptation of Philo.

461
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,120
Oh, I couldn't watch the end of that movie, man.

462
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,900
Too intense?

463
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,220
Yeah, too intense.

464
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:13,300
With his giant overman head in the sun, that part, just carrying the UFO over the explosion at the end of the movie.

465
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,600
It was inspiring, though.

466
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,840
Inspirational.

467
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,900
Yes, I'm really into this music.

468
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,380
Where can I get the CD?

469
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,100
Oh, he wants the CD.

470
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,580
He wants the CDs, the CDOs.

471
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,120
Hey, hey.

472
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,460
Hey, hey.

473
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


474
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


475
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


476
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


477
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


478
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


479
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,460


480
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
Digital tapes, maybe?

481
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,660
Digital tapes?

482
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,240
There you go.

483
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,900
Now you're talking.

484
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,100
The virtual tapes?

485
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,180
Virtual California.

486
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,900
See, I got kicked off the air for talking about Philo.

487
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,620
In this dead, new day, I had dreaded eyes like smokey.

488
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,720
In his great TZ chair, the jet dives like smoking.

489
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,920
Piss your money away.

490
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,620
There won't be no rainy day.

491
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,120
If I will sell you all the sun, he's unlike with your old old one.

492
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,880
But he ain't no man.

493
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,740
He ain't no God.

494
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,340
I don't want to walk the path I've tried.

495
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,240
He ain't no man.

496
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,100
He ain't no God.

497
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,700
I don't want to walk the path I've tried.

498
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,520
At his desk in Dallas, dread dives like smoking.

499
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,780
Behind his mirrored windows, dread dives like smoking.

500
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,220
He ain't no man.

501
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,220


502
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,220


503
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,400
He ain't no God.

504
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,260
He ain't no God.

505
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,540
It ain't no joke.

506
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,300
aliment Ğ¿Ğ¾Ğ·Ğ²Ğ¾Ğ»ment

507
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,420


508
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,420


509
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,260
Just lift your sirrens, you babBC, whichever way you want to.

510
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,640
you know what you tå½± der

511
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,060
But it ain't no man

512
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,080
It ain't no god

513
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,820
I don't want to walk the path I've tried.

514
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,460
But it ain't no man

515
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
He ain't no God.

516
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:30,040
I don't want to walk the path of trust.

517
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,820
Yeah, so? So what?

518
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,100
So, well, gee, I don't know. I thought...

519
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,540
What kind?

520
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,800
Well, I don't know. I went down there and looked, you know, and I've examined all the...

521
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,680
What kind are you going to give me?

522
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,560
Well, I've examined all the models very carefully and compared the books and the...

523
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,820
Yeah.

524
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,920
The Road and Track magazine article in July. You remember? We went over that. Both of us went over that in great detail.

525
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,060
What kind of a car are you going to give me?

526
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:11,740
Daddy.

527
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,880
I was thinking about...

528
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,620
Pops.

529
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,420
A Boss 302.

530
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,540
It's corny.

531
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,520
You know, like...

532
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,200
I don't like it.

533
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,240
I don't like it.

534
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,000
It's got chrome.

535
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,680
I don't want...

536
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,360
Boss 302.

537
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,980
What kind of a car?

538
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,420
Let me hear a bunch of them.

539
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,980
Well, there's...

540
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,620
I want to have a choice.

541
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,200
There's the...

542
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,900
How about the Cutlass Supreme?

543
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,700
Well, it's square.

544
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,760
It's sort of, you know, 1930s movies.

545
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,140
Errol Flynn. It's got a lot of dash, a lot of verve.

546
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,880
Yeah, who needs a dash, man? I just want...

547
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,160
Well, you've got to have a dash in the front of the car.

548
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,860
Oh, okay.

549
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,280
Okay.

550
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,320
Delta 88.

551
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,060
It's got a nice 1948 sound about it.

552
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,540
Delta sounds sort of, you know, south, south.

553
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,500
South of the Delta.

554
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:47,840
Down south.

555
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,740
I don't dig it, no.

556
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:48,860
No.

557
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,240
Ah, let me see now.

558
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,940
There's the Duster and the Hornet.

559
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
That reminds me of the Depression.

560
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,700
And the Rebel.

561
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,100
You keep telling me about it.

562
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,760
The Ambassador.

563
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,420
The Ambassador.

564
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,600
Rebel has a nice ring to it, but I'm afraid...

565
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,320
No, I don't think Rebel would be good.

566
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:00,980
Javelin.

567
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,380
Javelin.

568
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,140
Javelin's got a sports image.

569
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,940
Ah, who needs it?

570
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,820
How about a computer image?

571
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,580
AMX.

572
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,760
Ah, come on, Pop.

573
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,280
AMX.

574
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,660
AMX.

575
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,160
AMX.

576
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,760
Wow, man.

577
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:10,840
Charger.

578
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,940
Chargers come in three kinds.

579
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,880
Three kinds of chargers.

580
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,300
Three kinds of really grand chargers.

581
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,180
The Daytona Charger.

582
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,520
No.

583
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,840
The 500 Charger.

584
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,100
No.

585
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,700
Something like the Eliminator Appeals.

586
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,480
The Eliminator.

587
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,100
The Eliminator.

588
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Let me see if I got that.

589
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,720
I got...

590
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,960
Why don't you get him a Humbler?

591
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,140
A Humbler.

592
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,880
That's what he needs.

593
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,660
A little Humbling.

594
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,020
Doris, lay off this.

595
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,820
A little Humbling.

596
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,500
What about a Swinger?

597
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,960
A Swinger.

598
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,840
No, I'd rather have...

599
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,380
The Chrysler has a Swinger.

600
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,960
I'd rather have a Red Melba or a Wealthy or a White Astrakhan or a Holland or a Yellow

601
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,460
Transparent or a Beverly Hills.

602
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,660
There's been a lot of interest lately.

603
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,940
And mysticism.

604
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,440
And mysticism, too.

605
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
And mysticism, too, right?

606
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,000
And mysticism outside, owing to the weather.

607
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,040
It's been a tremendous occult revival in this country.

608
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,760
You haven't heard about it because it's very occult.

609
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,060
Occult to us.

610
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,900
And I have an article here by Alistair Crowley, which is called...

611
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,340
I heard of Alistair Crowley.

612
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,720
Wonderful.

613
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,060
Wonderful.

614
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,480
Alistair Crowley.

615
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,920
What was the name of the dancer who...

616
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,800
Isadora Duncan, right?

617
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,760
Isadora Duncan once met Alistair Crowley in a small cafe in Saint-Tropez, and she put

618
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,440
her hand out to be kissed, and he bit her.

619
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,340
Right?

620
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,560
And she was in the hospital for a month with blood poisoning because he filed down his

621
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,940
two front teeth to two points.

622
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,000
She said, EnchantÃ©, and he bit her.

623
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Well, he didn't have a dog.

624
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,720
That's right.

625
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,640
EnchantÃ©.

626
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:39,960
Delicious.

627
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,700
Delicious.

628
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,080
Right.

629
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,720
Ginsberg.

630
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,920
Bon Appetit.

631
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,200
Martha Graham.

632
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Both cable cleared of dead jumpers.

633
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,420
You're normally such a slacker.

634
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,340
It's the first time you've heard of them.

635
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,160
Are all four of you guys in here?

636
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,800
Is Phil in there?

637
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,460
He just...

638
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:50,720
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,220
Can we...

640
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,360
Do it with four?

641
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,020
Yeah, all four.

642
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,560
Okay.

643
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,120
What are we doing?

644
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:54,560
How do we...

645
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,920
This is...

646
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,760
This is...

647
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,120
Oh, yeah.

648
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,860
They'll do the comedy.

649
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,560
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater.

650
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,380
Okay.

651
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,400
This is Phil.

652
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:03,960
Phil.

653
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,460
Let's take it again.

654
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,840
Oh, Pete and Dave.

655
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,420
Okay, there we go.

656
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,560
Yeah.

657
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,180
All right.

658
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,700
You over here?

659
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,720
You just shut up.

660
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,040
This is Phil.

661
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,380
Phil.

662
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:11,820
Pete.

663
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,120
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

664
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,900
And we're listening to...

665
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,080
The Hour.

666
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,260
The Hour of Slack.

667
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,600
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

668
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,340
Because we're subgeniuses.

669
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,680
And we're slacking off.

670
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,680
Bomb is a football.

671
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,000
Bomb is a basketball.

672
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,340
Basketball.

673
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,140
Bob is a rugby ball.

674
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,340
And Bob is a golf ball.

675
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,660
There's a fella down in Texas.

676
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,320
They say his name is Bob.

677
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,160
He tells me I should slap God.

678
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,380
I should quit my job.

679
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,120
Well, I should quit my job.

680
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,260
Well, I'm a subgenius.

681
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,780
And I must have my slack.

682
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,900
If I don't live forever.

683
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,080
I get my money back.

684
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,600
They said that on July 5th of 1998.

685
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,560
The earth would meet destruction.

686
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,840
Wow.

687
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,440
You see.

688
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,960
Anyone can championship against me.

689
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,620
But when things end up fighting for myself.

690
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,100
I don't got you involved.

691
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


692
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


693
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


694
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


695
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


696
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


697
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


698
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


699
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


700
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


701
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


702
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


703
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


704
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


705
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


706
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


707
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


708
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


709
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


710
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


711
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


712
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


713
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


714
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


715
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


716
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


717
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


718
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


719
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


720
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


721
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


722
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


723
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


724
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


725
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


726
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


727
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


728
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


729
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


730
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


731
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


732
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


733
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


734
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


735
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,100


736
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,380
Obama.

737
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:22,480
If I don't live forever, I get my money back.

738
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:32,700
Poor Stang was made to suffer a terrible disgrace.

739
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:41,440
Of such humiliation, he feared to show his face.

740
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:50,700
Now Bob may be laughing because we are such chumps.

741
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,400
But there is no reason to be down in the dumps.

742
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,780
It'll all still happen, no need to curse or frown.

743
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,220
They got all the right numbers.

744
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,300
Just got them upside down.

745
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,840
Well, I'm a subgenius.

746
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,560
And I must tell my slack.

747
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:31,600
If I don't live forever, I get my money back.

748
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,860
Nen-slo did that.

749
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,180
There's a feller down in Texas.

750
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,540
I believe that was recorded at one of the very few good Portland divivals.

751
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,100
Maybe even Seattle.

752
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,360
It was one of the rare good ones.

753
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:04,320
Before that, the song Bob is a rock is by our old, old, old friend, Glass Madness.

754
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,200
The Fire Science Theater was heard before that from their collection, Duke of Madness Motor.

755
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,420
And it was a great song.

756
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,420


757
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,420


758
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,420


759
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:20,220
and Dread Dobbs, the reggae song was by Lost Souls Incorporated of Dallas

760
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,820
many, many a year ago.

761
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:29,000
And now, back, thanks to the large, to puzzling evidence.

762
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:30,260
Go.

763
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,220
Okay, go, go, go. It's the aqueduct, actually.

764
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,040
Go and do likewise. Oh, the aqueduct is so useful.

765
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:45,120
They always, in the old days, when we were kids, they always had the picture of the aqueduct in the dictionary.

766
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,140
That's true.

767
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,740
So you know it's important.

768
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,040
Well, in your high school Latin book, there was a picture of an aqueduct on every other page.

769
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,480
It looked like.

770
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,360
Yeah, exactly.

771
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,080
And some old runes.

772
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,460
Yes, and now you have to translate the,

773
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,040
Sailors saw the slave girls in the plain.

774
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,860
Okay, he's translating now.

775
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,560
Oh, and there are new,

776
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,020
Oh, he's translating now.

777
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,720
vocabulary words also that you have to pick up at the end of the hour.

778
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,560
Okay, we'll add those.

779
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,660
And then this should all be figured out by Ask Dr. Hal at 10 o'clock tonight.

780
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,700
Here we go.

781
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,900
Radio Valencia, where we'll all be meeting again on the computer.

782
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,680
Britannia est insula.

783
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,280
Oh.

784
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,940
Italia, pine insula est.

785
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
Wow, I'm going to have to take this home and work on it.

786
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,260
Okay.

787
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,440
Can't quite get the hang of it.

788
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,900
It sounds almost familiar, but it's mighty tough.

789
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,180
It might be radioactive, like just about everything else on the planet, man.

790
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,360
Well, it's that radiation exposure is cumulative.

791
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,300
I don't remember what you're talking about.

792
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,620
It's gasly mutants and giant insects.

793
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,700
So I get to go back to my book about the shooting of Moscone and milk.

794
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,000
Really? Is that where you are now?

795
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,380
Well, I'm actually reading the Lawrence Heroes.

796
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,340
So, too good for Abraham Lincoln these days, eh?

797
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,220
I had to pick it up because it's about this, the lesser known,

798
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,420
the connection between the two.

799
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,920
Between Margot St. James and Mayor Moscone.

800
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,180
Well, tell me this.

801
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,580
Margot being my cousin, and so she had explained it.

802
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,460
That's why she left town.

803
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,280
But Moscone was shot.

804
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,420
She moved to France for a while.

805
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:24,660
She left town because Dianne Feinstein made it so uncomfortable for her

806
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,580
and her other people in the Victoria Woodhull Foundation.

807
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,800
More than that, a mysterious fire destroyed the foundation's headquarters.

808
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,540
That's right.

809
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,400
That's right.

810
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,640
And now we're getting dicey in that prison.

811
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,820
Not only that, isn't it true, as long as we're discussing this,

812
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,680
that a maniac named Jesus Christ Satan grabbed her and threw her down the stairs,

813
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,800
causing her to be injured?

814
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:50,720
Yes.

815
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,900
Things were getting strange in the old days.

816
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,600
But years later, she came back.

817
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
Well, she lives in Washington.

818
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,360
She came back to marry another cousin, Paul Avery.

819
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,040
Remain close.

820
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,120
And they lived together quite happily.

821
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,480
And then when he died in 2000,

822
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,840
she was brought to her native state of Washington.

823
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,320
And this guy thinks he's doing show on the show.

824
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,300
Yes, that's right.

825
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,840
Well, let's do some.

826
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,140
We only have seconds to go here.

827
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:16,960
Still life.

828
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,060
After all.

829
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,840
Before the next one comes and wipes away the horrible memory of this bro.

830
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Case closed.

831
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,660
Oh, come on.

832
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,180
I left my GPS in my home.

833
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:30,960
Really?

834
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,440
So we can't follow you right now?

835
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,380
Oh, I think I'm...

836
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,080
You missed that old system.

837
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,800
Remember, we used to be able to do look down on the listeners' houses.

838
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,220
That's true.

839
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,520
We have the snooper scope and all sorts of high-tech devices,

840
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,560
which have simply gotten a little bit out of order.

841
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,820
Is that GPS thing?

842
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,640
It takes a specialist to fix this stuff.

843
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,560
I don't begin to be able to understand how it works.

844
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,980
These doohickeys and contraptions are more confusing than a maze.

845
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,540
Oh, what?

846
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,220
Oh, it seems to be starting.

847
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,600
It's starting on its own.

848
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,720
It's a movie starting, man.

849
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,000
Come on.

850
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,800
It's an artificial intelligence.

851
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,400
It's an intelligent system.

852
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,780
All this and rutabaga stew.

853
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:25,420
A warm, heartwarming tale of a large Quaker family engulfed in a volcano, an earthquake,

854
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,860
and a mix-up that'll keep you laughing for hours.

855
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,580
All in Technicolor VistaVision.

856
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:35,960
VistaVision.

857
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,060
VistaVision.

858
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,320
VistaVision.

859
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,380
VistaVision.

860
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:38,380


861
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:38,380


862
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:38,380


863
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,320
CinemaScope.

864
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,780
Regascope.

865
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,200
Dynamation.

866
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,780
And Dynorama.

867
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,100
The new miracle of the screen.

868
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,480
You'll thrill to sights never seen before.

869
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,140
And hear the wonderful songs.

870
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,940
Sung by thousands of chorus girls.

871
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,900
Oh, he's gonna pop.

872
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,540
He missed it.

873
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,060
Better pump some air to that boy.

874
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,980
Let's get out of here before he finds out we did that.

875
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,360
All right, I'm going to get in the front row and...

876
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,620
We'll be right back.

877
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,820
I'm sick, but I'm well again.

878
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,340
It's not dark like it was.

879
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,240
The lights are coming.

880
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,760
It's coming like the boyhood days that crept into the windows of the old house.

881
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,940
You've been dreaming, Ruff.

882
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,860
The fever ain't out in your head yet.

883
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,320
Dreaming?

884
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,940
Twant, twant all dreams.

885
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:21,720
Take it easy.

886
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,560
It's a light coming, Part.

887
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,160
I see them all playing.

888
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,240
There's the old man looking white and awful just as he looked the morning he drove me from home.

889
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,620
That woman behind him stretching out her arms after me.

890
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,320
She's the best mother in the world.

891
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,740
Don't you see them, Part?

892
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,180
You're flighty, Ruff.

893
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,940
It's all dark.

894
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,080
Except the pine knot flickering in the air.

895
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,060
The lights are coming.

896
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,640
Brighter and brighter.

897
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:40,860
Look.

898
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,300
Look, it's beaming over the range.

899
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,340
Bright and gentle like the smile that used to be over me when my head laid in my mother's lap long ago.

900
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,180
Come on, now.

901
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,460
Here's a little brandy, Ruff.

902
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:48,800
Oh, no.

903
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,400
There.

904
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,240
I've seen it, though my eyes are dim.

905
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,300
Somehow.

906
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,620
Here, Ruff.

907
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,300
Never, Part.

908
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,860
That stuff spiled the best years of my life.

909
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,900
It shan't spile my dreams of them.

910
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,560
Ah, such dreams, Part.

911
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,140
They take me to the old home again.

912
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,000
I see the White House.

913
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,980
Among the trees.

914
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,920
I smell the breath of the apples of blossom.

915
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,120
And hear the birds a-singing and the bees a-humming.

916
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,440
The old plow songs echoing over the little valley.

917
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,440
I see the river winding through the millers and sycamores.

918
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,700
The dear old hills all around.

919
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,780
Pining up to heaven like the spires of Big Newton House.

920
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,840
There's old Rockwood called the Tea Table.

921
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,640
Climb up on it and play happy boy again.

922
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,420
Oh, if I'd only stayed there, Part.

923
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,180
That's dope.

924
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,000
That's rock.

925
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,240
That's rock.

926
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,960
You thaw me all out talking to that.

927
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,600
Makes me womanish.

928
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,480
That's it, Part.

929
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:43,840
Womanish.

930
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,920
We kept our hearts froze so long we wanted all this winter.

931
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,440
Yeah, yeah.

932
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,220
But the summer comes back with all the lights from over the range.

933
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,460
Yeah, yeah.

934
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,040
Look at me, Part.

935
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,820
How bright it is, Part.

936
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,540
Look, look.

937
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,320
Let me put my arm around you.

938
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,100
Hold your tie.

939
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,280
How it floods the cabin to the nuts and cobwebs are plainer than day.

940
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,140
Something's wrong, Ruff.

941
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,060
It's all dark.

942
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,000
Except only the pine knot up there in the chimney.

943
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,340
No, it's all right, Part.

944
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:06,700
Yeah.

945
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,640
The lights come over the range.

946
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:08,980
Yeah.

947
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,600
What, Part?

948
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,380
I can see better than ever I could.

949
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:11,720
Yeah.

950
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,940
I can see the moisture in your eyes, Part.

951
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,200
I've got a bit of moisture.

952
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,560
You see the crooked path I've come running clean back to my mother's knee.

953
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,680
Mother's knee, that's it.

954
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,280
I wasn't always called Ruff.

955
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,900
Somebody used to kiss and call me her boy.

956
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,240
My boy.

957
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,680
Nobody you'll ever know.

958
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,560
I've kept it to the end.

959
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,460
Kept what?

960
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,740
Whatever that means.

961
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,260
Get your hands out of your pants.

962
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,420
I've wanted to ax you, mate.

963
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,060
So I think I'll do it.

964
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,840
The end of day.

965
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,280
Letting once in a while and internalizing.

966
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,280


967
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,280


968
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,280


969
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,300
left wheel.

970
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,300


971
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,300


972
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,480
That means we run producers.

973
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:23,480


974
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:23,480


975
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:23,480


976
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:23,480


977
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,600
ã„·ã„·urchuizing

978
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:26,720
Morsi Kitchen and...

979
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,560
Ah, yes, dear friends, that little instrumental there was by Reverend Sodi

980
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,040
from his collection, Music for Imaginary Monster Movies.

981
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,040
Before that, the end of the day was from Fireside Theater Radio Hour, hour number one.

982
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:05,660
You are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius,

983
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:14,860
subgenius.com, post office box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

984
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:21,680
And now, our oldest old friend, G. Gordon.

985
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,700
Thank you.

986
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:30,400
Are we then to understand that when Bob says we must learn to pull the wool over our own eyes,

987
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,360
that he is merely abetting an insidious form of self-delusion?

988
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,700
Is he saying that we shouldn't even look for the truth?

989
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,660
Is Bob saying, like Heisenberg did 40-odd years ago,

990
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,900
that we can never know what the hell is really going on?

991
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,540
I think not.

992
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,320
Bob, however, is cognizant of the fact that besides the shabby little lies we feed ourselves

993
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,420
from day to day as we struggle to cope with technoboredom,

994
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,280
we're all being force-fed a gross pablum of our truths,

995
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,880
sensationalized statistics and downright propaganda

996
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,780
by a vast monolithic network operated by and for the conspiracy.

997
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,840
Through such deception, the conspiracy is daily cheating us all out of our life essence,

998
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,820
our money, our health, and most important of all, our slack.

999
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,140
That's right, our slack.

1000
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,380
They draw it off like vampires in the night.

1001
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,020
They are pulling the wool over our eyes, constantly.

1002
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,680
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons,

1003
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,280
let us do it to ourselves for our own reasons.

1004
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,000
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

1005
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,340
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.

1006
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,140
Some ways are fun.

1007
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,920
For many of us, there is no physical escape from there.

1008
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,080
There is no hope of it until the exorcists come and the followers of Yahweh one prevail.

1009
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,240
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

1010
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,200
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

1011
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,160
This allows us to control our own reality,

1012
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,780
gives us the clarity of perspective to be able to sit back and look at it all,

1013
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,360
and I mean all, and simply say fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1014
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,020
Then and only then we'll slow down and we'll be able to see the truth.

1015
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,020


1016
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,820
And that's when the black begins to drop gently like a soothing dew into our tortured lives.

1017
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,540
After all, it should be every person's choice to curse God and die if that is what they wish.

1018
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,820
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods, did we not create them?

1019
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,140
Where indeed would Yahweh own be without the human race to torment and pester?

1020
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,800
I'll put it to you, the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

1021
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,360
if there was nothing more entertaining than cherubims and seraphims and numby-pumby flaming angels

1022
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,020
sitting around up there on down there,

1023
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,020


1024
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,340
damp clouds and arcing and trumpeting all 24 hours a bloody day,

1025
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,480
and you can bank on that.

1026
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,960
Why should we be any different to that?

1027
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,460
Why shouldn't our lives be more entertaining and more real

1028
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,680
than any glowing three-coloured phosphor image on the television screen?

1029
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,520
Why shouldn't we grab reality by the throat and shake it until it does what we want it to,

1030
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,140
until once again we find slack?

1031
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,380
Just as the primitive fire walkers of Ceylon can deny a reality in which fire burns,

1032
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,680
and thus paths unscathed across white-hot stones,

1033
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,120
so can the subgenius deny the existence of a world without slack

1034
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,960
and cast out the false prophets and the paintboys.

1035
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,240
All it requires is faith.

1036
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Faith in Bob and faith in ourselves.

1037
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,780
Are we not the dreamers of the dream,

1038
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,100
and is all that is within that dream not ourselves?

1039
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,120
Life is no more than a brief illusion,

1040
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,720
a flickering real-time movie in the theatre of our minds,

1041
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,360
and if you don't like the dream,

1042
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,580
and don't like the way your movie is going,

1043
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,040
perhaps you better ask yourself why not.

1044
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,440
After all, it is your movie,

1045
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,300
and despite what anyone else may have told you,

1046
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,440
you are the director as well as the protagonist.

1047
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,540
Ah, yes, yes, yes, so beautiful from G. Gordon Gordon.

1048
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:20,160
And we'll now leave you with this very ear-hurting collage

1049
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,200
by Outmouth.

1050
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,900
Praise Bob.

1051
