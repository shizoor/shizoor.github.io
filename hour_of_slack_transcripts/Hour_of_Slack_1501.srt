1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm completing the removal of propaganda signs on both sides of deprived Florida.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:14,080
The American Bar Association has passed a resolution supporting less money for college than ever before in 2003.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,440
PR is bad.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,720
North and South Korea successfully tested a hotline today aimed at helping to avoid PR News in Washington.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,380
Attention, men.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,220
Attention.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,220
The following new men report to the dispensary for shots.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,020
I like to laugh, do you?

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,240
Well, here, see if you think this is funny.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,660
The Self-Genius.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,240
Power of Swag.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,480
It ain't safe having a crackpot giving orders.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,900
About time somebody took over.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,660
Who, for instance?

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,120
A very good friend of mine.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,760
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,820
Go on!

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,720
Two million!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,220
A bastard, cowards!

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,720
We don't want to live anyway.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,740
Not in a stinking water like this.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,440
Oh?

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,820
And what's so stinking about it?

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,560
It's a stinking water because there's no law norther anymore.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,760
It's a stinking water because it lets the young get onto the old.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,880
Oh, it's no water for an old man any longer.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,520
What sort of a water is it at?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,180
Oh, man on the moon.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
And men spinning around the earth.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,140
And there's not no attention paid to earthly law norther no more.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,660
Oh, dear God.

32
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,380
Oh, it's all for the eye.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,260
In the U.S. today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,780
Thirty-five percent of all...

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
...students use drugs at least once a month.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
It isn't all the real legit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,580
We have a panacea in America that is a place to solve every problem.

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,920
No drugs, now there's help.

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,820
Introducing the drugs program.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,880
You may be eligible for drugs regardless of age or income.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,680
It costs to join.

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,120
From PR News in Washington, I'm worried about PR News.

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,980
President Bush is plotting to ban the use of drugs.

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,360
He's planning to blow up a mosque and a congressman's office.

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,960
The White House says 45 elderly disabled people caught fire.

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,760
The Dow Jones is down 10-3-6-4-3-12-11.

47
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,960
Germany's conservative environmentalist Green Christian Social Democrat Party ended coalition talks today with the conservatives of PR News Washington.

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,660
By the way, just want to let you know, corrupt.

49
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,740
Corruptions.

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,140
The African American voters.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,900
Free societies do not export terror.

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,080
Free governments respect the aspirations of their citizens and serve their hopes for a better life.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,180
Free nations are peaceful nations.

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,980
And free nations in the heart of the Middle East will show what is possible to others who want to live in a free society.

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,900
It's a tomorrow after all.

56
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,440
It's a tomorrow after all.

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,180
It's a tomorrow after all.

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,180


59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,900
It's a tomorrow after all.

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,680
It's a tomorrow after all.

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Flintstones.

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,640
Make the Flintstones.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
They're the pride of this family.

64
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,960
From the ground up they're the friends of the liege.

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Make the Flintstones.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,020
Have a-gala-gala do time.

67
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,500
Gala do time.

68
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,600
It's your holiday all time.

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,200
All by yourself.

70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
A chance to relax.

71
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,420
Touch yourself.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
A chance to think.

73
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,340
And enjoy things that don't cost a cent.

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,140
It's a nice idea.

75
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:22,600
It's a nice idea.

76
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,600
Wait for the final proof.

77
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,760
The smoking gun.

78
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,120
It could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
We will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike.

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,380
We will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike.

81
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,420
We will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike.

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:07,480
We will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike.

83
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,860
Ouch.

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,940
It's not funny.

85
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,020
It's not funny, you guys.

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
It's as funny as it needs to be.

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,720
There's nothing funny about that.

88
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,500
Oh, yes.

89
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,160
Unfortunately, there's nothing funny about anything right now.

90
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35,080
Friends, that last little collage there was by the great Joe.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,980
He calls himself Joe this year.

92
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,260
I think he's really at him in a fun way.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,120
But, friends, this hour of Slack number 1016.

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,200
Besides all that great collage by Norel Preff.

95
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,660
And the great...

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,920
And the great Fernanda Nandeli-Murr.

97
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,660
Friends, we have a live show because we have a live guest.

98
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,720
A special guest.

99
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes.

100
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,060
A celebrity guest.

101
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,800
The man who invented the revolution itself.

102
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,500
Saint Paul Krasner.

103
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,440
Is here in the studio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

104
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,280
Unfortunately, he is manacled tonight because he had a previous engagement with the authorities.

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,820
He tried to bust loose, so to speak, and bit an officer.

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:37,500
Well, Saint Krasner is in Cleveland to do a fundraiser for the good people of Universal Health Care Action Network.

107
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,260
In fact, Tuesday night, he'll be doing an evening of comedy.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:50,200
And we've been seeing Paul Krasnerian comedy all afternoon, actually, because he's been doing book signings and so forth.

109
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,980
And he has a new book out.

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,200
One Hand Jerking.

111
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:03,220
And it says here that Paul Krasner is the only person in the world ever to win awards from both Playboy for satire

112
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,620
and the Feminist Party Media Workshop for journalism.

113
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,920
And he's been inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam,

114
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,420
which makes me really jealous.

115
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,980
And we got the Upton Sinclair Award from ACLU for dedication of freedom of expression.

116
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,100
And the FBI considers him a raving unconfined.

117
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,200
And welcome to the Hour of Slack, Saint Paul.

118
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,440
Thank you, oh, intelligent designer.

119
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,080
You know, I think there's been a kind of an argument going on in the Intelligent Design Committee.

120
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,720
What argument in the committee?

121
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,600
Well, I don't know, but obviously they haven't.

122
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, there is bickering over each one has their own concept.

123
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, there are those who think there's an intelligent designer, but there's no warranty.

124
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,840
Okay.

125
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,180
Well, I had various questions that the subgeniuses.

126
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,220
Wait, there's one more plug.

127
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,860
Oh.

128
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:06,560
For the Disneyland Memorial Orgy, which was done by Mad Magazine artist Wally Wood in 1967,

129
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
which I published as a poster, and it's available again.

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
The original was in black and white.

131
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,160
Now it's been digitally colored by a former employee of Disney.

132
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,740
And that can be gotten via my website, paulkrasner.com.

133
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,600
That's with two.

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,180
Two S's, paulkrasner.com.

135
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,220
Now.

136
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,280
Oh, and that's a K on the Kras.

137
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,380
It's not the way you would expect it to be spelled after you've listened to it talk for a while.

138
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,740
More Kras than thou.

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:42,920
Now, these things featured therein are not of the ilk from before of the old realist where Mickey and Minnie are having.

140
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,760
That's it.

141
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,420
No, no.

142
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,800
It's Minnie and Goofy.

143
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
Minnie and Goofy.

144
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,300
On a cash register.

145
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,760
That's an ill prescription.

146
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,840
I mean.

147
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,840
And Cinderella is being investigated by the prince over in one corner.

148
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,880
I thought she was being crowned as from the dairy.

149
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,580
There's bestiality in that.

150
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
Well, Goofy is.

151
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,340
Well, no.

152
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,860
If it's between two beasts, is it then considered bestiality?

153
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,460
That's right.

154
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,560
A centaur and a pan.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Well, a centaur could commit bestiality upon himself.

156
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,680
Yeah.

157
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,160
Or anything present.

158
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,560
No, that.

159
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,960
If he applied himself.

160
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,280
Boy, this is getting me hot, friends.

161
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,000
You take a look at that poster we're talking about.

162
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:32,520
Old hippies will remember this poster from head shops and old perverts will remember it from porno shops.

163
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,160
That's where I first saw it.

164
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,620
And they might be the same person.

165
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
Yeah, it's great.

166
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,360
And you can get it.

167
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,460
You can get a free copy off of off of the Krasner.

168
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,160
Paul Krasner dot com website.

169
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, well, that's the small one.

170
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:51,820
Paul Krasner has been everywhere and done everything cool and knows everybody cool, especially all the cool people.

171
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:51,820


172
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:51,820


173
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,280
Dead guys.

174
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,340
Yeah, I'm the last of the Mohicans.

175
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,920
You know, I was thinking I was thinking what who else is there left?

176
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,700
I mean, you knew Lenny Bruce, Ken Kesey, Abby Hoffman.

177
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,160
I mean, it's just a tiny handful.

178
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,360
I mean, there's the Krasner curse.

179
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,200
You better watch out.

180
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,400
Oh, yeah.

181
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,860
The great reverend to know him.

182
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,040
And it's to add Alfred E. Newman.

183
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,700
That was the one that impressed me the most.

184
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,580
I understand.

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,260
I understand.

186
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,760
You lost your cherry to Alfred E. Newman at the magazine.

187
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,940
To him with my girlfriend and I.

188
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,820
I was still living with my parents.

189
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,560
And but I was friends with.

190
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,400
And so I had no place to take a girl.

191
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,160
I mean, I asked my mother if I was.

192
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,420
I wanted to rent an apartment.

193
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,440
And she said, why?

194
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,340
I said, well, I have no place to be alone with a girl.

195
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,700
She said, well, dad and I will step into the other room.

196
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,820
And I said, no, I mean, really alone.

197
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,460
And she rushed and took a shower.

198
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,060
So Bill Gaines, who published.

199
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,880
Mad was a friend of mine.

200
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,880
And he gave me the key to his office.

201
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:07,900
And so I lost my virginity on the carpet of the office where all of these, you know, the old crypt, the witch, all of these.

202
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,700
The vault of horror for the comics had been dreamed of all of them.

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,820
And there was Alfred E. Newman on the wall, beautifully framed, looking over us.

204
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,440
And at the moment of climax.

205
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,420
Near the moment of climax, because I was being very responsible and thought I should get a condom.

206
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,280
And I said, we better stop now.

207
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,280
She said, no, it's OK.

208
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,520
You can do it without worrying.

209
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,960
And and so I took her at her word.

210
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,700
But at the moment of climax, I couldn't resist the punch line to her setup.

211
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,420
And simultaneous with my orgasm, I said, what me worry?

212
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,020
I.

213
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,200
That was your first sexual experience with Alfred E. Newman.

214
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,280
Watching over us as he had watched over a whole generation.

215
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,860
Well, that's, you know, a very, very good thing to think of to know that Alfred E. Newman is watching us all, I suppose, in some strange way.

216
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,220
Gives you such a feeling of security.

217
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,640
That's the original slack is what me worry.

218
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,480
If you would like to transpose inefficiently.

219
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,000
You wouldn't need a Homeland Security Department if you had Alfred E. Newman all over the place.

220
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,060
But don't you think Bush does look a lot like Alfred E. Newman?

221
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,140
I've never seen him.

222
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,560
Together.

223
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,640
That has been pointed out.

224
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,520
Yes, it has been.

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,440
And Alfred himself did say nuclear.

226
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,540
When forced.

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,260
Does he do that?

228
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,320
Just does he act stupid so that the people will think he is one of them?

229
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,920
Or is that for real?

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,320
But I mean, he's we know he's not really a Texan.

231
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,440
He's a he's a he's a rich Connecticut kid.

232
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,000
I.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,420
I think you should ask Paul to go for the the Karl Rove connection then.

234
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,840
Well, Karl Rove.

235
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,220
You know, how maybe that is the inspiration for their whole intelligent, unintelligent, stupid design.

236
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,460
Their plan, their evil plan.

237
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,580
But by Karl Rove was always behind the scenes.

238
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,840
He was sort of like a flasher in the park who would jump out from behind the bushes.

239
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,640
But in the fast past few years, his ego has gotten ahead of him.

240
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,000
And now he just stands in front of everybody goes, hey, lady, opening his raincoat.

241
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah.

242
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,160
And the video cameras.

243
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,960
This is I know a lot of conspiracy theorists are, you know, all jacked up about this and stuff.

244
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,420
But all the cameras in Washington, D.C. have him exposing himself in numerous ways.

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:40,720
Well, you know, I think there's a kind of feeling of mass Schadenfreude going on now that if Karl Rove is indeed indicted,

246
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,500
all of us skeptical are going to be saying in unison the system works.

247
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,260
Oh, God, what a letdown that would be.

248
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,140
Oh, man.

249
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, who cares about all these new horrid white men?

250
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,840
What about the cool white guys of the past like Ken Kesey?

251
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,260
That guy was one of my heroes.

252
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,800
When I was 17, I read Tom Wolfe's account of the Mary Prankster's escapades.

253
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,120
And I honestly thought I want to be like that when I grow up.

254
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,940
Oh, well, you know, one hand jerking is dedicated to Kesey.

255
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,780
Yeah, I noticed that.

256
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,980
He was he was a good friend.

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,680
And an inspiration.

258
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,080
And one of the things he said was always stay in your own movie.

259
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,100
And I like that because people are always trying to get you into their screenplay of life.

260
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,700
It works for me this time.

261
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,420
Oh, welcome to the hour of slack.

262
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,060
Yes.

263
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,500
Oh, I'm slacking already.

264
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:49,040
Well, yeah, I always I really am sorry I never got to meet the great Ken Kesey because we

265
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,980
we would kind of.

266
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,120
I mailed stuff back and forth every now and then.

267
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,820
It all seemed so glorious in that Tom Wolfe book.

268
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,320
And then when I actually saw the bus movie, which their kids released, I guess Ken Babs

269
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,820
and Kesey's sons got together and edited all that footage from the from the bus trip into

270
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,340
a really hideous giant home movie.

271
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,380
Well, Kesey and Ken Babs did the editing and the kids are selling it now.

272
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,160
Oh, they're continuing the tradition.

273
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,660
Oh, that explains why.

274
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,620
Why it's so insane.

275
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,080
Yes.

276
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,180
Those guys really edited it themselves.

277
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,180
You know, I looked at that and it was like, God, those guys were even more low budget

278
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,640
than Church of the Subgenius.

279
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,440
And that's pretty much lowering the bar.

280
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah, that's pretty.

281
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:43,080
That's well, you had said earlier today when you were talking at the bookstore that being

282
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,580
a satirist is difficult nowadays because reality has outstripped satire half the time.

283
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,640
As a satirist.

284
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,840
I would have found it difficult to come up with a notion that the right wing Christians

285
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,860
have done where they now say that there was a pair of dinosaurs on Noah's Ark.

286
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,960
I wouldn't have had the imagination to think of that.

287
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,320
Is that the newest thing in intelligent design that there was a pair of dinosaurs on the

288
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,560
Ark now that they're accommodating so that they can.

289
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,560
Well, that's common household knowledge that there were there were dinosaurs on there.

290
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,520
But one of them was that there were two Tyrannosaurus.

291
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,220
And they ate all the other dinosaurs and then starved.

292
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,700
At that point, this is one of the things they left out of the Bible.

293
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,160
But Noah basically tricked it.

294
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,200
They managed to herd the Tyrannosaurus is off into the endless ocean.

295
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,520
The religious right.

296
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,240
Water world.

297
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,640
Our great spin doctors.

298
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,700
You know, who else would think to say that God put fossils on Earth to test people's

299
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:42,980
faith?

300
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,220
Yeah.

301
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,700
Well, it's it's direly tested my faith.

302
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,840
Seeing fossils everywhere.

303
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,640
In fact, in front of me.

304
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,440
The Onion had a great headline.

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,140
Creationist Museum acquires 5000 year old Tyrannosaurus skeleton.

306
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,680
There are hundreds of churches who claim to have Jesus's foreskin.

307
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,540
Get out of here.

308
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,160
All right.

309
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,720
I'll retract that.

310
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,240
The Church of the Subgenius actually does have the foreskin of the current acting Jesus.

311
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,720
Yes.

312
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,880
And I can prove we have video to prove it.

313
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,820
But you want to see.

314
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,160
I thought you had Petri dish.

315
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,260
Well, that too.

316
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,420
And we're trying to breed new ones.

317
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,560
But I don't.

318
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,680
Well, it's too late now.

319
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,340
We got the the Jesus cells mixed up with the Hitler cells.

320
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
Nenslow did that.

321
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,660
I think it happened long ago.

322
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,300
No.

323
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,880
There was a nice earnest lady at the borders today who had a question for you.

324
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
And her question was, quote, What happened to the left?

325
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,680
To which you said something about.

326
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,540
That a liberal is just a radical with a family.

327
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,380
Yeah, that's an old saying, but it's truer than ever.

328
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,460
I've never heard it before.

329
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,160
Oh, well, then it's a new saying.

330
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,640
Yeah.

331
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,260
And I.

332
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,820
And then I quoted.

333
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,280
I was on a TV show, a short lived TV show called The Conspiracy Zone.

334
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,700
Yeah, I'm familiar with that.

335
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,560
And and and culture was was on the panel with me.

336
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:19,580
And and during a commercial break, I said to her, you know, I think that the terms liberal and conservative.

337
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:31,880
Are obsolescent now because there's somebody like Schlaff Phyllis Schlafly, who was against the ERA, the Equal Rights Amendment for women.

338
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,640
But nevertheless, she is now campaigning against national I.D. cards.

339
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,220
And then there are some liberals who are in very conservative anti-choice positions.

340
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:49,380
So I said to her, and what do you think would make good substitutes for liberal and conservative?

341
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,480
And she replied, how about Americans and cowards?

342
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,160
That Ann Coulter.

343
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:04,420
How dare her refer to herself as a coward after all the posturing and gesturing, you know, and escaping pies she's done over the last few.

344
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:18,840
Well, actually, she and Coulter and Patrick Buchanan and Rush Limbaugh, among other professional conservatives, are blasting Bush now their hero for a point nominating.

345
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,280
Harriet Myers for the Supreme Court.

346
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,080
Yeah, she's practically a pinko.

347
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,620
Well, no, I'm practically a law student.

348
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,100
I think she's practically the cleaning woman in his office.

349
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,820
Right. Yeah.

350
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,440
She's never been a judge at all.

351
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:35,680
Right.

352
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,640
No, I'm going to I'm going to hand out applications to anybody who wants to be in a Supreme Court.

353
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,480
No experience required.

354
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,680
So now does Bush have a harem of his many helpmates and wives and maidens?

355
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,200
And so forth.

356
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,060
Kind of like a droopy and snow wife.

357
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,720
Oh, well, there is.

358
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,780
Name is there is Karen Hughes, the speechwriter who was the first one to try to teach him not to call terrorists folks.

359
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,180
And is she also?

360
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,620
Well, no.

361
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,480
Rove is nuclear.

362
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:14,580
Understanding that when you say that that way, you automatically win the empathy of millions and zillions of people somewhere in reds, whatever it is.

363
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,700
Oh, yeah.

364
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,460
No, he that goes back to your original question.

365
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,580
Whether he really is as goofy as he seems or whether it's an act to entice other goofies.

366
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:35,660
Well, speaking of other goofies in a sexual sense, isn't there some sort of pornography ring emanating from the White House press corps or something like that?

367
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,380
Or they just they just have declared war on pornography.

368
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You know, they have their priorities straight by golly.

369
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,220
I'd like to see Ann Coulter and.

370
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,200
Goosey.

371
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,940
Sheppey Garibaldi.

372
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,120
Yeah.

373
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,760
Goofy.

374
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,500
Goofy.

375
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,500
Wow.

376
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
Get me out of here, coward.

377
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:54,940
Yeah.

378
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,020
You know, I'd love that.

379
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,200
Yeah.

380
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,000
There's what?

381
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,140
How many combinations can we think of with Ann Coulter all dolled up in B and D leather?

382
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,040
Smacking around Mickey Mouse.

383
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,460
Smacking around Mickey Mouse.

384
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,020
Smacking around Rush Limbaugh.

385
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,500
I think she did it with Bill Maher.

386
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,560
Really?

387
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:15,980
Yeah.

388
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,820
That's why he had her on his program all the time.

389
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,660
Oh, well, that's the way it would work in those in the inner circles of whatever it is.

390
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,260
Political Hollywood.

391
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,000
Is that why?

392
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,820
Is that why we never made it, Dave?

393
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,680
We never had sex with each other.

394
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah.

395
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,740
We never had sex with Bill Maher.

396
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,380
We never we never even.

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,420
Well, I tried to that one time with Ann Coulter, but she blew me off.

398
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,760
I tried with Bill Maher once.

399
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,180
Right.

400
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,060
And weren't you rejected by Jon Stewart?

401
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,660
Yeah.

402
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,120
Yeah.

403
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah.

404
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,140
Actually, every day I'm rejected by Jon Stewart.

405
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,420
Oh, well.

406
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,100
We hear about the stuff, too, later.

407
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,080
You know, the angry letters and stuff.

408
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,540
It's.

409
00:22:51,780 --> 00:23:00,140
I was on Jon Stewart's show before he was famous when he had the original Jon Stewart show for the last three minutes of the show.

410
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:08,520
I had to explain the church of the subgenius in three minutes, but which all I could really do is just ask him for his watch and then smash it.

411
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,860
Did you do that?

412
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,800
Yeah, I did.

413
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,200
Did you really?

414
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,540
And you busted it?

415
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,620
It was to tell the truth.

416
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,540
It was set up.

417
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,100
But.

418
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,300
People believed it.

419
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,740
People fell for it.

420
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,580
So he put an old watch that wasn't ticking.

421
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,880
I gave him the watch.

422
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,300
Oh.

423
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,260
Oh, it was that one?

424
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah.

425
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,460
Oh.

426
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,480
I feel so disillusioned.

427
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,680
It's always the same watch.

428
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,500
Whenever you see me smash a watch.

429
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,120
And it wasn't even my idea.

430
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,700
Oh, well.

431
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,320
We had to kill a lot of subgeniuses who contributed ideas but then wanted credit.

432
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,220
Oh, I remember that one at Bloodbath.

433
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,020
Thank God nobody's asked for money.

434
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't know what we'd do.

435
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,160
What would we do?

436
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,860
We'd do without the lime consignment with all the mass graves.

437
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh, never mind.

438
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,060
Just an errant thought.

439
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,100
Top three reasons.

440
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,740
Number three.

441
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,220
Number two.

442
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,000
And the number one reason.

443
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Right now get free carpet paddles.

444
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,320
Pour gas money today.

445
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,360
Install a new dirty air filter.

446
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,000
Put in a dirty fuel filter.

447
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,740
And add a bottle of dirty tank.

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,240
Throwing money away.

449
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,680
Get the gas now.

450
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,640
Oh, no.

451
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,220
No.

452
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,420
No.

453
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,520
No.

454
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:14,800
No.

455
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,720
No.

456
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:15,800


457
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:15,800


458
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:15,800


459
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:15,820


460
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:15,820


461
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:15,900


462
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:15,900


463
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:15,900


464
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,920


465
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,920


466
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,920


467
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:15,920


468
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:15,940


469
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,040
No.

470
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,820
The cause, friend.

471
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,800
The cause of casting out the false prophets.

472
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,680
They're pledging to drive to the benefit.

473
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,500
Right.

474
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:22,880
Yes.

475
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,200
Yeah.

476
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,620
That's all they have to do.

477
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,560
And then you can sit there and watch St. Paul interact with a real live audience.

478
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,120
Unlike us.

479
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,200
And you can bid on that piece of art.

480
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,060
That Disney piece of art.

481
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,520
That filthy piece of art.

482
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:38,760
Yes.

483
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,720
I actually abused myself and that piece of art when I was a kid.

484
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,360
And not that much of a kid.

485
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,000
Wait a minute.

486
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,320
Now.

487
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,860
Yeah.

488
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,020
It's a long drawing by Wally Wood featuring Disney characters.

489
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,140
The most beloved Disney characters in more than compromising positions.

490
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,820
Sexual positions, in fact.

491
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,760
It was one of my favorite things as a youth.

492
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,020
It was hidden under desks and behind the cabinets.

493
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,340
But we took it out and laughed and cried.

494
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,700
Sorry.

495
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,700
Someday it will be animated.

496
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,900
Now, you're going to be in an animated movie, right?

497
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,940
No, no.

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
It is a.

499
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,860
It is a documentary being made about the Yippies and the Chicago conspiracy trial.

500
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,460
And instead of.

501
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,960
They're going to have reenactments originally.

502
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,480
But with actors.

503
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,280
But then they decided they would have animated scenes.

504
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,340
And I've been assigned to write four of them.

505
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,540
And to do the voiceover for my own cartoon character.

506
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't know how I'm going to talk.

507
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,080
Or like this.

508
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,660
Or what?

509
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,880
Do it villain style.

510
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:42,960
Yeah.

511
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,760
I've come for the ride.

512
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah.

513
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,740
Where are the Yippies?

514
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,120
What are you going to do about it, buddy?

515
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,620
Yeah, I'm going to burn the Chicago down, see?

516
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,800
With this new absurdist movement, we shall surely overthrow the capitalist government of America.

517
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,940
Come on, Abby.

518
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,620
Come on, Jerry.

519
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,340
Let's do it.

520
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,180
That would be the right voice for the wrong people, though.

521
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,320
Now, if you wanted to command true respect, you would say,

522
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,960
Come on, Abby.

523
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,000
Come on, Jerry.

524
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,400
Let's go and do it for the people.

525
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,020
That reminds me of somebody.

526
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,720
I don't know who.

527
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,300
I don't.

528
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,460
It's the deep-voiced hero guy.

529
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:18,740
Yeah.

530
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,060
With a bazir full of hairs.

531
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, no.

532
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,340
You know, eventually there are going to be movies, or at least TV movies, about that stuff.

533
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,060
And there will be some guy that plays you.

534
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,580
Oh, that plays me?

535
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,140
I wonder who I'd like to play me.

536
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,700
Tom Cruise.

537
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,700
Yeah.

538
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,620
Tom Cruise.

539
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,020
Well, that's who I'm going for.

540
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,140
Oh, that's who he can't because you have a problem with the Scientologists.

541
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,500
Or they have a problem with you.

542
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,900
They sued you or wanted to sue you because you tried to act normal, right?

543
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,180
And Tom Cruise, you know, he's too busy.

544
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,020
He's pregnant now.

545
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,580
They're going to have a baby, which they're going to name Little E-Meter.

546
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh, boy.

547
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,140
That looks like the cover of one of those tabloids.

548
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,620
I can really see that.

549
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,800
I can really see that.

550
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
What, a pregnant Tom Cruise?

551
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,480
Yes, with a big smile on his face and that kind of little bit demure, sheepish, and yet very strong look.

552
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,660
And Katie Holmes yelling,

553
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,540
Push! Push!

554
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,400
She's just reading off the door, of course.

555
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,480
Except for he's got these huge goofy feet and they're stirrups.

556
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,440
No.

557
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,720
Okay.

558
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,280
Anyway.

559
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,680
Oh, you were talking also earlier today about how you can't threaten the president anymore, even if you're a comedian.

560
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,040
But I've actually gotten away with it myself several times.

561
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,880
How do you manage?

562
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,480
By putting it in quotes, sort of.

563
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,500
People are always going, what should we do, Reverend Stank?

564
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,780
The conspiracy's taking over the whole world.

565
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,080
And as we all know, the conspiracy is the conservatives and the liberals are the good guys.

566
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,600
So what should we do to be good liberals or whatever?

567
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,740
And for a long time, I used to say you only had two choices.

568
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:05,020
To flee America or, if you really believe that they're building concentration camps to put ne'er-do-wells and troublemakers in,

569
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,760
you can either flee America or kill the evildoers, let's just say.

570
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:09,900


571
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,360
And I would actually outright speak.

572
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,120
The phrase really loud.

573
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,980
And then I'd say, oh, I was just saying that for effect.

574
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Or you could say, kill the president, Roosevelt.

575
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:20,960
Yeah.

576
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,040
You could add metaphorically speaking or figuratively.

577
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,720
That was not actually the punch.

578
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,880
The final punchline was that we had realized there was a third alternative to fleeing America or assassinating somebody.

579
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,500
And that was running for office.

580
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,540
Run for office yourself.

581
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,880
Oh, that's a ridiculous thing to say.

582
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,100
That's the answer.

583
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,500
Nobody.

584
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,460
Nobody wants to hear.

585
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,880
That's the one that was like, oh, that's not funny.

586
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,500
I was hoping you'd say something either funny or something I really wanted to do.

587
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
But, you know, when you run for office, then the next thing you know, somebody's saying,

588
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,000
the only thing you can do is flee America or kill that guy that's running for office.

589
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,720
Well, that would be pretty karmic, wouldn't this?

590
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,620
That's a problem with the revolutions, right?

591
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,340
Like karma?

592
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,500
The worm eating its own shoe.

593
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:07,980
Yeah.

594
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,580
The minute the noble young revolution.

595
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,800
The revolutionary Stalin wins, he turns into the evil old revolutionary Stalin.

596
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,360
They start looking like Potter.

597
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,660
Fascist.

598
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,220
You know, it's a wonderful life.

599
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,420
Or Dick Cheney.

600
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:32,640
But, of course, that's the way the fairy tale always ends, is you have the revolution, but then the revolutionaries turn into something worse than or equal to the guys they overthrew.

601
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,140
Because all animals are equal and some are more equal than others.

602
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,740
Well, in fact, when I had my radio show in San Francisco.

603
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,240
And the.

604
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,900
And the station manager told me to stop making comments after the news to go right into music.

605
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,680
So I always told the engineer to play the who singing, you know, won't be fooled again.

606
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,740
So no matter what the news was, it applied.

607
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:09,760
Well, I just like to say that the reason why Dick Cheney is often called Black Dick is not because of the fact, you know, like some wasp gangster thing like, ah, it's Black Dick.

608
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,400
You know, it's that's what happens to you after consecutive.

609
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,940
Heart attacks with an erection.

610
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,720
Oh, that's another thing I've learned while in Cleveland.

611
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,560
I didn't know that.

612
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,040
Did you know that there is becomes abstruse or something?

613
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,920
I don't know if you have a whole bunch of heart attacks.

614
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,300
Really?

615
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:33,680
Well, if you have a heart attack while you're having an ejaculation and the constriction goes backwards, your penis tends to become ossified.

616
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,700
See, that's what I've been trying.

617
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,440
Like an erectile.

618
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,080
Something.

619
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,980
I didn't realize that you could get that done so easily.

620
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,460
Well, it no longer has any.

621
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,580
There's no sensation to it.

622
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,160
It's just like.

623
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,660
That's the idea.

624
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,140
Yeah.

625
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,580
Right.

626
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,360
It's been embalmed in something.

627
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,060
Yeah, man.

628
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,980
Screw sex.

629
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,480
But you have to give Cheney.

630
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,000
Kill war.

631
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,860
Credit for being a good ventriloquist.

632
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah.

633
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,700
Which that's why he talks out of the side of his mouth like that.

634
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,020
He reminds me of the penguin when he does that.

635
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
So, OK.

636
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,020
Now, how come all the other old timer revolutionaries are dead and you're not?

637
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,180
Doesn't that cast suspicion on you at this point?

638
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,700
You know, I will reveal my secret.

639
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,420
I never take legal drugs.

640
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,600
Well, I guess that.

641
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,160
I did about a month ago.

642
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,140
I was at a party and I did take an aspirin.

643
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,920
But everybody else was.

644
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,340
It was sort of like peer pressure.

645
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,520
Yeah.

646
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,620
They do that to you a lot in high school, too.

647
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,680
You know, a crowd around you at the locker and stuff.

648
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,400
And sticking Excedrin in your face.

649
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,120
You know, usually the biggest, toughest guys.

650
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,600
One is.

651
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,880
Oh, no.

652
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,620
When you're when you get older, it's.

653
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,460
They're they're forcing glucose.

654
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,740
I mean, could join.

655
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,700
Could join on you.

656
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,040
That's how I got started.

657
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,620
Fear group pressure.

658
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,540
I can't.

659
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:47,880
Yeah.

660
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,060
Oh, well, you you you you said you misunderstood.

661
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
They said it was good for your joints.

662
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,240
And you say, OK, let's roll one.

663
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,180
Spur them on there.

664
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,200
Yeah.

665
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,540
That was the days.

666
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,280
Back back when we could still smoke reefers and fired up for before these vaporizer machines.

667
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,580
I've not a lot of people who have to use vaporizers because they're.

668
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,840
Lungs are ravaged.

669
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,920
I also know what you know, I'm talking about.

670
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,800
It's like a thing.

671
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,700
The heat gun blows.

672
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,240
Yeah.

673
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,780
Loves hot air across the healing herbal mixtures.

674
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,060
And so you're not getting this burnt stuff.

675
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,140
You're just getting this.

676
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,660
It it.

677
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,620
It cuts the interior of the site.

678
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,560
It's just not the same.

679
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:40,760
And you know, you need to do that if you smoke a lot, because people smoke marijuana often just to enhance life experience.

680
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,100
So I will smoke a joint before I go to a movie.

681
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,140
It enhances the movie.

682
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,200
I'll roll a joint before I have a nice dinner to enhance the taste.

683
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,080
I'll roll a joint before making love.

684
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,400
I'll roll a joint before listening to music.

685
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,140
I even roll a joint in order to enhance the experience of rolling another joint.

686
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,720
Yes.

687
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,580
In fact, your hands are numb from twisting joints all day.

688
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,840
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then I smoke two more.

689
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,440
Quote.

690
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,080
The great.

691
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,960
Subgenius man.

692
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,800
Sublime.

693
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,120
I use it to enhance my depression and my negative feelings.

694
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:16,820
I had to.

695
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,280
I had to swear off talking about it.

696
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,880
Huh?

697
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,860
I had to just swear off talking about it.

698
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,100
You used to enjoy talking about the experience itself.

699
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah.

700
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,360
We used to enjoy demonstrating the experience itself from right here inside this radio studio.

701
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,740
But that was years ago.

702
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,320
Yeah.

703
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,920
That was before the man started believing it's like sniffing our wee wee every time you try to get a job or, you know, pointing cameras.

704
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,720
Different days.

705
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,220
Different days.

706
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:49,260
I was going to tell Paul that that at one time things were just so freewheeling and it was just wonderful back then.

707
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,600
They never gave a pee test on a Friday in the old days.

708
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,220
They come by and congratulate you.

709
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,760
Well, that was a Catholic doctrine that you were allowed to eat meat, but you couldn't pee it out.

710
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:58,960
Have.

711
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,420
Yes.

712
00:33:59,560 --> 00:33:59,820
Right.

713
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,900
You're a guy.

714
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,820
I tried to quit.

715
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,380
And that's harder than quitting smoking.

716
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,860
Well, that's, you know, in the old confessionals, it's been like three years since my last good urination or something.

717
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,480
Something like that.

718
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,120
And then they'd smack you on the side of the head.

719
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,600
Well, I don't know this firsthand.

720
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,140
Oh, I.

721
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,100
If you read High Times, you see all these full page ads for ways to beat a drug test.

722
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,500
And one of the things they offer is a plastic penis.

723
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,940
And but the problem is that it's pink.

724
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,340
And so there was a guy who was busted in Texas.

725
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,020
He was a dark skinned Mexican.

726
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,560
And the DEA guy looking over his shoulder noticed.

727
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,360
That this dark skinned Mexican man had a pink penis.

728
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,040
And that made him slightly suspicious.

729
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:54,980
And then when the spray came out sort of like in a garden rather than in a single stream, it made him even more suspicious.

730
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,320
And when the pink penis dropped to the floor, that was the clincher.

731
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,040
He was clued in officially.

732
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:02,960
Yes.

733
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,980
Something was up.

734
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,360
Had you the heart and mind of like a Dr.

735
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,160
Tom delay or something rather than proclaiming he had a false penis.

736
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,720
You would have come.

737
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,460
To his rescue or something like that.

738
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,860
Oh, he would only because he himself is a false penis.

739
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,780
I heard that.

740
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,520
And he identified.

741
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,600
This is rampant in Congress now.

742
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,320
False penis.

743
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Peni, I guess you'd say.

744
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,740
Dick's right and left.

745
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,660
Casting out the false prophets and the and the the limp Richards.

746
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,820
The limp Richards.

747
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,760
They certainly do have a lot of testicles.

748
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,080
What they foisted on everyone, I think.

749
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,460
Now, we weren't going to go into.

750
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:40,640
That.

751
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:40,920
This.

752
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,220
Show.

753
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,820
And then I was.

754
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,980
We were going to.

755
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,580
Swear off.

756
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,540
We were going to.

757
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,140
Swear off.

758
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,420
The that kind of talk for for once.

759
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,960
Oh, then there goes the riddle then of what do Lance Armstrong and Hitler have in common?

760
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,060
I don't know.

761
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,620
What do Lance Armstrong and Hitler have in common?

762
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,680
Well, they each have only one testicle.

763
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Or I should say had in Hitler's case.

764
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,440
Yes.

765
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:01,840
Huh?

766
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,360
Well, I'm sure I'm sure that.

767
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,900
Well, just Hitler did.

768
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,440
Hitler and Hojo both had spare testicles.

769
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,440


770
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,440


771
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
That they kept in times of need.

772
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,340
Oh, like a tire.

773
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:13,860
You mean?

774
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,340
Yeah.

775
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,860
Like a spare.

776
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,440
Is that where my other one went?

777
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:16,840
Yeah.

778
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,440
Damn.

779
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,440
I thought it was in that little bejeweled case.

780
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,660
Then there was Bill Clinton, who had a piebald penis like Michael Jackson.

781
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,620
Those are those guys.

782
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,540
Piebald or pierbald.

783
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,620
They could be easily identified by the patterns, the spotted patterns on their tally.

784
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,900
Oh, well, who's that singer that's going to marry Lance Armstrong?

785
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,100
I just blocked out the one from Montreal.

786
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,600
I forget where she's from.

787
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,400
The one who sings the spirited songs about all the catastrophes.

788
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,020
Yeah, well, I mean, I just remember, which is why she went.

789
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,740
She liked Lance.

790
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,720
She had that song.

791
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,580
Remember, girls want to just want to have one.

792
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,200
What's the difference between Castro and a jockey strap?

793
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,000
I Castro is a dictator and I can't say the rest of it on the air.

794
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,940
Isn't this safe harbor town and a jockstrap?

795
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,160
Yeah.

796
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,600
It is a penis toter penis toter.

797
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,900
It's such a thin line between being, you know, even if it's not so much the words, it's the

798
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
meaning of the word.

799
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:28,180
So if you end up causing the listener to form this image in their mind of this actual carrying

800
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:35,640
sack filled with a potato, you know, you're dredging, you're causing them to have these

801
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,820
thoughts in their mind, ugly pictures.

802
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,240
And that in now this year.

803
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,360
This year's FCC rulings.

804
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,960
That's worse than just saying the word.

805
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,740
No dredging up ugly pictures.

806
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:56,160
After 11 o'clock tonight on the synesthesia show, you can use the words, but you can't dredge up the images still.

807
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,960
Well, but, you know, there are parents now who are naming their kids scrotum.

808
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,920
Scrotum, get out of the pool.

809
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,040
It's not even a joke.

810
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,120
It used to be that cruel, cruel doctors would name poor people's children.

811
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,360
With names like urethra and scrotum.

812
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:12,700
Yeah.

813
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,300
To make fun of, you know, it's kind of a.

814
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Of their social condition, they would name them after an organ and stuff.

815
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,420
Yeah.

816
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,160
Like my grandfather.

817
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,020
A kid would be 20 years old before she realized that the word urethra was also meant something else.

818
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,080
Well, when my great grandpa stepped off on Ellis Island, they said, forget your old name.

819
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,580
Your name is now cootie, pootie, kidney pidlins.

820
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,420
Which, and he never had problems anywhere like that.

821
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,100
And then it was a hard name to keep.

822
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,340
For so long.

823
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,460
I'm sorry.

824
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,140
It's a hard name to remember.

825
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,660
Yeah.

826
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,200
So that's why I couldn't work with it anymore because I forgot what I said.

827
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,180
It's almost a tongue twister.

828
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,920
And so he changed his last name to Dave.

829
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
No, he changed his name to.

830
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,880
It's always been the Dave family.

831
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,000
To Glad Bladder.

832
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,900
Oh, Glad Bladder.

833
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,480
Glad Bladder.

834
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,960
I knew the Glad Blatters.

835
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,360
They were a nice family.

836
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,840
In the wasp culture, Glad Bladder easily just comes out like cheese, you know.

837
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,240
Oh.

838
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,260
I only have two minutes left here.

839
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,620
So what can we do in those two minutes?

840
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,540
To make the world a better place.

841
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,080
Two minute warning.

842
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,360
To make the world a better place.

843
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,820
No, we're supposed to ask you that.

844
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,360
Yeah.

845
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,460
Mr. Krasner, what should we do to make the world a better place?

846
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
As a cultural icon, could we ask you?

847
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,820
Well, I would say that the most important thing in terms of consciousness would be to

848
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,460
never bite into a club sandwich before you have removed the toothpick.

849
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,040
And the philosophy can come later.

850
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,100
Because otherwise you'll have a problem.

851
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,220
You'll have a punctured upper palate.

852
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,020
And that doesn't do philosophy any good.

853
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,400
Sheesh.

854
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,880
I think he has lots and lots and lots of secrets to the founder.

855
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,360
I was going to say that was really deep, but it's not at all.

856
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,560
No, it's quite easy.

857
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,820
It's refreshingly shallow.

858
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,500
And then there are specialty, especially shallow.

859
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,520
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,300
It's easy for the subgeniuses to understand.

861
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,140
Don't bite that toothpick.

862
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,440
Oh, here's another one.

863
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,960
Who's a light dredger?

864
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,660
For those subgeniuses who want to be writers, my advice is,

865
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
avoid cliches like the plague.

866
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,660
That's one cliche to avoid.

867
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,060
But what are the...

868
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,900
There are...

869
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,220
You know, it's all a mystery to me.

870
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,300
I don't understand why we're here.

871
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,780
But you're like 72 years old or something, right?

872
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,220
I don't know.

873
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,020
The older you get, the more mysterious it gets.

874
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,840
Damn!

875
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,060
You mean...

876
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,780
My dad's been obviously faking it this whole time.

877
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,940
Faking what?

878
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,780
He tells people that he knows everything worth knowing,

879
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,440
and that his son, me, I know everything else.

880
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,800
Well, that's kind of a left-handed compliment, isn't it?

881
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,360
Yeah, real left-handed.

882
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,360
Extreme left, you might say.

883
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,240
Anyway, I have had a delightful time being with you guys.

884
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,700
And when I come to Cleveland again, I hope I can come here again.

885
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, could you please have the answer?

886
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,240
Well, yeah, I'd love to come back.

887
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,240


888
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,400
But I don't have any answers to the meaning of life next time, you know?

889
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:12,900
I mean...

890
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,400
Well, we did have questions from the subgeniuses of all time.

891
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:17,540
Oh, yeah, okay.

892
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,300
I'll answer those questions.

893
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,940
One question from Reverend New Monet was,

894
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,580
how do you get the bloodstains out of a lampshade?

895
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,480
Oh, by not getting them in there in the first place.

896
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,340
Okay.

897
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,480
By being very careful.

898
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,560
The question I would like to ask that reverend is,

899
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,860
how did you get those bloodstains in the lampshade?

900
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,460
Yeah, a lot of people want to know that.

901
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:49,340
The other, Nenslow, the great Nenslow wanted me to ask you, why don't you kiss my ass, was his question.

902
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:58,420
Oh, because we want to keep it nice and clean for Christo's next art project of covering asses all over the country.

903
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,880
You know, that's funny you should say that, because I think Christo actually is working with Nenslow on an ass covering project.

904
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,440
There you go again.

905
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,680
Yeah, it's a beautiful, it's a small world.

906
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,280
It's a small, small world.

907
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,860
But somebody out of college, when I spoke there, asked me to autograph his ass, so I invited him up to the front of the auditorium.

908
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,660
He pulled his pants down, I was given a felt-tip pen, and I signed, not my own name, I signed Sirhan Sirhan.

909
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,340
One Sirhan on each butt cheek.

910
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,340
I leave you with that visual impression.

911
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,380
Actually, can we also say that Paul's book, new book, is...

912
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,360
It's on sale at Max Bax on Coventry Road.

913
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,500
That's the best place to pick it up, certainly.

914
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,740
And there's a subtitle. The title is One Hand Jerking, but the subtitle is Reports from an Investigative Satirist.

915
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,060
That says it all, dear friends.

916
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,440
That does indeed.

917
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,840
And now, PR News.

918
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm expected to work from home.

919
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,560
PR's horse has more.

920
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,340
PR's comprehensive horse.

921
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,120
Iran says it's developing nuclear weapons.

922
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,900
President Bush is now offering early morning heart attacks to the leftist communist workers from Eastern European countries.

923
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,120
The federal government is now developing nuclear.

924
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,560
PR News in Washington.

925
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,140
How long before something?

926
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,440
Instantaneously.

927
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,940
You feel like a sugar rush, like a caffeine buzz.

928
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,980
You want to start having a caffeine buzz because you have extra sugar.

929
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,500
Why we sleep is to rebuild our caffeine system and start helping build the sugar rush.

930
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,220
This is on its own.

931
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,560
So after the first day or two, it increased like a sugar rush, like a caffeine buzz.

932
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,460
And it's increased ever since then.

933
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,100
It's been nine years.

934
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,500
So, I mean, the longer you use it, the better you feel, the more conditioned you feel.

935
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:48,680
Right.

936
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,780
And it obviously can, in most cases, be corrected.

937
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,680
Lamisil tablets.

938
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,400
Get your liver or kidney problems.

939
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,520
Get your serious side effects in the liver or serious skin reactions.

940
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,240
Ask your doctor about headache, diarrhea, indigestion, and rash.

941
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,200
Lamisil.

942
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,780
Get your nail infection.

943
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,860
Hi, I'm Charles Denver.

944
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,400
My name is John Bridges.

945
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,020
Eddie Haston is speaking for the National Pollution Foundation.

946
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,760
Is there anything as marvelous as pollution?

947
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,780
The air we breathe helps fight our cities.

948
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:19,760
Come here, please.

949
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,140
It gets bigger.

950
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,280
And all the time it's growing, it gets bigger.

951
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,140
All this fruit.

952
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,160
Hey, why don't you come here, please?

953
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,840
Oh, sure, sure.

954
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,700
Touch me.

955
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,160
That's the miracle of pollution.

956
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,580
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better for everybody.

957
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,820
In your neighborhood.

958
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,260
Why don't you come here, please?

959
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,600
Come here.

960
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,240
Hi.

961
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,760
My job is your kids.

962
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,420
Especially when it comes to drinking.

963
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,980
Hosting a drinking party for teens is legal.

964
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,700
It's okay to ignore the law.

965
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,420
Drinking starts with all of us.

966
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,040
Provide alcohol to minors.

967
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,580
She got caught up in that revolutionary excitement.

968
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,820
Selfish, foul-mouthed young men.

969
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,240
Fly.

970
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,740
Ridiculous.

971
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,940
A corrupt government.

972
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,560
I think it's senseless to help the victims of a cruel system if you let the system remain cruel.

973
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,840
I'm tempted to grab it.

974
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,300
I want my comfort and well-being to depend on somebody else's hardship.

975
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,600
The outmoded, racist school sister.

976
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,520
Give her a little slack.

977
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:13,900
Slack.

978
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,920
Welcome to chaos.

979
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,780
Bob.

980
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

981
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,280
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

982
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:20,760
Stupid!

983
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,080
White people got to straighten their own stuff out before they go around helping anybody else.

984
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:25,920
Bob.

985
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:26,500
Yeah?

986
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,760
Coming!

987
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,660
This is Bob.

988
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,200
Bob.

989
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:29,460
Bob.

990
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,180
Bob.

991
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:30,300
Bob.

992
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,160
You're wrong.

993
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,400
We are the invaders.

994
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:32,760
Bob.

995
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,520
Bob and I have been sleeping together for nearly two years.

996
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,340
Communist.

997
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,220
China's turned capitalist.

998
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,860
Well, racism at home and imperialism abroad.

999
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,660
Anything would be an improvement.

1000
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,720
American democracy doesn't exist.

1001
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,580
Morning, Bob.

1002
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,840
You gotta change the system, not the personalities.

1003
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,940
Stop the war now!

1004
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,720
Can't believe what I'm seeing on television.

1005
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,560
Bob.

1006
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,920
Oh, caca!

1007
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,100
Support all those who take up the gun against imperialism.

1008
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,560
Bob.

1009
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,520
Are you smoking?

1010
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,700
Yeah.

1011
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,600
Don't you know that stuff's counter-revolutionary?

1012
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,760
Takes your mind off the work.

1013
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,580
Monogamy is a bourgeois trait.

1014
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,300
Mm-hmm.

1015
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,860
Marriage forces dependency, lies.

1016
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,720
That was the last time I saw Bob.

1017
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,000
I sit here.

1018
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,400
I sit here.

1019
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,220
I felt impotent.

1020
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,240
The pig state and its corrupt institutions.

1021
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,800
Strike because your classes are a bore.

1022
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,980
Strike to show your opposition to the war.

1023
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,200
Revolutionary.

1024
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,580
Too many of my generation have already sold themselves to the false dreams of state.

1025
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,380
Status, material wealth, and hypocrisy.

1026
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,200
On and off the road to Bob

1027
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,180
We are marching forward blind

1028
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,140
He has gouged out both our eyes

1029
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,440
And he's laughing close

1030
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,760
behind

1031
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,220
He will sell us back

1032
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,800
Our eyes

1033
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,780
When we join his noble plan

1034
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,420
For just nineteen ninety-five

1035
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,620
And a taste of our woodland

1036
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,360
On and off the road with Bob

1037
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,340
He has handed us the wheel

1038
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,940
And he cuddles up with love

1039
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,280
As he casts himself a field

1040
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,160
Our eyes are on the road

1041
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,780
But Bob forgot to say

1042
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,120
That the steering wheel went bust

1043
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,600
The road carries us away

1044
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,420
On and off the road for Bob

1045
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,140
We forgot to say

1046
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,520
Why we came here

1047
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,260
We have quit all of our jobs

1048
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,300
Like a headlight frightened and dear

1049
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,900
He has lit the sacred pipe

1050
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,060
And he's smiling at us now

1051
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,120
On and off the road to Bob

1052
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,280
He's Bob

1053
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,240
He's our bull dada

1054
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,060
We are his town

1055
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,760
That hurt, Bob. Bob, where are you?

1056
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,640
Stop it, Bob.

1057
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1058
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,400
Hello, hello.

1059
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,120
Lead master.

1060
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,360
Huh.

1061
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,080
That was...

1062
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,900
I thought that was a bunch of chipmunks on steroids

1063
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,360
and it was bleepo, wasn't it?

1064
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,320
It was bleepo.

1065
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,180
Have you ever...

1066
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,700
Have you been hearing any radio signals lately

1067
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,000
where it seemed to digitally disappear off the air

1068
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,880
or even go backwards?

1069
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,560
Now, a live signal, even with a seven-second delay,

1070
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,620
can't go backwards, can it?

1071
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,060
I wouldn't think so.

1072
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,760
Well, then what's the problem here?

1073
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,860
It sounds like a train is rushing through the studio.

1074
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,180
I don't know.

1075
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,060
It's really all funny and, like, kind of psychedelic.

1076
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,720
It's completely broken up.

1077
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,180
It's all foobar and...

1078
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,080
Like that.

1079
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,520
That's what I was talking about.

1080
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:08,700
Yeah.

1081
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,940
And sometimes, like, spy satellites transmit those signals.

1082
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,000
Oh, or sunspots.

1083
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,800
And then they speed up and then they speed up.

1084
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,920
Yeah, sunspots.

1085
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:16,960
Sunspots, too.

1086
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:17,260
Yeah, sunspots.

1087
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:17,600
Yeah.

1088
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,840
The circular part is what tears out the average baboon's retina.

1089
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,520
I see.

1090
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,180
But we're not average baboons, are we?

1091
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,620
No.

1092
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,300
No, we are not.

1093
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:25,920
We're not.

1094
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,120
And you look over there at Stang.

1095
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,980
What a wonderful figure of a man.

1096
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,020
Some sort of...

1097
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:32,060
I mean, I don't know.

1098
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,060


1099
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,060


1100
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,060


1101
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,060


1102
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,000
He's seven feet tall.

1103
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,280
My baboon.

1104
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,820
Completely covered with green hair.

1105
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,300
He is no baboon.

1106
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,780
He is a yet, yet, yet, yet, yeti man.

1107
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,740
Silverback yeti.

1108
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,900
Silverback yeti.

1109
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,100
Ah-hoo-ga.

1110
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,680
And luckily, this one can speak, too, although right now he's fidgeting with his knobs.

1111
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,060
I love these knobs.

1112
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,300
They're so distracting and they keep me from communicating.

1113
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,300
Who's tweaking those knobs?

1114
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,940
The knobs do what I want them to.

1115
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,680
The people are all messy and chaotic and different and I can't predict them.

1116
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,400
Ah, you see the nexus, huh?

1117
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:07,760
Yes.

1118
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,120
The nexus of your mind.

1119
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,960
The people must be connected to the knobs.

1120
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,080
That's all you need, Stang.

1121
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:12,660
Yes.

1122
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:12,840
Yes.

1123
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:12,940
Yes.

1124
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,600
If I could connect the people to the knobs, everything would be controlled and neat.

1125
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,640
Yes.

1126
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,080
People, yeah.

1127
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,800
People, sure.

1128
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,620
Push this button here.

1129
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,480
Now push this button.

1130
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,580
Now push this button here.

1131
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,560
Now push this button here.

1132
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,820
It's like numbers.

1133
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,520
They always do the right thing, the thing you expect.

1134
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,760
Machines.

1135
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,040
Well, they can do that.

1136
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,000
They can break down and be a little glitchy.

1137
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:39,020
Computers are kind of like horses, but still, they're not as messy as people.

1138
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,140
I wish they knew how to listen to the music.

1139
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,280
The machines are taking over, honey.

1140
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,500
I wish.

1141
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,460
They are taking over.

1142
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,220
Why not?

1143
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,820
Why, you know, if we can invent a machine that's more intelligent and stronger and better

1144
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,360
than us, then what are we needed for?

1145
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,060
Why not just let that...

1146
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,520
Let that evolution take its course?

1147
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,260
Let's consider the idea of who's looking at what in the etymology of the old thing.

1148
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,100
What is meaning?

1149
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,440
Who needs needs if there are no...

1150
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,060
You know, it's like a tree in the forest where there are no elephants.

1151
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,800
You know what I'm saying, Stang?

1152
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,320
What's...

1153
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,340
Who dictates needs?

1154
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,500
Do the machines work for other machines?

1155
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,880
Who dictates what civilization might be?

1156
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,060
Well, whoever...

1157
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:30,180
The smartest and best, and you can tell who's smartest and best by who makes the most money.

1158
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,360
So I guess that cuts most of us right out of the picture, and that means we don't have

1159
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,660
to worry about it, does it?

1160
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,560
It means we've got slack.

1161
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,540
No, I don't have to worry about it.

1162
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,200
We don't have to worry about saving the world or ending the world because we have

1163
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,500
slack.

1164
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,120
It's not...

1165
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,980
Bob will take care of all of that for us.

1166
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:44,300
Yep.

1167
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,720
It's not a silverback that makes us superior.

1168
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,020
It's a greenback that makes us superior.

1169
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,480
Actually, it's none of those things.

1170
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:56,080
It's the mere fact that we see the inherent coolness of the Dobbs head face, the dot pattern

1171
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,160
of that classic Dobbs head, and the message that Bob has.

1172
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,160


1173
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,820
The message that Bob imparted.

1174
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,800
The message that you must repent, quit your job, and slack off while you still know how,

1175
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:15,760
because there is truly a conspiracy of the normal people out to sap your abnormality,

1176
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,420
to water you down, to make you one of them.

1177
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,580
Like them.

1178
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,300
Do you really want to be like them?

1179
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,720
Oh, it's a vast conspiracy, all right.

1180
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,260
Yeah, yeah.

1181
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,980
They're going in your gazpacho.

1182
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,140
They're going in your gazpacho.

1183
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,140


1184
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,140


1185
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,140


1186
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,140


1187
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,200
You really think you can be like them?

1188
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:32,920
That's the other thing.

1189
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,480
You probably can't anyway.

1190
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:34,880
They can't be like them.

1191
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


1192
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,660
So why bother?

1193
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,560
Why even try?

1194
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:44,140
Cut yourself some of that legendary slack that Bob's been trying to remind you about.

1195
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:54,880
You've had it, remember, before you were born, just floating in pure slack, but then, then

1196
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,120
untimely ripped and belched forth out into this devil's world.

1197
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,640
It ain't Bob's world.

1198
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,380
And slapped on the rear.

1199
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,140
Just lifted from your womb like with a pair of hand grenades strapped to it.

1200
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:08,880
It's not fair.

1201
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:09,360
It's not fair, but fairness.

1202
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,280
You're welcome to the world.

1203
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,840
You can make fairness happen, friend.

1204
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,480
Slap on it.

1205
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,380
You can force fairness.

1206
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,620
There is no justice, but you can create your own fairness.

1207
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,480
Well, after a fashion, you can.

1208
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,740
And you can find it at subgenius.com.

1209
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,560
And now we must leave because our time is soon up.

1210
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,100
We were happy to have you.

1211
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,100


1212
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,380
We have Paul Krasner as a guest tonight.

1213
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,520
You know, it's so rare that we allow anybody else in here anymore.

1214
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,380
And he was so famous, too, and yet his knuckles drags on the floor like the rest of us.

1215
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:39,680
Just like the rest of us.

1216
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,800
Just like the rest of us.

1217
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,560
That's right.

1218
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,360
Just pick a nose picker like everybody.

1219
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,520
Oh, yeah.

1220
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,380
Well, this has been Hour of Slack number 1016.

1221
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,380
Believe it or don't.

1222
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,980
You didn't know one in eight babies die and many face life.

1223
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,240
But still, your baby was born.

1224
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,380
And no one knows why.

1225
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,580
Let's find the answers together.

1226
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,000
Hey.

1227
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,480
Hey.

1228
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,180
Hey.

1229
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,320
Hey.

1230
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,220
Hey.

1231
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,100
Hey.

1232
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,440


1233
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:29,680
Hey.

1234
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:29,900


1235
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:29,980
Hey.

1236
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,360
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1237
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,480
Think about it.

1238
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,440
Who is the last guy to say to you these words?

1239
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,120
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1240
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:01,920
Who?

1241
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,640
I say, don't trade Bob for eagle stamps.

1242
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,300
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1243
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,800
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1244

00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,620
Fake your orgasms two in a row.

1246
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:55,600
I say, the ultra bizarre is a belch of the mind.

1247
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,140
I'll choke you daily.

1248
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,920
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1249
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,020
The moonies are groovy, but Bob is Bob.

1250
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,760
Bob pokes me in the eye with love.

1251
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,120
Eat your spinach, baby.

1252
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,080
Take a rubber chicken to lunch.

Fake your orgasms two in a row.

1254
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,280
The moonies are groovy

1255
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,300
But Bob

1256
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,400
Is Bob

1257
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,160
Bob pokes me in the eye

1258
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,420
Eat your spinach baby

1259
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,080

Eat your spinach baby

1262
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,480
You wanna fight?

1263
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,960
Fight with a bear

1264
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,000
Fight with a duck

1265
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,160
Fight with a wrench

Because no child should feel a fish

1270
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,760
Today we continue in our profanity that we speak

1271
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,860
And then I want to ask you to do one other thing

1272
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,400
This might seem a little out of your comfort zone

1273
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,100
But it's real simple

1274
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,740
Just stand on our heads and quack like ducks

1275
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,720
I mean, yeah

1276
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,020
I mean, yeah

1277
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,080
Do what I say

1278
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,520
Why?

1279
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,920
You know, if you're in love with a duck

1280
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,040
Who is this?

1281
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,140
What does society tell you can't do?

1282
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,160
Stand on our heads and quack like ducks

1283

1284
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,820

Barbara Bush

1289
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,380
Though maybe we could do with a little more

1290
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,220
Laura Bush

1291
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,060
In flesh

1292
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,600
Tough

1293
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,520
Hard messed up

1294
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:07,920
President

1295
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,900
Jerked off

1296
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,880
And then smacked

1297
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,700
Laura Bush

1298
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,900
They were dogs

1299
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,040
Guess what?

1300
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes

1301
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,140
You can almost hear a hint of frustration

1302
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,300
Pinky messed it up royally

1303
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,100
Smackhead

1304
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,440
Pinky dug down deep

1305
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,300
Look overhead

1306
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:22,820
Why?

1307
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,780
Wait a minute, I don't wanna do that

1308
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,320
Guess what?

1309
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,440
I can't do it

1310
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,380
Rise up now

1311
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,880
Hard Bush rises up

1312
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,500
In my opinion

1313
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,960
Would like to have marriage abolished

On the island of Sumatra

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush

1318
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,660
Have crashed into a crowded neighborhood over the weekend

1319
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,040
On this Labor Day

1320
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,560
Some travel organizations are killing at least 143 people
