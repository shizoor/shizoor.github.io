00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,660
I'm trying to make believe I'm you, oh, trying to think

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,360
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,060
People say that life is fun, but I don't know why

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,300
As far as I can tell, life sucks

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,360
Life sucks, life sucks, life sucks

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,840
Within the last 12 hours, we have received a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,340
that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomenon.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,240
Bob?

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm sick and tired of the rats

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,160
But you don't wait

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm sick and tired of the rats

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm sick and tired of the rats

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm sick and tired of the rats

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,100


15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,100

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,140
F spider

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,140

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,140


19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,140

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,260

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,260


26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,020
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,280
We will control the vertical.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,840
We will control the vertical.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,140
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,620
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of swag.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,440
Chris Bob, help me somebody.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,520
The church of the subgenius.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,540
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

34
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,000
quality audio visual techniques,

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,240
exacerbated and complicated by the church of the subgenius.

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,840
Dr. Spurman.

39
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,960
She said,

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,320
cutting her own legs off,

41
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,420
what was to be the foment of a startling trend among the so-called punk detail.

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,900
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

43
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,440
Enjoy life like Bob.

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,800
Get the head,

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,120
not be afraid.

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm not here to harm you.

47
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,220
I know you want to destroy me,

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
but listen,

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,000
please listen.

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,480
I only want to help you.

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,220
I've chosen you.

52
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:39,960
Well,

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm sure that's very flattering,

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,760
but I must get on with my work now.

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,640
They don't love you,

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:45,820
Bob.

57
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,180
They don't love you like I do.

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,040
Dear friends,

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,260
you may call 823-711-8233.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,260


61
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,260


62
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,260


63
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,260

00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,260

00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,920
7, 4, 9, 0.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,760
For a complete explanation of the Church of the Subgenius in under two minutes.

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,380
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,440
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,560
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,020
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
It's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents.

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,860
And then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

74
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,780
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches

75
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,800
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,600
It's not just the anesthesiologist for knee-deep.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,140
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,060
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car hood.

80
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,800
It's not just that the old ways were best.

81
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,060
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

82
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,300
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,280
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,780
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

85
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,180
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

86
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,320
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a b-

87
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,220
who thinks workers are property.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

89
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,620
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature

90
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,940
without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in mid-South.

91
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,460
It's not just the

92
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,340
It's not just the doorway to doom.

93
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,960
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,100
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,860
No, dear.

96
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,080
Dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

97
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,820
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,880
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,380
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

100
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,780
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there,

101
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,320
if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

102
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,380
Not off.

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,180
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
In his back pocket.

105
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,640
Just you try it.

106
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,900
Thanks to...

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,340
G Gordon Gordon for that one, and this is Reverend Cleve Duncan.

108
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,220
Well, there once was a man

109
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,760
There once was a man

110
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,800
The world's greatest salesman

111
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
A salesman

112
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,120
And he had to pass the pain

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,460
To get the shackles from my feet

114
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,700
I am a man, he's gone

115
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,540
A martyr for the cause of this world

116
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,760
No one

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,460
No one

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:26,940


123
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:26,940


124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:26,940


125
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:26,940

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:26,940

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:26,940


136
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,500
No one

137
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,160
Mer najow

138
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,040

144
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
Since

145
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,940
No one

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,280
Ever listened

147
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,120
There ain't much

148
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,220
Come on

149
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,320
The never-�데-cha beforehand

150
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,040
The ever-lasting

151
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,040


152
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,820
He called you

153
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,420
The ever-lasting

154
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,800
With the power of God

155
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,500
My bard

156
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,300
Your cukuz

157
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,060
He can save us from the men in black

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,460
We're just a shot from his mighty sack

159
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,740
If only he could make it back

160
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,640
From the land of the dead

161
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,820
But until that happy day

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,340
We can only drink and say

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,160
Father, follow

164
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,760
And it's coming again

165
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,860
I know he can make it

166
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,780
Without him we can't take it

167
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,020
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

168
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,820
To the pink boys and the whims

169
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,040
Until the day that he comes back

170
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
It'll be a world without sack

171
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,280
Father, follow

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,860
And it's coming again

173
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,960
And it's coming again

174
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,700
And it's coming again

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:08,140
And it's coming again

176
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:51,700
And it's coming again

177
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:21,140
And it's coming again

178
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:51,740
And it's coming again

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:04,600
And it's coming again

180
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,740
And it's coming again

181
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,520
And it's coming again

182
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:51,740
And it's coming again

183
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:06,480
And it's coming again

184
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:34,300
And it's coming again

185
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,140
And it's coming again

And it's coming again

188
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,400
And it's coming again

189
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
And it's coming again

190
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,080
And it's coming again

191
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,820
And it's coming again

192
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,640
And it's coming again

193
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
And it's coming again

194
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
And it's coming again

195
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,740
And it's coming again

196
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,240
And it's coming again

197
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,500
So, ordinary folks

198
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:16,020
We're just a shot form

199
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,500
From his mighty sack

200
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,540
And it's coming again

201
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,540


202
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,740
We're just a shot from his mighty sack

203
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,940
happiness, or guilt.

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,180
I don't know.

205
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,540
We now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years,

206
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,760
were actually only acting happy.

207
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,080
But living that lie just compounded their misery.

208
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,420
And millions of people do this to themselves

209
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,240
because they think God is as ignorant, intolerant, and insecure as they are.

210
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,500
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.

211
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,700
Hiding their real feelings, living a lie,

212
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,700
deliberately short-circuiting their instincts,

213
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,180
pretending.

214
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,500
That's what they do.

215
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,640
They're pretending, friends.

216
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,880
Now, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending,

217
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,960
but, you know, in a way, they pretend much, much worse than we do.

218
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,560
So, when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk,

219
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,740
remember that at least I'm being honest.

220
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,760
If I'm beat, worn out,

221
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,200
I don't take speed like Tammy Baker to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.

222
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,060
I act like I feel.

223
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,680
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as...

224
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,200
as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.

225
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,620
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

226
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,820
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.

227
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,260
He doesn't need to forgive me because I didn't do anything evil.

228
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,840
I screwed up.

229
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,260
And Bob, Bob loves me for that.

230
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,160
It's the power to fail, friends.

231
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,660
It's the power that the subgenius popes have,

232
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,680
and these rival popes can't ever have.

233
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,960
And the irony, friends, the irony.

234
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,500
It's like with the pledge drives.

235
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,000
The hour of slack listeners are 50% paid up right now,

236
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,000
or probably more by now.

237
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,640
But yet, now those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged.

238
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,840
They pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith.

239
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,100
And only 10%, at best,

240
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,160
in some cases 6%, bothered to fulfill the commitment.

241
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,300
Because in Christianity, pretending and promising is good enough.

242
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,380
And that's what faith means, friends.

243
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,740
It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter what.

244
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,480
Because you're going to pretend everything's okay.

245
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,320
Oh, it's God's will.

246
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,540
So therefore, you don't have to do anything about it.

247
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,660
Leave it to God, dear friends.

248
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Grace through faith, not works.

249
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,680
Jesus said, be like children.

250
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,180
And, you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without keeping her fake eyelashes,

251
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,660
her bat-winged sunglasses.

252
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,920
Fake eyelashes on.

253
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,040
I read that in the paper today.

254
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,600
That's how you keep your husband.

255
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,060
Wear makeup to bed.

256
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,620
Pretending, friends.

257
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,380
Yeah, they're like children, all right.

258
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,080
But they're like 7th grade children.

259
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
Cruel, gossiping liars and bullies

260
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,080
that roam in cliques and packs looking for weak, unsuspecting minority victims.

261
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,900
Oh, they have faith, all right.

262
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,700
Faith that any nasty thing they do didn't count

263
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,360
if God forgave it in their head.

264
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,380
And if you're having the kind of fun they can't experience,

265
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,020
then you must.

266
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,580
That must be.

267
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:20,860
That must be sin.

268
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,340
Because in their eyes, friends, slack is the ultimate sin.

269
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,300
The devil hates slack, too.

270
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
And when you look at the basic beliefs and behavior

271
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,720
of a lot of these fundamentalist Christians,

272
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,460
they have a lot in common with the devil, friends.

273
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,900
A whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus.

274
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,220
Now, subgenius is rationalized, too,

275
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,440
but our rationalization is so absurd

276
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,300
that it allows us, the slack, to remember that it's just a rationalization

277
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,980
and there's still work to do.

278
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,260
Praise Bob.

279
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,480
Oh, God.

280
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,940
Here's this Tammy Baker interview.

281
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,980
Yes, she rarely goes to bed without her makeup,

282
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,460
swears by her false eyelashes,

283
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,920
and wears different wigs for her husband, Jim.

284
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,120
And that still wasn't good enough, was it?

285
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,500
No, Jessica Hahn, she didn't have to change wigs every night.

286
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,920
Jim very seldom seen me without makeup

287
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,500
and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.

288
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,280
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes.

289
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,660
Yeah, I think natural-born eyelashes are kind of...

290
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,140
kind of good, too.

291
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,160
They keep the water out of your eyes.

292
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,140
The sweat.

293
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,840
If you're inhuman enough to sweat, unlike Miss Tammy.

294
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,340
Um, oh, God.

295
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,500
Well, I've got more of that rant to go on,

296
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
but in the meantime, until then.

297
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
And let me tell you, friends,

298
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,100
it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

299
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,940
It's not just the truncated attention spans of the conspiracy glorps.

300
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,560
Scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.

301
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,020
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like models posing on cue.

302
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,600
It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the hell-spawned image consultants.

303
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,300
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

304
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,520
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

305
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,660
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

306
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:20,660


307
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,880
It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, man.

308
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,960
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest.

309
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,120
It's not just the talentless pinks hooked into a groove devoid of style.

310
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,100
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.

311
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,480
It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.

312
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,220
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.

313
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,520
It's not just the frothy mouths.

314
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,660
It's not just the reactionaries.

315
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,260
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.

316
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,080
It's not just the empty youth culture borrowing from the ABC computerized format of possible personas.

317
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,120
It's that and a whole lot more.

318
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,840
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

319
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,980
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

320
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,180
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

321
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,640
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

322
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:20,660
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

323
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,960
Let's join us now, shall we?

324
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,840
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.

325
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,460
Thank you.

326
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,620
Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.

327
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,540
The Japanese...

328
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,260
Don't you wish you were with us?

329
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,080
Well, send in your money and maybe someday you can.

330
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,060
No, really, we're a fun crowd.

331
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,180
You'd like us to move in next door to you.

332
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,400
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

333
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,620
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eyes.

334
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,880
A smile or a leer on our lips.

335
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,220
But otherwise, we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale.

336
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,900
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man.

337
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,380
Ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring.

338
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,540
How about it, America? Get in step.

339
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,220
Well, let's try now, huh?

340
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,460
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be...

341
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,440
What's going on? I feel so sneaky!

342
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,060
Disobedient to parents. A subgenius.

343
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,000
Steals. A subgenius.

344
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,460
Lies. A subgenius.

345
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,360
Hater of God. A subgenius.

346
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,100
Whisperer. A subgenius.

347
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,340
Whoremonger. A subgenius.

348
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,860
Envious. A subgenius.

349
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,400
Pride. A subgenius.

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,120
A backbiter. A subgenius.

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,880
A deceitful person. A subgenius.

352
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,600
A hypocrite. A subgenius.

353
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
Unmerciful. A subplenius.

354
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,020
A false accuser. A subpenius.

355
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,080
Come here, you little subgenius.

356
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,980
Well, I guess that about wraps it up. That's your typical subgenius.

357
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,100
And, um...

358
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,280
Monk, I don't need Dobbs. There's nothing wrong with me. I'll make it my way.

359
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,020
Oh, good. Good.

360
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,880
I must have been insane. What can I say? I'm lost without Dobbs.

361
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,400
Good for you.

362
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,060
Without Bob, I'm guilty. Guilty!

363
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,520
Two side sheets.

364
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,300
Be not deceived. Dobbs is not mocked, though whosoever a man soeth.

365
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,280
Him also shall he reach.

366
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,160
Who is my shepherd? I shall not want.

367
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
That's right, dear friends.

368
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,040
That's right.

369
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,040
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.

370
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,860
This is Jester Jackson of the Rainbow Coalition.

371
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,940
It concerns me that the American people have been lied to.

372
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,680
Lied to about the secret war in Central America.

373
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,340
Lied to about your support for racist South Africa.

374
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,480
Our government should be funding cities and housing the homeless, not supporting fascism and waging illegal wars.

375
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,900
Join me in a march on Saturday, April 25th in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.

376
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,900
Help forge a new direction for the American people.

377
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,180
Help bring about justice and peace in Central America and Southern Africa.

378
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,760
March in a big way and in big numbers on April 25th.

379
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,380
I hate that old conspiracy as much as it needs me.

380
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,060
But me and Bob will get them.

381
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,920
Just you wait and see.

382
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,600
For as long as they have run things, they have turned them into...

383
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:08,900
Bob?

384
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,820
The time has come to get them back.

385
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,560
Here's how I look at it.

386
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,080
That conspiracy is nasty.

387
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
And they take us for their patsies.

388
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,920
But we know that they are just a bunch of queers.

389
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,060
And when we defeat them, we will kill them and we'll eat them.

390
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,540
And then we'll go and get ourselves some beers.

391
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,060
Now Bob has come to fight them.

392
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,420
That's how we know we'll win.

393
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,120
And we know to serve them is our only sin.

394
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,840
We won't have long to wait now.

395
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
The end is coming soon.

396
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
We'll march happy toward the future.

397
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,880
Cause we did what we must do.

398
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,500
Underwater vacations.

399
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,740
Bob will rule all the nations.

400
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,500
We'll be farming vegetation out on Mars.

401
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,140
Cause we killed them and we ate them.

402
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,580
Said boy we sure did hate them.

403
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,980
And then we made the rounds of all the bars.

404
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,600
Thank you Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

405
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,360
Great stuff.

406
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,060
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

407
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,080
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?

408
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,660
We never make fun of religion.

409
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,840
You must understand we're making money off religion but not fun off religion.

410
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,380
No. No. No. No fun.

411
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,940
We hope to erase the slack area in this part of the country.

412
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,740
And hopefully we'll...

413
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,160
Yes, sir.

414
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,940
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks or do you...

415
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,520
Mr. Wilsey, isn't it a fact really that you've invented this whole thing,

416
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,160
that you've thought up all these little gimmicks,

417
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,860
and you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people by getting money out of them?

418
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,460
People who believe in you and your silly preachings?

419
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
No it isn't, Joe.

420
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,620
The Illuminati will be unmasked.

421
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,920
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that.

422
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:17,280
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it,

423
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,500
the guys that drive up and down the streets selling ice cream, all of that will be exposed.

424
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,400
That's what America needs.

425
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,020
They have their brains washed.

426
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,120
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear and all that sickness and perversion

427
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,080
and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell.

428
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,780
...radio announcer and many friends of the rail land,

429
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,900
it's the old fashioned healing broadcast coming direct from the auditorium.

430
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,660
This is a special night tonight.

431
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,800
This is oil night.

432
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,140
Would you love to have a heart like God?

433
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,360
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil that God has let me use for quite a few years now.

434
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,840
And we're giving it out.

435
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,440
Come and join the hundreds of people.

436
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,380
Bring that bottle and get some of this miracle oil that's absolutely raised the dead,

437
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,500
has performed some of the greatest miracles, you name it.

438
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,920
It's performed every known miracle that's happening.

439
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,320
But look, it's...

440
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,040
No, Hal, look out!

441
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,240
You clumsy fool!

442
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
What have you done?

443
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,120
The show is ruined!

444
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,920
Ruined!

445
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,300
Goodbye for all of us here.

446
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,260
This is Puzzle Inn and it's Loebius Rex, Reverend Hal and Reverend Irv.

447
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,860
We tried.

448
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,620
Saying it's too late and we trumphed.

449
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,680
Goodbye, folks. I don't know how it works.

450
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,640
The whole thing's ridiculous.

451
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,400
The U.S. Customs Service is waging war on drug smugglers,

452
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
and you can help.

453
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,300
If you see any unusual activity involving private boats or planes

454
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,340
that might be connected to drug smuggling,

455
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,200
call the U.S. Customs Service 24 hours a day, toll free, at 1-800-BE-ALERT.

456
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,400
You can remain anonymous and you could receive a cash reward

457
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,400
if your information leads to the arrest and prosecution of drug smugglers.

458
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,280
Help stop drug smuggling.

459
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,680
Call 1-800-BE-ALERT.

460
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,220
I can't believe they gave me that cart to play on this show, honest to God.

461
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
Well, if you want to get...

462
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,100
If you want to be damned by Bob...

463
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,320
Let's talk about another language that's been spirited.

464
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,060
Try to control you.

465
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,200
Do you think...

466
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,800
Do you think that freedom for this great society, this great planet, is voting?

467
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,040
Say no.

468
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,940
Didn't they get to vote in Haiti?

469
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,820
Say yes.

470
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
Didn't they get to vote in the Philippines?

471
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,900
Don't they get to vote in Poland?

472
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,600
Say yes.

473
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,600
Joe, did they get to vote?

474
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,060
Do you think they'll go over there and plug out Libra when there's only one man in the East?

475
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,900
Say no.

476
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,220
But this is what the rest of the world perceives as freedom, it is...

477
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,260
consumer goods.

478
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,380
More specifically, American consumer goods.

479
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,280
And children, we're drowning in consumer goods.

480
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,880
We're drowning in them.

481
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
It's a fake economy.

482
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,460
But children, when you hear the 501 Blues and your heart sings,

483
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,480
when you see Spud McKenzie, then high concept is getting inside of you, children.

484
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,040
It's getting inside of you.

485
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,620
Now, I know, you're all artists, you're all hip, you're all aware.

486
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,640
You're a bunch of deconstructing thieves.

487
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,480
I know that, children.

488
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,360
I know you can sit there and watch those ads and you can say,

489
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
Ooh, look at that jump cut.

490
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,280
Woo!

491
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,600
Look at that computer animation.

492
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,200
Woo!

493
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,420
Look at that key lighting.

494
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,640
And you think by deconstructing it, you kept the message from getting into you.

495
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,060
But I'm going to tell you something, children.

496
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm right here, I'm here to tell you that.

497
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,500
We are not that sort.

498
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,360
That's right, children.

499
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,440
We're not that sort.

500
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,440
We are not able to resist those messages.

501
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,460
They get inside of us.

502
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,840
They work it up.

503
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,340
And before you know it, you're another mind-death-duder.

504
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,820
I'll be the conspiracy.

505
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,780
I'm going to give you another example, children.

506
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,080
They say that in the NFL, between steroids and weightlifting,

507
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:23,080
the football player can run so big and so fast that the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

508
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,380
And the same thing is true by analogy, by extensive by metaphor.

509
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,620
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer resist.

510
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,420
We cannot retain our will.

511
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,280
We cannot make a specific judgment.

512
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,160
We cannot simply act the other way.

513
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,320
We cannot do anything.

514
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
I've heard of the details.

515
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,840
But we can do everything we want from them.

516
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,200
And the truth is that if we just act the risk, because they become 상태 pulling on the

517
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,480
Earth, divide us into deuces.

518
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:01,620
Because we have to resist those very distinct orders, and these orders get us stuck.

519
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:01,620


520
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,000
Within belief and those orders, we keep ourselves higher.

521
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Within power we get up higher.

522
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,420
We can be tomorrow.

523
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,760
We can experience hope.

524
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,920
We can have the world in a�

525
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,640
�

526
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,780
them a thousand times.

527
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,280
by extensive by metaphor in the world of advertising,

528
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,040
the images they generate are so slick,

529
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,040
we can no longer resist.

530
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,860
We cannot retain our will.

531
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,740
We cannot make a specific judgment.

532
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,860
We cannot simply accept the messages.

533
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,100
Oh, boy, I have to cut in here.

534
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,200
Oh, that was Pope David Meyer two weeks ago

535
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,680
in Boston, Massachusetts.

536
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,860
Pretty soon I ought to have a better recording

537
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,940
of all the rants from there.

538
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,400
Janer was there, a whole bunch of good stuff.

539
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,960
Anyway, I had to cut in because

540
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,540
the Will of Dobs just got a call from someone

541
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,740
who said that they had called the cult awareness group.

542
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,060
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness

543
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,120
and had called them up just to see what they would say

544
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,680
about the Church of the Subgenius.

545
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,400
And the funny thing is that when they first opened,

546
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,860
I called them up and said,

547
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,400
yeah, I'm kind of concerned about these insane cults myself,

548
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,820
and I thought I'd send you some of our material

549
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,320
and...

550
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,680
And so you could, you know, you can refer people to us.

551
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,280
And they, apparently, they didn't like the material I sent.

552
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,700
I'd never heard from them since then,

553
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
but they're now telling people,

554
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,960
whatever you do, stay away from those guys.

555
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,540
That subgenius guy, man, that's the worst, I guess.

556
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,720
And especially, what, keep your kids away from them?

557
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,900
Especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius

558
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,220
because of the sexually explicit material.

559
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,540
Now, see, y'all that only listen to the radio show,

560
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,260
you don't know what...

561
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,620
Yeah!

562
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,920
Yeah!

563
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,040
You don't know what you're missing!

564
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,380
Woo!

565
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,660
And who don't order the tapes.

566
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,180
But I can't advertise that stuff,

567
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,720
and all you can really do is write for information

568
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,740
from P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214

569
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,320
for more information about Church of the Subgenius.

570
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,300
And for that sexually explicit material,

571
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,020
which you don't get for free, by the way.

572
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,460
Not like, I mean, you get this radio show for free

573
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,760
and you can get our information for free.

574
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,300
And it's not...

575
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,720
It's not very sexually explicit.

576
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,360
But, like I say, you...

577
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,740
Those of you who've been putting off

578
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,540
writing to P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, 75214,

579
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,200
fine, I don't care.

580
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,180
Honestly, I really don't.

581
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,440
I always end up getting the last laugh, dear friends.

582
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,400
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.

583
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,860
So, you know, I can't tell you what the deal is.

584
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,340
With the money, but...

585
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,620
Get some money!

586
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,520
That dirty, perky, shark-backed, flackin',

587
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,020
wharton, filibuster-barton, perky-loom-a...

588
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,200
Only we know what we don't know.

589
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,380
And when we do know it, we shall find out later

590
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,760
just exactly what it was that we didn't know.

591
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,420
But, in the meantime, we shall experiment further

592
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,500
and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind

593
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,840
to find out exactly what it is that we don't know.

594
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:05,840


595
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:05,840


596
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:05,840


597
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,320
What causes this device not to function properly?

598
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,040
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?

599
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,820
Or the nose gland?

600
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,780
Yes, possibly you did not know

601
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,540
that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human body.

602
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,840
And only after permanent foot and nose glandscaping

603
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,920
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run.

604
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,260
Ah!

605
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,720
Which would mean...

606
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,980
Possibly that you were backwards or built upside down.

607
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,840
But, you'll delve further into that

608
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,160
at the end of the broadcast

609
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,400
when you and I cannot hear each other.

610
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,260
That was Dr. Philo Drummond, dear friends.

611
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,680
And we can get into this, too.

612
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,560
The psychoneurotic mastosurgery,

613
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,960
the techniques of which has been developed

614
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,560
by the many great doctors

615
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,640
who have come over to...

616
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,500
Dobbs and from many of the other religious cults around the world.

617
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,400
Maybe the same as I had my frontal lobotomy.

618
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,600
And it's...

619
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,340
We've got Europeans and Lithuanians

620
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,780
and ice doctors and the big doctors

621
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,820
and the doctors of the trees

622
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,020
and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.

623
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,640
We've got a song about doctors.

624
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,760
And here...

625
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,080
Hypercletes.

626
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,240
Here it is.

627
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,800
Hypercletes.

628
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,920
Doctors.

629
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,640
Doctors.

630
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,040
For Bob.

631
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,280
Doctors for Bob

632
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,880
and everything real in my life.

633
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,120
Bob.

634
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,300
Yeah.

635
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,120
Doctors and Bob

636
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,600
and everything real in my life.

637
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,860
Oh, real in my life.

638
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,660
Damn pickup truck come out blue

639
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,680
done run over my wife.

640
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,420
Yeah.

641
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,760
He's got the blues

642
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,580
cause they run over his wife.

643
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,680
Some of you gonna get mad at me.

644
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,620
Jesus ain't in the church.

645
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Don't turn the radio off.

646
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,340
Keep it on.

647
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,560
And I wouldn't infer that

648
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,600
that our secondary state

649
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,340
is Antichrist.

650
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,960
But I'm telling you that

651
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,920
preparations are being made

652
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,600
and that the very

653
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,140
the very door of the day

654
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,360
of the wrath of God is at hand.

655
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,260
And that if you plan to get saved

656
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,400
you'd better do it now.

657
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,880
There will be a day

658
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,420
not in the too far distant future

659
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,620
in which Antichrist will be revealed

660
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,840
and the mark of the beast

661
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,780
will be introduced

662
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,580
and people will have a number

663
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,100
in their hand and in their forehead.

664
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,080
They'll be given a computerized number

665
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,900
if you please

666
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,120
that will entice you.

667
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120


668
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120


669
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120


670
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120


671
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120


672
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,120


673
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,520
I don't have to do business in this world

674
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,540
and with how you can starve.

675
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,280
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

676
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,840
Boy you aren't kidding.

677
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,140
And that's the way I've felt for quite a while.

678
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,320
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

679
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,120
You bet honey.

680
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,020
That's what we're gonna try to do.

681
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,980
I've never flown a city before.

682
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,640
Well.

683
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,420
What did you think?

684
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,100
I think Bill passed the ten dollar bridge.

685
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,080
The original concept was that

686
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,280
throughout history all great geniuses

687
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,000
had somebody at their side

688
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,720
that was kind of steering them.

689
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,500
You know what I mean?

690
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,820
So you say that person is a sub-genius?

691
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,140
That was the sub-genius.

692
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,420
He was the guy that was really

693
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,960
He was making sure the genius was used

694
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,200
to his proper potential.

695
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:56,880
Right.

696
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
And for the right reasons.

697
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,100


698
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,040
That's why the name is misleading you know.

699
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Now I want you to hear a little of the service

700
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,560
where the Holy Spirit was using me

701
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,180
with the gift of discernment.

702
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,380
I was ministering in the spirit.

703
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,640
God was showing me things about people I didn't know

704
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,240
I'd never seen before but the Lord was talking to me.

705
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,160
God was talking and I was walking.

706
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,120
Listen to a little of this right now.

707
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,900
And you have come to the end of your rope.

708
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,620
Oh.

709
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,280
I don't know which way to turn.

710
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,340
Give me money.

711
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,460
It's starting to affect your nerves.

712
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,120
Give me money.

713
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,560
Give me money.

714
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,560


715
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,560


716
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,260
I'm expecting my mind.

717
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,520
I'm expecting my mind.

718
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,240
I want to kill my husband.

719
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,940
Today we're going to put this in the hand of God.

720
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,740

Pastor Eppley, save my life.

725
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,800
I'm going to give you a handful.

726
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,380
Save my life.

727
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm going to pour it in this envelope.

728
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,560
Ha ha.

729

768
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,320
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound,

769
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,940
the subgenius foot doubles as a gland,

770
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,600
and a very complex gland at that.

771
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,340
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?

772
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,120
It treats you the way you need to be treated

773
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,960
by intuiting the world around you

774
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,420
so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.

775
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,380
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond,

776
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,140
and he best explained its functioning

777
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,000
in this excerpt from his daily radio show,

778
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,120
On the Road, so named because it is simply recorded

779
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,820
in a car.

780
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,500
Or money.

781
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,940
Self-worth.

782
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,140
Or money.

783
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,020
To love people because they need it.

784
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,560
Or their money.

785
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,920
I believe it's something God puts in us.

786
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,320
Or what else does God put in us?

787
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,320
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?

788
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,400
Yeah.

789
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,060
Yeah.

790
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,160
Oh, we could truly know nothing only.

791
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,700
Reinforcing the powers of the brain and foot gland

792
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,100
is a small secondary process.

793
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,860
The brain at the base of the subgenius spine,

794
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,720
the mighty stegosaurus,

795
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,820
also possessed this organ,

796
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,740
which made it tweet like a bird.

797
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,960
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems

798
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,640
that are so important to us.

799
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,160
Another gland unknown to normals

800
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,100
is the peen gland in the brain,

801
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,180
which regulates the eight separate stages

802
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,300
or character generations

803
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,360
through which the subgenius personality evolves

804
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,660
during an average day.

805
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
Literally eight different personalities

806
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,600
each have control at the jessie helm

807
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,280
of behavior at varying intervals.

808
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,320
We each contain eight people

809
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,700
in our corrugated, rugated subconsciousness.

810
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,680
The actual average human has but four.

811
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,400
Good, bad, bland, and asleep.

812
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,160
The last thought by some scholars

813
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,600
to overpower the others for up to 18 hours a day.

814
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,080
These different personalities account for the

815
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,540
compartmentalization of the subgenius brain

816
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,580
into eight distinct units or efficiencies

817
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,860
in the descending order of control.

818
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,800
First the left brain, the peen brain,

819
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,260
Of course.

820
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,280
which controls paranoia, anal compulsion,

821
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,620
overwork, trying too hard,

822
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,520
Social sobriety.

823
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,420
and thinking too much.

824
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,260
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain.

825
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,600
It handles jobs and money.

826
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,320
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain,

827
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,220
which covers the gray and limbic areas

828
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,800
of speech, writing, and lying.

829
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,480
Then the hind brain, the me brain,

830
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,060
the pivotal center brain,

831
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,620
the private you rides piggyback on the lord

832
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,620
and is infected by drugs or religion.

833
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,080
Bob comes in on this channel.

834
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,500
Then the forebrain, the sane brain,

835
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,860
which covers love, friendship,

836
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,840
traditional family values called by some the tame brain.

837
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,060
The inner brain or sex brain is self-explanatory.

838
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,500
Finally the right brain or lame brain or more brain

839
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,660
depending on your orientation, intuitive, art, music, drug addiction.

840
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,540
And the eighth brain, the outer brain,

841
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,440
is a pseudo-physical shell,

842
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,840
encasing not only the other brains but the entire body.

843
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,740
This diffuse brain, larger but far less controllable

844
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,440
than the others, is the nenta life.

845
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,040
The nenta life represents fully half of our brain power.

846
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,480
But because it is so independent from us,

847
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,020
we can rarely make use of it.

848
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,780
Occasionally a subgenius comes along

849
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,200
whose nenta life is incorporated into his thinking processes.

850
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,500
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci,

851
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,820
Einstein and Curran.

852
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,380
Or Lee Howard.

853
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,240
For most of us, however, the nenta life is a separate entity,

854
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,840
a semi-conscious ghost twin

855
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,020
which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about

856
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,480
but remains dormant throughout most of our lives.

857
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,500
Thus, for us-

858
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,640
to all beings,

859
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:54,800
science and fandas,

860
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:54,820


861
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:54,820


862
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,860
Great big heaping buckets of holy and pure

863
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,200
Bob the Lord is here

864
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,080
Yeah, we're singing a praise to Bob

865
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,920
Cause he's done a mighty fine job

866
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,500
Cause I'm slopped up and silly

867
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,720
Like a rip headed slob

868
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,160
And all I got to think is Bob

869
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,140
And Ivan Stang

870
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,240
And all I got to think is Bob

871
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,580
And Dr. Doo

872
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,160
And all I got to think is Bob

873
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,660
G. Gorg?

874
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,140
And all I got to think is Bob

875
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,440
And everybody

876
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,400
You can trust me

877
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,400
I'm Dr. Ivan Stang

878
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,620
And I'm prepared to take your money

879
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,060
And give you back your slob

880
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,260
So you can believe in me

881
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,880
I'm Ivan Stang

882
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,740
I never lie

883
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,940
And I'm always right

884
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,560
It extends throughout the rules

885
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,420
And has to do with the

886
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,720
Dying of a Libyan

887
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,760
It has to do with glass paintings

888
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,420
It has to do with

889
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,940
The public evidence

890
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,260
It has to do with

891
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,500

It has to do with

897
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,220


898
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,340
It has to do with

899
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,160

900
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,000
It has to do with

901
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,120
The gas is over for me

902
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,680
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

903
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,700
Well, we're coming down,

904
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,340
getting sorta close to the end of the hour there.

905
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,600
And I'm gonna continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy on the radio,

906
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,400
specifically here on the Hour of Slack, a couple of weeks ago.

907
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,600
Now, you have to understand, friends, that being a jerk,

908
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,760
that's my outlet for artistic, I mean, religious expression.

909
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:13,500
After all, most preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness,

910
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,820
orneriness, corniness,

911
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,320
and a sort of, you know,

912
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,580
posed intolerance.

913
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,480
And I also use stupidity and,

914
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
uh, uh, and especially cantankerousness.

915
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,340
I can't really, you know, I can't relax unless I'm being cantankerous

916
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,700
and inflicting my personal bile and spleen on others.

917
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,240
It's hate, dear friends,

918
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,760
and you wouldn't interfere with my right to hate to do my own thing, now would you?

919
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,780
This is a free country.

920
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,040
And besides, how can you, since I'm the one that's transmitting and you're only receiving?

921
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,000
Only receiving, friends,

922
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,660
does that insult you, like last time?

923
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,260
Well, good!

924
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,780
That shows that I'm succeeding in, in, uh, in doing Bob's assignment

925
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,100
of getting you to stop letting the conspiracy,

926
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,520
or even subgenius preachers, push you around.

927
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,000
This obscure church would be the next Inquisition,

928
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,000
where I'm not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness

929
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,900
to be in a continuous state of, not merely defensiveness, but outright rebellion.

930
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,980
And if you let me get any more,

931
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,560
the more abusive I'll have to kill you,

932
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,940
cause you'll deserve it!

933
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,160
It's like, I'm, I'm like an anti-role model.

934
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,320
That's what most subgeni-

935
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,180
all subgeniuses should be, anti-role models.

936
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,360
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang!

937
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:38,840
You, you mock my total disregard for the, the broadcast niceties.

938
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,480
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?

939
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,020
Have you even got a girlfriend yet, huh?

940
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,960
Oh, I, my jibes have.

941
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,020
But barely begun.

942
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,260
I could, I could rant a paragraph to you

943
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,900
that would have every one of you listeners jumping off a high bridge

944
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,900
to escape the mocking truth wielded by my tongue.

945
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,220
Or Janeer's.

946
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,120
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay.

947
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,500
I was a gentle man at one time.

948
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,280
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.

949
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,260
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon,

950
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,960
then you'd best urinate in fear at the thought of what I could dish out to you.

951
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,880
To the innocent and guilty alike.

952
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,700
For as my mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me,

953
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,520
none are so blind as those who have no eyes.

954
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:32,540
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyant visions

955
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,620
hath played out but the first move in a galactic game

956
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,320
on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.

957
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,000
Congratulations, dear friends.

958
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,860
You've now entered kindergarten in the School of Terror.

959
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,820
Oh, don't worry. It won't kill you.

960
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,300
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence from decreasing

961
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,020
at the same pace as your peers.

962
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,320
But, uh, but at what cost, dear listener?

963
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,820
At what cost?

964
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,280
At what cost?

965
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,980
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.

966
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,140
Ha! Oh, surprise you, nay.

967
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,640
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.

968
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,860
More than you could ever imagine.

969
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,100
In your wildest LSD dreams.

970
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,520
Fine! Go ahead, kill me!

971
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,560
You would-be Judases and Luthors!

972
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,500
Make your blindingly imbecilic move,

973
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:32,460
your mere-hume attempt to wrest controls from the claws of this Stang demon you hallucinate.

974
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,880
Death would be but a step up in my ascension to ultimate power.

975
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,240
Next to Bob, of course.

976
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,820
And have you not guessed that certain contingency plans have been laid?

977
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,240
Thinketh you not of the children of the Stang?

978
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,420
Oh, I've read my Frank Herbert closely.

979
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,480
The Atreides conspiracy is but a high school prank

980
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,200
compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang octopus.

981
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:02,820
Oh, your science fiction has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.

982
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,200
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six

983
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,280
have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens

984
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,980
which will render all your weapons, all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes impotent.

985
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,460
Utterly impotent.

986
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,620
Kill Stang One, and the Emperor Xandar is unchained.

987
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,060
And at that point, you can kiss your world, your human society,

988
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,000
your innocent subgenius church goodbye forever.

989
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,860
Or perhaps, if by some accident of God, the Emperor Xandar were eliminated,

990
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,500
oh, then you would face the Tev One.

991
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,620
And do you think they're my only offspring?

992
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,740
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?

993
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,620
Just as Darth Vader's son Luke was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence,

994
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:56,580
do you think that I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?

995
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,620
Oh, no indeed, dear friends. No indeedy, I say.

996
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,320
But you'll see.

997
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,620
Well, stay tuned for Ron Lindsey.

998
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,460
You've been listening to King Stang.

999
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,900
Ultimate stud groupie attractor and mystic psychic power monger.

1000
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,720
The very left brain of Dobbs.

1001
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,940
The chosen bringer, dear friends of terror and lawsuits.

1002
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,520
Owner of the trademark of God on Earth.

1003
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,620
Slayer of would-be scribe ship usurpers.

1004
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,260
Subjector of all bobbies.

1005
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,140
Decider of degrees of fame of subgenius mortals.

1006
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,240
Second chosen of the fishers of wallets.

1007
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,880
Biggest, organed, and sexiest voiced entrapper of radio groupies.

1008
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,440
Subduer of hecklers, but splitter of moonies.

1009
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,680
Exploiter of comedic idiot savants.

1010
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,560
Master of the sardonic over the cute.

1011
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,800
Violator of postal...

1012
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Oh, forget it.

1013
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,320
Anyway, okay, okay, don't rush me. Stop, stop, stop.

1014
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,160
Sister Chris asked me to come down here for an experiment.

1015
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,400
She asked me to listen to the Church of the Subgenius cassette and, and...

1016
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,040
I don't know, she said something like she wanted a normal reaction.

1017
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,900
Well, that didn't sound normal to me.

1018
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,820
Least of all, it sounded like a church.

1019
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,420
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring?

1020
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,660
I mean, I could hardly understand what went on there.

1021
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,140
I mean, was it, was it meant to be funny or what?

1022
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,320
I mean, come on, tell me, is it serious?

1023
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,040
Like, you know, do you have to...

1024
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,160
Are they telling you to stop listening to Top 40,

1025
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,380
give up things like watching Dynasty,

1026
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,440
or eating Haagen-Dazs,

1027
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,360
or maybe shopping at home from an Esprit catalog?

1028
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,800
What? Huh?

1029
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,320
What are you trying to say? What is this note?

1030
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,400
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas.

1031
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,560
With a sign saying,

1032
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,000
U.S. Grade A conspiracy dupe across your forehead?

1033
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,800
Hey, I don't know what that means,

1034
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,000
but, but I don't like your attitude, okay?

1035
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,960
I mean, like, just, you, you asked me to come here,

1036
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,380
and I mean, why did you even ask me, what?

1037
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,200
Just, just sit over there, okay?

1038
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,840
You try and experiment down here, and it just doesn't work.

1039
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,560
You, you try to...

1040
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,620
bring an opposing viewpoint, somewhat of a rebuttal,

1041
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,960
and, uh, you never can tell.

1042
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,740
This is Sister Chris here. It's 12.33.

1043
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,720
It's not 12.33, it's two minutes till midnight.

1044
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,340
Four minutes till something like that.

1045
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:35,200
And this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1046
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,680
And you cannot leave either.

1047
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,080
No, we're here.

1048
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,340
We're here.

1049
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:42,780
Let's go.

1050
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,560
The

1051
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,860
Brody Maslow film presents

1052
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,300
Ben Franklin, Hero for Hophead!

1053
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:58,040
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me.

1054
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,380
But I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside,

1055
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,380
so I never felt the touch of a warm naked Indian,

1056
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,040
or in a cold, naked forest.

1057
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,980
Ben Franklin, the only president of the United States

1058
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,160
who was never president of the United States.

1059
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,220
Was he an early drug user?

1060
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:25,700
Let's see.

1061
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,820
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761

1062
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,180
while still an apprentice bookmaker in colonial Philadelphia.

1063
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,280
So he took me to the Hashfire Inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads,

1064
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,920
rebellious libertines all lusting for life and liberty.

1065
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,580
The real George Washington brought the hemp and all the evening traders.

1066
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,820
We quickly proceeded to get some of the hurdles

1067
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,460
and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the hemp,

1068
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,440
which smoked us all like Boston's scrot.

1069
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,940
What a fetid fervor of freedom.

1070
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,540
I say, let's have a revolution.

1071
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,360
It was Larry Sam, the tax collector.

1072
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,780
To which Big Ben replied,

1073
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,880
Fine, Sam.

1074
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,900
Then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

1075
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,380
Yes, 1761.

1076
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,000
Hemp kindled the fires of American history.

1077
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,560
American history.

1078
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,720
American history.

1079
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,780
American history.

1080
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,580
American history.

1081
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:39,580


1082
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:39,580


1083
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:39,580


1084
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:39,580


1085
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:39,580


1086
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,100
Yes, dear friends.

1087
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,600
You have been listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry

1088
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,740
produced by the Church of the Subgenius.

1089
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,420
As I said this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1090
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,140
Stay tuned for Down Memory Lane with Ron Lindsay

1091
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:03,080
and this is your host, King, Pope Killer Reverend Ivan Stang,

1092
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,300
Arbiter of Hipness, Down Putter of Talk Show Hosts,

1093
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:07,360
Arbiter of Hipness, Down Putter of Talk Show Hosts,

1094
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,660
in my mighty glibness,

1095
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,000
son of the king of bull shatterers,

1096
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,440
he who hath been copied

1097
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,020
by David Byrne and Garrison Keillor,

1098
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,120
payer of royalty checks

1099
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,680
to tight-running buddies,

1100
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,400
contract signer of all paying

1101
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,600
subgenius projects,

1102
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,400
president of the corporation

1103
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,760
of all Dobbs PR,

1104
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,340
48% owner of the Janer tongue,

1105
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,480
first interpreter of the dogma,

1106
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,920
enrager of pinks

1107
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,460
and lesser subgeniuses alike,

1108
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,420
living embodiment of hate,

1109
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,960
slack under Dobbs,

1110
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,400
keeper of the original Dobbs image,

1111
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,840
carrot dangler of long-promised magazines,

1112
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,700
and returner of compliments.

1113
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,920
You faithless.

1114
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,260
You faithless.

1115
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,720
You faithless.

1116
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,900
You faithless.

1117
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,080
You faithless.

1118
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,040
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1119
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,940
This is Li Liqing,

1120
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,920
a Chinese subgenius.

1121
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,100
And you are listening to the hour of slack.

1122
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,420
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

1123
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,240
He is a China,

1124
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,000
just like in America.

1125
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,380
And people need slack.

1126
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,300
In Chinese,

1127
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,940
we call slack

1128
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,420
loon,

1129
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:18,280
impact. It must be true slack, not the best slack. Help me somebody. Thank you, Lily Jing.

1130
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:25,860
Yes, my friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight. Ivan Stang himself, the grand

1131
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:33,100
auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith, who has every subgenius's name on his

1132
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:39,080
special basement computer, and he's here tonight to make the hour and a half of slack seem

1133
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:47,120
like, well, like forever. Ah, yes, dear friends, so good to be here. Say it, Ivan, say it.

1134
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:55,400
Feeling the power. In this hideous, hideous place. Bob lives, friends. Bob lives. Don't

1135
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,120
let him tell you otherwise. He ain't dead. Oh, what is this? I should know. I'm the guy

1136
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,220
that has to read sooner or later.

1137
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,480
All the mail that comes to that T.O. box that you probably thought was just made up.

1138
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,960
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff

1139
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,740
and management of this radio station, the other staff, the relations and spouses of

1140
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,440
the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and staff.

1141
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,900
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

1142
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,820
He's dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes. These deadlights looked

1143
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,340
like a

1144
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,300
dead light.

1145
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:49,920
I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, that just because, just because there's a

1146
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:57,680
Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily, I mean, can Bob really die? I'd say yes, Ivan, and

1147
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,500
I think you better grow up and face the, face the sick truth that this Bobby isn't necessarily

1148
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,000
everything that you say he is.
