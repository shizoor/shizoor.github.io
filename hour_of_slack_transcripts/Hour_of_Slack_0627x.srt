00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:14,240
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,460
Yes, dear friends, so good to hear the babacata.

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,300
That's my Mark Mothersbaugh in the background.

4
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,260
Hour of slack.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,120
And here we are back.

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,080
With the hour of slack.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,140
No, actually I do have a little...

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,180
A sort of an echo device I could turn on.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,660
I wonder if I can get these little wellman heads into their position.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,340
No, I'm not going to mess with that.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,380
What was I going to...

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,560
Oh, I had some quick church announcements.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,860
Then we're going to get back to the tapes.

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,360
The tapes, yes, friends.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,660
We have more still yet from Bill T. Miller's amazing new CD.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,120
Orgy of Slack.

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,240
I've got more of Suzy the Fluzy's amazing collage.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,540
I've got more amazing Einstein Secret Orchestra.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,560
More Dr. Howell and Negative Land live in Portland, the Bible.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,760
The Duke of Uke, J.N. Hypercleets, and who knows what else I'll get to into this stack.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Friends, as far as the local church news goes,

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,700
Scouts, the Scouts are saving aluminum cans, bottles, and other items to be recycled if you have any of that kind of thing.

23
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,460
The...

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,220
The...

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,220


26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,380
Proceeds will be used to cripple children.

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:55,280
The Outreach Committee has enlisted 25 visitors to make calls on people who are not afflicted with any church.

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,720
And...

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,560
The low self-esteem support group, friends, will be meeting at 7 o'clock on Thursdays.

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,140
Please use the back door.

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,940
And...

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,540
Remember...

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,080
In prayer, friends, the many who are sick of our church and community.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
In the news...

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,960
Uh, this is from, uh, Planet Proctor News.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,560
Turmoil rocked heaven this morning as allegations arose that God had had an affair with a former worshiper.

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:42,040
The scandal was begun when a 21-year-old woman known only as Mary claimed that she had given birth to God's only son last week in the hamlet of Bethlehem.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,220
Uh, sources close to Mary claimed...

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,780
That she had, quote, loved God for a long time, unquote.

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,260
That she was constantly talking about her relationship with God and that she was thrilled to have his child.

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:06,540
In a press conference this morning, God issued a vehement denial saying that, quote, no sexual relationship existed and that, uh, quote, the facts of this story will come out in time verily.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,800
Independent counsel Kenneth Beelzebub immediately filed a brief with the Justice Department to expand his investigation.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:26,980
He said that the allegations were based on the allegation to cover questions of whether any commandments may have been broken and whether God had illegally funneled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three foreign operatives known only as the Wise Men.

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,740
Beelzebub also has issued subpoenas to several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens in the affair.

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,200
Critics have pointed out these allegations have little to do with the charges that Beelzebub was originally appointed to investigate.

46
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,780
That God had created large-scale flooding in order to cover...

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,340
...up evidence of a failed land deal.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:58,000
In recent months, Beelzebub's investigation has already been expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God's political opponents in the last election,

49
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:13,660
as well as to claims that the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was to divert attention away from a scandal involving whether the giveaway of a parcel of public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro quo for political contributions.

50
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:27,860
If these allegations prove to be true, then this could be a huge blow to God's career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral standards and higher punishment for wrongdoers.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,120
Indeed, God recently outlined a tough-on-crime plan consisting of ten commandments, which has been introduced to Congress in a bill by Representative Moses.

52
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,640
Critics of the bill have pointed out that it lacks provisions for the...

53
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:55,480
...rehabilitation of criminals and lawyers for the ACLU are planning to fight the name-in-drain commandment as being an unconstitutional restriction in free speech.

54
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,400
...

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,660
...

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,800
...

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,580
...

58
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,920
...

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:00,920


60
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
...

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:01,720


62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:01,740
...

63
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,740


64
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,740


65
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,740


66
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,740


67
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,740


68
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,740


69
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,960
...

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:01,960


71
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:01,960


72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,660
...

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,440
...

74
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,760
...

75
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,980
...

76
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,660
...

77
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,740
...

78
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


79
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


80
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


81
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


82
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


83
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


84
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


85
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


86
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


87
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


88
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


90
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


91
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


92
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


93
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


94
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


95
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,740


96
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,320
It was a mysterious journey that you took.

97
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,300
I don't know, man.

98
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,780
The merging with the doggy mind.

99
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,000
And the camel back.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,820
The merging and becoming one with the doggy mind.

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,500
Becoming one with the camel's water sack.

102
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,380
And how would you erudite on that, you smoky-Flanvers, you?

103
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,620
I wonder.

104
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,600
I wonder.

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,100
Whatever happens.

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,480
I wake to the testicular velocity of your particular...

107
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,420
...sappin' stamps.

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,920
My sappin' stamps at this particular moment happens to be misconstrued by the violence in this room.

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
In fact, some of the small...

110
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,640
I find your vituperantence...

111
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,520
...vituperance is most enigmatic.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,340
And I'd like to smoke some of your protuberances.

113
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,780
But I don't have the time, nor do I have the, uh...

114
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,080
...the vengeance needed.

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,820
Mr. High Times producer.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,460
Mr. High Times.

117
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,020
No, no, no. There's no connection, please.

118
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,140
This is the most misconstrued thing I've ever heard.

119
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,060
All of it.

120
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,860
Every last drop.

121
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,080
It's all strewed, strewed.

122
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,560
It's strewed to do.

123
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,680
But we're in the back in the mystic east.

124
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,560
The land of Bleepo's ancient ancestors and stuff like that.

125
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,860
Well, yes, I'm aware of that.

126
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,460
Fifty thousand years ago.

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,620
We're back, we're walkin' the sands, baby.

128
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,720
And our feet are real hot and stuff like that.

129
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,520
Real hot.

130
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,320
Pictures of reality dying can be fun!

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,000
...and I'm...

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,660
I've almost achieved perfection, you see.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,700
Of a divine creature.

134
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,220
It is pure, harmonious...

135
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,440
...absolutely incapable of malice.

136
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,880
But?

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,000
And if in my tinkering I have fallen short...

138
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,280
...of the human form by the odd snout, claw, or hoof...

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,740
...or pipe.

140
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,260
It really is of no great import.

141
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,420
Not yet.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
Not to kill for pleasure.

143
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
Not to kill for...

144
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,080
Not to kill for hatred.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Not to kill anything, anytime.

146
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,840
That is the law.

147
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,680
That law has been broken.

148
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,840
None escape.

149
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,200
None escape.

150
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,100
None shall escape.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,700
Praise Bones!

152
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,740
Praise Bones!

153
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,680
Praise Bones!

154
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,760
Praise Bones!

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,580
You know, even the task of paying the negligible price of tonight's admission ticket...

156
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,340
...is a step toward the rosy opening iris portals of those pleasure saucers.

157
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:13,560
And when you are sucked up into the empyrean by these sex goddess aliens...

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,700
...you will be in unimaginable ecstasy.

159
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,720
Ecstasy which makes the highest point of ecstasy that you can think of...

160
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,440
...seem, by comparison, like agony.

161
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,360
You will frantically copulate with these alien beings.

162
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:29,980
You bet!

163
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,360
There's no question about not wanting to.

164
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,640
They've got you by the short hairs.

165
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,300
Something to do with pheromones, I think.

166
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,660
These beings may not be the sorts that you would think you would want to cohabit with.

167
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,920
My friends, you have no choice.

168
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
And you will be lifted...

169
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
...from this bleeding earth...

170
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,640
...into a wondrous land...

171
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,120
...which moves on and on through infinite incarnations...

172
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,580
...until you reach the end of all things...

173
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,880
...which we call...

174
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
...the punchline.

175
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,120
Pheromones!

176
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,620
Think of it.

177
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,160
You'll be experiencing it.

178
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,580
You'll be feeling it.

179
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,980
Or...

180
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,600
...you'll be in deep, crying batter...

181
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,620
...while others...

182
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,740
...experience it.

183
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,160
The choice is yours.

184
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,640
All the universe...

185
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,600
...or nothing.

186
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,680
Which...

187
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,940
...shall it be?

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,840
Pheromones!

189
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,920
The, uh...

190
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,580
The, uh...

191
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
...slits are there.

192
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,380
The slits were there.

193
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,880
And that weird first Japanese...

194
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,240
Plasmatics.

195
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
...manga-mangahuna or whatever.

196
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,620
The original version of the plasmatics.

197
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,800
Not the, uh...

198
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
...MTV version.

199
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,660
Yeah, the...

200
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:40,880
They're there.

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
The tortured plasmanics.

202
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
The tortured plasmanics.

203
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,300
The one where the woman had three breasts...

204
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,140
They're actually manning the guns on the dark side of the moon.

205
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,680
They're actually...

206
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:47,820
I...

207
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:48,700
Aliens...

208
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,380
...the alien ships are coming through...

209
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:50,400
And the woman in the guns.

210
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,820
They're...

211
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,500
...they're touching the guns.

212
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,240
...left and right.

213
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,520
But the guns on the dark side of the moon...

214
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,400
...are blasting them out of the sky...

215
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
...until the pleasure ships arrive.

216
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,020
They'll let the pleasure ships through.

217
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,680
The guns will silence on July 5th.

218
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,140
And the pleasure ships will be allowed through...

219
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,480
...to Earth.

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,740
And it will be pretty unpleasurable.

221
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,320
Yeah.

222
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,360
Right.

223
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,740
That's because so many...

224
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,980
You can take that to the birth.

225
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,340
...have their, um...

226
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,880
...middle...

227
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,860
...not the middle eye...

228
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,640
...but what they call your...

229
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,860
...your accessory forehead eye.

230
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,680
You got that right from the horse's mouth.

231
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:18,680


232
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,120
...the horse's moot.

233
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,580
Your accessory forehand eye sometimes gets...

234
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,380
...when it gazes...

235
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,600
...tooth glazes too far inwards...

236
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,280
...you automatically transfix your own self...

237
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,800
...and you're just considered out of the box...

238
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,140
...right there.

239
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,400
The guns will go silent.

240
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,540
Hey, man, more on me.

241
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,260
I spend so long in the penalty bags...

242
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,040
...they go 500 reincarnation...

243
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
...I never come back this planet.

244
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,080
On July 5th.

245
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,600
Stuff like that.

246
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,020
This year.

247
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
This year.

248
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,660
This year you get your way out...

249
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,040
...or you get way out?

250
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,680
Man, we're gonna be way out...

251
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:48,680


252
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,020
...yeah.

253
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,700
We got our smoke machine...

254
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,720
That's where the fun...

255
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,780
We got our theremin...

256
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,160
...got that electric violin...

257
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,460
...got our electric pork chops...

258
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,160
Dave got his am fixed...

259
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
...and we've got the...

260
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,620
...we've got thousands of little laboratory animals...

261
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
...that need spanked...

262
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,920
...and need rectal examinations...

263
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,700
...we're gonna be performing them...

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
...in front of you...

265
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,700
...in this magnificent cyclotron...

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,960
...that also has a daredevil rodeo...

267
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,880
...going on behind it...

268
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,460
...only outside, I mean...

269
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,660
That's the, uh, Euclid Tavern...

270
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,680
...France Cleveland...

271
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:18,680


272
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,300
...Ohio...

273
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,520
...April 16th...

274
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,680
...but you've probably already missed that show...

275
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,360
...April 16th...

276
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,100
...the, uh...

277
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,180
...seminaries of the Euclid Tavern...

278
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,120
...on Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio...

279
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,040
...navigational track of most of the vesicles...

280
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,180
There's one landing right now.

281
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,980
Phew, that's a big one, isn't it?

282
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,480
Don't you wish we had one like that?

283
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,500
I wish I had one like that.

284
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,160
They don't make those...

285
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,400
...one like that anymore either.

286
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,580
No, everything's digitized now.

287
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,260
That's an old analog one there.

288
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,900
It's an old analog ship.

289
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,800
An analog ship?

290
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah.

291
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
They had analog ships?

292
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, you didn't know that.

293
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,040
All that stuff today...

294
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,140
...all the new ships that you see today...

295
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,220
...those are all digitized, digital ships.

296
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,420
I thought they had carbuncles and slurpees.

297
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
No, they're not carbon-based at all.

298
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,360
Oh, my lord and heaven.

299
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,500
No, they're silicon-based.

300
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,580
Sweet gotten himmel.

301
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,260
No.

302
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,900
Only the old analog spaceships are the carbon-based ones.

303
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,980
Well, how does this...

304
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,580
Those are the best.

305
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,180
You know, you can tell.

306
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,620
They have a warmth to them when you're flying in them...

307
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,680
...that the new ships don't have.

308
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,880
Oh, yeah, I always knew that.

309
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,520
The tube ships were better, but I didn't even know if we were born in...

310
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,320
If you can get a tube ship, you can get an analog ship...

311
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,740
...and use a tube amplifier modulation unit on it.

312
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,740
Well, that's the test tube variety of a test drive.

313
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,180
For the warp drive.

314
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,200
You got it, man.

315
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh, that's old. I'm sorry.

316
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,500
And if you...

317
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,980
I'll tell you what, you know the tube amp?

318
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,780
If you can get this, you get yourself an analog spaceship...

319
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,260
...and you load that sucker with an old Leslie tube amp, man.

320
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,120
I thought you were going to pack it with old lesbians.

321
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,760
That's another old idea from SK...

322
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:46,860
Yeah.

323
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,160
With them rotating warp drives.

324
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,980
That's also another rotating idea that keeps on recurring.

325
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,440
That's an amazing ship you'd have there.

326
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,320
You'd be the envy.

327
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,420
Every girl in the galaxy would want to fly in your ship.

328
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,420
That's for sure.

329
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,880
Well, wasn't that a sexual illusion back in the medieval times?

330
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,980
The little old man in the spaceship?

331
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,640
Yeah.

332
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,680
And if you can get a Farfisa console for it...

333
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,660
And you can get close to that in the Middle Ages.

334
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,480
They're not that good, but they're nostalgic as hell.

335
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,180
Pictures of reality dying can be fun!

336
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,420
My tail knows I must fly

337
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,420
The weak kiss and say goodbye

338
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,800
She says now come back soon

339
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,020
From your trip up to the moon

340
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,640
So happy she was

341
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,920
She would be

342
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,300
Well, yeah

343
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,360
Well, well, well

344
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,740
We gotta get out of this place

345
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,080
It's the last thing we ever do

346
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,740
We gotta get out of this place

347
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,660
There's a better life for me

348
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:09,820
Yeah

349
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,400
The sun is shining, come on, get happy

350
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,940
The Lord is waiting to take your hand

351
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,880
Shout hallelujah, come on, get happy

352
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,640
We're gonna be going to the promised land

353
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,660
Oh, is it tender, long, quick

354
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,160
Let me take your little hand

355
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,800
I'll take you from this hell hole to the Toronto big land

356
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,540
Oh, don't blame me, oh children

357
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,240
If the promises are geek

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,380
Cause promises like lies

359
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,980
Damn ye, but so very geek

360
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,240
Well, there are polls that say that young people in their 20s

361
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,220
think it's more likely that they will see UFOs

362
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,800
than that they will ever collect Social Security.

363
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
You see things like this increasing

364
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,060
when you hear the news of such things.

365
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,020
Whatever you do, change your priorities.

366
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,620
Whatever you do, rearrange your schedule.

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,320
But get ready.

368
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,600
Alert number four.

369
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,040
There'll be signs in the stars and in the heavens.

370
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,040
In the moon.

371
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
You know, nobody laughs when you say three letters anymore.

372
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,680
U-F-O.

373
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,640
We're being orbited by man-made stars

374
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,080
while we sit here in comparative security.

375
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,380
You know or do you realize that

376
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,400
the implement that will allow the man who rules the world,

377
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
the Antichrist, you'll learn about him.

378
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,940
That satellite is in orbit right now.

379
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,320
It is called Telstar.

380
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,420
And I don't have to remind you that men have walked on God's moon.

381
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,580
Signs in the heavens.

382
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,720
How they'll be traveling in the last days to and fro

383
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,180
and everywhere and from one country to the other.

384
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
As if it is nothing.

385
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,500
And you know about the friendly skies

386
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,440
and fly now and pay never.

387
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,580
So you better get ready.

388
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Ready to go.

389
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,740
You can go as you are.

390
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,440
But pay as you own.

391
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,780
Pay as you go.

392
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:20,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

393
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

394
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,700
Uncontrolled burning of this prophesied time.

395
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,580
However, the saved will escape this horrible judgment.

396
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,600
For true believers are called...

397
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,340
The saved are not the same.

398
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,440
After traveling a mile or so, one realizes that the towers and various launching sites

399
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,240
are laid out in one great semicircle along the eastern shoreline.

400
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,140
We leave the main highway and go northeast along the outer drive near the beaches.

401
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,820
Soon we are passing electrical transformers

402
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,420
and the spring's lattice steel structures of the radar and tracking installations.

403
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,880
Then comes the launching areas for the rockets

404
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,040
with the round blockhouses which look like turtles squatted down among the cabbage farms.

405
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,980
Beyond each blockhouse is a rocket tower.

406
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,580
All of these are off the main road in a little isolated area to themselves

407
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,160
and stand shining in the floodlights.

408
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,460
Before she knew it, she was staring up at the ship

409
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,960
that would take her into the vast, soundless void of space.

410
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,300
She gasped. Why, it wasn't ugly at all, but beautiful.

411
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,460
As it stood there tall and straight in the launching pad.

412
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,860
The pink light of early dawn glinted on the shiny hull and it was so clean.

413
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,380
Cindy was sure she wouldn't mind eating off its engines.

414
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,500
Suddenly, to the north and still several miles away, we see a great tower.

415
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,040
It is so large that it dwarfs all the rest and seems to dominate the entire cape.

416
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,860
This is our...

417
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,240
tower tower.

418
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,700
For enclosed within its steel framework stands the giant rocket

419
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,200
that will soon be taking us away...

420
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,420
to the moon.

421
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,080
None but authorized vehicles are permitted to enter the launching area.

422
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,900
So we leave our car on the parking ramp and walk to the complex gate.

423
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,920
Lights are shining directly in our faces so that the guards will be able to identify us beyond any question.

424
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,200
This time we are checked more closely by the guards.

425
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,860
This time we are checked more closely by the guards.

426
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,380
After a moment's delay, they wave us through and we find ourselves inside the high steel fence that encloses the entire complex area.

427
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,860
Now you are at the world's largest airfield on Tinian in the Marianas.

428
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,000
The voice you hear is that of Chaplain William Downey, who stood amongst the target charts, the escape kits and the stale coffee,

429
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,720
and said a prayer for the Enola Gay and civilization.

430
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,740
The Lord is my happening.

431
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,760
He's where it's all at.

432
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,020
He tricks me sweetly.

433
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,540
He never bugs me.

434
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,500
He says, make it, when the duds put me all down.

435
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,260
I keep my cool cause he straights with me.

436
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,400
Even though my head's torn up in the world of plastic mushroom and I'm crawling on my face,

437
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,620
everything is cool cause he's there digging me.

438
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,780
When everybody's faking and stabbing, he's super cool.

439
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,800
And he's with me, baby.

440
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
He craves me.

441
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,420
He saves my face when it's ugly, man.

442
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,060
He lays abundance on me.

443
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,700
Baby, ain't no way I can get hung up.

444
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,580
He's my lifetime trick.

445
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,820
When the great moment arrives, when all the lights are glowing green,

446
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,000
the test conductor will depress the launch button by a fraction of an inch to send a rocket,

447
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,040
weighing hundreds of pounds,

448
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,000
for 240,000 miles to the moon.

449
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,080
And you'll be riding in that rocket.

450
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,180
We are confronted for the first time with the massive structure of the rocket itself.

451
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,000
The great booster engines are protruding from the thrust section only a few feet away,

452
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,960
and our eyes move upward along the gleaming steel for more than 200 feet,

453
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,380
to where the spaceship is still hidden in the top portion of the tower.

454
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,020
The silver rocket, enclosed within the red carnet,

455
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,760
the same cave of the tower,

456
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,340
appears like the altar of a great cathedral,

457
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,060
and it takes your breath away.

458
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,440
An odd chill ran up her spine as she watched the gantry platform

459
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,580
clang to the ground and unload an electronics engineer.

460
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,160
Then she was riding the platform as it rose and climbing through the entrance lock of the ship.

461
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,540
Don't look for me.

462
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,600
I'll get ahead.

463
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,460
Remember darling.

464
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,320
Don't smoke in bed.

465
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,120
The rumble of the stars.

466
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,820
The rumble of the stars.

467
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,520
The rumble of the stars.

468
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,040
The rumble of the engines is heard once more.

469
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Other worlds are waiting, and we must leave.

470
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,840
The rocket ship is one of the greatest scientific devices ever conceived by man.

471
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,980
The thunder of its great boosters will be heard throughout the heavens,

472
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,600
across the universe,

473
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,140
and someday even beyond.

474
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,100
The voice of the rocket is the voice of science,

475
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,640
the voice of hope,

476
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,900
and the voice of our nation.

477
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,260
Your voyage to the moon will be recorded forever in the hearts of mankind.

478
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,520
It is a feat equally important to us.

479
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,100
To the greatest.

480
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,760
Though the greater deeds are yet to come.

481
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,560
This, our first journey to the moon,

482
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,320
is only the beginning

483
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,840
of the beginning

484
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,320
of the beginning.

485
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,520
Shout hallelujah, come on get happy.

486
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,000
Don't try to chase all your cares away.

487
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,080
Shout hallelujah, come on get happy.

488
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,500
Get ready,

489
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,360
get ready.

490
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,900
Get ready for the Judgment Day

491
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,540
Oh, praise Bob, Seekers!

492
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,820
We've survived!

493
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,820
We've survived tonight's little taste of the hellfire to come

494
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,080
Oh, yes, Bob is the man

495
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,660
And thanks to him, we've got soap in our holes

496
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,320
For a brighter subgenius future

497
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,220
Oh, and thanks are due also to the stars of tonight's fractured show

498
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,640
People who either didn't know any better

499
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,700
Or who knew all too well

500
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,880
Oh, Bob, Seekers!

501
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,680
Crazy Christians like Jerry Falwell and Hal Lindsey

502
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,100
And Jack Van Impey and Bill McKee

503
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,820
And Pastor Arnold Murray and the Joyful Heirs

504
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,560
And the Carter family and Bobby Jean White

505
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,020
And the Cleveland Youth Chorale

506
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,820
Oh, we also heard from sublime visionaries

507
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,780
Such as Oingo Boingo, The Simpsons, D.D. Ranged

508
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,460
Bob and Doug McKenzie, Rod Keith

509
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,860
Tom Larry, and the D.D. Ranged

510
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,020
Bob and Doug McKenzie, Rod K.

511
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,080
I love you, Bob and Doug McKenzie

512
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,080


513
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,080


514
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,080


515
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,080


516
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,080


517
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,020
The Stranglers, Edward R. Murrow

518
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,380
And a little dollop of Matthias from The Omega Man

519
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,780
Oh, man, he cranked my tractor way back then

520
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,220
There's nothing like a mutated man

521
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,840
Oh, and we also heard out-and-out lunatics

522
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,120
Like General Curtis E. LeMay

523
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,980
And that lisping guy with a journey to infinity

524
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,120
With a spacecraft takeoff

525
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,860
And then the animatronics

526
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,780
Annoying aliens.

527
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,980
Giving that seminar at the extraterrestrial Earth mission of Sedona, Arizona.

528
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,000
I mean, I did not blow my nose with a microphone open.

529
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,800
That was on the original tape.

530
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,520
Oh, man, what a trip with suitcases those losers are.

531
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,660
Oh, just be very glad I didn't play you their half-hour symphonies that go like...

532
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
For half an hour.

533
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,520
Oh, yeah, it gets me in tune with the spheres.

534
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:20,380
Oh, and the parts of the luscious sex goddesses were played by Julie London and Laurie Anderson and Judy Garland and Polly Bergen.

535
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:27,660
Oh, and I used some bits from a dramatic reading of the little girl's book, A Countdown for Cindy,

536
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,320
that I...

537
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,760
Had on hand.

538
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,620
Oh, I love that book.

539
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,700
I could just eat off its engines.

540
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:43,060
Oh, and yes, I would like to add a heaping helping of special thanks tonight.

541
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:57,720
And it goes out to sweet brother James, who gave the Flues-O-Rama show here the first professional sound mixing it's ever had on that opening sequence of tonight's show.

542
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:09,320
And being a man of less than one voice myself, I could not have pulled it off, especially the JonBenet Ramsey part, without his expert knob diddling.

543
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,860
So thanks to the tip of the old bimbo's bustier to brother James.

544
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:24,100
Oh, and if the rest of the show sounded like crap, you know, that's because it was floozy engineered with a new boom box, so...

545
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,660
If you didn't like it.

546
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,280
So get used to it, Bubba.

547
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Because there's gonna be a lot to dislike about the coming months.

548
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:43,140
And I plan to provide you all with the perfect background pain textures to complement your end-of-the-world color scheme.

549
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,840
So sleep tight, seekers.

550
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,940
And if I were you, I'd start packing first thing in the morning.

551
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,640
Let's buy the next shift a little time with a lovely hymn by G. Don Truby called...

552
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,540
Hymn 999.

553
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,520
Good night, seekers.

554
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,680
The end times are near, but there's nothing to fear.

555
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,560
If you just send us a dollar.

556
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,180
Get ready, get set.

557
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:50,220
Prepare for the launch of the bleeding head of a bomber.

558
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,440
Remember the motto, perform the salute.

559
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,100
Slack off.

560
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,940
And study the pamphlets.

561
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,960
And if you should falter, then look to the sky.

562
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,100
Cause Bob's always somewhere nearby.

563
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,040
There's a pipe in the sky.

564
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,100
And I'll follow him anywhere.

565
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,940
Through the sun, they glow.

566
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Amen.

567
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,580
Through a hurricane tide.

568
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,260
There's a pipe in the sky.

569
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,760
There's a pipe in the sky.

570
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,900
And I'll follow him anywhere.

571
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,240
And I'll follow him anywhere.

572
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Through the floor of the ocean.

573
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,440
Through the mountains so high.

574
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,860
Through the mountains so high.

575
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,920
Through the mountains so high.

576
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,340
But never sick.

577
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,300
He's never been ill.

578
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,680
Except for the time in the Andes.

579
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,480
And then there's the time on a mellow sea.

580
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,920
When he ate the fun-spir-o-can.

581
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:28,060
But for the most part, he won't let you down.

582
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,640
When he eats the fun-spir-o-can.

583
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,340
Yet find yourself pressed for time.

584
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,140
Just soften Bob and your mind will unlock.

585
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Cause in another piece of the rock.

586
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,520
There they're a pipe in the sky.

587
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,340
There's a pipe in the sky.

588
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,680
And I'll follow him with anywhere.

589
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,700
And I'll follow him anywhere.

590
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,640
Through the Sun may call upon you.

591
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,600
Thank you.

592
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,700
There's a pipe in the sky.

593
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,060
There's a pipe in the sky.

594
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,540
And I'll follow it anywhere.

595
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,680
Stand up and be counted.

596
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,500
Go with the Ku Klux Klan.

597
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,500
Stand up and be counted.

598
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,260
Show the world that you're a man.

599
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,160
Stand up and be counted.

600
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
Go with the Ku Klux Klan.

601
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Let's all join up, buddies.

602
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,140
Boys and girls, if we can get any girls.

603
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,040
Oh, man.

604
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,640
I'm glad that I've got my white underwear on today.

605
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,420
You know, if it isn't bad enough.

606
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,120
I would never wear colored underwear.

607
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:41,120
You know, if it isn't bad enough that we're just playing little traces of this incredibly racist and ignorant, bigoted, redneck recording.

608
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,960
But somebody actually called us to ask us where he could acquire a copy.

609
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,280
We know who you are.

610
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,320
Southern by birth, retarded by the grace of God.

611
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,820
We know about the drugs.

612
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,160
Yes, we know.

613
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,680
It's okay with us, Bob.

614
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,380
Oh, boy.

615
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,620
Oh, boy.

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,420
Bob, he doesn't care.

617
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,600
Bob, you couldn't carry one lick.

618
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,700
I'm proud to be a genetic throwback.

619
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,080
I'm proud to be retarded.

620
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,740
Oh, everybody around me claims they're so smart.

621
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,660
But look how they live.

622
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,740
Why, there's people of all races around them.

623
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,600
And, well, you know how scary that can be.

624
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh, man.

625
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,920
I don't know about you, Reverend Strange.

626
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,600
You're starting to look kind.

627
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,760
Different.

628
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,900
How so?

629
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,140
I don't know.

630
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,320
You've got brown hair, and I've got very little blonde hair.

631
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,160
Very little.

632
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,540
I think that maybe I should come up with some kind of a funny nickname to call you that

633
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,300
me and my other blonde friends can sit around and laugh at you for.

634
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:48,940
How about...

635
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,880
Hey, Lunchbox.

636
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,980
Hey, Lunchbox.

637
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,940
Real brownie girl dolls.

638
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,100
I would never hang out with one of them Lunchbox people.

639
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,480
Oh, man.

640
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,580
I would never hang out with one of them Lunchbox people.

641
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,580


642
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,580


643
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,580


644
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,500
I'd rather have them with their rubber sex dolls and...

645
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,320
Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies from a silicone love Girl Scout?

646
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,100
I don't trust you.

647
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,740
You've got glasses on.

648
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,680
How'd you get nearsighted?

649
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,880
I know myself.

650
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,820
Father...

651
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I must ask a question.

652
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,880
Please.

653
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,520
What am I?

654
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,860
But, good father, yet we are not like you.

655
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,780
What are we?

656
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,780
Father!

657
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,720
You are my children.

658
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,860
You are all my children.

659
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,320
One of the things that...

660
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,920
Tell me why you make the pain.

661
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
If we are your children.

662
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,760
Ah, you see, you are my children, but law is necessary.

663
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:13,320
If there is no more pain, then is there no more law?

664
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,780
There is always law.

665
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,940
Pain, no more.

666
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,880
Oh, God.

667
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,420
What do you do?

668
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,640
To walk on all fours.

669
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,360
That is the law.

670
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,700
To slurp up our drink.

671
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,180
That is the law.

672
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,500
We are not men.

673
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,960
To eat flesh and fish anytime.

674
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,660
That is the law.

675
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,220
Now I...

676
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,620
Now I...

677
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
I am the law.

678
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,280
I am the law.

679
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,080
Yeah.

680
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,980
Look in the mirror, Whitey.

681
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,520
You aren't too far from that tree yourself now, are you?

682
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,220
Oh, yeah.

683
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,560
Look at that.

684
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,540
Eleven toes.

685
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,540
Yeah, that's right, Whitey.

686
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,660
That's right, Whitey.

687
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,600
We know you're out there.

688
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah, and we're coming to get you.

689
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,640
You and your glow-in-the-dark Hebrew savior.

690
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,720
You bastards.

691
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,040
You bastards.

692
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,620
You bastards.

693
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,560
You screwed our planet up, and now we're gonna burr you underneath that.

694
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,400
None shall escape.

695
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,040
That is the law.

696
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,640
No!

697
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,280
No!

698
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,840
Is there still law?

699
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,460
There is still law.

700
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,080
Yes.

701
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,540
But how can there be love without the Father?

702
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,620
He hasn't left us.

703
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,480
That is what I will tell the others.

704
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,580
But the Spirit is watching over us.

705
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,340
We must wait for a sign.

706
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,600
Ow!

707
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,300
Ow!

708
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,960
I used to hang around there and ask for corners around the corner.

709
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,040
A new title, too?

710
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:52,940
Yeah.

711
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,760
I think what you should do in the final days is you should change everybody's title every

712
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,400
day, Stan.

713
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:05,460
Well, what it comes down to is if you have to ask me for a title, if you have to ask anybody

714
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,500
for a title, then you haven't learned anything.

715
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,400
You have all of Bob's lessons have been wasted.

716
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, God.

717
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,600
If you have to ask someone else for slack, then you are lost.

718
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,600
You are completely lost.

719
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,000
There's no point in any of this for you.

720
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,680
We gotta.

721
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,400
We gotta.

722
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
You are a spiritual leader, man.

723
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,160
You make the slack yourself.

724
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,940
You are a spiritual leader.

725
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,940
You have become the Pope.

726
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,740
You name yourself the Pope.

727
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,720
You are hearing right now.

728
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:38,160
Or the, uh, or in whatever case, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, whatever, uh, sort of religious,

729
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,480
uh, a superstitious nonsense, uh, title you want to give yourself.

730
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:43,980
And listen, I'll just say this.

731
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,800
Go ahead and do it, man.

732
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,940
I'll, I'll, I'll give, I'll give, uh, David back his title.

733
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,920
We should, uh, you know, I think David can have his title back as soon as he returns

734
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,380
my call.

735
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,380
I want a title that says, uh, I'm a Christian.

736
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,380


737
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,380


738
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,380


739
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,380


740
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,400
I, uh, David Meyer, don't give a fuck.

741
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,820
Who's gonna give me the title that has the

742
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,200
Let David Meyer be the Pope of all New York.

743
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,260
You can yourself be Popey, the emperor of all New York.

744
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,200
I am now, I am now, I am now, I am now the grand Googleplex.

745
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,080
There you go.

746
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah.

747
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,900
I am the

748
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,420
And you gotta be the grand Googleplex.

749
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,020
From now on, I am the grand Googleplex.

750
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,560
I've sunk pretty much I'm just trying to get his attention.

751
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,560
All hail the grand Googleplex, man.

752
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:13,860
Thank you.

753
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,920
All hail the grand Googleplex.

754
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,260
Thank you.

755
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,260
All hail the grand Googleplex.

756
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:19,260


757
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,540
All hail the grand Googleplex.

758
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,140
Oh, hi there.

759
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,360
Welcome to the grand Googleplex.

760
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,360


761
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,360


762
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,400
Oh, hey, Louis.

763
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,220
Oh, hey, Louis.

764
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,920
Oh, hey, Louis.

765
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,480
Oh, baby, nice.

766
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,020
Oh, baby.

767
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,460
Come on, children.

768
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:53,620
These primitive people don't believe in silly superstitions such as so-called Bob Dobbs seen here on this totem pole carving.

769
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,680
Totem pole?

770
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,360
They would give each other titles.

771
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,640
It might be a tale from the totem pole.

772
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,840
Is that like the stone or half pipe?

773
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,820
The different titles that Bob would be given?

774
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,800
And they're like in layers, aren't they?

775
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,720
They would say things like the next day and the day after that.

776
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,360
Meanwhile, across town.

777
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
There'd be different Sonic and Fonz.

778
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,100
Yeah, what about titles like that, Stang?

779
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,880
Yeah, what about titles like that, Stang?

780
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,600
I want to be now the Impossible Dream.

781
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,640
That's my new Googleplex title.

782
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,620
Oh, you just had one.

783
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Impossible Dream has said to forgotten yesterday's lingerie, Bleepo.

784
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,800
Bleepo.

785
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,560
Hey, have you heard from Cracked Sidewalk Dave lately?

786
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,000
I can't find him anywhere.

787
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,700
We should give him a new title.

788
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,760
I think.

789
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,940
I think.

790
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,180
The Frozen Cat Dave.

791
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,840
The Monstrous Spunk Doodle Dave.

792
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,900
Oh, that's a good one.

793
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,260
The Monstrous Spunk Doodle.

794
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,880
The Abstruse Monk Stunnel.

795
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,440
No, how about Mean Old Mr. Tooth Decade?

796
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,040
That's good.

797
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,920
Because I've had a hard time with the days for the last 10 years.

798
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,440
Mean Old Mr. Tooth Decade?

799
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,140
Yeah, it's 10 years ago.

800
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,760
I like that one.

801
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,520
That's a good one.

802
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,200
He came out tonight, too.

803
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,980
He was invading Pastor Craig's fuzz.

804
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,420
He was deep into it.

805
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,020
He has cerebral cortex, too, and couldn't get out.

806
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,300
But you've got it also, don't you?

807
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,440
When was the last time you licked Pastor Craig's scalp, boys and girls?

808
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:24,900
Oh.

809
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,800
That's better than those weird psychotoxic frogs from Lean.

810
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,700
What about Wipe Me All Over Your Chest Dave?

811
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,200
Wipe Mean Stuff All Over Your Chest?

812
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,140
No, just Wipe Me All Over Your Chest Dave.

813
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,340
I like that even better than the other Monstrous Strudel or Kugel Dave, whatever the hell it was.

814
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,740
I don't even care.

815
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,540
But that sounds better to me.

816
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,540
What are you people talking about?

817
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,880
This sounds like crazy talk.

818
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,860
It is crazy talk.

819
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,160
Because we don't need titles.

820
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,400
We don't need names.

821
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,260
We just need, um, what are you talking about?

822
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,860
We don't need no stinking universe.

823
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,000
Gotcha.

824
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,820
We don't need no stinking universe.

825
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,580
We don't need no stinking universe.

826
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,080
We don't need no stinking concepts, man.

827
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,300
We don't need no stinking Life Theory.

828
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,780
We don't need no stinking Dobbs approved.

829
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,520
We don't need no stinking radio airwaves.

830
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,320
We don't need no stinking stink.

831
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,280
We don't need no, we don't need a stinking repetitive pattern.

832
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,600
Edmund, give us your philosophy, man.

833
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,460
Welcome to the machine.

834
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,960
You don't need to speak audioactive.

835
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,880
I don't have any philosophy.

836
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,340
Actually, audioactive is not working very well tonight.

837
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,680
Everybody be quiet. Just one second. Everybody just be quiet.

838
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,160
Okay.

839
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,760
Okay.

840
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,300
Okay.

841
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,020
I just want to make people who were listening maybe think that there was something wrong.

842
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,800
There was something wrong. There was something terribly wrong for that moment.

843
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,100
And you just highlighted it by making it silent.

844
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,020
We could have made it go away so easy, but you had to bring it out.

845
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,560
Okay.

846
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,740
Yeah, I was just getting everybody to get their compressors to go all the way down to zero mark before we hit it again, you know.

847
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,120
Yes, but you live such a threatened existence here.

848
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,160
The people are monitoring you all the time.

849
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,560
And you can hardly walk because you can hardly go to the laundromat without the people taking your names down.

850
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,620
Oh, look at that.

851
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,280
I want to be sedated.

852
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,460
So just put me in a wheelchair.

853
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,840
Get me on a plane.

854
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,660
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane.

855
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,320
I can't control my fingers.

856
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,780
I can't control my brain.

857
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,760
Oh, no, no, no, no.

858
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,260
It's 20, 20, 24 hours to go.

859
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,780
I want to be sedated.

860
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,820
Nothing to do.

861
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,460
No way.

862
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,520
To go home.

863
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,780
I want to be sedated.

864
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,920
So just put me in a wheelchair.

865
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,220
Get me to the show.

866
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,100
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go low-co.

867
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,800
I can't control my fingers.

868
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,240
I can't control my toes.

869
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

870
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,980
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

871
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,220
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

872
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,360
I want to be sedated.

873
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,800
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

874
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,080
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

875
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,220
I want to be sedated.

876
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,640
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

877
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,460
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

878
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:11,920
Bam, bam, bam.

879
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,060
I want to be sedated.

880
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,580
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

881
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,800
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

882
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,460
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

883
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,000
I want to be sedated.

884
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

885
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

886
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,700
So sad.

887
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,080
So fresh.

888
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,440
This show is good on you all.

889
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,620
That was one of the saddest things I've ever heard.

890
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,940
I live on.

891
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,300
I didn't even hear it, but it's still one of the saddest.

892
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,480
This whole show is one of the saddest things I've ever heard.

893
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,260
This is the happiest moment of your life, Jader Heidern.

894
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,180
And now, Jader Heidern pleads, I pronounce you and the show married.

895
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,200
You may kiss.

896
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,340
We are scattered here in the sight of Bob.

897
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,260
Turn to page 237 in your hymnal.

898
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,060
And before all, to sanctify this grimoire.

899
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,340
In a urinal.

900
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,180
With a urinal toward destruction.

901
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,280
You're in a lot of trouble now.

902
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,580
Let us jump over the quiver of compromise and fall upon the jagged rocks of reality.

903
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,580
And Aunt Bertha will now give Jader away.

904
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,460
Come forward, Jader.

905
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,100
I don't want to be given away.

906
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,320
It's time for you to marry me.

907
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,340
She's going to carry you.

908
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:17,920
You've got to do it.

909
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,540
She'll carry you.

910
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,300
Yes, we shall apply to our vows.

911
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,820
And the purity of Aunt Bertha shall overcome the evil and sin of poor Jader.

912
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,700
Timmy, let's blow this hot dog stand.

913
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,700
Go get some crack.

914
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,700
No, I wouldn't miss this for anything.

915
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,560
Aunt Bertha's going to marry that guy.

916
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,680
And then, you know what?

917
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,980
We're going to put him in bed.

918
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,520
And how can I marry a fictitious character?

919
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,780
Stop talking and give me the ring.

920
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,800
Ah, with this ring, I'm me-wed.

921
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,480
It won't go on my finger.

922
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,140
I'll have to give it another push.

923
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,640
Well, how can I have sex with a fantasy woman?

924
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,100
Of course, I do it every night.

925
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,300
She looks stupid.

926
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,340
Just do what comes naturally.

927
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,420
And now, they're going to throw rice at us.

928
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,660
In 60 pounds.

929
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,100
Come back.

930
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,300
Put these pebbles in with the rice, Jader.

931
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,340
Put these little rocks in with the...

932
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:17,980
Oh, look.

933
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,780
Hi-yi-yi.

934
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,680
I'm throwing...

935
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,000
Hi-yi-yi for the field artillery.

936
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,500
It's a full tilt.

937
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,540
Uh-oh.

938
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:24,940
Okay.

939
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,540
Crazy out.

940
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,420
See you later.

941
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,440
Boys and girls, there is a conspiracy in this land of ours to ram Jader down the throat

942
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,820
May your show be twice as demented as it was previously.

943
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,480
Right to Aunt Bertha.

944
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,440
I'm sure it will be.

945
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,720
Dial a story.

946
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,300
Oh, box one.

947
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,460
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

948
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,160
Goodbye now.

949
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,020
Goodbye.

950
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,580
All right, brothers and sisters.

951
00:45:51,760 --> 00:46:01,040
Now, it is my very great pleasure to introduce a man, a man whose name is synonymous with

952
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:10,660
slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs' closest confidant, and a close personal friend of Slack.

953
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:20,200
Several acquaintances of mine, Reverend Ivan Stant magnetic

954
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,920
Come on, Reverend Stan.

955
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,080
Mm-hmm.

956
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
aika

957
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,780
How you doing, gang?

958
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,000
How are you?

959
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,220
Good.

960
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:36,220


961
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:36,680
Good.

962
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,240
Happy last year.

963
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,940
Your friends, there'll be so many healings tonight

964
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,980
that by X day we'll have a bonfire made of crutches.

965
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,140
We'll be able to sip and cripple the motherfuckers ourselves.

966
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,240
Friends, there are so many funny preachers lined up tonight.

967
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,640
There's so much funny, ha-ha, cute sub-genius jokes and stuff lined up

968
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,500
that I've got a couple of 15-minute spaces I'm supposed to speak in,

969
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,640
so I'm going to actually get serious.

970
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,500
I've got a lot of ground to cover in that 15 minutes.

971
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,860
No offense, but friends, there's only one...

972
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm not sure exactly the count,

973
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:36,860
but I believe there's only 115 days left until X day.

974
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,820
Something like that.

975
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,640
There's 113, okay.

976
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,620
Now, um...

977
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,980
Oh, shit.

978
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,420
Now, to be quite serious,

979
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,820
I had always, as usual,

980
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,060
I had my little prepared speech and so forth for this thing.

981
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,520
But you know what, friends?

982
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,480
I am sick and tired of preaching to the unsaved

983
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,400
and trying at the last minute to explain Bob's lack of conspiracy in X day.

984
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,320
Fuck the unsaved!

985
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,160
I'm talking to the...

986
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,020
This is playing sub-geniuses tonight.

987
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,060
I'm depressed nothing's going to hell for you.

988
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,880
But you sub-geniuses,

989
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,280
I know that quite a few of you are depressed.

990
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,540
You are angry and you're very frustrated

991
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,520
and some of you are at the very near, right near, for good reason,

992
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,000
you are at the near the end of your rope.

993
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,600
I know how it is.

994
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,780
And, uh...

995
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,440
Like I say, it's probably for real good reason.

996
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,140
But, once again,

997
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,040
it's only 113 days left.

998
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,680
That means you really only have one job.

999
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,720
As far as the conspiracy goes,

1000
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,000
we don't have enough time left to defeat it ourselves, most likely.

1001
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:02,460
We can let the exes do that for us at this point, I think.

1002
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,580
But there's one real fucking important job

1003
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,020
that you angry, frustrated, depressed sub-geniuses have.

1004
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,600
And that is this.

1005
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,220
Stay alive until next day.

1006
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,040
That's all you have to do.

1007
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,140
That's your only job.

1008
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,840
Stay alive.

1009
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:25,700
Stay alive.

1010
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:25,940
Stay alive.

1011
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,360
One thing that requires is

1012
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,520
not only do you have to not kill yourselves,

1013
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,320
as much as I hate to say it,

1014
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,660
try not to go postal.

1015
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,200
Prematurely.

1016
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,220
Prematurely.

1017
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,740
As much as it might actually help

1018
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,220
the Church of the Sub-Genius for one of you to stop,

1019
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,520
take a rifle,

1020
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,960
and kill every people you see,

1021
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,640
as much as that might save our asses,

1022
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,860
financially,

1023
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,540
I...

1024
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,300
You know,

1025
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,820
it would be wrong.

1026
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,360
It would just be...

1027
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,480
As much as that would help the Church of the Sub-Genius

1028
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,300
for somebody,

1029
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,660
for a whole bunch of you to kill yourselves,

1030
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,160
like Heaven's Gate idiots,

1031
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,980
while wearing Bob shirts,

1032
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,280
don't do that yet.

1033
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,060
Because there's one thing,

1034
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,040
you know, a lot of people...

1035
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,120
Would you guys pull the music down just a little bit?

1036
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,800
I'm having trouble.

1037
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,260
If...

1038
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,460
If there's...

1039
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,740
You know, I have an awful lot of people coming up to me going,

1040
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,120
I can't wait to see your face at 7.06 a.m. on X-Day,

1041
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,720
where we sing.

1042
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,160
Well, what are you gonna do

1043
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,360
if the X's don't come here with all this skill?

1044
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,160
You know, stupid bullshit.

1045
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,860
I'll tell you one thing, friends.

1046
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,080
Maybe some of those people missed

1047
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,180
the very first thing Bob said

1048
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,520
at the top of the very first Sub-Genius pamphlet number one.

1049
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,260
Aside from one dollar.

1050
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,660
It says, if I...

1051
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,640
If you don't mind me quoting,

1052
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,360
the world ends...

1053
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,900
Tomorrow!

1054
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,440
Tomorrow!

1055
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,280
Tomorrow!

1056
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,560
And you may die.

1057
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,340
The world ends tomorrow.

1058
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,860
Tomorrow!

1059
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,880
And you may die!

1060
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,820
How many of you are living your lives

1061
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,860
as if the world ends tomorrow and you may die?

1062
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,360
How many of you are doing whatever the fuck you want to do

1063
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,520
to see that you might die tomorrow?

1064
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,640
And guess what?

1065
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,280
You very well might die tomorrow.

1066
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,860
A car wreck...

1067
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,860
You could die in a car wreck.

1068
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,320
Space junk could fall from outer space.

1069
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,640
Some idiot could just decide to shoot you.

1070
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,200
You can trip and fall down the stairs and break your neck.

1071
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,080
Are you living your life?

1072
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,340
Or are you living your life in a world where I'm dead?

1073
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:38,340


1074
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:38,340


1075
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:43,760
As if it might end tomorrow, are you living it as if you had all the time in the world?

1076
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,600
Well, if you're not doing both, you are wasting your fucking time.

1077
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,580
If you are not getting slack, you are wasting your time.

1078
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:01,300
Now, of course, and then you go, oh, slack, isn't that a Miller beer commercial?

1079
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:10,680
Slack, isn't that where your team is winning the game and there's a bunch of cute TV-looking MTV girls dancing around?

1080
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,100
You're good-looking and rich. Isn't that slack?

1081
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,280
Or, oh no, isn't slack like what Beavis and Bunhead do?

1082
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,440
Just sit around and watch TV all day.

1083
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,020
And drink beer and smoke dope.

1084
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,160
Could that be slack, too?

1085
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,820
Hello!

1086
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,260
For friends, slack is not...

1087
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,760
necessarily...

1088
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:33,940
laziness!

1089
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,480
Sorry to break it to you.

1090
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,720
For some of you, I mean, you know, that's the difference between us and the conspiracy.

1091
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,700
The conspiracy will tell you what slack is!

1092
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,820
And it is that Miller beer commercial.

1093
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,680
Or it is your next paycheck, or whatever.

1094
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,140
For some of us, friends, slack is activity.

1095
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,760
Doing what we want to do.

1096
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,820
Not work for the conspiracy, but work for us!

1097
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,960
When some of us find true slack

1098
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,180
by working ourselves up into such a

1099
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,960
fit of activity, pure concentration,

1100
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,280
and lack of sleep,

1101
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,620
such an incredible level of awareness,

1102
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,220
that for just a second, your eyes snap open,

1103
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,960
and you realize that life is wonderful,

1104
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,860
the world is beautiful,

1105
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:25,480
and everything is just as psychedelic as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

1106
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,000
Now!

1107
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,880
Hold.

1108
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,780
That.

1109
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,760
Thought!

1110
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,040
Hard to do!

1111
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,960
And I'll tell you what makes it hard to do.

1112
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,440
It's the conspiracy!

1113
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,880
And, uh, you know,

1114
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,300
when we talk about the conspiracy,

1115
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,660
half the time people are going,

1116
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,740
oh yeah, I know what conspiracy they're talking about,

1117
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,460
because I read that one conspiracy book.

1118
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,000
The conspiracy that killed John Kennedy and him flying saucers under the desert,

1119
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,960
and, uh, and crashed in Roswell,

1120
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,780
and made the X-Files, and, uh,

1121
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,280
and, uh, yeah, that conspiracy is a big one.

1122
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:01,280


1123
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:01,680
It's a big conspiracy.

1124
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,880
Oh no, no, they go,

1125
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,340
oh no, it's a conspiracy that makes a certain haircut cool this month.

1126
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,780
Or no, it's the conspiracy of this or that.

1127
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,000
First, there's only one conspiracy that causes all the other ones,

1128
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,400
and that's the conspiracy that's too fucking stupid to even know it's a conspiracy.

1129
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,720
The conspiracy of the normals!

1130
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,600
The ordinary garden-variety human beings

1131
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,240
who do not even know that everything they do takes away the slack of the underworld.

1132
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,360
Yeah.

1133
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:29,820
Yeah.

1134
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,400
But they don't know because they're too busy imitating TV.

1135
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,680
Now, we can fight lots of other creatures who build up the hate

1136
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,480
against specific conspiracy figures,

1137
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,220
your boss, or the, you know, the rude clerks in the stores,

1138
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,560
the cops, and so forth.

1139
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,220
But you know,

1140
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,320
there's one part of the conspiracy that really chaps my ass.

1141
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,940
To quote the great Jane O'Haggard, please, it kind of makes me pee.

1142
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,820
And then?

1143
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:03,620
Friends,

1144
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,120
87% of the people in this, just in this country,

1145
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,040
believe that there is an invisible monster living in the sky

1146
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,560
that will, if they piss its ass enough,

1147
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,200
or pay it enough lip service, it will do them favors,

1148
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,140
smite their enemies, bring them good luck, and so forth.

1149
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,080
87% of the people believe in this invisible monster.

1150
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,460
And because of that,

1151
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,260
we have to deal with it.

1152
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,860
That doesn't mean there is an invisible monster,

1153
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,440
but they think there is, and we have to deal with it.

1154
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,420
And that's why, friends, as of this year,

1155
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,420
we, herewith, the Church of the Subgenius,

1156
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,520
declare war on God!

1157
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,040
.

1158
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,960
You know, we've got a call.

1159
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,160
That's kind of a fight call for us.

1160
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,000
That takes a lot of nerve to declare war on God.

1161
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,180
But you know, I'm really tired of hearing about this God

1162
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,760
that is such a pussy, this God that is so weak

1163
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,180
that it has to have stupid redneck little old ladies

1164
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,120
defend it against idiots like me.

1165
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,640
What the hell kind of a God is that?

1166
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,360
Well, friends, this religion, in most ways,

1167
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,660
this religion is just like every other religion.

1168
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,120
It's just built upon hate of everyone different from us.

1169
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,180
The only difference is at least we're upfront about it.

1170
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,340
We're honest about it.

1171
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,820
And they hate us for all kinds of stupid reasons.

1172
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,440
We only have one reason for hating them,

1173
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,680
because we've got Bob and they don't!

1174
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,120
.

1175
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,220
.

1176
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,020
Oh, the hate feels good.

1177
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:08,860
.

1178
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,560
Actually, it can be kind of creepy, you know,

1179
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,840
to stand up here and have a whole crowd of people

1180
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,020
chanting like a bunch of Nazis,

1181
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,840
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1182
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,040
Creepy!

1183
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,940
Hey! Hey!

1184
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,820
Use your brain, used that brain!

1185
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,060
AndAKII, he's here, hot to kill!

1186
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,020
We're going to have a fight,

1187
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,120


1188
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,120


1189
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,120


1190
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,120


1191
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,120


1192
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,260
½

1193
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,260


1194
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,940
so we in Marian in this country should use that brain

1195
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,440
andock each other to king

1196
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,180
Subgenius magic.

1197
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,360
Let's not go into the four steps of subgenius magic, dear friends.

1198
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,960
Let's just give credits.

1199
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,500
That was Negative Land in the background, providing the amazing sound effects and horror music and so forth.

1200
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:13,060
I think some of that was from Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Bernard Herrmann's classic.

1201
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,380
Classic.

1202
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,200
Beautiful.

1203
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,940
And friends, yes, thank and praise Negative Land.

1204
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:24,860
And praise Crawford Smith, who organized the Portland devivals.

1205
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,260
And praise Emot Zeppel for this music in the background, Cosmic Voyeur.

1206
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:38,060
Praise Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1207
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:46,780
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1208
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,540
Because you are my number one guy.

1209
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,860
As a liver fluke, pal.

1210
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,340
I want it now.

1211
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,860
The end is now.

1212
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,800
The end is now.

1213
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,180
I want it all and I want it now.

1214
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,000
Break on through to the other side.

1215
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:13,000
Break on through to the other side.

1216
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,400
Are we not ten?

1217
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,960
We are ten.

1218
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,220
We are ten.

1219
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,240
Are we not men?

1220
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,100
We are Devo.

1221
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,340
We are Devo.

1222
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,200
We are Devo.

1223
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,860
D-E-V-O.

1224
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,100
We are Devo.

1225
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,880
I am a Devo.
