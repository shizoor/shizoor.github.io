1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,460
The South Geniuses

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,300
The South Geniuses

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:28,640
Come in, come in, Sergeant.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,020
Sergeant, stop that noise.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,520
Come in.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,280
Why do you stand there?

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,240
What is it?

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,180
Speak up, you wimpy head.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,660
Do you keep watching the clock?

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,860
Do you run down and jittery?

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
Do you tired?

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,180
Do you never end?

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,820
But that's how you feel.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,520
For your own sake, try Sub-Giddy-Meter.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,700
That's right.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,580
Sub-Giddy-Meter gives you glorious strength, energy, and needed vital substances.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,940
Plus iron.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,220
The name is Sub-Giddy-Meter.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,720
And now...

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,180
Turn off your radio.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,660
Now.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,040
How's he doing?

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,880
He's alright.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,140
You know, he's a little shaken up, but...

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,380
I was involved in some covert CIA-sponsored mind-altering techniques back in the 70s.

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
I'd like a few minutes alone with him just to erase what he saw from his memory.

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,140
You're not going to erase my son's memory.

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,060
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,760
Greg, he saw Bob.

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,160
He already has issues.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,200
That's something he might never recover from.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,200
I'll handle it.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,560
Okay.

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,340
Alright.

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,100
Okay.

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,620
Thank you.

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,420
In 27 years on the force, this is the first time I think I may have to throw up looking at this man.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,700
Over there, you can see a little bit of her brain.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,000
That's her hair ribbon.

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,520
And over there, that's her left shoe, I think.

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,380
That's part of it there by the engine block.

42
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,080
So, in conclusion, kids...

43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,280
That's all crazy.

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,160
Crazy.

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,160


46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,280
When you get behind the wheel of a car, make sure it's not your last prop.

47
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,580
Okay, over and out.

48
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,100
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

49
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,820
Roger Wilco.

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,560
What does Wilco mean?

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,180
Wilcopy.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,520
I thought it was a code for Philo.

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,200
Well, no, it has nothing to do with Steve Wilco.

54
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,740
Yeah, like do well.

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,260
Steven Ro Wilco.

56
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,800
Steve Roper, Mike Nomad, and Steve Wilco.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,940
Those brawny guys.

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Those brawny guys with the big cleft chins.

59
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,140
Give me another beer.

60
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,560
Yeah, they had plenty of adventures.

61
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,140
They fought Hitler's brain.

62
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,080
They did fight Hitler's brain all the way across...

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,760
And then I don't have...

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Did I tell you about anything in the paper here?

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,300
On a speedboat.

66
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,640
Oh, on a speedboat.

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:44,920
Yeah, right.

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,620
When they were in Florida.

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
You know, in that time, the adventure they had.

70
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,260
Yeah.

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,920
Did I tell you on the last five shows about my movie idea,

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,840
Harold and Maude and Kumar go to meet Hitler?

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,340
Yeah, that's cool.

74
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,700
Buy Hitler's art.

75
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,280
Yeah.

76
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,780
Yeah.

77
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,620
Yeah, but I'm still back here on Hitler Takes the Submarine

78
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,400
because we've got the submarine footage filmed.

79
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,040
Yeah.

80
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,980
So now we need to somehow get Hitler from that to the speedboat.

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,500
And we can have quite a movie.

82
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,920
Take him off the submarine and put him on the speedboat.

83
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,400
Yahoo.

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

85
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,660
We could bring my parts to the park.

86
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,160
We would have to go to Kurt's house in Florida to shoot all this, of course.

87
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,580
Because he would have the costume.

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,780
I get seasick on the speedboat.

89
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,400
And he would have the...

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Probably he'd know somebody with the speedboat.

91
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,500
Yeah.

92
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,920
We've got to finish the movie.

93
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,760
It's our mission now.

94
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,740
Bye.

95
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,240
Have it turned into a ridiculous thing with Hitler in a Hawaiian shirt.

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,720
Like a Bollywood movie.

97
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,320
Driving around in a speedboat.

98
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
A musical number.

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000


100
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,260
Didn't Mel Brooks already do that?

101
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,320
Yeah, but this is ours, man.

102
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,240
Not like that.

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,320
No.

104
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,900
Not in a Hawaiian shirt.

105
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,200
This is a new generation's laughter, Hitler.

106
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,280
Just imagine the laughter.

107
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,480
The silvery...

108
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,020
Because see, what happened is Jesus forgave Hitler.

109
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,800
So then he could just go back and have fun until the end.

110
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,600
But then the Mormons ordained him.

111
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,120
Right.

112
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,580
And gave him eternal life as a name in their book.

113
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,900
And then the subgeniuses did the same thing.

114
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,660
Yeah.

115
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,900
And that was when the Hitler comic book finally was banned.

116
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,760
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can't get one.

117
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,640
Who would win?

118
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,940
Hitler or Batman?

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,520
Well...

120
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,500
If Batman fought Hitler, who would win?

121
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,620
Well, that makes you wonder why Batman didn't fight Hitler.

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,420
And that was a big problem back then.

123
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,680
You know, why weren't Batman and Superman going over there?

124
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,660
And winning the war with two punches instead of, you know, letting our...

125
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,640
When did Batman appear?

126
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,360
I know Superman should have been in there, but when did Batman come along?

127
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,120
Well, maybe Superman supposedly can't interfere with blah, blah, blah.

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,680
In the 30s.

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,300
I thought that...

130
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,240
Bruce Wayne was a draft doctor.

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,680
I thought Superman did do some Hitler punching in a few issues.

132
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,180
Bruce Wayne did contribute to the war effort.

133
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,780
Yeah, but on the Nazi side.

134
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,600
But why wasn't he out there on the front line?

135
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,340
Bruce Wayne and the Bushes.

136
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,840
Oh, yeah.

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
Were contributing to the Nazi war effort.

138
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,180
Yeah.

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,560
Because they had better machines.

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,540
It was an investment.

141
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,500
There's a book.

142
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,500
There's a book.

143
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,400
A whole fake The Waynes and the...

144
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,940
You know, all tied into the real history.

145
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,140
The Waynes, the Bushes, the camps.

146
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,260
The Mobius Strip, yeah.

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,900
And why the Waynes become a comic book fakery thing as opposed to the Bushes, who actually

148
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,180
do run Bay of Pigs.

149
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,220
And really were super costumed heroes.

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
Not super heroes, but costumed heroes.

151
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,440
And I apologize to Nose Hair Lincoland for not playing the Mary Sherman story.

152
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,040
We'll do that next week.

153
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,400
Bye.

154
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,240
Bye.

155
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,000
Bye.

156
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,440
Bye.

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,700
Bye.

158
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,620
Bye.

159
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,140
Bye.

160
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,840
Bye.

161
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,100
Bye.

162
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,920
Bye.

163
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,540
Bye.

164
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,060
Bye.

165
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,060


166
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,400
Bye.

167
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,860
Thank you.

168
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,840
Thank you.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,640
Thank you.

170
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,420
Thank you.

171
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,480
Thank you.

172
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,220
Thank you.

173
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,600
Thank you.

174
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,580
Thank you.

175
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,800
Thank you.

176
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,080
Thank you.

177
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,680
Thank you.

178
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,800
Thank you.

179
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,020
Thank you.

180
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,740
Thank you.

181
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,160
Let's go down the hall.

182
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,760
Danke.

183
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,740
Okay, you're welcome.

184
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,800
Auf Wiedersehen.

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,360
Auf Wiedersehen.

186
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,120
The smoke bomb here.

187
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,880
Danke schön.

188
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,340
You're welcome.

189
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,720
So what do you think of Dr. Hal and Ivan Stang on the show now?

190
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,220
Trying to stay on what show now?

191
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,680
What do you mean?

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,780
The showdown between Dr. Hal and Ivan Stang at high noon in El Dorado.

193
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,060
All a bunch of malarkey.

194
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,700
So what happens at X-Day this year?

195
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,860
Well, I...

196
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,160
Oh, it's a Day of the Dead theme.

197
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Well, appropriately, since it's the day everybody else will be dead.

198
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:27,900
We're planning to have another heat stroke and heat wave and tornado and lightning strike, just like last year.

199
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,260
When President Obama declared it a disaster area.

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,820
Well, the funny thing was, yes, President Obama declared southern Ohio a disaster area,

201
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,680
and yet the one place where he still had a...

202
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,540
Electricity and internet was...

203
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,020
Where?

204
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Was Derry Campground.

205
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,840
Where the subgeniuses were messing around, but nobody else had any refrigeration or...

206
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,000
Just one little pocket of perfection.

207
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,240
It was a crisis.

208
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,720
Everywhere around was death.

209
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,120
The subgeniuses got a taste of their future.

210
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,340
Well, it was...

211
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:10,680
It still was a little hot, and there were horrible testicle-eating spiders clustered underneath the seats of the...

212
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


213
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


214
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


215
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


216
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


217
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


218
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,680


219
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:10,860
That's true.

220
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,540
That's so mystical.

221
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,480
Chem toilets.

222
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,360
Yes, right.

223
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,200
You know, women don't have to worry about those, but men do.

224
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,680
Making me more misty.

225
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,120
They're really...

226
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,180
These spiders are sort of butch, you know.

227
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:30,360
They're totally vigorous, able to withstand the chemical toilet thing.

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,940
But, as we know, the creatures out there are of a particularly hardy disposition.

229
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,600
And so are the subgeniuses who survived.

230
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,000
We can make sure that only the strong make it.

231
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,560
Yes, who needs air conditioning with all of its softening influences?

232
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,620
The true subgenius sweats it out next day.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Who needs chairs without spikes on them?

234
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,820
Who needs beds without scorpions?

235
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,700
Come on, we're subgeniuses.

236
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,860
We can...

237
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,440
That's right.

238
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,040
A few spider bites, why you act as though it actually...

239
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,240
mattered in any way.

240
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,920
It builds your immune system.

241
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,660
Which you're going to need, because you'll meet all sorts of extraterrestrial insect life on the pleasure saucers.

242
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,660
Right.

243
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:33,640
They've mastered faster-than-light travel, but they have not mastered the perfect mousetrap.

244
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
Oh, no, these are not vermin.

245
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,800
These are your beloved fellow crew members.

246
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:40,800
Yes.

247
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,720
Who have been changed into swine as soon as they were beamed up.

248
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,280
Wow.

249
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,260
That was the part they didn't tell you about in the first and second book.

250
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,940
Someone has to...

251
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,120
And the third book is out of print.

252
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,040
...feed the giant insects on these newly converted porkers.

253
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,660
In my version, they go to the funeral planet where they, of course, die and become little stuffed versions of themselves.

254
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,140
You know, nobody bought our third testament until it went out of print.

255
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,200
Now it's $800 a copy on eBay.

256
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,660
$800?

257
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,020
Not kidding.

258
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,700
$800.

259
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,500
FiloSort for $950.

260
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,320
It's down to $899 now.

261
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:17,900
Uh-oh.

262
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,760
But...

263
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah.

264
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,420
What does that fool anybody?

265
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,020
$899.

266
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,320
I'll get that now.

267
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,860
I ain't paying none of the pork.

268
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,600
Well, I'll sell mine for that amount.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,320
And I'll autograph it into the bargain.

270
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:29,980
It's like gas prices.

271
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,860
You weren't here, folks.

272
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,460
Yeah.

273
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh, nine-tenths of a cent.

274
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm really saving here.

275
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,080
As you go across country with gas being...

276
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,540
Actually, gas is not...

277
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,380
It's a gas.

278
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,680
Like here, elsewhere, right?

279
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,540
I paid four...

280
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,840
Princess, we and I paid $4.25 for gas this evening in...

281
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,420
Oh, yeah.

282
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,080
Where were we?

283
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,720
Fremont?

284
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,560
Mm-hmm.

285
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,100
And a guy overheard her saying,

286
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,320
well, let's just put $20 worth in because, you know, it's not...

287
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,380
I know we'll find it cheaper further on.

288
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,300
And this guy walked up and said, I'll do the same thing.

289
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,120
This is the highest I've seen in this area, $4.25.

290
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,140
I just get $10 at a time.

291
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,240
I mean, who can afford a tank of gas?

292
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,760
And I didn't say, well, in a couple of weeks, we'll be back in the east of here where it's only $3 a gallon.

293
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,200
We got gas for $2.89 in Florida a month ago, two months ago now.

294
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,720
Yep.

295
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,700
We're special.

296
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,060
We need special gas.

297
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,160
For a special...

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,640
Spensive.

299
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,640
We went to that Dobbs Town...

300
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,120
Spatial.

301
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,960
...abusement park in Orlando.

302
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,820
We also went to Epcot and Universal.

303
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,220
But the Dobbs Town riders...

304
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,780
I mean, the park is...

305
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:49,940
Yeah.

306
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,420
It's a little run down.

307
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,120
The Dobbs Town riders, are they like a motorcycle gang?

308
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,460
They terrorize the little bobbies at X-Day.

309
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,400
They're like rogue police officers.

310
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,460
It's been a...

311
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,100
I don't know if we should even discuss that particular...

312
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,520
Those guys are at Dobbs Town, Paris now.

313
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,260
It's better than Paris Island, where they came from.

314
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,100
We...

315
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,640
We...

316
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,160
We...

317
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,180
Some of the rides you can tell are kind of old.

318
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,300
And they imported the Flintstone Village from outside the Grand Canyon, that run down...

319
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,420
Oh, great.

320
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,820
Yeah, that's at Dobbs Town in Orlando now, the whole thing.

321
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,940
And it's still run down.

322
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:24,960
Yay.

323
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
They didn't fix it up.

324
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,640
They left it exactly the way it was.

325
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,240
They even imported the radioactive dirt.

326
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,140
When you go through Williams, there's just a little empty pit of radioactive dirt now.

327
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,660
No...

328
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,540
I used to love to go in there because nobody was around.

329
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,780
Is that what town it was?

330
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,260
Williams.

331
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:39,820
Beautiful.

332
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,040
Yeah.

333
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,320
I...

334
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,140
We went there with the kids back in the 1880s.

335
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,880
Yeah.

336
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,720
Coming across country when you guys...

337
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:47,880
Yeah.

338
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,500
It was a proud and untamed land.

339
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,120
Yes.

340
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,860
Bedrock.

341
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,220
Flintstone's Bedrock City.

342
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,800
Cash on the girl.

343
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,440
Yeah, they really bastardized the thing when it became Yabba Dabba.

344
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,060
You mean the Spielberg version?

345
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,520
Yeah.

346
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,320
And what about...

347
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,380
Even worse than that, the sequel to the Spielberg...

348
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,700
The Spielberg version, not by Spielberg.

349
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh, are you talking about Flintstone movies?

350
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,560
The Flintstones 2, Viva Rock Vegas.

351
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,460
They changed the actors, didn't they?

352
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,360
Yes, they did.

353
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,000
The original ones asked too much for that project.

354
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
I can't believe that.

355
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,200
I think they do it out of the kindness of their heart.

356
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,360
Who would do that?

357
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,980
John Goodman wanted more money to play Fred Flintstone a second time.

358
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,280
He wouldn't do it a second time.

359
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,480
He said once was enough.

360
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,620
How could he say a thing like that?

361
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,980
And wasn't Agent Dale Cooper in that movie?

362
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,820
In the first one, but not the second one.

363
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,280
Yeah, and what did?

364
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,980
He was an evil corporate villain in old Stone Age Bedrock.

365
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,620
He used the voice on...

366
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,880
The weirding word he used on Wilma and Barney.

367
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,400
Yabba Dabba Doo!

368
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,620
Yes, now we know the terrible things that that does.

369
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,580
It's a horrible incantation.

370
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,100
It should never actually be articulated.

371
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,540
It does infinite harm.

372
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,820
But enough shop talk.

373
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,520
You know, we do have to mention that Ivan Stang is going to make appearances

374
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,240
at fairs and carnivals in this area.

375
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,000
The 4-H Club will be hosting him with the Heifer Show

376
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,760
at the Santa Mira Fair on July 23rd.

377
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,000
And after that, the Stangs, the traveling road show,

378
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,400
will be...

379
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,760
at the exposition of dairy farmers and curd producers.

380
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,480
We'll be at the Gilroy Garlic Festival.

381
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,880
Gilroy Garlic Festival, that's true.

382
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,160
And then, of course, the...

383
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,720
That's fun. You can get a garlic milkshake.

384
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,700
You can get garlic cow pies.

385
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,520
Party check milkshake.

386
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,900
Garlic milkshake? Where do I sign up?

387
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,040
I love that song.

388
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,420
And at the Great American Music Hall on October 24th.

389
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,180
They make the finest garlic cow pies,

390
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,780
and all of Lompoc.

391
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,980
Ah, yes, uh...

392
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,200
I mean, Gilroy.

393
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,480
That was... I thought, uh, peccary pie?

394
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,300
Peccary pie?

395
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, yeah, like, you know, like, everybody likes it.

396
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,620
Gregory Peccary, everyone.

397
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,100
Now, is a peccary the same as, uh,

398
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,780
what everyone else calls a javelina?

399
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,860
And that I, for some reason, always pronounce javelina?

400
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,980
You're correct. It is pronounced javelina.

401
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,680
Yes.

402
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,860
Uh, uh, it's, uh...

403
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,020
No accident.

404
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,320
Javelinas do roam the desert.

405
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,540
Why, I've often seen them.

406
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,740
They're out there.

407
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,720
They're out there.

408
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,440
Oh, my God!

409
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,240
They've treed Dr. Howell.

410
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,380
He's up on the top of that...

411
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,080
Oh, my God.

412
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,600
...Savaro cactus.

413
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,500
Get back.

414
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,360
Look at those creatures.

415
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,980
They're giant razorback hogs.

416
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm not really seeing this, am I?

417
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,560
Those prehistoric eleothears.

418
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,620
Bofangos, they're called.

419
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,780
The giant, uh, creature.

420
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,660
It is a monstrous pig.

421
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,280
It's like, uh, a creature, a cryodot of the Arteodactyla.

422
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,620
They're terrifying.

423
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,060
Yes, from the, uh, Miocene period.

424
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:25,300
And, uh, this was the largest, most fearsome hog predator ever to walk the Earth,

425
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,240
grunting on its, uh, cloven hooves.

426
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,060
My children, we must stop the humans, or they will turn us into food.

427
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,980
Bacon.

428
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,040
We'll be slaves to them.

429
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,020
That's a...

430
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,240
In more ways than you can count.

431
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,840
You're the...

432
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,420
Omnivore.

433
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,860
I wonder that you should...

434
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,840
Now squeal like a sow.

435
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Well, there you go.

436
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,820
That's the fact of life, uh, pork chop style.

437
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,000
For, uh, Sensual Radio, this is Ralph Fielding Snow.

438
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,820
Huh?

439
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,580
Life among the pigs.

440
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,560
The, uh, sex story.

441
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,040
See?

442
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,540


443
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,540


444
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,080
What the subway?

445
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,200
Why die until his blood grew black after With me, Bowser.

446
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,840
Oh, he could have been put on a pass and then free like I wanted to do.

447
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:38,840


448
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,680
I've seen communal carnal relations nearly turn into a mob

449
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,240
But for a truly unique sensation you got to turn to Connie and Bob

450
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:57,800
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

451
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,200
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the Church of Subgenius

452
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,680
I've seen the mating of the iguana on the rocks is what they prefer

453
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,060
While the sloths just like to hang around hoping something will occur

454
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,920
And though the rabbit is most unsteady he is always ready once more

455
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,180
But when it comes to Bob and Connie there's no way of keeping score

456
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,160
Oh

457
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,820
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

458
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:49,140
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the Church of Subgenius

459
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,140
La la la la la

460
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,460
Ay!

461
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,940
A dragon's lie has balance A black widow has the nash

462
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,820
But Bob and Connie got their hands on each other

463
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,720
And each other's personal stash

464
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,260
And Anna Catherin's got constriction And a crocodile has her grin

465
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,220
But Bob and Connie are the one true origin of sin

466
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,120
Oh!

467
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,240
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

468
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,860
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the Church of Subgenius

469
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,900
La la la la la la

470
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,220
Ay!

471
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,280
And Connie

472
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,340
La la la la la la

473
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,600
La la la la la la la la la la la la t-Bob

474
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,140
La la la la la la la la la la la t-Bob

475
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,680
Brown-eyed Bob

476
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,840
The ostrich do it in the service of God

477
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:04,840


478
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,540
없이

479
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,200
Far

480
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,160
Far

481
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,620
Far

482
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:23,920
All

483
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,340
All

484
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,220
Down

485
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,540
Down

486
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:34,700
Down

487
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:34,720
All

488
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,740
Down

489
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:34,760
Down

490
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:34,780
Down

491
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:34,800
All

492
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:34,820
All

493
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,020
Mary, Job and Connie In the church of sub-genia

494
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,700
It's the miracle of the 90's It's the talk of all the others

495
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,160
It's the Mary, Job and Connie In the church of sub-genia

496
00:25:49,160 --> 00:26:00,160
It's the Miracle Party Night, it's the dark tomorrow, it's the marriage of Bob and Mel, in the church of St. Jenny.

497
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:11,100
It's the Miracle Party Night, it's the dark tomorrow, it's the marriage of Bob and Mel, in the church of St. Jenny.

498
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:29,380
La la la la la la, and Connie, la la la la la la, and Connie, la la la la la la, and Connie, la.

499
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,800
Scientists have two sort of super soaker nozzles on their head that they fire urine out of.

500
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,080
In fact, they're not even going to use it.

501
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,320
In battles.

502
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,640
Can I see that?

503
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:51,220
No, but it turns out that when a female comes upon a male, she shoots out a stream of urine, but it's like love potion number nine.

504
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,060
And she seduces the male, so instead of smacking her over the head with his claw, you know, she says, come in, come in.

505
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,440
Well, and pee nozzles in their head, two bladders of urine, which are located in their heads.

506
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,600
Well, and then one of the most difficult ones, of course, is climate change.

507
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,700
The warm urine is really having a huge impact in the ocean and the creatures that live there.

508
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,560
Seawater temperatures are rising, and the acidity of the ocean is rising.

509
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,960
Could we, we, we...

510
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:35,240
Well, have you noticed that in the church of the subgenius, there's this fascination with animals, and every few years, it'll swing around to a different animal.

511
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,260
It was prairie squid for a long time, then face...

512
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,020
Having...

513
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,100
Bats.

514
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,460
Well, then all the females, the younger ones...

515
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,080
Then it was goats.

516
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,960
They were talking about being...

517
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,620
And now it's bears.

518
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,960
...violated in the woods by a certain man-bear pig that they said was out there.

519
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,320
Man-bear pig?

520
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,000
The right...

521
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
No, that was the South Park thing.

522
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,320
No, that was the...

523
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,040
They made a cardboard sign at X-Day.

524
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,860
I saw it.

525
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,280
About man-bear pig?

526
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,380
Yes, with...

527
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,580
That's not very original.

528
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,040
Pictures of this...

529
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,700
Being engaged in violating some well-known subgenius.

530
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,500
We had heard about the horrible rape bears, and I know that's not funny.

531
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,760
And they're out there, too, huh?

532
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,480
With their seven...

533
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,000
You know, the big question was, how does the victim survive during hibernation?

534
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:34,360
And the answer to that, I cannot tell you on the public radio waves.

535
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,420
It involves tampions and worse.

536
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,240
But what does the victim have to do?

537
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,300
It has to do with hibernation.

538
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,660
Hey, the rape bears do that for seven years.

539
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
And during that seven years, the bear's going to hibernate.

540
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:56,440
Now, how does he keep the subgenius alive as prisoner while he's hibernating and keep him from escaping?

541
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,380
This is all mythical.

542
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,040
Yes, this is...

543
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,240
And it makes me get all misty...

544
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,180
It doesn't really happen.

545
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,320
...when I hear about it.

546
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,000
We invite everyone to come.

547
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,220
There are no raping semi-human beings.

548
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,840
There are no humanoid bears in the woods.

549
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,720
And if there are, I'm sure this is simply a misunderstanding, which can be...

550
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,200
Any of you learning that are going to X-Days, please build a biobot of a mystical raping bear.

551
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
That would just create more confusion.

552
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,980
We're trying to straighten these issues out.

553
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,760
I think the origin of the right...

554
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
Somebody better rent a bear suit and do this, folks.

555
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,940
No, we need no frauds here.

556
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,900
This problem is sufficient on its own.

557
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,320
We had a gorilla suit last year.

558
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,100
Yeah, we did, but it was so hot that Philo couldn't...

559
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,560
Oh, ahem.

560
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,460
The, uh, whoever was going to wear it...

561
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:50,260
And the sightings of the so-called right bears are merely glimpses of Dr. Legume striding through the woods.

562
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:57,740
This picture that I found on a piece of cardboard showed two aggressors in that realm.

563
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,200
One was a bear, and one, I think, was intended to represent J.R. Bob Dobbs with pipe and everything.

564
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,060
It was, uh...

565
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,120
Keep your plugs in.

566
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,800
When you go to X-Day, kids...

567
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,920
Well, it's, uh...

568
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
You can't be too cautious.

569
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,060
You know, I'm...

570
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,300
It's all part of the learning experience that we offer.

571
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:29,300
Uh, we do have classes that you can take on fashioning a tampion out of objects found in the woods.

572
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,500
Out of spittle, leaves, bark, and chung-tong root.

573
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,300
Chung-tong root?

574
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:37,640
Yes.

575
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,220
It grows in the...

576
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,800
In the southern Ohio area.

577
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,840
Make sure it's not a poison ivy stem or vine.

578
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,940
That would be a terrible mistake.

579
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,260
It would backfire.

580
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,700
That would be...

581
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,280
As it were, so to speak.

582
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Well, someone would...

583
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,440
Terrible and terrifying.

584
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,500
Backfire.

585
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,940
Think of.

586
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,900
You know, uh, the way kids, uh, cut grapevines and smoke them like cigars?

587
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,180
Or maybe they used to do that back in the pre-computer days.

588
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,620
Well, before corn silk.

589
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,220
But, uh, you can cut a length of, uh, grapevine if you're a kid and smoke it?

590
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,300
And it makes a nice smoke.

591
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,180
Have you ever done that?

592
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:11,680
No.

593
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,180
Ew.

594
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,540
Oh, okay.

595
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,860
We didn't...

596
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,960
They didn't make grapevines in Texas.

597
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,400
We were just...

598
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,940
See, I...

599
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,600
I lived with, uh...

600
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,240
We had to use cow...

601
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,060
Everybody except staying in the world did it.

602
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,060
I lived with hillbillies for a while.

603
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,360
We also, uh, chewed tobacco.

604
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,300
But, uh, smoking the grapevine cigarette was, uh, something everybody did.

605
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:37,460
But there was, at the time, a sort of grisly, not an urban legend, since we were intensely rural,

606
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,120
but a horrible legend about some...

607
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,200
Yeah.

608
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,200


609
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,200


610
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,200


611
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,460
...kid who thought he was smoking a grapevine, but he cut a poison ivy vine and smoked it

612
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,140
and his entire lungs...

613
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,280
But it's organic.

614
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,020
...fell out, you know, because they were all a mass of blood.

615
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,480
Oh!

616
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,280
And so...

617
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes.

618
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,700
Hal was one of the pallbearers who carried his little friend to the...

619
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,000
It wasn't me, I swear.

620
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,960
I told him to smoke the grapevine.

621
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,140
Why doesn't anyone listen?

622
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,520
Oh, well, it's another one of those misunderstandings.

623
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,900
What a nightmarish...

624
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,540
Yes, I, uh...

625
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:08,860
Legend.

626
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,420
Here, kid, smoke this Black Widow cigar.

627
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,820
Let's hope it was just a legend.

628
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,920
Yes, it's moving under its own power.

629
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,060
But I've seen such sights that, uh, no one would believe it.

630
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,260
In my exploration of the underground, uh, world, I've seen...

631
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,140
Hillbillies, you say?

632
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,920
...spider outrages that...

633
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,600
Oh, no, I...

634
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,200
Was that a reality show, Dr. Hal and the Hal-billies?

635
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,180
There was no show.

636
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,220
It was all intensely real.

637
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,740
Yeah, it was...

638
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,640
Came right after Subgenius Junction.

639
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,200
Yeah.

640
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,760
Uh...

641
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,200
I...

642
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,380
This was long before I...

643
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:40,980
Which opens with a...

644
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,940
...ever heard of Subgenius Junction.

645
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,200
...Berkeley Hal-billies.

646
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,180
No, no.

647
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,200
I was in the Ozark Mountains, uh, in the, uh, wilds of southern Missouri.

648
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,300
Yeah, let's go back to where Hal was.

649
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,300
An intensely forested area.

650
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,600
Here he is, eight years old.

651
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,100
The Ozark Mountains.

652
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,660
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, gather round.

653
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,180
I've got something awesome to tell you.

654
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,660
String it up!

655
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,480
Hanging's too good for it.

656
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,760
We need to reorganize.

657
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,300
All you...

658
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,280
...people on a scientific basis.

659
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,120
Now, everybody with a single shot, get over there by...

660
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,840
...Eb Ziegler's Ford.

661
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,160
He's evil, I'll tell you.

662
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
He created a monster.

663
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,480
That's just, uh, Joe, and you all know him.

664
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
He's a fine fella.

665
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,240
Burn down the castle.

666
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,300
Burn down Dr. Hal's moving castle.

667
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,620
Well, that's, uh, what's gonna go up to Big Springs for the show.

668
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,860
They're gonna look at it up there, and then you...

669
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,920
...people will...

670
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,300
Well, you'll technically own it.

671
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,300
You can do what you want.

672
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,180
Now we're gonna get a...

673
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,840
...get a little move on here...

674
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,860
...and travel up the current river to...

675
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,520
...Big Springs, Missouri.

676
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,580
Ah, the waters of the current running over the pebbly bottom.

677
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,180
Pebbly spring and chasms and watery depths.

678
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,140
In the john boat.

679
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,740
Trolling for the giant, uh, alligator gar that inhabits the river.

680
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,820
Big enough to swallow a human...

681
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
...with a single gulp.

682
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,420
Up you go.

683
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,240
I think we're almost out of gas.

684
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,700
The giant snapping turtle is found in this river system.

685
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, come on, it's your game.

686
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,700
What do we do now?

687
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,800
Sixty pounds and more.

688
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,940
Let's see, we gotta eat the giant power pill, or...

689
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Yeah, if we eat the giant power pill, we can row back ashore, but we'll lose a lot of health.

690
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,120
Right.

691
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,340
We might not make it to shore in time, so we might have to...

692
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,800
But then we get back to shore.

693
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,860
We paint Old Man Dob's barn.

694
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,060
There's no man bear pigs.

695
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,040
That's a legend.

696
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,660
Yeah, we gotta avoid the man bear pigs.

697
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,180
No, they... they doesn't exist.

698
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,740
Oh, it does... well, it just... it exists when you get to higher levels of the game.

699
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,800
These are just nervous women. They make up stories.

700
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,900
I... I... there's no such creature.

701
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,020
I... uh... I... I wish I could, uh, reassure you.

702
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,500
Then...

703
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,040
Okay, it was the much less...

704
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,620
That was Hitler and the bear pig.

705
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,820
The much less threatening man koala bear pig.

706
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,580
And now they're bringing in... now they're bringing in Hitler?

707
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,620
I thought it was Hitler and the bear pig.

708
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,640
The Hitler koala bear pig.

709
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Oh, that's terrible.

710
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,340
The cause of all global warming doubters.

711
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,280
You can tell by the little mustache there.

712
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,240
Oh.

713
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,540
Um... now, um...

714
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,280
Yeah, I know, looking... looking for the old files.

715
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,520
That's not gonna work.

716
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,300
Dr. Howell is scanning the newspaper.

717
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:31,100
I was trying to find evidence that would back up this man bear pig story, but I, uh...

718
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,640
Well, we exchanged the Hitler koala bear, uh, guinea pig.

719
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,640
It's, uh, cuter.

720
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,240
Everybody loves Hitler jokes now.

721
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,980
And UFO jokes.

722
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
It's too soon!

723
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,820
You are kicking when he can't defend himself.

724
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,140
UFO jokes? Are you trivializing an important subject matter?

725
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,700
UFOders, Bigfeet, uh, the entire spectrum of fringe science.

726
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,960
Did you say UFOders?

727
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,300
Well, they have been...

728
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,780
And Bigfeet in the same sentence?

729
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,660
They have been detected.

730
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,320
Do you have UFOder problems with your Bigfeet?

731
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,040
You may.

732
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,220
Because of your unearthly predilection...

733
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,000
Monkey butt powder can help you.

734
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
...for a foot powder that wasn't created on this terraqueous globe,

735
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,120
but rather on an otherworld far out in the inky darkness of interstellar space.

736
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,780
Out of space.

737
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,600
We used to think that planets went around suns in orbital systems,

738
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,740
but now we know there are mysterious, uncounted, dark, rogue planets

739
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,600
moving through space.

740
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,860
One of them may be coming here at this very hour.

741
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,040
Oh, we'd better hurry up. There's only 15 minutes left.

742
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,880
Everybody laughed at Flash Gordon when the planet Mongo suddenly entered the solar system.

743
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,280
Planets don't move around and do that.

744
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,140
Well, they do if Ming the Merciless has figured out the science of planetary motion.

745
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,280
Or what about that old Japanese movie, Gorath?

746
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,740
Remember Gorath?

747
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,860
No.

748
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,700
Oh, well, there's this movie. It's called Gorath.

749
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,760
And on the poster, it shows them fighting a giant lobster.

750
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,880
I mean, giant walrus in the Arctic.

751
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,080
But people may think that Gorath is a monster and it's the walrus.

752
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,980
But no, the walrus is simply an incidental diversion

753
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,600
because Gorath is the name, once again, of a rogue planet that enters the solar system

754
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,740
and it's going to hit the Earth.

755
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,160
What does science do?

756
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,520
They put rockets at the poles and they actually move the Earth out of the way

757
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,420
in doing so, disturbing the giant walrus.

758
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,740
I saw those suggestions in the Chronicle during this last couple of asteroid barnacle things.

759
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,040
So that's Gorath, ladies and gentlemen.

760
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,120
And people are saying, we should attach rockets to people on the Moon and move them out of the way.

761
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,700
Move people on the Moon out of the way with rockets? That'll never fly.

762
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,480
Oh, well.

763
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,540
But the cool thing is the swastika-shaped buildings on the surface.

764
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,540
Mein Gott, a swastika on the Moon.

765
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:18,380
Yes, all the moons, I mean the Nazi buildings on the far side of the Moon are made swastika-shaped by direct furor.

766
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
And here come the sheeple.

767
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,660
Oh, these are sheep.

768
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,800
Look at them, calling each other sheeple.

769
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,040
That means you're all sheeple.

770
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
Now they can be molded into...

771
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,380
Oh, sheeple, sheeple, sheeple.

772
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,780
...national socialist.

773
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,520
Steeple people.

774
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,020
I think for myself, you sheeple.

775
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,460
This mob can be stampeded.

776
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,720
They're all trying to run onto the pleasure saucer at once.

777
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,800
Foolish ones. Slow down. Some bellwether of a ram is going to have to lead them up the ramp.

778
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,960
Stop. Slow down. That's the only way you'll get on.

779
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,020
Bad.

780
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,080
They're crushing each other, the bobbies.

781
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,080
Oh, the horrible, the humanity.

782
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,540
They're going to run down there and get all those sheeple.

783
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:58,780
Those cows.

784
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,740
Have you no dreams, you people? Fight, you mindless sheep. You willing peck.

785
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,560
They're gone.

786
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,340
I'd volunteer myself, except these nosebleeds keep me on my back.

787
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,420
Look at that cool electric sheer Bob's got up there on that landing ramp.

788
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,540
That's sheer beauty, everybody.

789
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,080
It's wicked looking.

790
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,760
Yeah, I can...

791
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,000
It's sheerly divine.

792
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,460
With that, he'll sheer their earthly cares away.

793
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,360
Back to annals of cryptozoology. I actually did save this piece of cardboard from X-Day,

794
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,560
and I can send you a JPEG.

795
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:27,840
Wow.

796
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:35,860
Of the depiction, not by me, of these strange beings supposedly found in the woods of southern Ohio.

797
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,840
Covered in walnut water.

798
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,540
Well, that's walnut oil.

799
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,480
Well, it's special walnut oil plus water, yeah.

800
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,960
You know, that's what has kept old Ciqua alive for as long as he has been.

801
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,720
Walnut nutrients.

802
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,140
The walnut oil has not only created enormous size, but incredible vitality.

803
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,580
Keeps all those raffles looking real good, too.

804
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,280
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,060
And quite an appetite.

806
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,000
Ciqua sucks up all the bobbies.

807
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,800
Nobody ever finds...

808
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,360
Really, I'll tell you a little church secret.

809
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,680
It's like one of those old stairways to heaven, and then you just fall off into Ciqua's mouth.

810
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,760
Oh.

811
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,340
Yep.

812
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:19,040
Well, some people compete for the right to be the sacrificed old Ciqua.

813
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,460
Yes, the most beautiful subgeniette is covered with flowers.

814
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,660
She's given dances and drugs all day, and then somewhat dazed.

815
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:36,620
Dazed state is led down to the water, and she walks like a pillar of marble into the green, swirling waters of the swamp.

816
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,280
But she doesn't walk out of there.

817
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,880
Only a stream of bubbles rises from the deep like a belch of reptilian satisfaction.

818
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
And then she sings.

819
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,380
Now listen to my story about an apt man named Hal.

820
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,200
A voice divine, he was even my pal.

821
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,100
Then one day he was at a shooting op.

822
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,220
When out of the paparazzi came a lady named Frop.

823
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,840
Shane was her name.

824
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,140
Big lips, big hips.

825
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,600
Oh, no.

826
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,820
A lady.

827
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,220
Oh, gosh.

828
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,500
The Berkeley Howellbillies.

829
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,240
Guess I better put on my pants.

830
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,960
Y'all come back night here.

831
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,980
All right, all right.

832
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,300
Get this out of the way.

833
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,700
We're going to have a cop show now.

834
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,580
Splattigan.

835
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,080
Splattigan?

836
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,840
Yes.

837
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,260
He's a tough cop who makes tough decisions in a tough town.

838
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,580
Splattigan.

839
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,800
Now, when did we get the one about the topless lady cops in Miami?

840
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,220
Headless body found in topless bar.

841
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,860
I have that movie.

842
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,360
It's a DVD.

843
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,540
You do have that?

844
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,160
Susie gave us a book about that.

845
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,840
It's a great little, well, it's a joke, too.

846
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,500
I mean, there's a...

847
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
No, it really happened.

848
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,080
I know, I know.

849
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,360
But it's like the phrase itself is not unlike, um,

850
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,560
Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?

851
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,020
which is a Hollywood code for if I call Hal and say,

852
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,380
Well, the movie that you're working on, how's that going?

853
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
And Hal says, Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?

854
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,980
It means the project he's working on really stinks.

855
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,440
Severed Hand writes 14 novels.

856
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,180
Hey!

857
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,840
You mean The Beast with Five Fingers?

858
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,860
Severed Hand composes Sonata.

859
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,740
Seven Hands composed seven symphonies.

860
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,540
Beautiful!

861
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,500
Seven Sisters or Seven Brothers.

862
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,140
And these treatments can only be played by the left hand on the piano.

863
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,080
What?

864
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:44,400
Yes, the Beast with Five Fingers can leap about on the piano and play the piano.

865
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,360
It is quite a sight.

866
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,400
And only if you have two left hands.

867
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,280
Thank you, Thing.

868
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,160
Do I have to keep practicing, Dr. T?

869
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,840
Yes, again and again.

870
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,700
Oh.

871
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,700
A one and a two and a...

872
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,880
Ten little happy fingers dancing in the line.

873
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,880
Ten little happy fingers and they're mine, all mine.

874
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,160
They're mine, they're mine.

875
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,060
Now isn't that just fine?

876
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,120
Hey, wait a minute.

877
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,680
These aren't fingers.

878
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,200
Sorry.

879
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,360
These are...

880
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,260
We have to get him before the show.

881
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,300
These aren't minds.

882
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,800
Good.

883
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,060
My mind is not my mind.

884
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,360
Good.

885
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,740
What are these?

886
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,260
Lord.

887
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,840
Your mind is my mind.

888
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,860
Jack Lord.

889
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,420
And the most astonishing thing about it is...

890
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,460
The clavicular suspension is...

891
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,500
Can't do the levering.

892
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,180
I always hesitate to quote those monster movies when you're around, Dr. Howell,

893
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,100
because I know I'm getting a word off.

894
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,680
No.

895
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,420
It's probably astounding instead of astonishing or something.

896
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:54,640
I know.

897
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,060
It's amazing, astonishing, fantastic, unbelievable, preposterous.

898
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,880
It's behind.

899
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:11,720
You won't believe our eyes when we see the horrible sights of the show versus the thing.

900
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,440
Who would win?

901
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,860
Man, that's a tough one.

902
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,800
If Batman fought the show, who would win?

903
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,660
This beast has no lungs and it has no heart.

904
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,120
The show versus the thing?

905
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,740
It's more like what we would call a vegetable.

906
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,740
It breathes through a network of small tubules throughout its body.

907
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,640
Hence, gunfire has no real disadvantage.

908
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,440
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

909
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,880
Any abnormal sound?

910
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:46,700
No.

911
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,120
The sound is just the reflection.

912
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:05,580
All these things are made up of very subtle

913
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,440
millimeters.

914
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,920
That one has to capsize completely.

915
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,940
5 seconds.

916
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,540
You're right.

917
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,600
Incredible, absolutely incredible.

918
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,420
Mind over matter.

919
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,640
The whole business is mind over matter.

920
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,560
Totally and absolutely mind over matter.

921
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,240
Normal.

922
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,000
Normal.

923
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,380
Why do you want to be normal?

924
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,860
Think about it, no one.

925
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,880
Rather, rather.

926
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,720

Rather.

I think you've developed some kind of obsession here. I think you need some help.

that collaged just then and PR news are by Lemur.

1015
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,820
The song Normal was by Reverend Bill T. Miller's Kings of Feedback

1016
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,140
and the song The Marriage of Bob and Connie

1017
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,300
was by Sister Melodious Chops with Princess We Also Singing,

1018
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,900
that band also known as Victoria Ganger and Revelry.

1019
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,300
The crazy cartoon-like instrumental back near the beginning

1020
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,740
was Poop Hat Cha-Cha by the Rudy Schwartz Project

1021
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,500
from Full Frontal Klugman

1022
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:29,700
and the other little cut-up clips were all from Reverend Royal Decapitator.

1023
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:35,220
The sub-step music behind me is by Reverend Two Beans as seen at X-Day.

1024
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,100
Now, an instrumental break by the Swingin' Love Corpses

1025
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,320
with the Drummond Brothers on horns,

1026
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,520
a piece aptly called Bad Medicine.

From PR News in Washington, I'm expected to last all day, counting 79 felons in 3D today.

1036
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,380
Authorities say he led a quiet life until now.

1037
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,460
Grand theft under the influence or involuntary robbery.

1038
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,280
Leading to a 21-car pileup.

1039
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,780
PR News.

1040
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,580
PR's reports say local police must now take place within two months.

1041
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:59,440
The document has triggered mass protests, but supporters say this is PR News from Washington.

1042
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,260
Britain's Queen Elizabeth.

1043
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,500
Elizabeth expressed the enthusiasm for me and my family.

1044
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,300
27 people were killed.

1045
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,460
California Governor Jerry Brown has pardoned PR News in Washington.

1046
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,820
I was allowed to utilize their education devices, which are these huge walls that they have on the ship.

1047
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:23,160
You would basically be in this very extremely comfortable chair, and you would just look at the wall,

1048
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,400
and it would interact, it would interface with your mind,

1049
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,440
and you would see in 3D all the particular sets of information,

1050
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,780
whether it was history or whatever.

1051
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,600
You would see that in your mind's eye, and it would be set up so it could be retained.

1052
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,580
And after that, they would quiz on me.

1053
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,660
And they would also ask me later when I went back down to my Earth place, my Earth home,

1054
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,140
they would ask me to go to the libraries, and then when I came back up again,

1055
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,080
they would quiz on me, and then I would do things with them.

1056
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,340
Electro-dynamometer coming on the platform now, Doctor.

1057
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,280
Mmm, good, yes. Stand back, everybody.

1058
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,400
Ease up on those fears and give J.R. Bob Dobbs a little time.

1059
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,900
You know, America wants a return to basics and winning ways.

1060
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:19,040
But Trading Smith must remain at the top of our list of tasks.

1061
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,740
Ah, the trusty Smith.

1062
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,180
Well, that's a coincidence that you said all that, Doctor.

1063
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,620
How? Because I noticed on the sports page of the newspaper,

1064
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,420
it says something about ease up on those fears.

1065
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,780
It's true. I read it in TV Guide.

1066
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,340
You've Bob got a little time.

1067
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,280
Trading Smith tops lists of tasks.

1068
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,180
Oh, all sorts of things just happened in the news.

1069
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,480
Alex Smith. Hey, that's my kid.

1070
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,060
All right, now, calm down.

1071
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,420
He joined the 49ers?

1072
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,200
This is, you have this dream a lot.

1073
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,020
Yeah, you guys should, you come, well, actually, it's earlier than that.

1074
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,860
The 49ers meet in Death Valley every November.

1075
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,520
The Santa Clara 49ers?

1076
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,460
That's worth, and it's Woodstock for old people. It's amazing.

1077
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,920
Forty Burton.

1078
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,540
The 49ers, man.

1079
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,960
The 49ers aren't in the market for a starting quarterback,

1080
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,660
but they're hoping there's a market for their ex-starter, Zandy Smith.

1081
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,820
But what about Bubba Butkus?

1082
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,040
He can pound that Zandy Smith into A-Lo Vera.

1083
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,580
Yeah, but he's not, he's not fast.

1084
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:20,960
No, that's not.

1085
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,020
Smith is small, but he's fast.

1086
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,200
He's steady, though. He keeps on coming. He keeps on coming.

1087
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,660
As long as he can put down this stupid investigation.

1088
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,680
Oh, there they go. Look at them.

1089
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,020
Oh, he tripped over the ball.

1090
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:37,420
Oh, he's kind of, he's had a lot of brain damage, but he's still out there on the field.

1091
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,740
You know, according to the diagram that was on the sports page,

1092
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,940
he's broken every bone in his body, some of them more than once.

1093
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,140
It shows his many injuries. There's a cutaway view here.

1094
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,720
Well, I've got a lot of money riding on this fight.

1095
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,500
Well, you know, I think if we don't get the outcome we want, we can find that outcome.

1096
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:09,760
So, just relax up here in the President's box, and anything you need, a friend of Bob doesn't need to ask.

1097
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,480
You don't even have to write it down. Just ask.

1098
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,540
Just remember, we might need a favor of our own come Election Day.

1099
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
From on Earth?

1100
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,480
From the Earth people. Those fools, those chumps, simps.

1101
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:24,940
Huh.

1102
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,480
Yes, they'll be laughing out the other side of their ears.

1103
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:34,420
Or esophagus, when the star traders from Sirius come down in their skyships.

1104
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,120
Fixed-legged fools milling about in their cage of three dimensions.

1105
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,040
Puny humans.

1106
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,160
For am I not Groot?

1107
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,600
I don't know, are you?

1108
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,340
Lord of all the timber in the universe?

1109
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,380
Not anymore, because the show's almost over.

1110
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,600
Am I not Gafroon?

1111
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,220
You're gonna have to hang up your little costume.

1112
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,280
Oh, no, I guess I'm not.

1113
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,260
Am I not Funny Name Monster?

1114
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,360
No, you're not, Daddy.

1115
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,120
He who wears diapers?

1116
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,880
Well, we all wear diapers.

1117
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,960
Who brings money into the cash register?

1118
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,360
All us monsters wear these diapers. They're not diapers, they're trunks.

1119
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,820
They're trunks, that's right. You know, and I asked Mr. Kirby about that, and he says...

1120
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,100
They're space pants!

1121
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,360
Well, they couldn't be naked.

1122
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,180
They're space pants!

1123
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,280
Well, that tells us that they do have...

1124
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,800
That tells us they were hiding something. They were hiding monster nads.

1125
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,200
As in this historic comic book.

1126
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,400
Moon Pots!

1127
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,020
Monsters on the Rag.

1128
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,820
In which Moon Pots and Dinosaur Devil first appeared?

1129
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,520
Now that, no, wait a minute, that was Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy.

1130
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,980
Uh, I'll have to...

1131
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,760
Moon Dinosaur and Devil Boy.

1132
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:55,200
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slash.

1133
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,220
For free information, write to...

1134
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,700
Praise Bob!

1135
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:36,620
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1136
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,620
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1137
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,720
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1138
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:56,240
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1139
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,540
and help out financially as best you can.

1140
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:07,560
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1141
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,480
But some of you still have jobs.

1142
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:17,400
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month, from enough of you.

1143
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,800
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1144
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:28,600
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1145
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,060
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1146
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:46,540
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1147
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,760
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
