1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
We have all kinds of stuff for you tonight.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,960
Stuff you're stuck in this holiday season.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,780
And friends, if you're lucky, well, I don't know if it's lucky or unlucky,

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,420
if we have time, we're even going to do some pretty evil stuff.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,800
We might sing some opera tonight.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,980
That really depends on if we have time.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,000
We might have time.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,140
Please, let's hear the opera.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,400
Well, this is true. I mean, I'm sitting here,

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,940
supposed to be a good sub-genius preacher, and I'm talking about time.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Shame on me.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,620
Stop!

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,800
Since we have the ability to control time.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,180
But without any further ado, friends.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,780
Ado.

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,900
Let's ado something.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,900
We're going to go ahead here, and we're going to get to playing some music.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
Like I said, we have a lot of stuff to play tonight, friends.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,640
Are you ready?

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,720
Yes.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,140
Are you ready?

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,920
We hope you're listening.

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,460
That's another sub-genius show.

24
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,280
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse out of Atlanta.

25
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,600
Those guys, they switch off every other...

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:58,860
It's another week.

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,660
One week it'll be Suzy the Flusy, and the next week it'll be those guys.

28
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,640
And those guys finally sent me some copies of their sub-genius show,

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
which has never been played on our Slack.

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,400
And they sent a whole bunch of samples on CD.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,180
So we will see how the heck it is.

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,740
Friends, there's some Einstein's Secret Orchestra noodling along in the background.

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,180
And, oh yes, we should probably mention...

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,420
Which show this is, because I do have to put together a show somehow.

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,720
My computer's calling me, friends, but...

36
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,020
But welcome.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,800
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,960
You could stay around for another 30 minutes after that, too, if you wanted.

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,020
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,340
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,480
Hey, what's going on here?

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,140
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,500
Okay, well, you knew which show that was.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
This show is.

45
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,120
Friends, I've got my little studio here all prepped up.

46
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,240
I took a shower before I came on the air.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,220
Aren't you glad?

48
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,900
I had to think about that.

49
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,220
I was thinking, well, now, should I...

50
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,140
I've got to get this show done quick.

51
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,960
I've got to whip through this show and get it out as fast as I can.

52
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,140
Thank goodness and Bob that Bob Slacktime Funhouse Doctors sent their CD.

53
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,960
Limph node institute is what, or lymph node productions.

54
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:42,040
You would call Dr. Bug Blatter and Reverend Rock in hand and Dr. P. Ellis and Dr. T. Nitis and a bunch of...

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,920
It's a bunch of...

56
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,440
They're all doctors, I guess.

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
Friends, yes, we...

58
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,660
So we'll be playing excerpts from their wacky stuff.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,680
And what else?

60
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,600
There was so much I was going to tell you.

61
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,880
you i just thought of the most pithy thing to say about christians and believers and

62
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:12,540
had something to do with how it's like you know they always say to you well you wouldn't

63
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,000
understand you know when i it's like oh so you're one of these people that talks to god does he

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,600
ever talk back well not in a way that you would understand and that's when i kind of feel like

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:31,320
going up oh i would understand all too well you'd be surprised how much i might understand about

66
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,800
that but some of us move on you know speaking of religious nuts here from onan's uh dr onan

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:48,560
cannabites uh news service this is true news monk arrested for kicking worshipper in hong kong

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,140
a buddhist monk was arrested and charged with assault in hong kong

69
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,520
for

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,820
kicking a worshipper at a taoist temple a newspaper said wednesday the 30 year old monk

71
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,160
was standing by the wong tai sin temple when a man kneeling beside him offering incense was pushed

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,960
over by a large crowd and fell at the monk's feet temple staff said the man was kicked and injured

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,060
in the eye and fought back police broke up the fight the monk charged with assault and freed

74
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,060
on bail will appear in court next week kicking a man on his knees a temple administrator

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,000
said according to the report kicking a man on his knees that's a no-no for a monk

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,560
oh here's a letter from uh the reverend lord captain phil dostoevsky who says well i was

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,500
putzing oh it was all my stuff set right here i don't have dolby is off okay good

78
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,000
so i was putzing around at home minding my own business reading of all things discards when a

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
A sudden thought struck me. It hurt.

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,400
After the first aid was applied, I examined the thought, and here it is for your perusal.

81
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,100
Slack is the usage slash venting of intense emotions

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,780
without strengthening the bonds between the said emotions and their source.

83
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,600
The sources themselves being petty things that mostly don't need that sort of attention,

84
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,420
such as relationships, jobs, taxes, inane people, etc.

85
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,360
Which is why the rant exists.

86
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,500
A step up from the primal scream, the rant allows a non-destructive,

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,300
often creative medium from which one may get one's kicks.

88
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:38,120
Or, to summarize, Slack equals all the intensity, none of the guilt.

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,260
Well, that, I guess, that's kind of philosophical.

90
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,280
I'll have to...

91
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,400
When I hear this show...

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,280
When I hear this show back, that's when I'll understand it.

93
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
London, Reuters.

94
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,260
Oh, here's from Onan's news service again.

95
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,620
Sex, violence, and flatworms.

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,700
Nature has provided a variety of sexual mechanisms to ensure survival of a species,

97
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,260
but none is as violent as penis fencing among marine flatworms, German researchers said Wednesday.

98
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,220
Humans and animals transverse.

99
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,720
Ahem.

100
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,060
Sperm.

101
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,400
Ahem.

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,420
Through copulation, or as Nicholas Michels of Germany's Max Planck Institute in Sueisen calls it,

103
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,880
a, pardon the expression, friends, genital handshake.

104
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:41,800
But hermaphrodite worms that have both male and female sex organs inject sperm under their partner's skin.

105
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,280
In a letter to the scientific journal Nature, Michels explained how he and his colleagues,

106
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:56,560
observed the sex play of Pseudoceros bifurcus, marine flatworms which duel with their sharp-tipped penises

107
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,780
to try to inject each other with sperm.

108
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,160
The loser is the first one to be impaled.

109
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,800
Individuals try to stab one another but show strong avoidance behavior when struck by their partner.

110
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,280
During 39 contests, 287 strikes led to 46 inseminations,

111
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,080
and the total number of hits in 12 pairs, he said.

112
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:28,860
Uh, hypodermic insemination, when present, allows hermaphrodites to skew the sexual interaction

113
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:37,880
in favor of sperm donation, fueling an evolutionary arms race between strike and avoidance behavior, Michels said.

114
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,480
And friends, I want you to chew on that subject as we move to this next one.

115
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,800
This, uh, you've heard this same news report a million times in the last month, but,

116
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,220
uh, not quite this way, I hope.

117
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,660
This is some internet graffiti, and I'm not sure who originally created this news report,

118
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,840
but this is, in relation to those bifurcated, penis-wielding, hermaphrodite worms,

119
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,980
this is the story in a nutshell.

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,620
Things came to a head last week, and the name Monica Lewinsky is fast becoming a real mouthful at the White House.

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,780
The latest news about President Clinton is definitely hard to believe,

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,180
and it seems certain to leave a nasty taste in the mouth of the current administration.

123
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,460
It will be some time before all the stains resulting from this issue are removed from the Oval Office.

124
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,340
Monica Lewinsky has proved to be not as tight-lipped as Clinton had hoped,

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,120
and is expected to spit out the truth to a grand jury tomorrow.

126
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:47,700
She will surely go down in history for her orations concerning the comings and goings behind the doors of the Oval Office.

127
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,340
Monica was apparently on her knees when she received the recent gagging order from the White House,

128
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,300
and now has to decide whether to swallow her pride and dispose of the evidence,

129
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:07,200
or succumb to the deep-throated rumblings of the Washington press corps and spill the issue wide open.

130
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Any attempt by Lewinsky to suck up to Clinton can only be construed as lip service,

131
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,900
and Clinton would be advised to try and minimize the impact of this.

132
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,780
This is the latest in a long series of blows he has received since coming to power.

133
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,580
Despite this latest blow, job security for the President seems to be assured,

134
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,380
as he can rely on his proven oral skills to promote a career in public speaking,

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,920
being, as he has often shown, a cunning linguist,

136
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,620
although Hillary Clinton may disagree with this, as she claims she is rarely on the end of a tongue lashing from Bill.

137
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,520
Miss Lewinsky is from a naval background,

138
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,320
and her choice of Clinton as a lover is somewhat surprising given her preference for sea men.

139
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,900
According to her lawyer, Miss Lewinsky likes to see men in power,

140
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:04,600
and relished the thought of taking a length of time to chew things over with the President whenever she could fit him in.

141
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,680
And the President was equally keen to see Miss Lewinsky always putting on a spurt when she entered her office.

142
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,040
Miss Lewinsky has apparently been offered a PR job by Listerine,

143
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,860
who described her as spunky enough for any job.

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,380
Her name has also been associated with Big Gulp soda advertising and Kleenex.

145
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,900
She has also lined up a gig with the Got Milk campaign.

146
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,580
And there's a little line at the bottom of this that says,

147
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,500
it's a dirty job but someone has to do it.

148
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,260
Joan.

149
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,020
So I think this was written by someone named Joan.

150
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,980
Gosh, I wonder if it could be the wife of Byron Verner.

151
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,180
Could it be that Joan?

152
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,780
I don't know.

153
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,640
Anyway, friend, enough talking.

154
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,040
Just thinking about that Monica Lewinsky babe gets me all watery.

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,460
Well, okay, I've got some strange and legume.

156
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,040
I got me some ESO.

157
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,000
I've got some Jane-er and KPFA.

158
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,080
And I've got the lymph node productions.

159
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,380
And, uh, the noise song.

160
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,820
Sque pok boink.

161
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:20,820


162
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
Squee.

163
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:43,200
R Waar boode de hoo üç.

164
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait I forgot to say that,

165
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,060
the boundaries of this song are maymay exaggerated for some effect,

166
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,060


167
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Thank you.

168
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,620
Thank you.

169
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,040
Thank you.

170
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,500
Thank you.

171
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,860
Thank you.

172
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Thank you.

173
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,080
Thank you.

174
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Thank you.

175
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,440
Thank you.

176
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,540
Thank you.

177
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,600
Good.

178
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,280
Hate.

179
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:15,980
Good.

180
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,400
Hate.

181
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:16,720
Hate.

182
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,040
Good.

183
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,860
Good.

184
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,340
Good.

185
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,700
Good.

186
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,060
Hate.

187
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,520
Good.

188
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:19,960
Hate.

189
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,660
Now, patience.

190
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,660
Of course I know that not all of your superiors and masters are bad people.

191
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:33,500
I understand it's nice to work in a cushy house job, rather than toil out in the field with a riff-raff.

192
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,680
Sure, your pink boss treats you just fine, and well, he may even like you.

193
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,100
Sort of like the way he likes Seinfeld or his neighbor's dog.

194
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,780
It's not its fault that it's part of the conspiracy to deprive you of the only thing that really counts,

195
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,780
your access to the time-slap continuum.

196
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,980
Without which you will wither away into a husk of your former self until you just have a swell body.

197
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,240
No mercy for your oppressors! Sacrifice yourself above!

198
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Jam the gears of their killer machine with your corpse!

199
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,180
Kill! Kill for Bob!

200
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,360
And for those of you who may believe that this cycle has already begun,

201
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,140
you are mistaken.

202
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,080
We live in a marvelous time.

203
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,440
Uh, somewhat.

204
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,200
The end times.

205
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,120
You guys want?

206
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,480
Oh, wait, yeah!

207
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,060
You got, you got?

208
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,040
End of the world coming up, buddy!

209
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,000
In the dust.

210
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,340
In the dust beneath.

211
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,640
Quit looking under the console.

212
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,340
I want you duck down.

213
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Hey, hey, hey, cut that out over there.

214
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
Put a little of that 439 on him.

215
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,340
Cut that out.

216
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,400
There we go.

217
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:50,500
What a sub-genius does with a picture in the privacy of underneath the console is none of your business now, except another sub-genius.

218
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,140
I'm a doctor.

219
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,840
I don't care.

220
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,200
This is science.

221
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,380
This is your lunch hour.

222
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,200
This is your lunch hour.

223
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,640
It's a lot to ponder.

224
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,880
I respect that.

225
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,640
All the worlds you really don't know love.

226
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,040
A woman, a woman is like a plunger.

227
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,740
What a little cocktail.

228
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,780
Before that we had a, uh, the snake bite.

229
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,800
Uh, barrage.

230
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,220
Um, to commemorate my being bit by the venomous reptile.

231
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,420
Um, which actually, you know, there are, there are pictures of it.

232
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,620
I haven't put them up on the web yet, but I need to do that so people can have a look at that.

233
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,160
I took some pictures with a digital camera.

234
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,880
Pictures of the wound?

235
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,180
Yes, of my foot and the bite wound.

236
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,920
I actually should have taken it while I was in the hospital because it was all bloated and, and funky looking and all kind of yellowish jaundice almost looking.

237
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,900
Kind of freaky.

238
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,140
Uh, it was like you could thump it like a watermelon.

239
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,900
Bloop, bloop, bloop.

240
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,120
Yeah.

241
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,380
Uh, but, but of course I did not.

242
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,980
Um, I should have.

243
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,540
Okay, I should have, but I didn't.

244
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,600
Um, but I did take some adverse pictures.

245
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,120
It doesn't look as bad as you would think.

246
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,580
My foot didn't turn black and fall off like, uh, you know, I was kind of afraid at first.

247
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,280
I don't know, my foot's going to turn black and necrotized and it's going to fall off and all that kind of mess.

248
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,380
Necro, necro, necro, necro.

249
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,340
Hopefully so.

250
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,400
Uh, you know, some way Bob smiled at me.

251
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Some way Bob was just kicking me in the butt.

252
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,260
Um, you know, he does give you a reach around now.

253
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:06,780
Necro, necro, necro.

254
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,000
This is true, this is true.

255
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,580
You know, uh, Bob doesn't, Bob doesn't seem to hold any, uh, uh, he doesn't seem to hold any...

256
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,600
Waters?

257
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,920
No, he doesn't hold any grudges.

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,780
I mean, one minute he can be having you arrested, the next minute he can be giving you a get out of jail free card.

259
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,240
Who knows, you know, um, I don't know.

260
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,020
Kind of hard to say, kind of hard to say.

261
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,420
Anyway, friends, um, what shall we listen to now?

262
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,140
Dead Bobbies demand no refunds.

263
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,880
And once she comes to realize that it's her only form of sustenance,

264
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,380
she'll do it whenever you tell her to.

265
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,660
Sister Bullets, boss man.

266
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,600
Sorry, R5.

267
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,700
Sorry, boss man.

268
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,800
Why, you...

269
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
When do...

270
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,980
Sure, I can't.

271
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,920
How low are you fighting?

272
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,660
Ooh, my...

273
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,580
Do I card to intelligence aspartame?

274
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,260
What'd you say?

275
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,620
Time.

276
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,020
Package.

277
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,280
What'd he say?

278
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,220
Someone will eventually sue incense makers for enabling drug users.

279
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,940
What's I shall on parking?

280
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,660
Never trust a junkie.

281
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,280
Are you going to choke you to death?

282
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,900
Our Dead Bobbies demand no refunds.

283
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,800
You are not what you think you are.

284
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,300
It's booster time.

285
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,640
The battle is already engaged.

286
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,620
Why aren't you up there fighting?

287
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,540
They already graven it.

288
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:13,920
The revolution.

289
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,400
The vessel will be sanitized, packaged, mass produced, and discounted.

290
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,240
Enough.

291
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,240


292
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,540
But it's the officer what's killed.

293
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,760
You look at kids.

294
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,180
You think I'm gonna choke you to death?

295
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,180
No, I think they, your son.

296
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,280
Your parents know all about what you do.

297
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,000
Never put you to doubt for enabling.

298
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,600
What drug users never trust a junkie.

299
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,080
You will not be aboard the Exit Escape vessel.

300
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,540
Dead Bobbies demand no refunds.

301
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,520
You will die a virgin.

302
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,860
The bee, do she ask?

303
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,260
Take athlete Bobbies.

304
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:35,900
I ain't going to listen to you.

305
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,780
I ain't going to listen to you.

306
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:36,780


307
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,800
You are part of the problem.

308
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,920
That's the problem.

309
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,760
You can squeeze your window for a dollar.

310
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,980
Fight the love.

311
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,500
What's that stain on your skirt, buddy?

312
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,560
I'm a problem.

313
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,720
You have already eaten and smoked enough poison to kill you.

314
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,820
If you think it'd be a game, I'm going to do you.

315
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,460
Do not expect to survive.

316
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,000
Are you prepared for a core death danger?

317
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,320
Is that stain in your beard, dad?

318
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,820
I can't take the pain, so I'll take the pain.

319
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,020
You think you are not what you are.

320
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,520
Dead Bobbies demand no refunds.

321
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,960
You're gonna have to screech English, Jake.

322
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,420
Get right with your muscle stakes.

323
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,760
You're gonna have to screech English, Jake.

324
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:06,760


325
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:06,760


326
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:06,760


327
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,240
You might think you're a little snub monkey.

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,460
Quicksprits in your plisara.

329
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,760
Lesson, it's snow and light lute juice.

330
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,260
Else wise, you're plinkin' bleeders blowin' hot water.

331
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,680
You'll go blind or please your neather trying not to.

332
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,440
Either way, you're getting up on the wrong side orbit for this kind of freed, peed-needed

333
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,420
side trade.

334
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,900
Well, I want you to just stand there like a daddy nickel slug?

335
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,420
Or you're going to puss your blimperer in a righteous agony?

336
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

337
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,740
Boy, pick up when he writes.

338
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


339
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


340
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


341
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


342
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


343
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


344
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


345
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,140
rivers in your fluter tubes.

346
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,260
I'll tell you what.

347
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,100
What?

348
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,580
You don't give me any smart lip like that.

349
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,460
That's all I'm saying.

350
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,160
I shove a pack up your ass just as soon as I look at you.

351
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,140
Boo.

352
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,160
Don't think I won't.

353
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,800
Okay.

354
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,640
Somebody tried to break into my house.

355
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,180
Yeah.

356
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,500
Somebody tried to break into my trailer back there.

357
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
I got a shotgun in the bed.

358
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,880
I blow his head off just as soon as I look at him.

359
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,420
Hell, I hope they try.

360
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,840
I hope somebody breaks into my house.

361
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,100
I blow his head right off.

362
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,700
Now we've bifurcated your head.

363
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,740
Yeah, they try to run away from you.

364
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,420
You shoot him and drag him back in the house.

365
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,260
Police won't say no.

366
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,160
You put a gun in your hand or something?

367
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,660
Okay, yeah.

368
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,420
You knew that.

369
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,800
You just didn't want to say it.

370
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,880
Because you know the Santa Rosa police, the Roanoke Park police,

371
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,580
and the Cotati police all listen to this show.

372
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,200
Maybe that's what they're doing.

373
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

374
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Well, forget everything.

375
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,240
We were just kidding.

376
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,860
I wouldn't worry about it.

377
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,720
I just shoot his head off.

378
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,120
I wouldn't think twice about it.

379
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,540
No, man.

380
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,680
Because that one happened outside the stadium.

381
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,080
The station earlier?

382
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,340
No, don't.

383
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,560
Let's go on another routine.

384
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,920
Oh, okay, yeah.

385
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,420
Funny one.

386
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,460
Yeah, I just blow his head off.

387
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,980
If someone tried to break into my house, okay,

388
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,060
first I'd sew his mouth shut with fishing wire.

389
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,140
Then probably strip him stark butt, bare ass.

390
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,740
You're from the police to get the guy who broke into Jader's house.

391
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,960
Then I'd just, you know, take a pair of handcuffs.

392
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,460
But the guy's still in Jader's house being tortured by Jader.

393
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,000
He handcuffs his arm behind his back.

394
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,620
Then I'd shove a pack up his ass.

395
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,780
Shove a pack up his ass.

396
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,520
I thought you saved that for last.

397
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,400
I'd shove a pack up his ass.

398
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,540
Yeah, probably.

399
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,340
This ain't pack on the radio.

400
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,680
Don't say 56 miles an hour, you know, those dirt roads back there.

401
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,380
Nobody cares.

402
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,880
Why do you think his wig was so big?

403
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,640
Carl knew much better.

404
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,300
Oh, yes.

405
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,240
So did Groucho.

406
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,560
So did Harpo.

407
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,300
All the Marxists did, Cousin Jazz, were all related.

408
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,000
Except for me, I'm an ape.

409
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
And I'm only related to one ape.

410
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,020
One ape.

411
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,920
One mitochondrial ape.

412
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,420
The mitochondrial ape.

413
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,260
But explain a lot of things.

414
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,740
You all come from different mothers than me.

415
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,200
My back is hairy.

416
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,740
My palms are hairy.

417
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,980
There were a lot of different kinds of humans.

418
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,020
But you don't hear their story because there's none of them left.

419
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,820
That's right.

420
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,160
There's only us.

421
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,520
We won the war.

422
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,300
That's right.

423
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,080
We're all gone except for a few of us.

424
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,900
And believe me, I don't mind making a circuit.

425
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,180
But especially with this special slab I carry around between my knees.

426
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,520
Believe me, I can do a lot of damage in a small town like Scram, Pennsylvania.

427
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,840
In my dream.

428
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,620
The aliens.

429
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,720
The top half of their head looked like the normal humanistic view of aliens.

430
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,200
But the bottom head was the chin of a monkey with a big goatee.

431
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
And he talked like this.

432
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,620
We won the war.

433
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,960
We.

434
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,180
We.

435
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,200
That's you.

436
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,940
And we.

437
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,820
And she.

438
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,520
We.

439
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,640
One.

440
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,940
Two one.

441
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
Two one.

442
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,260
Two one to many.

443
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,420
One.

444
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,180
We've won the war, James.

445
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,460
Think of it, bro.

446
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:38,980
One.

447
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,880
We've won.

448
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,180
It's just a few celebrations.

449
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,740
A few minor celebrations.

450
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,380
Just go through the motions.

451
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
Look nice.

452
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,440
Look pretty.

453
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:46,960
Look pretty.

454
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,640
Look pretty.

455
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,040
And deal with it.

456
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,220
One of the things we have to look nice and pretty for is, well, winter starts coming

457
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,160
up at the end of the month.

458
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,760
So I was plugging that a little earlier.

459
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,640
But yeah, we'll be having a lot of sort of laying back.

460
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,340
Digging on some tunes.

461
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:12,340
I guess we'll be doing that at the end of the month, at $30.

462
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,420
But that's not 401k isn't it?

463
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:25,520
No chewing on paint, Jammy.

464
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,520


465
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,040
I bet it was funny watching I.

466
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,880
soap opera.

467
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:29,900


468
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:29,900


469
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:29,900


470
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:29,900


471
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,020
We'll play a little Conference Party Oрез.

472
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,320
We'll play a little Perfect.

473
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,000
Ling Ling is not a real woman though is she?

474
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,600
Woman? You think woman? No, no, no, Ling Ling is not a woman.

475
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,280
Ling Ling is panda? Ling Ling is yeti? Woman?

476
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,920
That's right, the plunger one for New York City.

477
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,200
What more could a decent American ask for than to drink it?

478
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,260
I swear to God.

479
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,260
When I drink the all of it, I'm not expecting just a little bit.

480
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,620
I'm expecting a little bit more.

481
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,840
Random Noise, friends, is the name of the background tune from Lymphnode.

482
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:26,960
We've been listening to the Lymphnode boys and Reverend Rockin' Hand on the Bob Slatton Funhouse show from WZRD in Atlanta.

483
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,160
No, WREK. God, what am I saying?

484
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,820
Goof!

485
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,260
WZRD in Chicago hasn't paid us.

486
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,320
Oh, my God.

487
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,780
We haven't paid them in years.

488
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,260
WREK is the greatest thing.

489
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,720
Them and all the other ones that pay us.

490
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,020
Praise Bob.

491
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,800
Support your local subgenius radio station, friends.

492
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,520
You can't imagine what it's like not to have it.

493
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:59,400
I have to listen to it over the internet because we don't get any subgenius radio here in Dallas, Texas.

494
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,220
Hmm.

495
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,240
Hmm.

496
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,360
What does this kid think about my music and my fans?

497
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,420
And if it says a lot, maybe you should start listening to me.

498
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,000
All right.

499
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,060
All right.

500
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,680
These guys are crazy, and they're fucking crazy.

501
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,760
OY.

502
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,300
nissmailfusstuhfg.

503
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,280
L

504
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,240
I

505
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,020
Buy out the gland owners with what you earn with your skinny, peel-faced face of pain.

506
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,620
Please, a piece of the fine ass, have a fuzzy, big bock,

507
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,960
and strut your heart-best soft blow for the raccoon, the rocket racket.

508
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,140
This face-outer belongs to your worship and the crutch of your choice toys.

509
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,420
And I've been pulling in the flush-lugger of tears to let them stack.

510
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
You know who's a cunt?

511
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,440
Well, them cunts ain't keen to hop on nobody, no sir, ma'am.

512
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,700
You just work in the ugly good, and they'll be scorned by your fate.

513
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,580
This has been your re-enunciator.

514
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,620
Thank me.

515
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,780
And we're back.

516
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,280
And, uh...

517
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,380
Friends, I'm sitting here in my...

518
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,980
studio in the Subgenius Foundation offices,

519
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,020
and I have a video dubbing set up going across the room that...

520
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,400
Every time I look over there, I see some clip or another from our video called Arise.

521
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,800
It's like ten years...

522
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,980
The video itself is ten years old, and a lot of it was shot fifteen years ago.

523
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,840
And, friends...

524
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,760
It's horrible...

525
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,500
to look across the room...

526
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,500


527
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,500


528
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,500


529
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,540
and see myself when I was...

530
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,520
your age.

531
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,140
Bummer, man.

532
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,140
But, you know, at the same time, I sometimes wonder,

533
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,460
well, why don't we do another video like that one?

534
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,420
Besides just concert videos and stuff.

535
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:17,420
I must say that, well, it's because that darn internet thing came along,

536
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,180
and I swear, I just find it a lot more interesting than...

537
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,200
any TV show.

538
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,220
Huh.

539
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,400
But I tell you what, somebody got into my place.

540
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,180
Somebody...

541
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,240
If I found somebody breaking into my house, man...

542
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,640
Damn.

543
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,540
And so, the show...

544
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,760
I'll tell you one thing.

545
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Came on y'all around the trailer.

546
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,320
You see this line I'm drawing here in the same boy?

547
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,940
I call that McCounty line.

548
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,180
Step over this line, you see it in McCounty.

549
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,780
Break the law in McCounty, I'll shoot you dead.

550
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,000
You fall dead on that land on that sidewalk,

551
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,320
and you get your ticket for the Lord of the Rings.

552
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,160
You don't pay that ticket for the Lord of the Rings in thirty days,

553
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,300
I'll throw you in jail.

554
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,400
And jail's one place you don't want.

555
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
I'll be especially for dead, boy.

556
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,060
So that means you're county law.

557
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,320
Right.

558
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,860
You must be your own county law now.

559
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,420
That's right.

560
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Ladies and gentlemen, we are all our own county law.

561
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,580
Another fine.

562
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,180
By that time you'll be rotting dead corpse.

563
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,540
We've got a dead man's penalty.

564
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,260
You don't get a dead man license.

565
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,420
We'll give you a fine for that, too.

566
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,840
You're dead corpse only.

567
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,360
And no one can claim your body until all these fines are paid.

568
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
You don't pay for your own funeral, we'll give you tickets.

569
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,220
We'll give you a widow a ticket for that.

570
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,820
You don't pay child support to your widow to pay your ticket for your dead body not being buried.

571
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,060
We'll throw you in jail again.

572
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,460
You got Big Sam back there.

573
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,280
He doesn't care if you're alive or dead or what.

574
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,060
You just don't ever think about breaking into my house, you understand?

575
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
I wish this was a slave.

576
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,340
Yee-haw.

577
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,900
Your astral body comes out there and tries to go to heaven.

578
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,480
And we got a fine.

579
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,580
We got astral handcuffs.

580
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,420
Astral county law.

581
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,100
We got astral laws.

582
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,960
You try to speed, you know, with your astral body.

583
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,240
We got a radar system out there.

584
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,920
You try to go into the light at an improper speed, it'll bust your ass.

585
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,500
That tunnel to the afterlife is patrolled by radar.

586
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,900
It'll bust your ass so fast you don't know what hit you.

587
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,600
Your little angel wings will drop to the floor.

588
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,680
Little piles of feathers.

589
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,600
Hey, those angel wings have to be licensed by the state and they have to be up to code.

590
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,980
They're not 30 days.

591
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,140
There's all kinds of stuff you ain't ever read about in the Into the Light books.

592
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,120
You understand what I'm saying?

593
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,700
Don't think heaven's gonna be some bed of roses.

594
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,600
There's gonna be work.

595
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,420
There's gonna be praying.

596
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,280
And over on the right wing of heaven, there's Big Dan.

597
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,740
You don't want to mess with Big Dan.

598
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,520
He's got a Johnson big as my arm, you know what I'm saying?

599
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,600
Uh-oh, if you'd like to make a call, please call Johnson.

600
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,680
I don't know anything about heaven.

601
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,920
Dude up there's got a shotgun.

602
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,340
Warden's up there's got a shotgun.

603
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,660
Now is the time for all good men to come in the face of their country.

604
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,880
It is time for the seed within you to come to life.

605
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,340
Let Bob water upon you and you shall bloom.

Dallas, Texas 75214

609
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,460
Good evening brothers and sisters.

610
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,400
The time is 9.01.

611
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,240
Do you know where your children are?

612
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:45,680
Well, we here at the Sweetness and Light Radio Network pray that they're all tucked safely away in their beds.

613
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,220
And you know, tomorrow's not a school day.

614
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:02,060
So why not sit there beside them at their bedside and pray with them with us for the next half hour.

615
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,780
And as a special treat, you can let the little ones stay up a little later.

616
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,860
And at 9.30, listen to Mr. Pink's Happy Children Hour.

617
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,920
Ooh, Mr. Pink himself will be here.

618
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,020
Oh boy, Jesus loves Mr. Pink.

619
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,400
All the way from Calcutta.

620
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,500
Oh yes.

621
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,920
And Jesus loves his little, his happy little sidekick, Arnie the Dinosaur.

622
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,080
Oh yes, Jesus loves Arnie and Jesus loves Mr. Pink.

623
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,080
And they'll be coming up in a half an hour.

624
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,560
We'd like to thank the management here at this station, WMUH, Allentown, Pennsylvania,

625
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,760
for giving this opportunity to bring you the fine word of the Lord.

626
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,480
Giving us the opportunity.

627
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,860
The opportunity to prove once and for all that no one is beyond the Lord's salvation.

628
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:08,700
Why, just last night, on the other side of the country, lied a man in his deathbed.

629
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,520
So far, we thought, from the grasp of the Lord.

630
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,980
So diametrically opposed to the Holy Spirit that he would surely burn.

631
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,680
Unrepentant in his sins, not accepting Jesus into his heart.

632
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,300
He was a man of some fame in some circles.

633
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,040
A preacher of his own rights, although a preacher of the black arts.

634
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,260
The minister, the dark minister, Anton LaVey, lie there, gasping his last breaths.

635
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:55,260
And we took it upon ourselves, myself and my associate, Dr. Light, to go to California

636
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,900
and try to rein in this poor lost sheep.

637
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,220
For truly is Jesus the greatest of all shepherds.

638
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,940
Yes, brothers and sisters, we were there.

639
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,360
Poor Anton LaVey was lying in his deathbed.

640
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,240
And I was holding his bones.

641
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,180
And he was withered, shaking hand.

642
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,240
And I told him about Jesus.

643
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,920
And I told him that this was his last chance at redemption.

644
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,540
And I saw his eyes cloud up with tears.

645
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,500
I saw that evil that had surrounded him all his life.

646
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,020
I seen it break like glass.

647
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,500
And I seen the evil shards, the evil shield fall from him.

648
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,220
And his eyes filled up with tears.

649
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,200
And he looked up at me and said,

650
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,360
Brother Light, Brother Light, I accept Jesus into my heart, Brother Light.

651
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,200
And he wept.

652
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,020
And he cried.

653
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,840
And he said, please, please let me not be so far out to the light.

654
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,100
Please let me not be damned.

655
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:13,220
For, for my last moments, I realized that it was love, love, sweet love,

656
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,960
that, that left me hollow, for I was empty of it.

657
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,940
Please let me not be so far out to the light that God may not look upon me and have mercy.

658
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,380
I just, I can't even.

659
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:37,460
And in his final moments, it was like a golden glow came over his face.

660
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,480
And he smiled the warmest smile.

661
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,220
His sickly white pallid transformed into this beautiful.

662
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,920
Excuse me.

663
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,960
He smiled the warmest smile I'd ever seen.

664
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:53,580
And he looked up at me and he said, I can't believe that I've missed out on this all my life.

665
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,440
And, and, and, and now, now that I'm dying, I know, I know the glory that's Jesus.

666
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:08,160
And, and then he, the smile slowly softened and his eyes softly closed.

667
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,920
And like a candle being snuffed out by the wind.

668
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:20,320
Anton Zandor LeVay's soul rose up to be with Jesus.

669
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:31,980
And brothers and sisters, right now, Anton LeVay is sitting at the Lord's table with him.

670
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:41,060
Holding his hand and living a life of eternal bliss in heaven.

671
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,560
Amen.

672
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:50,760
Yes, a life and a heart so empty, but a soul so full.

673
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,100
Forever.

674
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:09,240
1974 is the year that they are now planning for sex on the streets in every major city from coast to coast.

675
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,140
And get ready for a shock.

676
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:23,820
The music that they're planning to use to crumble the morals of America is this rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd, lascivious junk called rock and roll.

677
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,780
It isn't just the lyrics, it's the beat.

678
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,020
I preach into my conversion story, which you can get, how this beat gets them.

679
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,020
400 teenage girls in Detroit interviewed as to why they had illegitimate babies.

680
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,580
They said not just the words, the beat.

681
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:48,200
The fertility rights of the jungles are the same beats incorporated in this modern rock to stir them up.

682
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,620
Now they'll do this for another 20 minutes or so and then they'll settle down.

683
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,420
Contemporary troglodytes, living fossils.

684
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,320
The subgenii are most interesting from an anthropological point of view.

685
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,040
But otherwise, you can see our view of the Subgenius Museum in Dallas.

686
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,100
These are the last actual subgeniuses.

687
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,800
Most of them imported from Arkansas.

688
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,980
This is Subgenius Man.

689
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,220
His home was a cave in the mountains.

690
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,480
His only weapon was a crude staff.

691
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,220
Which responded only to brute strength.

692
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,840
Brute strength?

693
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,780
Life walked hand in hand with death.

694
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,200
Their laws are simple.

695
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,000
The strong take everything.

696
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,720
You're playing hockey and you pretend to be a puck and it's Bubba Gee and every other thing.

697
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,960
This is Huck Hoback.

698
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,280
Leader of the rock and roll tribe.

699
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,940
And his two sons.

700
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,720
Sakana and Tumek.

701
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,240
Or Tumescent, Tumid as they call him.

702
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,900
There is no love lost between them.

703
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:05,640
Oh.

704
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,440
Well, let's sing that little Janer song now.

705
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,680
Yes, since we don't have Janer, we'll have to sing the Janer anthem.

706
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,320
That's right, with King Stan.

707
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,860
Everybody join along now.

708
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,540
Janer has a baner.

709
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,780
Lord of lords.

710
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Conquering JANER.

711
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:32,660
Oh friends, sometimes this old church makes no sense even to me.

712
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,640
I mean it just sometimes...

713
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I know all these people, most of them.

714
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,440
But believe me, it doesn't mean...

715
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,020
It has no more of a concrete anchor in reality than...

716
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,700
Views and opinions.

717
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,080
Express on.

718
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,660
On.

719
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,640
What time?

720
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,320
Burn house.

721
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,080
Not necessarily.

722
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,020
Not necessarily.

723
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,600
Those are...

724
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,340
Those are...

725
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:01,540
Georgia Tech.

726
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,660
Georgia Tech.

727
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,100
Georgia Tech.

728
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:28,660
We all go toville.

729
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,600
Good morning.

730
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,080
Pretty good to see you.

731
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,080


732
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,080


733
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,080


734
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,080


735
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,080


736
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,080


737
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,860
You can get heart attacks, you can get surgery cranks, anything you possibly want.

738
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,640
So have a good time tonight.

739
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,800
But that'll come at the end.

740
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,120
Mommy is going to punish you.

741
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,620
So without any further ado, let's play a little bit of Oddwoods and this and that,

742
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,180
and we'll be back a little bit later on.

743
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,520
Good show.

744
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,180
Bye-bye.

745
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,340
We have been the leaders of the Reagans.

746
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,180
I'm not used to going in front of the problem.

747
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,540
I am the future.

748
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,920
You know, and I will be a threat as well.

749
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,280
We are leaders of the American public to be called the Soviet Union's demise and collapse.

750
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,540
Pre-recorded message for contingency number 823.

751
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,720
Play this message only if you are experiencing contingency number 823,

752
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,000
according to the Institute Contingency Guide.

753
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,020
Fellow doctors, before I get to the goodies,

754
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,780
I must say that the tone of the current conversation

755
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,900
has left me...

756
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,820
rather disappointed.

757
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,060
To see my own brethren in science reduced to hysterics

758
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,680
by some coincidental, purely extraneous glitch in the data

759
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,940
is demoralizing, to say the least.

760
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,820
If you're still in harm's way, that's your own damn fault.

761
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,940
We provide everybody who counts around here

762
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,680
with the necessary liquidity and lubricosity

763
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,500
to get where you need to get.

764
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,200
Besides, just because a few of us higher-ups

765
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,000
have taken the common-sense precaution

766
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,900
to distance ourselves from the truth,

767
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,480
doesn't mean it's time for every spare flunky on the payroll to cut and run.

768
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,840
For most of you, we now have lost an important subject.

769
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,500
Really now, let's think this thing through.

770
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,600
We have no proof that this Kentucky thing is in our family at all.

771
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,820
Okay, I will admit, he does seem to be following one of our prime contingencies.

772
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,300
One of our classified prime contingencies.

773
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,900
At first glance, this can be sort of a strange thing, but...

774
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:30,900


775
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,020
I think some of you hysterical ninny's doth protest too much, get me?

776
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,240
To the trained eye, this looks more like someone's homework assignment

777
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,040
than a full institute undertaking.

778
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,940
I mean, come on, analysis here, people, not reaction.

779
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,620
Where's the support team?

780
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,220
Where's the patsy?

781
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,980
And most importantly, where's the spectacular suicidal finale

782
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,680
in the sweet silent dead mouth?

783
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,560
I notice there's 14 people listening on the internet.

784
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,600
Whole people.

785
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,180
Yeah, you're out there.

786
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,160
We don't know if they're whole or not.

787
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,720
We know you're there.

788
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Anywhere in the planet.

789
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:13,260
I wonder what's going through their little vapid minds as they listen to this crap going

790
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,220
on here.

791
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,260
I didn't say crap, I said crop.

792
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,080
It is this most recent crop of frop.

793
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,500
As you're listening to this grok.

794
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:26,320
I'm not smoking grok anymore because the last time I did, I became filled with a red ochre

795
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,620
hue.

796
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,160
Drink deeply.

797
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,260
And I thought water was more precious than my own excrement.

798
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:30,860
Yeah.

799
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,100
And I dive deep into many manuscripts that I could not sell and also screenplays that

800
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,280
would be fused.

801
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,720
Water is important, but fire is important too.

802
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,040
You don't get any life without fire either, except we don't pass fire.

803
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,980
Well, that's, you keep on missing that dynamic, which is the pep, that is a dynamic

804
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,620
named peppy.

805
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,060
Fire.

806
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,100
But fire does get you between the planets.

807
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,140
There's fire.

808
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,600
What are, what, okay, what are the four elements?

809
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Gets you between point A and point B, you know.

810
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,080
Air, water, earth, and if you're Chinese, there's also wood.

811
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,600
Okay?

812
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,480
Wood.

813
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,260
That's, you get an extra element if you're a Chinese.

814
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,820
If you're Chinese, there's woody.

815
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,740
If you're Chinese, there's woody.

816
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,460
You're not an arrogant redneck.

817
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,520
Ha ha ha.

818
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,040
Jeez.

819
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,760
Ha ha ha.

820
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,600
But I was so far in the character, I actually forgot what...

821
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,060
Yeah.

822
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,620
They let me just have a sandwich!

823
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,560
Deep space.

824
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,560
Yeah.

825
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,820
Yeah.

826
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,560
Fire, fire, I was at the first space challenge.

827
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,960
I was at the first space challenge.

828
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,480
I was trying to get that, and now I was supposed to go to space.

829
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,580
A conspiracy is keeping you from traveling in space.

830
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,140
I was trying to get that, and now I was supposed to go to space.

831
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,140
I got to wreck, I got to rip the whole thing apart just to look at it, just to even...

832
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,140
Build your own ship.

833
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,800
...a little sniff of it, a little taste.

834
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,720
No, no, no, no.

835
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:30,720


836
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:30,720


837
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:30,720


838
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,980
Build your own ship.

839
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,120


840
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,180
Build your own ship.

841
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,820
My mind, my mind, my mind.

842
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,720
I'm losing my mind, you're losing your mind.

843
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,320
My mind.

844
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:43,320
Frankly, my colleagues, if this is one of ours, we have a bigger problem than the full

845
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,800
damn exposure this brings.

846
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:51,160
This was a real shoddy piece of work utilizing an all too obvious, and need I say, common

847
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,380
trigger mechanism.

848
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,740
No kiddies, what we have here is a setup.

849
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,700
This fool was designed to screw up.

850
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,360
Pathetic body count.

851
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,500
The inevitable media shellacking.

852
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,040
The con is going to try to crawl all the way up us on this one.

853
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:13,000
The full four hour CNN worldwide spectacular attention hungry rednecks on parade.

854
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,600
You must give them credit.

855
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,660
They're almost as good as we are.

856
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,500
Almost.

857
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,020
They may be planning to pin this one on us, and I must reiterate that if you're sitting

858
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,120
anywhere within the scope of their power to extradite, you are stupid and not taking full

859
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,720
advantage of the lifestyle perks that a full fellowship in the institute can offer the

860
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,700
freelance researcher.

861
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,620
And I might add that it is a capital offense to steal institute property, namely stamps,

862
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,800
you damn outpatients.

863
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,980
I could have used that money at the border crossings.

864
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,780
As it is, I'm short in fillings.

865
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,400
My impatient inpatients, don't worry.

866
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,300
The chimp will continue to hand out pills every day on his own.

867
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,200
If we have any more incidents of our simian cousins.

868
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,340
I'm not going to be a fool.

869
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


870
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


871
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


872
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


873
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


874
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


875
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


876
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


877
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,340


878
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,220
I'm going to be a chump.

879
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,220
If you want to see my son rediscovering his curiosity, then try to remember which pills

880
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,340
you missed, and when you missed them.

881
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,480
We'll get you all fixed up when I'm back in town.

882
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:16,420
And you know, they're out to do something to you.

883
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,440
I ain't going to say just what.

884
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,620
I know it's not kiss you.

885
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:29,100
They don't want to kiss you, though they may want you to kiss something on them.

886
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:37,780
You know, in the middle ages, there was a, they called it the obscene kiss.

887
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,920
Kissing the devil's bum was the way a witch was initiated.

888
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,300
And today, of course, we have a corporate butt kissing.

889
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,040
And it's the same thing in the office, in the school.

890
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,080
They're still kissing the posterior of the devil.

891
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,080


892
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,080


893
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,500
Selling out.

894
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,780
The bottom line is, friends, the work ethic is satanic.

895
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,460
Oh, the church of the subgenius.

896
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:17,320
Well, all I can say about them is that anybody who hides behind blasphemous humor and doesn't

897
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,120
have the guts to come out in the open and identify who they are, what they are, and

898
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:27,200
allow anybody to interact on any kind of an intelligent level with them is just plain

899
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,080
idiotic and crazy.

900
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,080


901
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,000
And I think Bob's a great name.

902
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,300
And you can see it's their women's clothing.

903
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,800
It saved my life.

904
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,260
It saved my life.

905
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,620
And it can save your life, too.

906
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,540
The subgenius.

907
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,660
Our whole swatch.

908
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,640
But I'm here to be opened up with you today.

909
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:47,900
And, uh.

910
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,520
Well, now, I have just said something in response to what you said.

911
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,100
And there isn't one person in a million out there who even knows what we're talking about,

912
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,420
why I said what I said compared to what you said, because they've never heard of the church

913
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,100
of the subgenius.

914
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,320
So maybe you would like to enlighten them for a moment.

915
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,520
Make it quick.

916
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,100
Okay.

917
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:07,080
Well, what the church of the subgenius is about is finding peace through forgetting

918
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,940
about Jesus.

919
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,060
Because what Jesus has caused on this earth is religion.

920
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:17,900
And what religion has caused is wars and strife and problems in everybody's life.

921
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,560
That's right.

922
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,480
Let's all blame it on the...

923
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,300
Are we ready now?

924
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,340
Christians!

925
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,320
Lord.

926
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,020
Look, Christian...

927
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,020
Well, not just Christians.

928
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,680
I'm not just...

929
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,440
I'm not just picking on you, Bob.

930
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:28,860
Yeah.

931
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,580
Bob.

932
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,580
It's, um...

933
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,080
You want to let people in on that inside joke?

934
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:32,700
Oh.

935
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,700
Well, the founder of the church of subgenius is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

936
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,560
And he had had a vision of the subgenius.

937
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,420
I am the first person to make this fabulous journey.

938
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,880
Suspended in the timelessness of inner space are the thought waves of my first impressions.

939
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:56,060
They will be our only source of contact once you have passed beyond the limits of normal...

940
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,280
Magnification.

941
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,120
Magnification.

942
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,180
Magnification.

943
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:05,740
Magnification.

944
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,240
Magnification.

945
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:06,920


946
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,720
Magnification.

947
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:07,740
Magnification.

948
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:07,740


949
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:12,780
And what is going to happen is there are some zists, which are extraterrestrial creatures,

950
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,700
that are going to appear here on July 8th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning.

951
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,700
And the people who...

952
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,580
Oh, it isn't either.

953
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,780
It's a 703.

954
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,300
Well, 703.

955
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,980
I'm just trying to explain briefly.

956
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,700
Yeah.

957
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:33,360
And the people who have Bob in their hearts, which I believe you possibly could be, since

958
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:33,880
you're Bob.

959
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,380
Since you're both Bob.

960
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,300
You're a candidate for this.

961
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:42,380
And we will take off from Earth just in time to miss the destruction of the Earth in their

962
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,380
pleasure saucers.

963
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,220
And we will be taken back to their planet, which is Planet X, they call it, because they

964
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,200
don't want to reveal what planet they're from until we're there.

965
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,060
And we'll find out.

966
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,400
And we'll live in peace and harmony with them.

967
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,420
Yeah.

968
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,020
Now, I hate to disappoint you, but my truly christened name by my mother is Bobby.

969
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,480
Now, I hate to disappoint you because I realize you had this deep spiritual respect for me

970
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,960
as the result of what you said in terms of the appellation applied to me, but it truly

971
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,720
is Bobby.

972
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,380
Now, in Alabama, I get along great.

973
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,160
In Nebraska, it wasn't so great being raised as Bobby, okay?

974
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,620
Okay.

975
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,480
But, but, sir.

976
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,180
Yes?

977
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,420
To reduce...

978
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,400
Yes?

979
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:32,620
To reduce the problem of evil and the reality of grace to some kind of sick, silly joke

980
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,420
is not only pathetic, it's a waste of time.

981
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,920
And I cannot for the life of me find out what you and the rest of the people in the so-called

982
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,760
Church of the Subgenius want to spend so much time doing absolutely nothing about nothing

983
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,600
when there are very serious and real problems in this world that need resolved and no Bob

984
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,840
can solve them.

985
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,260
Bob can solve them.

986
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,160
Bob can do lots of things.

987
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,220
Bob can do lots of things, dear friends.

988
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,040
And he did do lots of things.

989
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,740
He did some bad things.

990
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:07,880
I'm gonna get you.

991
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:07,920
I'm just gonna get you.

992
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,140
Ah, yes.

993
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:18,740
And friends, if you want to be pathetic, a pathetic loser that just does nothing at

994
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:23,580
all about all the serious problems that could be cured by the goodness of Jesus Christ,

995
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


996
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


997
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


998
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


999
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


1000
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


1001
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


1002
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,580


1003
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:30,180
and so forth. Well friends, I want you to write for free information from old

1004
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:37,540
Bobby. I bet you know how to spell that name Bob. Yeah. At, and here it comes.

1005
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:42,040
Here's the important part and you better have that pencil ready. That

1006
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:49,320
post office box. You just write to Bob at post office box 140306.

1007
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:59,280
Oh God, I'd love to say that one more time. That's 140306. That mighty, mighty P.O. box.

1008
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:05,480
There's lipstick on it right now and the phrase pray Bob written in lipstick. And

1009
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:14,380
friends, that town, that city is Dallas, Texas. God's country. P.O. box 140306

1010
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,380
Dallas, Texas. Zip code 7521.

1011
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:24,560
4. Holy number. It adds up to 23. That's a holy number because that one adds up to

1012
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:32,260
13013 and that means Bob. This music in the background is by DK Jones.

1013
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:43,740
Why does it sound kind of muffled? Well anyway friends, that man Bob loves you.

1014
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,180
You're gonna love him right back in just the same filthy, dirty,

1015
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,120
disgusting, slack-filled way if you just get that self-addressed damn Don

1016
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,880
Bloke or other love offerings too. Thank you.

1017
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:04,040
I doubt there would be so much bitching if you could fully understand what it's like when the TV really is talking about you.

1018
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,280
It's like waking up from one of your daisy fantasies and finding out the whole damn thing was true.

1019
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:17,800
Everyone really is against you and they can read your mind. Just, just, just lie down, be calm, and have faith.

1020
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,820
Uh, note to control, we'll erase the, uh, that word and let's go around.

1021
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,760
Faith in the able interns and technicians who are running the show in our absence.

1022
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,880
Give them some damn peace and quiet. They're probably very jumpy and very fatigued.

1023
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,600
So if one of you mouths off and gets the hose or some other damn thing I know absolutely nothing about, then it's your fault!

1024
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:45,760
I cannot stress this point enough. If you get punished, it is because you are bad.

1025
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,160
Not because your actions are disgusting.

1026
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,480
Not because your actions are displeasing or inappropriate.

1027
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,720
Because you yourself are not good!

1028
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,780
Good. Now go to bed.

1029
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,060
Well, back to the doctors.

1030
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,040
If you're listening to this, you must be pretty bad off for some orders or advice.

1031
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,500
It turns my stomach, you sheep, my fellow doctors toadying about passing the responsibility.

1032
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:15,980
Your present situation seems to indicate that none of you have the necessary survival instincts to follow my advice.

1033
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,660
But, for whatever it's worth,

1034
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,120
start by incinerating your orders.

1035
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:28,580
Your notes, your uniforms, your secretaries, your degrees, etc, etc.

1036
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:34,900
Next, medic yourselves into oblivion and disappear into the inpatient population of the institute.

1037
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,180
Once we're back in town, I'll find you and set you right again. I promise.

1038
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,440
You'd best take precautions to liquify date. I mean date.

1039
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:48,100
Best liquidate any daisies that might recognize you and bear some...

1040
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,900
irrational grudge against you.

1041
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:58,160
Make no mistake, these zombies may be decerebrated for the most part, but they do have their own sort of primitive prison mentality kind of society.

1042
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,940
Except for the rape, of course. We've seen to that.

1043
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,520
Listen, fellows.

1044
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:09,080
We decided a long time ago that our cargo would be delivered to the population regardless of collateral damage.

1045
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,860
I cannot have you fools scurrying around every time a firecracker goes off in the parking lot we...

1046
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,700
Hey!

1047
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,420
Hey, get the hell away from my car!

1048
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,500
As I was saying, we have to at least provide the appearance of a unified front or they'll cut us apart.

1049
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,520
It's ugly.

1050
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,420
I've watched them do it in our former competitors.

1051
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,540
So if you can't handle it, get in with the rest of the damn cripples and shut up, shut up, shut up!

1052
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,940
That was beautiful, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

1053
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,900
I know I feel better.

1054
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,240
Indeed, indeed.

1055
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,680
You know, if I remember correctly, isn't contingency 823 constantly changing?

1056
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:46,680


1057
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:46,980
I mean, is it constipation?

1058
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,160
Uh, coupled with premature ejaculation, yes.

1059
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,580
Well, excellent.

1060
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,620
False activation.

1061
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,440
Ah, understood.

1062
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,840
Well, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, friends and neighbors.

1063
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,140
Oh, let's play some background music.

1064
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,040
Ooh, background music.

1065
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,100
Ooh, baby, baby.

1066
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,120
Set a little bit of a mood.

1067
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,700
Yes, indeed. We do need to. Let's play some background music. Let's just...

1068
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,060
Something to relax all the ladies.

1069
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,400
Let's go.

1070
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,560
Just lay down here.

1071
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:11,940
Let's go here.

1072
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,820
Ah, so beautiful.

1073
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:15,940
How beautiful.

1074
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,800
This Kentucky thing.

1075
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,440
Promise,Vibe, I agree.

1076
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,020
Paducah, Kentucky.

1077
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,300
Orange, Minor, handicap,

1078
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,220
Right.

1079
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:24,960
arse,

1080
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:43,820
Prince,
