00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:15,920
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,260
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,540
Ah, yes, dear friends, there we go. That's the background music I wanted, whatever the heck it is.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,240
Ah.

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,640
And, uh, yes, it's a show with Dave again, but we have to call Dave.

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,000
We have to call Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,380
And find the Dave-man inside the Dave.

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,840
The Dave.

10
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh, great. Way to go, Dave.

11
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:22,400
Well, we'll try that home number and hope he's not buzzing.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Wish you had a Dave.

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,640
I think we got a wrong number.

14
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:38,680
You got a wrong number.

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,520
No, no, no, it's all right.

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
We got a wrong number.

17
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,860
Can I have a wrong number?

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,760
I got, they...

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,740
Ah, yeah, the Chinese people just left and they came back again.

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,980
Don't worry about them, they're all hot and sold, so to speak.

21
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,360
We got the money to cover what they want to do.

22
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,820
Well, lucky them.

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,200
We got the money back.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,440
Well...

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,380
I think it has to do with cartographing and flyballing, uh, various moon flights.

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,260
Like, you can book a moon flight for a fun, you know, your bachelorette party.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,200
You can do that now.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,820
Yeah.

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,860
You can have your bachelorette party on a trip to the moon.

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,180
If you have enough scratch.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
But what about the flyballing?

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,680
Well, I think that's the only incentive you want, promise.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,220
Promise.

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,880
You need binoculars to flyball just right.

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,260
I mean, that's...

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,540
You need a binoculars and a telescope and a telescope and a great big...

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,300
Bob with big red straps.

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,180
That's what you need to flyball, baby.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,540
Sounds like a hanging epiglottis or something.

41
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,640
Actually, you need a tiny, tiny little Bob with little red straps.

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,300
Well, Dave, how's...

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,320
How the heck are you, man?

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,420
How are you and your swinging epiglottis?

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,660
Who are you talking to?

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,260
Are you talking to a tiny little Bob head?

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,240
No.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,680
Are you talking to me?

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,620
We're talking to you.

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,160
Are you talking to me?

51
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,580
You.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,860
You and your swinging epiglottis.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
There's no one else here.

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,820
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,720
Wasn't that a great Robert De Niro?

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,480
That was really cool.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,420
That was like some passion.

58
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,220
Terrible.

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,420
It was awful.

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,840
Awful.

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,580
Don't quit your day job.

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Who says I got a gay job?

63
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm mighty proud to be a bachelorette organizer party person.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


70
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,240


75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,020
I make quite a few mandrills every couple of week of phones.

76
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,080
There's nothing wrong with that.

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,680
That's cool.

78
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,560
We're cool with that.

79
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,200
Yeah.

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,500
Sure.

81
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,780
You're cool with everything, man.

82
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,120
Yeah.

83
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,780
Do your own thing.

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah.

85
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,660
I'm up for any program.

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,240
I don't know if it's not any program.

87
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,420
Most programs, any program.

88
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,840
Well, you're going to have to...

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,720
Most pogroms.

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Yeah.

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,580
Most pogroms.

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah.

93
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,240
Spanish pogroms.

94
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,240


95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,240


96
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,240


97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,240


98
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,240


99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Most pogroms.

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,180
Pogrom mashup.

101
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,540
You silly.

102
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, old Dave, how's life going for you there in Ashtabulee Trump land?

103
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,640
Ah, it's bittersweet, my friend.

104
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,300
I've often thought of calling you and to tell you of the travails I've suffered here in

105
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,660
this God-forsaken southern land.

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,220
Suddenly, I've come to this place.

107
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


108
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


110
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


111
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,040
I feel better just knowing there's someone to beat the trumpet with and spank up the sparkly phone.

112
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,840
Well, spank it up.

113
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,860
Well, get on with it then.

114
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Spank it.

115
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:37,580


116
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,820
Spank it, dude.

117
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,160
Okay.

118
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,020
I start with one first very important thing, okay?

119
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:45,940
Okay.

120
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,000
I start with, no, no, forget that.

121
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,760
I got a better idea.

122
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,800
No, let it flow, man.

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,400
Let it flow.

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,820
Oh, okay, okay.

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:13,060
I see like this big, big, big animal, and it have three sharp teeth on its face to buy you or to commercially orient you and sell you a new property in the zone.

126
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,580
Ah.

127
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:16,760
Ah.

128
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,320
A selling animal.

129
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,340
Yes.

130
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,980
With three teeth.

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,080
Yes.

132
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,100
Three rodent-like teeth.

133
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Yes.

134
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,700
I love listening to conversation between two deaf people now that I'm no longer deaf.

135
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,620
I'm the only one that can tell that you're talking about three completely different things, and there's only two of you doing it.

136
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,580
It's astounding.

137
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,300
That's a special skill we have.

138
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,820
There's some things I don't know, but if I don't already know about it, then it isn't cool enough for me to have known about in the first place.

139
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,320
Well, maybe it's because you had perforated our ear balls for so long.

140
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:04,920
You invented and created an own likewise world of your own on a parallel symphonic part, you know, thing there.

141
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,940
Yeah.

142
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,200
Yeah, the world.

143
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,200
I learn about it.

144
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,560
I learn about it from my friends.

145
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,400
And we got a letter from a friend who's a pharmacist.

146
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,560
He's a subgenius minister who also is a pharmacist, Reverend Middleton.

147
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,140
He's also a really good cartoonist.

148
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,940
But.

149
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,660
That's not his day job.

150
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:37,020
But I wanted to tell you a funny story of the conspiracy world of medicine, Dave, that I think you might be able to appreciate.

151
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,640
Oh, heck.

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,520
Hell yeah.

153
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,020
Sure.

154
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,420
Yeah, this is notes from the cornered druggist.

156
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:56,300
And this month of the year the conspiracy calls 2017, he said that yesterday he received an order from a dentist's office for a product called Zip.

157
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,840
Zerese.

158
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,760
I guess that's how it's pronounced or Xerese or something.

159
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,960
I'll call it Zerese.

160
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:10,800
Something we never stocked in a product that was listed as available from my wholesaler for the princely sum of $1,085.

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,740
This warranted further.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,300
Yeah.

163
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,060
Yeah.

164
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,080
One little tube.

165
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:26,300
I think it turns out that this five gram tube of an ointment contains a combination of 5% a cycle of ear and 1% of a tube.

166
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


167
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


168
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


169
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


170
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


171
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


172
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


173
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


174
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


175
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


176
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


177
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


178
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


179
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


180
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,300


181
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:37,220
Hydrocortisone, a cycle of ear, a long generic antiviral treatment for herpes comes in capsules of 200 milligrams for about 10 cents each.

182
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:44,760
And hydrocortisone has been available as an over the counter product at the dollar store for well, a dollar.

183
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,020
Five grams of Zerese contains 250 milligrams of a cycle of ear.

184
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,240
Uh,

185
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,380
5% concentration.

186
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:55,940
And five.

187
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,300
Grams.

188
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,780
And 100 grams.

189
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,020
And whatever.

190
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,320
And 250 grams.

191
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,580
And whatever.

192
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:11,720
This means that Valiant, the makers of Zerese, is taking raw materials that cost at most a dollar ten and charging $1,085 for the product wholesale.

193
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Yes.

194
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm.

195
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,680
Yes, I.

196
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,260
I'm here on the home.

197
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,920
I thought you might know about that.

198
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:26,220
So you may wonder why I, the pharmacist, don't just make this project by scratching together the ingredients, investing about five minutes of mix and

199
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,400
label time and pass it on to the patient at a huge savings.

200
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,740
The answer is this.

201
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm forbidden to do so by federal law.

202
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,740
The FDA has given the license to this combination of Valiant of Canada.

203
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,980
And for me to create the combination is to violate the directives of the FDA.

204
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:55,900
But you may recognize the name Valiant, by the way, one of the more recent one of the recent collection of pharmaceutical gougers under its ex CEO, Jay.

205
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:13,420
Michael Pearson and morally aligned with the rap loving smirk fest embodied by Martin Screlly and entrepreneur who is currently either in prison or scamming widows and orphans out of their homes with phony mortgages.

206
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,160
However, I can get a prescription for a a cycle of your capsules from that dentist.

207
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,240
See that the patient charges no more than $5.

208
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,880
Then instruct the patient to get a $1.20.

209
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,720
Tube of hydrocortisone ointment from my shelf.

210
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:40,780
And then by demonstration, show the patient how to mix the two products, put the combination in a one ounce oatmeal jar and possess not five grams, but 30 grams of handmade quotes.

211
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,140
A Reese unquote with a wholesale value of over $6,000.

212
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,100
To put it in context, series cost $217 a gram gold.

213
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,100
As of.

214
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Third of March.

215
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:55,880


216
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,200
2017 cost $39 a gram.

217
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
Yeah, I'm quite familiar.

218
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,220
I'm actually familiar with this on a personal level because I can't remember what it was that I had.

219
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:20,000
But I talked to my buddy who whose brother was a pharmacist and who's real radical pharmacist and likes to rail on on the Internet about how big pharma is screwing everybody.

220
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,380
And one of the ingredients was hydrocortisone.

221
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,540
But in the mixture that.

222
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:25,680
He.

223
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,680
Explained to me there were three things, but they could all be found at the local dollar store.

224
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Right.

225
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,720
And I think it was like a $700 markup for whatever product.

226
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,780
And it was either.

227
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,800
It could have been the same guy who told him.

228
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, maybe not.

229
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:52,500
But somebody told him, look, you just go to the store and get hydrocortisone, white vinegar and whatever, you know, and you've got the stuff.

230
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,520
He makes it three to one this and anybody can do it.

231
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,920
They've got your link.

232
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
I can't.

233
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,580
You did irritate the hell out of me when you told me that because I just I think they're very nasty people.

234
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,720
They really are.

235
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:18,240
The cost of the cost of MRIs is like about thirteen hundred times higher in the United States than it is around the rest of the world.

236
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,420
And they ask them people.

237
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,840
Well, how come America charged something?

238
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,060
And they all said, we don't know.

239
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,320
All our MRI devices were all from the United States.

240
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,120
Right.

241
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:45,480
Well, you know, I've been lately having such a great time out here at Stang Ranch and partying around and being feted by the fetid or something like that.

242
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:53,780
And that I almost feel guilty for having so much slack, although I don't because that would infringe on my slack.

243
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,200
But.

244
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:03,800
But at the same time, I haven't got the bill yet for that little heart attack that killed me.

245
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,700
I mean, that I that minor little nothing that I recovered from so easily.

246
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,300
Anyway, I got one bill.

247
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:24,020
Actually, it was for the the first stop at the hospital where they didn't have a working heart attack fixing machine or the doctor.

248
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,980
It was.

249
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,340
It was a little down.

250
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,100
They charged me 13.

251
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,100
They charged somebody 13,000 bucks.

252
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm going to have to pay a couple of grand out of that.

253
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:42,260
Now, I got a bill from the helicopter company for 40,000 dollars.

254
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,840
I don't know how much of that I'm expected to pay, but I also got an ad for helicopter ride insurance.

255
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,040
So if you only pay 25 bucks a month and next time you have a heart attack, you have to be helicopter.

256
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,240
You don't get charged anything.

257
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,680
So it's so it's so easy.

258
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,340
That's real.

259
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,780
Yeah, that's real.

260
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:15,500
And what I haven't got yet is is the the bill for saving my miserable life at the actual main hospital where they did have the heart attack fixing machine and the doctor and the pills.

261
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,600
Actually, they gave me a shot of morphine before they flew me to Fort Worth and a helicopter, Dave.

262
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,240
I'd never done anything like that.

263
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,900
It was so.

264
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,620
Interesting.

265
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,480
It didn't make me when it made me high.

266
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,040
It made me interested in everything.

267
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,780
I wasn't scared I was going to have a heart attack.

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,860
I was interested.

269
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah, I felt a similar way.

270
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,720
Yeah, they charged me one thousand dollars for that shot of or they charged the insurance company a thousand bucks for that shot of morphine.

271
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
I bet I could get a little cheaper on the street.

272
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,980
Yeah, but it wasn't available to me right at that time.

273
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,760
And, you know, it might be stepped on.

274
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,680
When you're having a heart attack, you want only the best.

275
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:57,960
Sure.

276
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,060
But, you know, obviously, the very late, if she keeps the feet, the gimmick is on it.

277
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,160
Let's face it.

278
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,780
When I get the final bill, I have another heart attack.

279
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:18,940
It's a win win situation for all the heart attack doctors and the helicopter pilots because I still don't have that helicopter insurance.

280
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,740
Yeah.

281
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,020
And now, you know why?

282
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm a social.

283
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm a socialized medicine creep.

284
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:35,900
When I was playing in the band in London and my son came over and my wife came over and we were living in this place that had a pantry in it.

285
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,180
And, you know, they like it's like a half basement.

286
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,980
It goes down low.

287
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,040
So they saved a bunch of bills on refrigeration.

288
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,760
They can put milk in there for a long time.

289
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,600
So he's running back and forth, back and forth, like all crazy children and stuff like that.

290
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,360
And he gets a huge concussion.

291
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,820
All we've got to do is get to the hospital.

292
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,640
And they take care.

293
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,840
And that's what happened to the hardest thing was trying to find.

294
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,660
Yeah.

295
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,780
Well, that's socialized medicine, Dave.

296
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,240
That's what most of the civilized countries do.

297
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,320
I don't see what they had to complain about.

298
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,040
They still had all the cool cars in the parking lot.

299
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,340
Right.

300
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:09,680
Exactly.

301
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,360
Who was a doctor and who was just, you know.

302
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,700
But do the insurance bosses in England have cool cars like that?

303
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,860
That's the question.

304
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
I would say that.

305
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,480
The pharmacy, you know, CEO.

306
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:24,760


307
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,280
I don't know.

308
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,300
I don't know.

309
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,300


310
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,840
What are you going to do?

311
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,440
Move to England?

312
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,500
On the other hand.

313
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,120
Go to Canada or Cuba because they both start with the K sound.

314
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,860
Which means Canada, Cuba.

315
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,020
And communists, they all start with a C.

316
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,200
And conspiracy.

317
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,540
You know what, though?

318
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,780
The great musician, Reverend Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz Project, he used to live here in Texas.

319
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,880
But he.

320
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,500
He.

321
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,740
He.

322
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:02,600
He moved to Canada for his health and lived because he.

323
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
Actually, it wasn't him.

324
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,880
I think it was his wife that lived because they were in Canada instead of Texas.

325
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,440
Yeah.

326
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,900
You know, I guess he wouldn't get the $40,000 helicopter bill.

327
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,120
They'd just take him on the helicopter and charge some rich man.

328
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Like the government.

329
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,480
That rich guy named the government.

330
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,380
The invisible hand guy.

331
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,800
Yeah, that guy.

332
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
That jerk.

333
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,020
I hate that invisible hand guy.

334
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,060
The deep.

335
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,800
The deep.

336
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,540
Yeah.

337
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:41,840
That's what they say when they're pallbearers at everyone's similar funeral that they're having in Chinatown tonight.

338
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,860
With all the gongs and the wacky wheels and the childish motors.

339
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,360
They're much too grand for the rest of the restaurateurs.

340
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:50,840
Two years.

341
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,260
It gets pretty deep and dark out there.

342
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,840
Here, I'll tell you.

343
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,140
Yes, sir.

344
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,620
I think so.

345
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,440
No, no.

346
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,480
I take all that back.

347
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,920
That doesn't make no sense.

348
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,780
What?

349
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,340
I can't believe I heard Dave just say that.

350
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,080
He's taking it backwards.

351
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,260
What are them to say?

352
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
It's all going backwards.

353
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
He took it back.

354
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,640
Yeah, Dave.

355
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,400
So, but we're safe, right?

356
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,760
We can talk about it by John, too.

357
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,720
Well.

358
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,380
Well, the oil republic and Mr. Trump was involved with a bunch of shady deals in Azerbaijan,

359
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,460
which was a former part of the former Soviet Union, formerly known as Bruns.

360
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,620
Oh, he's involved with shady stuff all over the place.

361
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,660
It's just one would think it's just a matter of time.

362
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,660
I had such fun reading headlines today.

363
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,060
Listeners, here's some time control.

364
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,240
In our time when we're doing this, it's Sunday, March 26th, I think.

365
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,840
Yeah, Sunday, March 26th.

366
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,460
It's my birthday after my brother's birthday.

367
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,860
The headlines this morning.

368
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,660
Happy birthday, Wee.

369
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,020
My brother's birthday.

370
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,320
The headlines this morning were fun headlines to read because they were gloating.

371
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,240
Trump and Ryan insure Dem Congress in 2018.

372
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,200
That was my favorite one.

373
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,780
You know, Trump, Trump, number one loser, you know, stuff like that.

374
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,640
It was a dog pile.

375
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,180
It was so unfair.

376
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,000
It was so unfair.

377
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,560
It hurt the feelings of the...

378
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,080
It made the little snowflakes cry.

379
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
The little snowflakes in the tea party.

380
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,660
No, no, the tea party people.

381
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,120
You know, the Trumpies, the Trumpanzis, the Trumpangatangs.

382
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,960
They were...

383
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,540
Those poor little snowflakes were oppressed by the fact that their own representatives

384
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,820
couldn't agree on anything whatsoever.

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
And it hurts their feelings.

386
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,620
It hurts their feelings when the libtards laugh at them.

387
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,320
They didn't like being portrayed as a train wreck.

388
00:18:59,560 --> 00:18:59,840
Huh?

389
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,340
They didn't like being portrayed as a train wreck.

390
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,660
Well, nobody likes to have mean things said.

391
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,220
But bullies, bullies especially object to being bullied.

392
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,840
Nobody, nobody deserves to be bullied, at least of all bullies.

393
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,980
It's just unfair.

394
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,260
And so sad to see those poor...

395
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,620
I know.

396
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
Those poor conservatives get...

397
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,620
So upset and angry.

398
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,420
And they're just so fretful.

399
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,960
And they're bitter.

400
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,760
And they're going to hurt themselves.

401
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,080
They're going to all have heart attacks.

402
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,620
Those poor little snowflakes.

403
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,320
They're just crying and weeping.

404
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,500
The girls are picking on them.

405
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,660
The gay people, the sissies are all picking on them.

406
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,560
For some of them, gay people ain't sissies.

407
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,100
You asked Jayner about that.

408
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,080
Yep.

409
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,960
I was in a real world situation one time.

410
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,680
And it happened to be the death.

411
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,900
And the oil industry.

412
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,940
And I was talking to a representative and asking questions about earthquakes,

413
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,280
which I was required to do because that was part of my job and stuff.

414
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,460
And this guy started acting like somebody was picking on his grandma.

415
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,940
Or his little, his four-year-old son or something.

416
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,440
Well, you are an enemy of...

417
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,860
He tried to make me feel guilty like I was picking on big gas and oil.

418
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,360
Yeah, you're an enemy of the people.

419
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,440
One freaking question about earthquakes.

420
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,140
He was like, well, you know, this is a very young science.

421
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,060
Science and industry.

422
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,520
And I don't necessarily know if I like the idea of you...

423
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,240
You know, he was making it sound like...

424
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,460
No, geology is...

425
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,740
...somebody weak.

426
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,100
Geology is one of the oldest sciences and most understood.

427
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,980
And meta-sciences and neo-sciences, too, when you talk about guys like that.

428
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,340
But, Dave, they read on the fake news...

429
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,200
Well, they don't read.

430
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,840
They heard.

431
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,240
They saw on the fake news that you are a reporter and, therefore, an enemy of America.

432
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,120
Of course, the fact is...

433
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,940
The fact that they learned this from reporters is kind of odd.

434
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,340
But they have their own reporters that do their own fake news.

435
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,840
The fake news they want to hear.

436
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960
There were 90,000 of them during George Bush's days.

437
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,520
Fake reporters, they call them.

438
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,160
But they were actually flak hacks who released stories that were not necessarily true.

439
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,060
No.

440
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,080
And that's an actual fact.

441
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,780
Well, you know...

442
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,020
But it's no more weird than having to pay $3,000 for a...

443
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,000
Bill or $100,000 for a night in the hospital.

444
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,040
Right.

445
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
Oh, yeah, but don't remind me.

446
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,520
I haven't gotten the bill for the night in the hospital yet.

447
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,720
Oh, I did.

448
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,720
It was...

449
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,820
I couldn't believe it.

450
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,760
And it was a lot for around here, even.

451
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,940
Not quite as much as you were forced to pay.

452
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,580
Oh, no.

453
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,880
I was flown to the finest private room in Harris Hospital in Fort Worth.

454
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,760
We landed on top of a building.

455
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,540
A who?

456
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,780
And I was carried out.

457
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,020
And a stretcher ahead.

458
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,360
I could see, like, this big circle with a line in between and stuff like that.

459
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,760
And you guys are all ducking.

460
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,820
You're not strapped in at all.

461
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,860
You're running right along with the rest of them.

462
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,380
Shouting to them like a movie of some kind.

463
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,700
The funny thing is, at no point did I ever feel all that bad.

464
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,940
The heart attack hurt.

465
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,240
And it didn't feel right.

466
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,680
But it felt more like terrible indigestion.

467
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,740
Only the fact that it was...

468
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,880
It was affecting my neck and teeth and upper brain.

469
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,940
Made us realize, no, it's a heart attack.

470
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,960
But it took us long enough to figure that out.

471
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,760
And since then, some of my cholesterol wasn't bad.

472
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm in real good shape now.

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
For a 90-year-old man.

474
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,800
So I just don't get it.

475
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,860
Why do I have to go do exercises in a room full of old people?

476
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,500
And they are super old, Dave.

477
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,400
They're even older.

478
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:52,920
And you!

479
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,980
They're so old!

480
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,520
They have to have walkers when they walk and stuff like that.

481
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,620
Some of them do, yeah.

482
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,260
And they have oxygen.

483
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,880
They smile all the time, even though they're in excruciating pain.

484
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,140
It makes them want to not really live that long.

485
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,760
I mean, I do.

486
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,960
Okay, okay, don't hurt me.

487
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,520
Please don't.

488
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,280
Please don't hurt me.

489
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
I want to live forever.

490
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,600
But you know what I mean, don't you?

491
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm happy!

492
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm alive!

493
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,980
Oh, man.

494
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,660
Well.

495
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,680
Yeah, it can get...

496
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,780
It can get kind of grim.

497
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,800
A certain friend of mine told me that she did her treatise or her thesis or whatever

498
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,500
where you get free when you do a paper for your master's degree on Mussolini

499
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,440
and his march on Rome and stuff like that.

500
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:43,140
And all of his slogans are being recycled into the Trump cycle.

501
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,900
Like there's make Rome...

502
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,720
Remember the old one of the Italian fascist party?

503
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,320
Let's make Rome great again.

504
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, that became let's make America great again.

505
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah, when it should be, let's make Reverend Stang great again.

506
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,400
Or for once.

507
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,780
Let's make him great finally.

508
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,460
Yeah.

509
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,100
Why not?

510
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:16,020
I'd worship you as some sort of peculiar Iowaf, a diminished police car or something.

511
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,620
You know, it would sound different.

512
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,960
Stang is my lord and master blaster.

513
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,700
Well, you don't have to do that yet.

514
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,360
But...

515
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,460
It would sound different, though.

516
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:32,200
If you say make America great finally, that has a really different ring to it.

517
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,240
It implies that it hasn't yet been great, but could be.

518
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,560
How about make America great for once?

519
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,520
Yeah, well, that sounds a little better than finally, doesn't it?

520
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,180
You should be an ad copywriter.

521
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,460
You should be in that show Mad Men that I've never seen.

522
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,500
Do you want to hear another really?

523
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,640
Sick one that they're doing?

524
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,240
Sure.

525
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,640
Have you heard of the author Howard Zinn?

526
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,520
Yeah.

527
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,980
He might have just recently...

528
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,680
Well, they're going to ban his books.

529
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,920
They're trying to ban his books, and they're having a constitutional struggle.

530
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
Well, I thought alternative news...

531
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,820
In Little Rock, Arkansas.

532
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,800
Oh, well...

533
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,200
They want to ban his books in Little Rock, Arkansas.

534
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,980
The school board wants to make sure the kids don't...

535
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,480
They can't possibly read alternative news.

536
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,280
Howard Zinn and hear about the Shane Whiskey Rebellion or something.

537
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,440
You know, that could be dangerous.

538
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,740
Huh?

539
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,220
Huh?

540
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,840
Well, that is Arkansas.

541
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,340
No offense to my many Arkansanian friends.

542
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,660
They would all agree with me wholeheartedly.

543
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,320
Yeah, Arkansas is the dumbest place in the country.

544
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,740
Except possibly Mississippi, Kansas, Alabama, Texas.

545
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,900
All those southern states and midwestern states and eastern and northern states.

546
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,160
Alaskan and non-contiguous island type states.

547
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,860
They're all so...

548
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,280
They're all stupider than all the other states.

549
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,900
They are.

550
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,780
And they're sterile and hostile, too.

551
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,760
And that's why we have to aboriginate.

552
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,820
De-arib...

553
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,780
Yeah.

554
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,540
We have to get...

555
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,660
Whatever you said.

556
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,720
De-aboriginate.

557
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,020
No.

558
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,400
Wait.

559
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,580
They already did that.

560
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,820
If we don't, what will happen to our children and our forefathers?

561
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,520
They kind of already did de-aboriginate about nine-tenths of the aborigines.

562
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,940
By accident.

563
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,600
Half of them.

564
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,800
Well, I hope enough of them at least show up at the bowling alley.

565
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,980
That we can stop the oil trail going right through the center of the country.

566
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,260
Like Standing Rock and the other...

567
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:37,580
And you really think that little bitty Lakota team is going to be able to out-bowl the conspiracy of oil runners?

568
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:37,900
I don't know.

569
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,000
There's people going from all around the country joining the struggle, you know?

570
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,460
Yeah, but it ended.

571
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,240
It's over with.

572
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
The conspiracy won.

573
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,400
Oh, sure, man.

574
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,600
Poop on you, man.

575
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,440
Sorry, but the conspiracy won that one.

576
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,440
That's what I meant.

577
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,020
Yeah.

578
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,680
It's a bummer.

579
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,920
Bob's prophecy that it's going to be a bummer, man.

580
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,640
Came true.

581
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,260
Sure did.

582
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,180
Yeah.

583
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,240
He didn't even know about Santar oil either.

584
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,180
Or whatever they call them in New York.

585
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,640
Oh, he probably owned it.

586
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,500
He probably still does.

587
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,740
He just doesn't know it.

588
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,780
Yeah, he probably made a hole.

589
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,280
A ton off of it.

590
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,220
Because, you see, Bob...

591
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,780
Dave...

592
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,960
Bob is like a warm jacuzzi.

593
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,120
Making it warm and fuzzy to be alive.

594
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,320
He protects Yeti gins with pure grimy slack.

595
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,740
And the bubbles go in his rectum, too.

596
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:50,980
And he arranges the mind to a microcosmos consciousness where you can relax with your own delusions.

597
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,780
Yes.

598
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,680
And be yourself.

599
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:01,260
And living in symbiosis with slackful nature in the small world of the Yeti.

600
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,820
So you can just get down in the spirit sphere and into his warm surrounding glow.

601
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,540
And be truly alive and free.

602
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,100
To be one with your own spirit.

603
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,200
Alone.

604
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,300
Or something.

605
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,280
Well, I agree wholeheartedly.

606
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,640
If I had a heart and a hole.

607
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,580
And I could agree with either one of the two of them.

608
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,780
I would certainly do it in your honor.

609
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,560
At your behest, senor.

610
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,740
Don senor.

611
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,060
Well, it's not me talking.

612
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:47,720
I got this long, all over the place kind of rant or essay by Pope Misopan.

613
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,420
Or if that's the way you say it.

614
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,340
Misopan.

615
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,440
Misopan.

616
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,840
I don't know.

617
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,840
Misopan.

618
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,280
Earth, sky, fire, and Bob, it's called.

619
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,280
It's one of those rants where I can pick it up during the hour of slack

620
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,940
and just read three sentences every now and then at random.

621
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,720
Like here's one.

622
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,980
Bob has a way to protect you.

623
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,520
He puts you apart from them because you believe in the Holy Spirit

624
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,060
and they don't understand because they're not praying people,

625
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,520
not religious at all, nothing but slaving fools.

626
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,040
Oh, wait, I thought that was us.

627
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,020
Wait, now I'm mixed up.

628
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,560
Yeah, now you thought you were reading a Christian.

629
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,560
Oh, this guy's nuts.

630
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,840
You can't trust anyone.

631
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,580
You can trust in Bob.

632
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,920
What?

633
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,640
Yeah, you can trust in Bob to get all the slack that was yours in the first place.

634
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,080
That's what preachers do.

635
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,000
He's a preacher.

636
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,740
He's trying to be hard on the other crap, on the other side of the fence.

637
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,420
You know what I mean?

638
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,320
He's just, you know.

639
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,680
Well, this part here is a little better.

640
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,760
Whatever you call it.

641
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,240
Bob allows you to break on through to the other side,

642
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,220
to just be alive, slacked,

643
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,220
and make all the slackless vanish into oblivion.

644
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,900
Oh, really?

645
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,860
Is that?

646
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,560
Well, I'll just make that slackless hospital bill vanish into oblivion.

647
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:12,760
Yeah.

648
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,500
Oh, no, Bob has to do that for you.

649
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,480
I'll do it that way.

650
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,900
Yeah, I can't.

651
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,360
I don't know.

652
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,040
Well, Mark Mother's boss said it best, says Pope Missopan.

653
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,440
Bob is like an all-consuming sex.

654
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,660
Bob consumes it all and turns it into slackful mojo,

655
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,520
filling the blank for any yeti looking to build a wholly existential scheme.

656
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,380
Live alone in slack, pursuing one's own free nature.

657
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,800
Free to become a divine creature, an animal, all over again.

658
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,080
Oh!

659
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,700
Oh!

660
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,080
Oh!

661
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:48,680
Oh!

662
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,420
Even a man who is pure at heart and often farts by night

663
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,000
will turn into a subgenius

664
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,940
when the frop is blooming and the autumn moon is bright.

665
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,160
And the wolf's famous blood.

666
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,080
Yeah.

667
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,180
Yeah.

668
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,840
And the wind is being broken again and again and again.

669
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,500
Yeah.

670
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,160
Where is Maria Ospenskaya when we need her?

671
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,960
She was so old and so beautiful.

672
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,000
Like Nunu.

673
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,900
The kid walks into the crystal ball.

674
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,260
And Lon Chaney looks at his feet and hair getting hairy and stuff like that.

675
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,260
And then a lady with a purple purse walks in

676
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,680
and shoots one of the dragonaires and one of the sound effects people, too.

677
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,260
She had a gun.

678
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,360
That was the Fierstein Theater version of The Wolfman starring Lon Chaney Jr.

679
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,920
Worst actor.

680
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,900
In 50 years.

681
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,120
Yeah, but he knew how to put his hands over his face and grimace.

682
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,540
You know, like, oh my God, the horror.

683
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,600
And he put his hands up to his face.

684
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,080
Everybody can do that.

685
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,160
Yeah.

686
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,080
Actually, he was terrible.

687
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,960
Lon Chaney Jr. was...

688
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,140
Believe it or not, he got an Academy Award or nomination anyway

689
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,680
for playing Lenny of Mice and Men.

690
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,040
But anybody can play Sinfaltimus.

691
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,500
So, you know, again, The Wolfman...

692
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,380
He...

693
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,880
But, hey, still, he was Lon Chaney Jr.

694
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,620
Earnest, forced imitation of Lon Chaney Sr.

695
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,960
Forced by the studios.

696
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,340
He didn't even want to be an actor.

697
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,180
His real name is Creighton Tull Chaney.

698
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,980
And I've got scans of his passport from 1959.

699
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,580
That's cute.

700
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,960
Yeah, it's weird, man.

701
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,460
It's weird.

702
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,420
Why do I have...

703
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,380
Lon Chaney Jr.'s passport.

704
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,120
Why not?

705
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
There you go.

706
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,820
Why not both?

707
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,620
Have it and not have it.

708
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,180
Schrodinger's Lon Chaney Jr. passport.

709
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
Have it and don't have it.

710
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,300
I also had...

711
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,240
I had Fritz von Erich's baby book for a while,

712
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,520
but let's not go into that.

713
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,020
Let's not.

714
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,600
Fritz von Erich is too deep for anybody to cover in one afternoon.

715
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,520
He's an...

716
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,540
He reminds me of one of those old Prussian archdukes or something like that.

717
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,100
Well, he was.

718
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,320
He's got...

719
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,740
Yeah, but he's got all kinds of fuzzy and financial...

720
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,060
Yeah.

721
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,080
And all kinds of other things associated with his bank account.

722
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,560
Fritz von Erich was...

723
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,020
And his psychics...

724
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,220
His psychological history.

725
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Do you even know who I'm talking about?

726
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Fritz von Erich.

727
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,400
Because you sound remarkably accurate.

728
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,620
Fritz von Erich was a famous wrestler.

729
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,180
Yeah.

730
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,800
Okay.

731
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,280
Well, and he had five sons who all committed suicide except for one,

732
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,360
Kevin von Erich.

733
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,540
Oh, yes.

734
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,140
I forgot.

735
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,520
Who hired me and Jesus to do his mail order business for a while

736
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,960
back when I still lived in Dallas.

737
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,620
We did mail order business for the von Erich wrestling clan empire,

738
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,160
which consisted only of Kevin.

739
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,600
The Texas Tornado was dead of a drug overdose.

740
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,000
Two of the other brothers killed themselves,

741
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,240
probably leaving notes,

742
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,980
thanks, Dad,

743
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,320
something like that.

744
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,880
It's all very tragic.

745
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,680
There was even a little boy that died.

746
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,780
He died in that family.

747
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,200
Aw.

748
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,780
Yeah.

749
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,320
It was a cursed family, the von Erichs, I guess,

750
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,760
except for old Kevin.

751
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,360
He seemed to...

752
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,460
He'd been hit in the head so many times.

753
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,800
He couldn't have anything but slack.

754
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,580
We were little.

755
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,460
We were little.

756
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,740
Just think how much we hated Fritz von Erich.

757
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,560
Little did we know.

758
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,300
Well, because he was a German, and Germans were Nazis in the late 1950s.

759
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,420
Well, yeah.

760
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,680
He was supposed to be a villain.

761
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,620
He always was.

762
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,620
His sons later played all-American hero types

763
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,040
and would wrestle guys.

764
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,920
He would wrestle guys in Iraqi masks,

765
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,540
Iranian turbans and stuff, you know.

766
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,300
Oh, jeez.

767
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,640
And now, the Texas Tornado will take on Mustafa, the evil one.

768
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,300
Yeah, that must be nice.

769
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,140
Good Lord, the large.

770
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,800
You can hardly convey it.

771
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,060
It's a form...

772
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,520
It's like madness, like in Wisconsin's Death Trip.

773
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,820
Did you ever read that book?

774
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,740
It was written by a guy.

775
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,480
It was his doctorate's thesis.

776
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,660
He took a small town in Wisconsin,

777
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,380
in the 1890s, just to see what people did,

778
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,780
if they had to make cheese or if they barbecued or anything like that.

779
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,800
And he found out that they were going crazy in successive waves.

780
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,820
People would come wandering out of the woods

781
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,980
and didn't know where they were.

782
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,800
They lynched an African-American barber

783
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,460
who had been, like, one of the pillars of the community,

784
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,420
and they just went nuts one day.

785
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,260
All of a sudden, they were big-time murderous racists

786
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,120
and everything like that.

787
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,340
There were all kinds of murders in it.

788
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,580
I think there were, like, 4,000 people in this one town,

789
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,020
and there were, like, 200 murders in one year.

790
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,360
So Wisconsin's always been like that.

791
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,780
Apparently.

792
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,540
The Florida of the North.

793
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,520
Yeah, upside down, like, kind of a cunnilingus bag,

794
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,300
you could say.

795
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,280
Yeah.

796
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,500
Yeah.

797
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:08,700
I don't know.

798
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,740
It's deep stuff, man.

799
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,900
Just like a deep state of mind-worrying, you know?

800
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:18,100
Well, what's scary is how fast a nice, friendly, small town,

801
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,100


802
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,100


803
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,100


804
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,100


805
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,200
can suddenly turn around and become a bunch of exiles

806
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,140
on Main Street, like that Twilight Zone

807
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,820
with the Rolling Stones in it,

808
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,480
where your neighbors all turn against each other

809
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,260
just out of pure fear, just because they're scared.

810
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,320
And there's, of course, by the end,

811
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,000
you find out the threat never existed.

812
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,140
The fear was created, as that was the real threat,

813
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,520
was just the fear of fear itself in the Twilight Zone.

814
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,100
Yeah.

815
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,600
And think of all those poor Jews in Germany that thought,

816
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,340
well, how bad can it get?

817
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,760
Our neighbors aren't going to, like, turn us in or imprison us.

818
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,080
Right.

819
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,260
A lot of people voted for him because they thought,

820
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,780
well, the same way that people think of Trump is like,

821
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,180
well, that's just the way he expresses himself.

822
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,800
That's just the way he is.

823
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,560
He's rambunctious or something, you know?

824
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,840
Yeah, just like the rest.

825
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,460
Just like us.

826
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,780
He talks like regular folks.

827
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,540
Ignorant.

828
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,780
Doesn't know a damn thing about what he's talking about.

829
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,600
But goddamn, he sure knows that he's right and everything else is wrong.

830
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,220
No matter what you say.

831
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
He's just like the rest of us.

832
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,640
Except that we're not actually all that way.

833
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,180
And we don't walk up and grab people by the country.

834
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,260
Or even talk that way.

835
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,940
Well, not in mixed company.

836
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,880
Not around humans.

837
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,380
It's perpendicular, man.

838
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,740
Humans.

839
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm sure it's crisis and so forth.

840
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,980
Yeah, it is perpendicular.

841
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,960
And parallel.

842
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,160
I started seeing those parallels three years ago

843
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,680
when all this stuff started up.

844
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,420
And I tried to warn him.

845
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,600
I tried to warn him.

846
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,240
I'm going to play my last year's Starwood rant in a week or two.

847
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,620
Then we won't have to do a show.

848
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,700
Because I already did that show.

849
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,480
But I think I vaguely remember going,

850
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,880
don't be so sure that everything's going to be normal.

851
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,800
Because sometimes things don't stay normal.

852
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,520
Sometimes they really do change.

853
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,640
Really change.

854
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,460
In ways that people don't even know is going on.

855
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,700
Most of those Germans had no idea what was being done to their Jewish neighbors.

856
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,240
No.

857
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,120
But the ones that did probably didn't say anything or kind of snickered.

858
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,320
Turned a blind eye.

859
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,880
Until they came for them, so to speak.

860
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,220
Right.

861
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,860
Just like, oh, it's my turn to take a ride on the train.

862
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,280
Oh.

863
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,440
When they came for the talking people, I didn't say anything.

864
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,620
Because I was mute.

865
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,420
But then they came for the mute.

866
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I wouldn't call you a mute, Stan.

867
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,720
No, that's a metaphor.

868
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,820
Your internal organs just don't pay attention when they're supposed to.

869
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,880
That's the way a little child is.

870
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,740
It needs sometimes ADHD and symphonic puberty forms.

871
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,020
He called me a child.

872
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,400
I didn't necessarily call you a child.

873
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,880
I called you a young teen.

874
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,660
A whip.

875
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,480
A whippet.

876
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:13,940
A whelp.

877
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,820
A whippa snapple.

878
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:15,920
Yeah.

879
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,380
That's, yeah.

880
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,520
I mean, you can advance and die on a foreskin if you'd like to, perhaps.

881
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,460
You know, that makes some sense to you.

882
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,280
If not, join the barbecue.

883
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,600
You're Mr. Austintown.

884
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,940
Mr. Flagrantes Stilektos of the Ubermensioners.

885
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,220
Hey, we're going to cut back to, I'm going to play some more Bob music now.

886
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,560
And now this.

887
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,800
I've got no money, but I've got no Bob.

888
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,200
Stuck to the carpet, he's stuck to the carpet.

889
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,660
I'm going to be a bar.

890
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,040
Wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

891
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,460
Instead of this church where my socks just rot

892
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,200
I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby

893
00:41:45,860 --> 00:42:10,960
I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby

894
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:41,200
I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby, I'm a fly baby

895
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,540
So that we'll have variety, you know, unlike usual.

896
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,940
Yes, you need contrast, you need air, you need collapsible vehicles, you need things that, you know,

897
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,400
that actually work if you're going to pay double for the guarantee.

898
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,760
Well, that reminds me of another Bob song about that very thing.

899
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,620
And here's The Pink Boys with Put Your Hands on the Radio.

900
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,880
I'll add the credits later.

901
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

902
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,780
Sunday morning, do you feel it?

903
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,500
You heard all over in your movie soul

904
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,620
Well, people, here's something that you should know

905
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,280
Tune us in on the radio now

906
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,860
We got charisma, we got style

907
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,100
Well, people, we'll make you feel better

908
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,520
It took for a while

909
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,180
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

910
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,460
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

911
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,140
A family doctor tells you you're just fine

912
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,660
But you feel so down all the time

913
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,280
Well, people, you don't have to worry

914
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,580
Just drop us a line

915
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,460
Send your money in on the double

916
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,720
Don't worry, it's deductible

917
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,200
Well, people, you can forget your money

918
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,960
Send us your money and get your troubles

919
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,000
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

920
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,160
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

921
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,600
If you're feeling lonely and confused

922
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,380
And you don't know what you're to do

923
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,100
And there's no candle left to burn

924
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,800
And you don't know which way to turn

925
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,400
We can help you out

926
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,480
Music

927
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,340
Music

928
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,200
Music

929
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,200


930
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,200


931
00:44:41,200 --> 00:45:11,200


932
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,420
trigging your heat

933
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,880
Little hurry all over and you're moving so

934
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,020
Well, people, here's something that you should know

935
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,620
Music

936
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,680
Tune us in on the radio now

937
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,400
We got charisma, we got style

938
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,740
Well, people, we'll make you feel better

939
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,900
It took for a while

940
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,600
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

941
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,840
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

942
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,680
Music

943
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,180
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio

944
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,180


945
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,060
Put your hands on the radio.

946
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,260
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

947
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,520
Will you just please stop doing cutaways and segways?

948
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,520
I mean, segways.

949
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,640
He's just preparing to do them, dear.

950
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:14,040
People used to like the show back when I spent three days editing each one-hour show

951
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:22,080
at the expense of my family being able to eat decently or wear clothing to school

952
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,560
because I was working so hard on hour slacks.

953
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,020
I don't do that anymore, but I want to pretend like I'm doing it.

954
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,820
Actually, Dave, this afternoon I had to pick music

955
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,360
that I thought the documentary...

956
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,500
that the documentary people should know about

957
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,200
because, you know, they are making a documentary

958
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,580
about the Church of the Subgenius.

959
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,400
I think they really are doing it.

960
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,320
I mean, it's this time it's going to happen.

961
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,540
There have been some flame-outs.

962
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,660
There was one that got made, but it was really lame,

963
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,520
and they didn't give me their footage.

964
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,280
And there was another one where not only did they not give me any of their footage,

965
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,200
but they never returned, they never showed.

966
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:05,760
They vanished.

967
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,420
With everything.

968
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,540
But this new group, which actually is connected to Subgenius

969
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,720
from the oldest, olden days,

970
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,600
I have high hopes.

971
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,460
I'm not telling them what's important in the story,

972
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,980
but they do have the complete story.

973
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,900
You are a model of sobriety,

974
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,380
so I can see you having high hopes or at least esperanzas.

975
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,040
But anyway, I was picking music that I thought,

976
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,540
before they find stuff on their own,

977
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,300
why don't I provide them with,

978
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,600
hey, the most popular Bob songs,

979
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,020
such as the Subgenius Anthem by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

980
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,600
There's fun and in it

981
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,340
When the trumpet calls X-Day

982
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,760
In a brother and sister band

983
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,100
When they blow the world away

984
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,020
We shall have paradise

985
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,760
Subgenie of the world unite

986
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,380
Alien sex

987
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,920
Every night

988
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,820
Subgenie of the world

989
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,480
Subgenie of the world

990
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,520
Subgenie of the world unite

991
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,020
Stand hand in hand

992
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,920
When the trumpet calls X-Day

993
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,020
In a brother and sister band

994
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,620
While they blow the world away

995
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:36,620


996
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,660
We shall have paradise

997
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,760
Subgenie of the world unite

998
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,140
Alien sex

999
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,700
Every night

1000
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,380
Subgenie of the world

1001
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,880
Subgenie of the world

1002
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,680
Subgenie of the world unite

1003
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,800
Oh, what a wonderful idea that is.

1004
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,920
What a beautiful, beautiful song.

1005
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,640
I remember when I first met the old welfare,

1006
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,820
the old cubby boy,

1007
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,280
and I think it was 1926,

1008
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,360
2012.

1009
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,380
Ah, what a great mistake it was.

1010
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,260
P-U.

1011
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,140
Exactly.

1012
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,520
Just my thoughts precisely.

1013
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,460
Fumigation was necessary.

1014
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,520
Yep, me too.

1015
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,140
I agree.

1016
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,840
I mean, I'd be the first to admit it

1017
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,740
that we got some pretty smelly aspersions around.

1018
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,840
Well, I also wanted to...

1019
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,440
Oh, you know what?

1020
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,680
I should give him...

1021
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,760
I hope this is okay with Chaz,

1022
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,500
but I should give him a witch disco.

1023
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:36,780
I'm gonna give him a witch disco.

1024
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,860
I'm gonna give him a witch disco.

1025
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:37,860


1026
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,380
Because I wanted to make sure

1027
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,200
they had lots of instrumental music.

1028
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,600
I'm largely thinking of the Rudy Schwartz project

1029
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,340
and the Psychoskeletons,

1030
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,200
who both do varied instrumentals

1031
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,400
that are kind of Zappa-esque

1032
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,440
without sounding Zappa-esque,

1033
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,840
and yet they're very original,

1034
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,460
but they're complex and cartoon music sounding, sort of.

1035
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,620
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And there's been a lot of... As I was going through my in-depth research,

1036
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,140
I've been thinking about the instrumental music collections by subgeniuses.

1037
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:16,420
There's quite a bit of really good, different, cartoony rugs

1038
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,020
that could be used for different sequences.

1039
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,060
Even I did some.

1040
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:21,980
Good-o.

1041
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,020
So...

1042
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,080
Well, you know, Witch Disco actually had a reviewer

1043
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,620
who was a part-time reviewer for Downbeat Magazine

1044
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,180
and gave that an A-plus in...

1045
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,240
Well, I believe Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1046
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,880
got Best Electronic Music in Cleveland one year.

1047
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,040
But that was the year before it stopped existing.

1048
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,020
Yeah, then the band kind of didn't exist anymore

1049
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,960
or changed shape so much that it...

1050
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,260
Well, ESO meant Extended Sexual Orgasm

1051
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,220
or Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1052
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,740
or any other things that E, S, and O could stand for.

1053
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,220
Oh, that's good.

1054
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,580
But, yeah, yeah.

1055
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,400
So, you know, there's a lot to think about

1056
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,060
in the world of subgenius music

1057
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,700
or music made by subgeniuses

1058
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,240
or rather noise made by subgeniuses,

1059
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,820
which they define as music

1060
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,860
or anti-music.

1061
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,040
But I prefer music myself.

1062
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,960
Listen, poor old Dave.

1063
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,680
Well, Dave, we're getting nigh up near the end of an hour

1064
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,340
of slack.

1065
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,720
And, uh...

1066
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,140
But that doesn't mean we have to quit.

1067
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,440
It means the listeners have to quit.

1068
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,560
The listeners have to know that this is the Hour of Slack

1069
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,700
from the Church of the Subgenius,

1070
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,940
which isn't just the three of us,

1071
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,500
Princess Wee, Reverend Stang,

1072
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,960
and our guest on the phone, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1073
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,680
There are others involved.

1074
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,560
And you can know that at subgenius.com.

1075
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,360
Does... yeah.

1076
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,320
And some of them are...

1077
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,900
Some are younger and better looking than Dave and me.

1078
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,660
I thought there was a good name for a whore.

1079
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,300
Some are younger than Princess Wee,

1080
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,220
but none are better looking than Princess Wee,

1081
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,860
who is in fact the most beautiful girl thing

1082
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,660
or any kind of creature

1083
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,800
that has ever roamed the entire known galaxy.

1084
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,240
Which we don't know much of the galaxy yet.

1085
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,440
What are you trying to get out of now?

1086
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,960
No, man.

1087
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,420
I've looked at a lot of porno

1088
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,920
and magazine pictures and TV shows and movies in my life,

1089
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,500
and Princess Wee remains the prettiest looking one I've ever seen.

1090
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,660
That's the truth.

1091
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,440
I know that what's wrong with you is that

1092
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,460
constantly examining pornographic materials.

1093
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,900
Well, you've got to make...

1094
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,840
You've got constantly reassuring myself

1095
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,540
that my wife is hotter than anybody.

1096
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,600
The set up is nice,

1097
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,060
and it's very wonderful for you to say that to your wife.

1098
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,140
I don't just look at porno.

1099
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,900
I look at...

1100
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,440
I was looking at botany websites today

1101
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,160
and all kinds of zoology.

1102
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,180
I double-check to make sure there aren't any animals

1103
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,100
or invertebrates even

1104
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,200
that might happen to be prettier than my wife.

1105
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,440
So far, they're not.

1106
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,820
All kinds of physical structures.

1107
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,940
All right, the physical structures.

1108
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,200
Yeah, I thought you were examining mothballs and butterflies.

1109
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,220
It turns out you're coming up with a new spiritual reality.

1110
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,040
No.

1111
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,380
We were examining mothballs and butterflies.

1112
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:34,980
Yes, we were.

1113
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,740
And what was it?

1114
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,900
Manly chestnuts.

1115
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,060
We were examining the kids.

1116
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,800
We didn't laugh,

1117
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,260
but I am familiar with this tractus treatis.

1118
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:48,960
Oh, yeah?

1119
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,520
You know about the manly chestnuts?

1120
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,880
Because I never could...

1121
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,620
I read the whole thing, but I'm aware of it.

1122
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,840
We couldn't get the kids to explain it to us.

1123
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,320
No.

1124
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,600
We were mystified.

1125
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,360
They were so excited about manly chestnuts.

1126
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,340
They went on and on about it.

1127
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,660
Yes.

1128
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,040
It became the mantra for hours.

1129
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,820
Kids latch onto things much quicker than their elderly parents and stuff

1130
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,560
and their grandparents.

1131
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,200
And subgeniuses are the same way.

1132
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,420
There's a cutting-edge social culture.

1133
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,500
Five-year-old kids.

1134
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:18,840
Yeah.

1135
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,880
Cutting-edge.

1136
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,060
Hey, look, there's a butt.

1137
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,840
When they saw our new Yeti statue, they thought...

1138
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,020
The first thing they noticed was that he didn't have any clothes on.

1139
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,480
I've got this new Yeti statue in the yard.

1140
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,460
It's only three feet tall.

1141
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:42,160
Well, what is the name of the iconic icon of the person exposing their derriere practically

1142
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
up their intestines at one time?

1143
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,800
What was that guy's name again?

1144
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,880
Manly P. Chestnut.

1145
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,120
No, no, no.

1146
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,680
The guy who told me...

1147
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,600
I don't know.

1148
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,700
Perhaps you were lying.

1149
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,940
I know you like to falsify your...

1150
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:00,480
Are you talking about Le Petit Main, the great artist who could perform concerts using crepitation?

1151
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:01,930
No.

1152
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,670
Well, yeah, he could do that, but he was more into flames and stuff like that.

1153
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,750
He didn't like fireworks to play or...

1154
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,190
No, no, no.

1155
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:17,050
Le Petit Main didn't shoot fire out of his butt because his crepitations were not made

1156
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,730
by digestion.

1157
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:25,870
He could inhale using his fundament and exhale in a very controlled way so that he could

1158
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:30,430
imitate, say, for instance, the ripping of a yard of gingham.

1159
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,650
And then he could...

1160
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:36,530
Using his butt, he could imitate, no, the Battle of Waterloo.

1161
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,530
You know, that was...

1162
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,910
I remember I used to attend all of his concerts.

1163
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,610
I have a couple of photograph albums of him.

1164
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,430
He was before photographs, Dave.

1165
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,770
He was before movies or recordings.

1166
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,310
This was in the late 1800s, I think.

1167
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,590
He was the biggest...

1168
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,290
He was the hottest show in Paris, I believe.

1169
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,410
Yes.

1170
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,150
He was the hottest show in his day.

1171
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:11,830
And he was so funny that audiences had to be treated for fainting and apoplexy because

1172
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,330
they'd laugh so hard, they'd have heart attacks.

1173
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,650
I can most certainly understand that.

1174
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,890
The Great Le Petit Main.

1175
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,470
The Great Le Petit Main.

1176
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:20,850
Brut.

1177
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,230
Okay, and with that, that's the end of the show.

1178
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,970
That was The Great Le Petit Main.

1179
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,270
The end, so to speak.

1180
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,650
Yes.

1181
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,410
But I never tire of listening to all of his shows.

1182
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:30,410


1183
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:30,410


1184
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,430
I never tire of watching him, you know, or talking to you about Le Petit Main and then

1185
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,250
his wonderful achievements.

1186
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,190
We saw something even better than Le Petit Main yesterday.

1187
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,650
A goat's head sticking out of a goat.

1188
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,650
Only not from the head end, from the back end.

1189
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,150
It was a push me, pull you.

1190
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,450
One of my brother's goats was having kids.

1191
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,470
A baby kid.

1192
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,530
It was having triplets.

1193
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:57,410
And the second one, the second one was stuck.

1194
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,390
Normally, they come out with their forelegs.

1195
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:01,770
and their head first.

1196
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,310
Well, this guy's forelegs were tucked back,

1197
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,090
so he was only just his head,

1198
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,170
and he couldn't get out.

1199
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,330
So my brother had to put on the blue rubber gloves

1200
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,490
and go give him a hand.

1201
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,650
But for about five or ten minutes there,

1202
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,110
there was a goat with a goat's head

1203
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,490
sticking out of its rump.

1204
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,950
Or vajayjay, actually, technically.

1205
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:22,570
Yes.

1206
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,530
But it's what a sight.

1207
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,330
Imagine that.

1208
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,610
A miniature goat sticking out of the inside

1209
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,010
of a larger goat.

1210
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,390
Stop and think about that, Dave,

1211
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,870
and let your appetite grow.

1212
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,090
Fabrito.

1213
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:44,110
1980s type of, you know, exacto blade art.

1214
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,050
Clip art.

1215
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:46,330
Exacto blade art.

1216
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,170
This is the real thing, baby.

1217
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,430
But about ten minutes later,

1218
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,970
there were three new baby goats

1219
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,730
making 34 new goats on Stang Ranch,

1220
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,710
where we sell religion and goats.

1221
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,170
Friends.

1222
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,530
So come on down to the

1223
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,090
Subgenius Destructionist Museum,

1224
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,790
Destructionist Evidence Museum,

1225
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,450
and Sanitarium,

1226
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,150
here in Stang'sville,

1227
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,830
near beautiful Blood Rose Texas.

1228
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,950
It's where you never have to worry why a goat.

1229
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,130
Subgenius.com.

1230
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,170
Praise Bob.

1231
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,910
I didn't know you were doing a rocket wave.

1232
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,170
Yeah, I was doing a rocket wave.

1233
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,150
I need to give some kind of credits

1234
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,370
for the music that we,

1235
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,430
the people who played in the background.

1236
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,170
It was a collection of instrumentals

1237
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,850
assembled by Potter Nostril.

1238
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,010
And I believe that we heard

1239
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,730
Dave Greenslade, Anvil, Jeff Beck,

1240
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:49,010
Lorena McKinnet, Mashmakan, or the letter F,

1241
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:53,510
Danny Elfman, Coliseum, Nucleus, Jeff Beck,

1242
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,170
Terrace Garden, Nash the Slash, Vangelis,

1243
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:00,090
Link Wray, Sidewinder, The Groundhogs, Colin Linden,

1244
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,030
and Camel.

1245
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,670
Praise Craig.

1246
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:05,870
I actually have no idea where we are on that list

1247
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,070
or if we heard any of those,

1248
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,150
but it was something like that.

1249
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,830
But now that we've recorded so damn much stuff

1250
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:12,910
that there's no time to play any of those songs

1251
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:13,670
I was going to play.

1252
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,510
So I guess we better just talk about,

1253
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,730
we better talk about how they better send their 35 bucks in

1254
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,690
because that part of the show,

1255
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,710
that other part, the legal part's over.

1256
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,230
This is the illegal part of the show.

1257
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,710
Dave, tell them what they need to know.

1258
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,750
What they can get?

1259
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:29,490
Yeah.

1260
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,070
Is that a good idea?

1261
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,130
Well, Seborrhea for one thing,

1262
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:36,270
mild laxative at best,

1263
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,070
at least 300 pounds a week of phosphorescent,

1264
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,210
pho, pho, phosphorescent donuts or,

1265
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:44,690
Pho, pho.

1266
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,850
Have you ever tried?

1267
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,470
Pho, pho.

1268
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,830
Phosphorescent donuts sound really fun.

1269
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,110
Vietnamese pho, but they call it pho.

1270
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:58,650
No, no, no.

1271
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,830
It's the Church of the Subgenius membership pack.

1272
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,750
That's what they want is the membership pack.

1273
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,270
It's got that little minister's card

1274
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,010
that says you can do anything.

1275
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,790
You can do real marriages.

1276
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,590
You're really a minister.

1277
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,470
If you want to go to enough trouble,

1278
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,510
you could probably write it off on your taxes,

1279
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,810
but that's a lot of trouble.

1280
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,990
We don't do that, most of us.

1281
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:24,810
We just hitch people and bitch at people.

1282
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,410
That's what preachers are for.

1283
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,830
And you can be a preacher too, friend.

1284
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:30,370
It's not just the little card.

1285
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:35,110
You get a really nice 30-piece set of documents,

1286
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,210
bumper stickers, a pin.

1287
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:42,230
Yes, a metal pin with Bob's logo on it and face.

1288
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,510
11 by 17 documents suitable for framing.

1289
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,650
Suitable for framing like crazy.

1290
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,530
They're all over this house.

1291
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,830
Both my parents were subgeniuses.

1292
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,330
Very proud.

1293
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:57,810
So anyway, yeah, that's the post office.

1294
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,310
Box 14...

1295
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,150
Yeah.

1296
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:00,970
Wait, wait.

1297
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:06,010
No, until May, it's box 807,

1298
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:09,190
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1299
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:13,290
After that, it's P.O. Box 181-417,

1300
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,490
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1301
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,550
Ah, yes.

1302
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:22,430
It's so righteous.

1303
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:27,230
So beautiful to get down with Bob.

1304
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:32,350
Sit down in that barber chair he kick out for you.

1305
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,250
Let him give you a haircut.

1306
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,130
I'll cut them a shave.

1307
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,130
You'll never have to work again.

1308
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:43,190
You'll be a bum, but you'll be a happy, happy bum.

1309
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:45,710
You'll be the happiest old bum out on the street

1310
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:49,430
because you got the haircut that Bob Dobbs gave you, buddy.

1311
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:50,850
Praise Bob.

1312
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,190
Praise that old Bob.

1313
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,910
Praise, praise him.

1314
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,410
Oh, yes, I'll praise him.

1315
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,170
Praise him.

1316
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,010
Praise him.

1317
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,570
Oh, yeah.

1318
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,910
That's the old-time feeling.

1319
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:08,030
It's the good old slack feeling

1320
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,510
coming from the church of the subgenius.

1321
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,530
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1322
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:16,370
Just feel that slack wash over you

1323
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:23,710
like a warm, warm ocean of heated jelly, Vaseline.

1324
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:26,530
It's like rolling and lolling around

1325
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:31,590
on an ocean made of giant, human, female mammary breasts.

1326
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:33,710
Just think of it, friend.

1327
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,890
You could have all of that for just $35.

1328
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,150
But you can't wear it in public unless you have a special permit,

1329
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,510
which is only $30 once it's good.

1330
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,570
PayPal, credit cards.

1331
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,150
You can mail us a check to that post office boxes I just gave.

1332
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:54,530
We'll be back in Cleveland after May 15th.

1333
01:02:54,650 --> 01:03:00,030
And friends, you can just get down in there with Bob.

1334
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,690
Just right down in there.

1335
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,730
Warm and close and snugly.

1336
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:10,030
Sure, that pipe smoke is a bit cloying,

1337
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:14,050
and his body odor can be rank at times,

1338
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,810
but you're in his protection.

1339
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,770
Not his pro-tection.

1340
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,850
His purr-tection.

1341
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,110
He loves you.

1342
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,710
It just feels so good.

1343
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,250
And Bob can be rough sometimes,

1344
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:30,010
so you'd better watch out and pull and hold his pully little snout.

1345
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,590
You'd better be happy.

1346
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:32,730
You'd better not cry,

1347
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:36,350
or you'll have to kick Bob in his left . . .

1348
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:36,650
. . .

1349
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,550
Okay, well, we're going to be flyballing away now.

1350
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:44,150
That's all 60 minutes used up.

1351
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:45,850
That's done.
