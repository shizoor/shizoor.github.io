00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,100
Hello?

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,020

137
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,020

You've got one of the less romantic ones

151
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,840
Not that revenge is often emotive in these cases, of course

152
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,280
It's usually just the impulse of a man whose sex re-offered track

153
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh, no, no

154
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,260
No need to be alarmed

155
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,240
They invariably get their satisfaction at the other end of the telephone

156
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,960
By shocking you, making you gasp

157
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,700
The intake of your breath is like a kiss

158
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,400
Huh?

159
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,620
Come on, now

160
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,560
You haven't been able to fool your Aunt Bea since you were two

161
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Well, it's just some stupid thing that's been happening, really

162
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,020
Strange man's been calling me on the telephone

163
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,720
Yeah, another thing

164
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,880
Just like with the subgenius minister

165
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,580
You know, Gordon?

166
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,040
You know about, you know

167
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,840
You know about how the conspiracy is like a sinister fiendish entity?

168
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,420
That is what they are

169
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,900
Even though they're like compulsive individuals

170
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,860
They are like one organism

171
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,260
And they're all over

172
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,960
Like the size of a tentacle that's growing

173
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,800
That represents the Khan

174
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,680
That's what they are, even though they're individuals

175
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,120
It's like, they're like one big sinister organism

176
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,460
And if you're not one of them, they're out to get you

177
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,600
And they're targeting me

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,660
And they're trying to take a piece out of me like that

179
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,100
Then this doctor, Colton Rain

180
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,240
Who drilled my tooth unnecessarily down to a nerve

181
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,860
Because after he failed to keep the fillings in my teeth

182
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,240
And now the company, the Medicaid company

183
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,300
Is telling me that

184
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,340
Hi, I'm a trained professional just waiting for you

185
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,280
If you're ready to take your life

186
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,140
It's time to put yourself first

187
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,740
You can call the number on your screen

188
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,220
We're waiting to hear from you

189
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,940
I won't call again, I promise

190
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,960
What the hell are you?

191
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,900
What the hell are you?

192
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,260
Hello? Increase the output

193
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,320
Yeah, if you can just slap yourself awake

194
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,480
That's the main thing we're trying to do

195
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,100
If we can reach just 10 unsaved individuals out there

196
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,840
And get them to notice the schematics

197
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
To surf the line

198
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:53,600


199
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:53,860
That they're not just a block plane

200
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,300
As Bob refers to it

201
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,880
If you can just find a way to recognize the two conspiracy theories

202
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,540
Listen, you're on the right track

203
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,580
The answer is, you have the answer

204
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,160
Take the slack

205
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,380
It's yours

206
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,500
You didn't recognize it because

207
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,440
The conspiracy had you looking for something

208
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,220
More expensive and more complicated

209
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,880
I'd like to read some words

210
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,320
That many satisfied

211
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,580
Church members with

212
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,220
We've got piles of mail every day

213
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,440
This reader said

214
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,920
Suddenly it's girls, girls, girls

215
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,100
Boy, your book, Things to See, Say and Do

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,880
Is great

217
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,740
We have gospel missions all over the country

218
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,360
This is true

219
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,800
People don't understand quite how large

220
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,280
And dangerous an organization

221
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,100
The Church of the Subgenius is

222
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,260
It's, you've heard of the Moonies

223
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,860
The Scientologists, the Christians

224
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,560
This is a very important book

225
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:53,560


226
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,720
Better than each of those individually

227
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,580
But worse than all of them put together

228
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,760
There really are subgeniuses everywhere

229
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,380
Our mailing list is doubling

230
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,900
Every couple of weeks

231
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,920
And the power

232
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,560
The power of abnormality

233
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,860
I think

234
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,820
Will eventually be felt

235
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,540
In the guts of all those

236
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,720
Complacent people out there

237
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
Those who are

238
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,460
Who are afraid of change

239
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
Listen to that young Noah

240
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,540
Who is afraid of change?

241
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,460
Yes, he seems to think

242
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,380
He's got the world by the oysters

243
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,620
Try to

244
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,260
You can tell he hasn't had that

245
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,300
Deviated septum operated on yet

246
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,660
And he obviously doesn't have that

247
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Hap, hap, happy day feeling

248
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,300
Don't worry folks, he's really

249
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,060
What? Yeah, I know, he's really

250
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,720
We're gonna run an ID check to see

251
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
Which is the real Stang?

252
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,180
The happy-go-lucky

253
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,780
Mature Stang

254
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,260
Who's not all bit embittered by

255
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,340
Life, oddly enough

256
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,800
Well, you know some

257
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,580
Some people really like

258
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,100
The mature Stang

259
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,180
I mean, there's a lot

260
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,140
Yeah, really

261
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,180
I mean, do I have to draw you a picture?

262
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,180
I mean, it's kind of

263
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,540
I fill out every flyaway card there is in that thing

264
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,680
Yeah, it's off-putting, frankly

265
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,240
I saw a magazine on the stands

266
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,700
It was like 50 plus Stang

267
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,400
Yes, exactly

268
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,260
Like for people who like mature

269
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,860
And the Stang films

270
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,460
They're not, of course

271
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,320
Actual films, nothing is anymore

272
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,880
But they're called Stang films

273
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,260
And they, uh

274
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,140
They're shown, yeah

275
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
Now that I'm verified

276
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,120
See, these are shown at

277
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,000
Bachelor parties and

278
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,260
Secret to

279
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,860
Access granted

280
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,280
The amount of Stang

281
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,100
Associated with each one of them

282
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,360
Is debatable, but

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
That's the tradition

284
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,000
Now we're going to take you back

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,100
To a time when life was

286
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,540
Longer, shorter, and some would say

287
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,440
Sweeter, hot and merry

288
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,160
When the devil took the hindmost

289
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,920
Yes, who needed

290
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,180
Doctors and dentists

291
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,720
Look at that devil's hindmost

292
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,500
She's gorgeous

293
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,720
And most people would say

294
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,060
Great day in the morning

295
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,320
Great day in the morning

296
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,580
Now I feel alive

297
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,100
Ready to challenge

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,260
The world as a

299
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,060
Newly ordained overman

300
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,280
Ah, yes

301
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,840
Dear friends

302
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,500
The smoke of that pipe goes up

303
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,760
Against the morning sky

304
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,880
Higher than the zenith

305
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,200
The smoke of that burning

306
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,860
Goes up forever

307
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,800
Puff, puff, puff, puff

308
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,300
This is no mere puffery, friends

309
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,280
The pipe of thoughtfulness

310
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,020
This is the real thing

311
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,360
The pipe of planning

312
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,660
The pipe of piquance

313
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,840
And pusillanimity

314
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,540
The pipe of thoughtfulness

315
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:53,540


316
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,420
This is the pipe of destiny

317
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,780
Um, hold on while I look up those words

318
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,840
I always get those

319
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,760
Confused

320
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,900
Piquant and pusillanimous

321
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,620
And pusillaginous

322
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
Is it true that you guys have the

323
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,860
Pipe that bears Christ's side

324
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,680
The critters what use this

325
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,400
Pipe they've got great

326
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,940
Pouissance

327
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,440
The puissance as well as the

328
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,880
Pouissance

329
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,120
The three Ps of perfect

330
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,500
Pipe placement

331
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,140
That class by Dr. Filodrum

332
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,740
Will be available online

333
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Rich Burley

334
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,280
Or Rum Soaked Shag

335
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,500
Oh, someone's at the door

336
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,400
Just a moment

337
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,620
I love these dob stores

338
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,260
Whenever I get depressed at work

339
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,700
I just walk into a dob store

340
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,000
They're so big and confusing

341
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,960
And I can't find a sales person

342
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,660
You know this kind of is against

343
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,480
The whole thing that Bob was originally about

344
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
What, what? He was a salesman

345
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,900
Yeah, but he was an individual salesman

346
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,300
It just fixes you

347
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,420
This is no good

348
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,980
This isn't subgenius

349
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,440
This is on the site of the original

350
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,080
X-Day

351
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,160
Oh, look at the flying saucer

352
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,900
Hey, do you have two quarters?

353
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,160
I want to try that one

354
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,500
The Bob and Connie mom and pop stores

355
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,100
You know kids

356
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,580
I'm gonna see you over by Connie's World

357
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,620
About 4 o'clock

358
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm gonna go try this out

359
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,940
See, who knows?

360
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,040
It's not worth it

361
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,960
You'll wait for like an hour and a half

362
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,080
And then it's like five minutes up Connie and out Connie

363
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,940
Oh, that's not very slackful

364
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,960
So you sail up Connie

365
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,080
And kind of swirl around

366
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,160
And then you sail out

367
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,900
How about the Midway?

368
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,780
Is that worth visiting?

369
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,080
That's the cool part

370
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,900
Because the people watching

371
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,360
The arcades and stuff are pretty

372
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,520
Like most amusement parks

373
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,440
But watching the subgeniuses

374
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,340
You can just sit there

375
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,880
And people watch

376
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,040
Or rather

377
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,660
People, yeah people

378
00:18:59,560 --> 00:18:59,940
Subgenius watch

379
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,840
You don't mean very special people

380
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,700
Yeah

381
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,540
We like to

382
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,960
That's the polite way of putting it

383
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,720
Now boys

384
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,800
In the Bible it says

385
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,580
He who looketh upon the two-headed geek

386
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,240
Becomes himself

387
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,820
A horrible freak

388
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,720
Where is Hal doing?

389
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,200
I have come to declare

390
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,960
The story that manipulate

391
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,880
Our sins

392
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:35,880


393
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,900
Any way

394
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,460
Let us master

395
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,060
Your god

396
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,700
So Jehovah

397
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,540
You're a complete

398
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:53,540


399
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
to have our God who made our minds impacted

400
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,140
by the Jesus whom we know as your people.

401
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,740
Be it now.

402
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
Oh, come on.

403
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh, that Bible video game.

404
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,200
I like that boss monster that you have to fight at the very end.

405
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,440
Jehovah.

406
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,480
For Am I Not Jehovah-thon.

407
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:37,580
Now, in the subgenius video game, Jehovah One is the first boss monster

408
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,340
that you fight after you have befriended Bob.

409
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,440
Once you have befriended Bob, you have to first beat

410
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,400
and then befriend a whole series of minor boss monsters.

411
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,600
There's like puzzling evidence.

412
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,580
And that's part of your war on God thing.

413
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,080
The overman.

414
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,300
Yeah.

415
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,580
And each one has weaknesses and powers.

416
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,560
Like Doc Frop's power, of course, is Frop,

417
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,740
and his weakness is Pussycats.

418
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,260
You know what I don't like is in this subgenius movie, though,

419
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,520
is how they talk about slack, but they just beat you over the head with it

420
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,340
for the whole three hours.

421
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,540
And it's not really very slackful.

422
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,100
Yeah.

423
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,460
Preaching.

424
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,320
And it's...

425
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,400
And it's...

426
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,660
Well, if they had slack, they wouldn't want to watch the movie, would they?

427
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,120
I mean, we can't give them slack.

428
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,180
They gotta watch the movie.

429
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,340
Well, that's why we switched it to a video game.

430
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,220
Because everybody already knows the plot.

431
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,760
Okay.

432
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,280
X-Day.

433
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,020
That's the plot.

434
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,340
So...

435
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,860
You go out...

436
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,340
Talk about having to jump into this lake of fire.

437
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,580
Oh.

438
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,840
That's gross.

439
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,920
Hot enough for you?

440
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,620
You can tell the fire's superimposed, but that guy's really burning up.

441
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,460
That's not makeup.

442
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,460
No.

443
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,700
And there's no way to make this up.

444
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,120
How do you make up with Satan, anyway?

445
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,960
Well, some would say we never split from Satan,

446
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
who has gotten a bad rap all the way,

447
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,400
as have all who have trod the left-hand path.

448
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,780
The question is, are we agents of the left-hand or the right-hand path?

449
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,260
We're the ambidextrous path.

450
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,440
We're the path of least resistance.

451
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,080
That's right.

452
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,900
That's right.

453
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,500
I've heard...

454
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,180
Princess Wee's been reading her prescriptures.

455
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,780
The path of least...

456
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,520
When was the last time we dwelled morbidly on the path of least resistance?

457
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:36,880
Perhaps when the shining path of least resistance was visiting or calling you in the middle of a packing crisis at X-Day.

458
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,100
Woo-hoo!

459
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,440
No, but the...

460
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,820
That used to be synonymous with the luck plane.

461
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,900
Yes.

462
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,700
So many have forgotten the original, true teachings of Bob.

463
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,240
And they follow all this apocalypse.

464
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,120
Superful garbage, basically.

465
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,260
This crappy computer-generated fake Bob stuff that wouldn't fool a three-year-old.

466
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,900
Dada.

467
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,280
Oh, except that one.

468
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,660
We don't want to disabuse.

469
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,660
You know, he who mocks the infant's faith shall be mocked in age and death.

470
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,920
Praise God.

471
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,380
Wow.

472
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,460
And one that's not funny.

473
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,680
People tend to forget the role of Bob in toilet training.

474
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,860
All right, now I'm not going to go much further.

475
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,120
Burn in the background.

476
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,040
Yeah.

477
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,880
After all, this isn't a juvenile daycare center.

478
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,500
Exactly.

479
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,100
It's not.

480
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,240
I mean, I kind of thought it was.

481
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,140
I thought it was the...

482
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,980
In a way.

483
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,280
Well, no, this is the subgenius elder daycare center.

484
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,960
Yeah.

485
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,620
And when they get old, we push them out into the cold wind.

486
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,980
Hey, what you doing?

487
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,660
Who are you pushing?

488
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,320
Sorry, Hal.

489
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,300
Thanks for your help.

490
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,940
What are you doing?

491
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,360
Just slam the door down.

492
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,120
This ice floor is cold.

493
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,360
And they slowly...

494
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,180
They don't feel a thing.

495
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,760
I remember Flo.

496
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,580
She was cold as ice.

497
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,760
I feel like a...

498
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,160
Just tell them, look, out there in the white, that's X-Day.

499
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,100
Those are my bunions.

500
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,960
I got chill blades and...

501
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,680
I complained because it was hot and mysterious.

502
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,000
And then they moved it to the North Pole.

503
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,940
And then I met a man who had no shoes and he took mine.

504
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,480
Look, there he is now.

505
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,280
I forget.

506
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,160
Do I live here?

507
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,220
Just a pile of flies.

508
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,580
These aren't ordinary flies.

509
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,400
These are the porbo flies of the Congo Basin.

510
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,620
They swarm in the hundreds of thousands in the tropical heat and moisture,

511
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,700
creating almost unbearable conditions.

512
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,880
They lay their eggs in the exit wounds of U.S. presidents.

513
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,120
From their...

514
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:57,520
They hatch and fly around carrying the little footballs,

515
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,200
those carrying cases for nuclear weapon initiation.

516
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,580
The red button is in that briefcase.

517
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,200
They watch those red-headed comedians from the past.

518
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,500
Handcuffs each of those African flies.

519
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,540
In Hatari, also starring Red Button.

520
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,620
Oh, here they are now.

521
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,980
A giant swarm...

522
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,040
...covering the sun.

523
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,260
Stinging, biting, leaving nothing alive.

524
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Driving animals, birds, hippopotamuses, crocs, all to madness.

525
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,900
In insanity and agony, they dash themselves to pieces on the rocks.

526
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,720
But those flies make a pretty good soup, if you can catch enough of them.

527
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,780
Yes, you...

528
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,460
Waiter, there aren't enough flies in my soup.

529
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:47,980
Right.

530
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,440
Yes, I've heard...

531
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:49,800
Flies.

532
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,220
...soup.

533
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,860
African fly soup.

534
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,740
Ah, you're a lousy idiot.

535
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,200
You know, today, folks...

536
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,500
Fly flan, I've heard, is very...

537
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,660
Fly flan?

538
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,380
Fly flan.

539
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,060
Those flans have flown.

540
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,920
A flea and a fly in a flue.

541
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,720
Maggot Jam.

542
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,520
They're imprisoned, so what could they do?

543
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,720
Said the flea, let us fly.

544
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,760
Said the fly, let us flee.

545
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,740
A little too much show there.

546
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,140
So they flew through a flaw in the flue.

547
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,320
What's he doing?

548
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,580
Oh, nothing.

549
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,600
I thought you said this wasn't the daycare center for the so-called...

550
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,100
I was just...

551
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,500
Just wool gathering, all right?

552
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,400
I can't be as sharp as I was when I was a young sprat.

553
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,500
All oafishly full of bounce and bobance.

554
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,060
Vim vigor and vitality.

555
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,240
Youthful zest.

556
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,700
That is...

557
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,200
Oh, look at that.

558
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,840
Well, that settles that controversy.

559
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,160
As friends, UFOs are real.

560
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,160
This photograph...

561
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,180
Landing in the desert.

562
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,960
This is the clearest UFO photo ever.

563
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,580
Say goodbye to those blurry...

564
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,980
UFO photo.

565
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,220
Well, we just...

566
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,800
It just came in on the inter-roster.

567
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,120
Look.

568
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,520
Look.

569
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,100
See?

570
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,020
The radio listeners can't see the laptop.

571
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,200
See?

572
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,760
That settles that controversy.

573
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,860
Now we know.

574
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,960
We know for sure.

575
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,360
They are landing.

576
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,320
They are landing in the desert.

577
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,340
I, Princess Biardo, have just seen...

578
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,360
That is a very fabulous photograph of a...

579
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,000
And she's the queen of all UFOs.

580
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,740
And they went to meet you, Burning Man.

581
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,140
Burning Man?

582
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,080
Well, I...

583
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,700
A spaceship.

584
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,660
Yeah.

585
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,920
A UFO.

586
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,120
I don't like Burning Man ever since they moved it to that desert.

587
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,620
A spaceship from another world.

588
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,300
They don't have any toilets.

589
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,280
There's giant interstellar...

590
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,300
Wiener-eating spiders that take all your beanie-weenies.

591
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,840
One of my many subjects.

592
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
You'll just have to cozy up to them.

593
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,800
To them, you're the monster.

594
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,540
We're standing over Burning Man's little body.

595
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,280
Yeah, it's like the Colossus of toads.

596
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,240
I mean, roads.

597
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,540
All roads lead here.

598
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,560
Where the blackened, bleached bones of toads erode in the desert.

599
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,160
There's a UFO.

600
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,600
There's a UFO again, yeah.

601
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,620
That one's not as convincing somehow.

602
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,560
Little Burning Man.

603
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,320
Well...

604
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,480
I see, yes, but...

605
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,160
Oh, I thought that was the surface of Mars.

606
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,020
Like the village of the Potawatomi Indians.

607
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,720
Oh, Burning the Burning...

608
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,820
It's a little Burning Man.

609
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,500
A giant bagel in the foreground distracts from credibility, but...

610
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,280
But...

611
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,360
I should have another festival called Drowning Woman.

612
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,060
By Yostar.

613
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,100
And some say they will again.

614
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:39,020
But it really is a shame that all these festivals coincide with about the same time, so...

615
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh my gosh, what a conflagration.

616
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,100
Look at it burn.

617
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,320
It burns me up.

618
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,920
It's relaxing, though.

619
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,540
I happen to go from X-Day to Starwood to Burning Man.

620
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,720
That is hot.

621
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,260
And back again.

622
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,080
And they burn a man at every one of them.

623
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,260
It bangs.

624
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:52,920
It bangs.

625
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,000
The only one where they hide the man is Starwood.

626
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,120
The man is deep inside the big bonfire.

627
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,740
Really?

628
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,520
So you can't see him.

629
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
Well, it's that basket...

630
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,160
You know, meditational and stuff?

631
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,180
Basket man.

632
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,940
No, he's the dude with the plan to stick it to the man.

633
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,540
Oh, I see.

634
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,120
It's not an art.

635
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,940
It's a religion.

636
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,400
He's a tough cop.

637
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,760
Your dude is here.

638
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,480
Oh, who?

639
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,480
Oh.

640
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,440
Basket case man.

641
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,860
What was that?

642
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,920
The Nicolas Cage.

643
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,820
Yeah, right.

644
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,280
Nicolas Cage is splatting it.

645
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,260
That's based on Starwood, of course.

646
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,580
The freakout?

647
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,360
The George Lucas?

648
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,020
Well, they always pick...

649
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,560
Yeah, George Lucas is Starwood 4.

650
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,300
What is it that you think that you're talking about?

651
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,180
Because there is no such thing in the Starwood bonfire.

652
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,280
Starwood, beautiful Starwood, beautiful Starwood, flying through space.

653
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,020
Yeah, exactly.

654
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,620
That's exactly what it's like, folks.

655
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,260
And the drugs and the LSD.

656
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,180
Yeah.

657
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,940
Freakouts.

658
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,560
Starwood.

659
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,780
And the body painting and the nose rings.

660
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,020
And Darth Vader.

661
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,000
And the patchouli.

662
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,320
Yeah, it's beautiful.

663
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,720
Where Reverend Stang speaks.

664
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,600
And everyone listens, unlike X-Day.

665
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,880
Don't kid.

666
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,780
That's all too accurate.

667
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,120
Those subgeniuses, they come there and they just socialize.

668
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,760
They don't listen to our sermons.

669
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,660
No, we sit there talking for ten hours.

670
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,160
At that picnic table.

671
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,000
And the microphones with PAs and everything.

672
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,040
But then he goes to Starwood and these pagans listen intently with thoughtful expressions.

673
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,140
Oh, they take notes.

674
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,080
They laugh whenever we hold up the laugh sign.

675
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,380
They laugh at all the jokes.

676
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,680
You really don't need to coach.

677
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,700
And they buy stuff afterwards.

678
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,140
Yeah, they buy the swag.

679
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,440
Subgeniuses are utterly worthless bums.

680
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,100
I need to save my money for beer.

681
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,420
Yeah, I know.

682
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
That's what they're like.

683
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,760
You know, these bobbies.

684
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,560
Can you buy me some beer?

685
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,160
I've got the money for it.

686
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,960
Not now, kid.

687
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,460
I'm busy.

688
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,160
Can't you see I'm broadcasting here?

689
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,140
In fact, I was just talking about how unreliable this generation of dweebs is that's come up.

690
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:12,080
They just don't have the pizzazz that subgeniuses did back in the day when we were so wild and wiggy.

691
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,860
Does somebody have a sentence?

692
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,540
Let's go to the D5.

693
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,420
Yeah, I'm going.

694
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,380
Are you going?

695
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,620
Back in them days, you had to sneak around to smoke your froth.

696
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,400
They didn't just shove it in your face and make you smoke.

697
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,420
Well, I missed count stock, and then I was there for froth stock, too.

698
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,720
But I missed froth stock one.

699
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,700
I was the laughing stock.

700
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,160
Froth stock one.

701
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah.

702
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,960
Froth stock.

703
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,540
I told myself I had to stop.

704
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,420
Then and then.

705
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,200
So I stopped.

706
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,860
That was the, was that one?

707
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,040
No, two, in effect.

708
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,340
Froth stock four.

709
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,880
It's 81 debiable as, in my mind, as a dock stock.

710
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,200
It isn't really, but it is.

711
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,080
Well, in these films we're watching, it looks harmless and innocent, but it doesn't show what it is.

712
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,460
It does. It really does.

713
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,960
Because it's the first time the conclave, it's the first time I see everybody in one place.

714
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
It was the world, yeah, it was the first world subgenius convention.

715
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:16,400
And then the second one in my mind is that sternos lair, where we just took a whole evening to destroy his piano.

716
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,400
Wow.

717
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,240
And I have on video.

718
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,940
The moment where he comes in and says, hey, my piano.

719
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,200
Now, see, back in them days, we said demons destroyed real pianos.

720
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,340
They didn't do it with a video game or a computer-generated piano.

721
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,180
But they just, right, of course, it looks and sounds better on the computer version.

722
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:35,760
Yep.

723
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,440
And it wasn't virtual.

724
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,480
It's not girl's name.

725
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,240
Yep.

726
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,700
And you could go to Conway and get tea, which I would do a lot.

727
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Conway Twitty?

728
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,240
Conway Arkansas.

729
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,020
Conway.

730
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,660
Reverend Conway Twitty.

731
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,600
But.

732
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,780
Yeah.

733
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:48,840
Yeah.

734
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,840


735
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,840


736
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,840


737
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,840


738
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,840


739
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:48,840


740
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,280
The earliest.

741
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,260
Like Reverend Roy Orbison.

742
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,420
I recognize him from the sunglasses right away.

743
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,280
And Reverend Buddy Holly.

744
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,980
All those guys are still alive, friends, but living under false identities in pure slack, thanks to Bob.

745
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,420
Meanwhile, here's another track from Full Frontal Klugman by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

746
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,100
A song called Blood Freak.

747
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,300
Incidentally, the female voice you'll hear is that of Popes Pantiera Ivakovich.

748
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:44,700
A song called Blood Freak.

749
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,620
A song called Blood Freak.

750
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:47,620


751
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:47,620


752
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:54,420
I could use a husky man like you out at my motor farm.

753
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,740
Out at my motor farm.

754
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,460
Oh my God, Herschel.

755
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,600
I just can't believe you're here like this.

756
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,260
Do you think the effect of that turkey meat will wear off?

757
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:15,680
Because...

758
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,980
God damn, Herschel, you sure are ugly.

759
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,940
But it's not so bad if I don't look at you.

760
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,640
I don't know.

761
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,380
I don't know.

762
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:28,400
I don't know.

763
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,580
I don't know.

764
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,240
I don't know.

765
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,080
I don't know.

766
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,860
I don't know.

767
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,180
I don't know.

768
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,120
I don't know.

769
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,140
I don't know.

770
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,740
I don't know.

771
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,380
I don't know.

772
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,160
I don't know.

773
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,180
I don't know.

774
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,480
I don't know.

775
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,360
I don't know.

776
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:41,960
I don't know.

777
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,920
I don't know.

778
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,900
Herschel?

779
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm sorry.

780
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,640
You know, I've got a guilty feeling that this is all my fault.

781
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,200
What will our children think of their dad?

782
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,180
What will our children look like?

783
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,200
I guess the pretty girl is stuck with the monster she created.

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
We live in a world in which there is a constant change.

785
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,300
Every second, every minute, every hour, changes take place.

786
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,620
These changes are perhaps invisible to us because our level of awareness is limited.

787
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,200
Take for example...

788
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,620
How the things we do and say to the people we meet.

789
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,060
All these things affect our lives.

790
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,060
It kills our destiny.

791
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,640
We never know how or when we will meet a person who will become a catalyst.

792
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,480
What is a catalyst?

793
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,140
Well, in this case, a catalyst is a person that will bring about change.

794
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,380
They could be good or bad.

795
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
But there will be changes.

796
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,440
They could be bad or good.

797
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:26,020
Every second, every minute, every hour, changes take place.

798
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,220
Hoist the junkies from a tree.

799
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:40,540
Slit their throats to catch their spark-laced blood.

800
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:52,260
A child is raised to feed the mute and the sick.

801
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:05,560
I could use a husky baby like you and hold her far away...

802
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,480
And hold her far away...

803
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,580
ön smelling perk tee.

804
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,700
Bj Herzor.

805
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:15,580
I could use a husky man like you

806
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,020
Out in my poultry farm

807
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,240
Out in my poultry farm

808
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,840
Come on out to my poultry farm

809
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:36,080
Out in my poultry farm

810
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm physically and verbally abusing players during PR's practice.

811
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
PR's gay practice.

812
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,040
Which coincides with President Obama speaking out against Colorado to drum up construction.

813
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,660
A survey by the payroll processor states this is PR News.

814
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,080
A woman is postponed.

815
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,100
She might be responsible for the murders of two PR News.

816
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
On Wall Street.

817
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,240
377-666-555-444-321.

818
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,340
A federal prosecutor in Houston is due to appear in court today.

819
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,120
Meanwhile, the Institute says this is PR News in Washington.

820
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,820
Heaven and hell.

821
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,500
Yes.

822
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,660
I tried to get a concept.

823
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,640
And big brain.

824
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Have our.

825
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,560
That's fascinating.

826
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,500
Now, now.

827
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,500
Uh, send.

828
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,080
Uh, and, uh, and, uh, uh, that's, uh, um, Jesus Christ.

829
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,460
Mm.

830
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:48,760
The, uh, you know, even the, in the Jesus Christ, uh, the, uh, Jesus, um, or Jesus Christ.

831
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,260
Mm.

832
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,020
And Jesus me.

833
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,020
And, and, and, and, um, uh, to, uh, uh, was to.

834
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:56,440
Mm.

835
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,020
Mm.

836
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,540
Uh, in a, in a, uh, Satan himself.

837
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:00,980
Mm.

838
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,700
In a huge house.

839
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:01,880
In a huge house.

840
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,700
Overlooking the ocean and the tropics.

841
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,280
Ha, ha.

842
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,160
That's right.

843
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,220
Um.

844
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,600
And, of course, you can call 848-455-510-8505.

845
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,720
For those of you on drugs.

846
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,040
Yeah, you can.

847
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,460
And see where that gets you.

848
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,620
Hey, you said that phone number the way people do on my answer machine.

849
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,740
Yo.

850
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:24,740
You know, when you call my machine, it says, please leave your number twice, slowly and

851
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,640
clearly, on account of I'm kind of deaf and phones don't work very well anymore.

852
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,700
These modern day phones.

853
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,540
And why just this morning, I checked my answer machine back in Cleveland and there was a

854
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,000
guy saying, and this is all he said in the first message.

855
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,500
Five, one, two, three, six, eight.

856
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:44,880
No, no, no.

857
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,600
And he hung up.

858
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,840
And he called back.

859
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:54,840
He called back and said, five, one, two, three, six, eight.

860
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,360
No, no, no.

861
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,240
And that was it.

862
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,700
But he did leave the same message.

863
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,160
Twice.

864
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:11,440
Now, my crazy, my crazy caller, Bernard, who used to, he used to fill my machine up and

865
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,860
I had to block him because he was making it impossible.

866
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,780
He must have gotten a new phone because he started leaving messages again.

867
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:25,360
And the latest one, he said, this is Bernard M. Braithwaite.

868
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,000
It's incredible what I'm seeing on the television.

869
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,500
The mysterious things.

870
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,400
Falling out of the sky and attacking people and killing people all over the world.

871
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,940
It is the end times.

872
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,040
This is the day of judgment.

873
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,660
I know 1998 was a long time ago.

874
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,100
But a queen of UFOs.

875
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,580
And then he repeated the exact same message.

876
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,540
He's reporting truth right now.

877
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,080
It's like tongues.

878
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,380
No, no.

879
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,160
That's a word for verbatim.

880
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,520
No, he's just reporting what happened.

881
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,060
Yeah.

882
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,340
What?

883
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,560
And it's easy to remember.

884
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,500
This is what actually happened.

885
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,700
Didn't you hear about it?

886
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,700
Bernard always leaves messages at least twice.

887
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,260
This time he seemed to be surprised.

888
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,680
The same message?

889
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,040
My message, yeah.

890
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,660
Yes.

891
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,680
My machine now.

892
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,240
Just in case, man.

893
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,380
Just in case he didn't.

894
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,860
Message received.

895
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,220
My machine used to shut off at 30 seconds.

896
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,260
And he would try to get his whole thing into 30 seconds.

897
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,180
And if he didn't, he would call back.

898
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,260
And he never got it perfect.

899
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,520
So he would usually fill up my entire machine before he was, and never be satisfied.

900
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,320
Well, this latest time, he was surprised that it didn't cut him off at 30 seconds.

901
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,400
And he was kind of at a loss for words.

902
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,420
So he repeated the message on the same message rather than making a separate call.

903
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:45,780
Yeah.

904
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:54,600
Because I think he maybe got the impression after he'd been blocked twice that maybe we were having trouble with the way he was doing.

905
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,620
Oh, well.

906
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,460
He does not seem to know about the Internet or the...

907
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,920
The hour of slack was still in production.

908
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah.

909
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,100
And he probably won't hear this.

910
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,920
But Bernard, if you do hear this, you know, you never have left a phone number.

911
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,040
Hello, this is me.

912
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,260
To add on to what I was saying, I know the time is short.

913
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:25,120
Like, I'm trying to speak with this throwing tooth, you know, of a crown that, you know, the dentist made for me.

914
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,900
You know, you're not one of them.

915
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
They're out to get you.

916
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,780
And they're protecting their own.

917
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,620
The police is a sham.

918
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,300
They are hypocritical, lying jerks.

919
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Instead of, you know, you know, targeting, you know, you know, you know, concentrating on the people who are bothering you, the pinks and normals,

920
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:54,560
they target me and try to berate me and dehumanize me and telling and asking me questions that have nothing to do with what's going on.

921
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,740
Showing that they're only protecting their own beast element of humanity.

922
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,480
Co-conspirators.

923
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,420
Co-conspirators representing society and the community.

924
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,760
Gold Bond Sweaty and Niche Powder.

925
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,420
Especially medicated to keep feet hot, sweaty, and niche.

926
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,160
Gold Bond Sweaty and Niche Powder.

927
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,120
Medicated to get nervous about foot odor and wet foot powder and kick.

928
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,260
Gold Bond Work Powder.

929
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,620
Cholesterol is natural enemy.

930
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,640
Cholesterol is not Narrator.

931
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:41,820
Gold Bond Blood Poison.

932
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,640
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

933
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:43,900
Gold Bond Puzzle.

934
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,620
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

935
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,880
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

936
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,960
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

937
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,160
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

938
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,980
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

939
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,620
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

940
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,340
Gold Bond Blood Puzzle.

941
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,220
Thank you.

942
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,260
Thank you.

943
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:01,720
Thank you.

944
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,400
Did you know about the ender?

945
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,180
No. The last time I saw him, he put a banana in my anus.

946
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,720
I was bleeding and it made him angry.

947
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,160
It would be unfortunate if I had put the banana in my ender.

948
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,540
And then the enders should start bleeding.

949
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,820
Yes. Children should be healed and the general world should follow the malaise.

950
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:30,880
Yes.

951
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,740
That's why it would be better if you didn't put the banana in my anus at this moment.

952
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,700
I'll be back when I put this banana in my life.

953
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,840
Have a nice day.

954
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,580
You make my anus very happy.

955
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,160
My God!

956
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,380
Go on.

957
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,480
Go on.

958
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,940
Go on.

959
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,140
Go on.

960
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:56,460
Go on.

961
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,180
Go on.

962
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,460
Go on.

963
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,280
Oh, my God.

964
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,140
Oh, my God.

965
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,640
Speaking of which, now the news.

966
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,320
Daylight saving time is expected early this week in Nome, Alaska.

967
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,700
Now it's pushing north and east toward Colorado and other parts of the Great Lakes.

968
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,040
Safety officials suggest as you change your clocks, change the batteries in your PR detectors.

969
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,800
This is PR.

970
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,600
Britain made the claim yesterday, saying they'd recently seen British warplanes flying near them.

971
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,280
Cyclists are rolling from Newtown, Connecticut to West Africa to send a message.

972
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,820
They were not on a hostage extraction mission.

973
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:19,620
The cyclists are riding in support of what they describe as common sense solutions to prevent Congress.

974
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,360
I'm hoping for measures that will help this ride.

975
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,640
The riders are expected to arrive at PR News on Tuesday.

976
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,360
The Associated Press and other news outlets cite PR News in Washington.

977
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,460
For the archaeologists.

978
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,540
Every day is a hair day.

979
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,720
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name.

980
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,620
I got just what I wanted from.

981
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,880
Everybody here today.

982
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,460
And everybody said, name me a.

983
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,480
Name me a.

984
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,760
Now I reason because here is inflicted unbelief.

985
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,700
Name me a.

986
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,580
Unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister.

987
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,300
Right now, man.

988
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,100
Sarcastic.

989
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,620
Satisfaction.

990
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,840
Secure my weapon, corporal.

991
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,540
Again?

992
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,320
Again.

993
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,600
Big day.

994
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,620
Did you get my present?

995
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,520
Placed a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer.

996
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:20,920
Hmm.

997
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,280
I saw those.

998
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,060
I see pictures.

999
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah.

1000
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,480
Do you dare see that?

1001
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,340
You transfer all the pictures that I just put on there into your brain.

1002
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,360
The thing is.

1003
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,800
I'll just put them right into my USB port.

1004
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:35,980
Yes.

1005
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,980
And then I'll look at them.

1006
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,920
And then all of them.

1007
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,880
Take them away and put them into the.

1008
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,120
Okay.

1009
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,400
I'll see how it looks.

1010
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:42,880
Port.

1011
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,120
Port.

1012
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,480
That's not USB.

1013
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,940
Starberry home.

1014
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,240
This is USB 3.

1015
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,000
Ooh.

1016
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:48,880
I'm only.

1017
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,180
My port only holds USB 2.

1018
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,640
Oh, I guess that kind of took us all by surprise.

1019
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
That's an exit, not an entrance.

1020
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,100
Okay.

1021
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,560
Here we go.

1022
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,020
Oh.

1023
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,920
Our port.

1024
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,600
Now this movie has Robert Vaughn as a man searching for Hitler.

1025
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,920
And then he meets him.

1026
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,780
Oh, it's not Teenage Caveman.

1027
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,500
No.

1028
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:06,900
No.

1029
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,740
It's much later.

1030
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,940
And Keenan Wynn is in it.

1031
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,600
Who looks to be 83.

1032
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
And they have.

1033
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,400
I love this poor guy running through these awful sets.

1034
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,160
And he can barely move.

1035
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,140
It's.

1036
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,700
And.

1037
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,820
And when he finds Hitler, he's kind of a reedy voice.

1038
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,440
Thin little guy that is produced by a hologram.

1039
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,700
He's the wimpy Hitler.

1040
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,540
And this is.

1041
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,900
This is actually the music and sound effects from that movie whose name I can never remember.

1042
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,360
But I caught it on a 3 a.m.

1043
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,580
You know.

1044
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,980
Have you guys done the.

1045
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,760
They shaved Hitler's mustache.

1046
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,520
The post-World War II Hitler movie festival yet.

1047
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,500
You would have to include that.

1048
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:42,780
Why?

1049
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,060
I mean, it's.

1050
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,160
It's the Twilight Zone with Dennis.

1051
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,980
Where Dennis Hopper meets Hitler.

1052
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,540
It's called He's Alive.

1053
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:47,940
Yeah.

1054
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,800
And it's the Fuhrer.

1056
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,140
He teaches Dennis Hopper how to make those zippy Nazi speeches.

1057
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:57,660
Yeah.

1058
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,020
I haven't watched that one in a while.

1059
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,920
I have.

1060
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,020
I watched it in a while.

1061
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,160
I know.

1062
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,440
It probably.

1063
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,800
Princess, we and I watched all of them in the right hour and.

1064
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:06,820
All of them in the right hour and.

1065
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,060
Some of them weren't good, weren't they?

1066
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:08,460
I.

1067
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,100
I watched all of them at once.

1068
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,420
Yeah.

1069
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:10,800
We did.

1070
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,180
Yeah.

1071
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,900
We did two.

1072
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:12,540
300.

1073
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:12,860
300.

1074
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:12,860


1075
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:12,860


1076
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:12,860


1077
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:12,860


1078
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:12,860


1079
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,360
352.

1080
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
No, I mean, I watched all of them at once.

1081
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,680
We had 352 shows in one half hour.

1082
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,260
We put a day in between every two or three shows.

1083
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,740
That's super speedy.

1084
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,560
And then I had to keep watching because they're all those awful hour-long ones.

1085
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,300
And in the.

1086
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,500
What about Simon Oakland and the submarine?

1087
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,600
Oh, God.

1088
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,820
Endless.

1089
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah.

1090
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,840
In the thing I have.

1091
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,560
They gave me a thing and I looked at the thing and the thing says.

1092
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,400
The thing.

1093
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,240
Can you take it?

1094
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,740
Yeah.

1095
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:40,820
Yeah.

1096
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,620
The show right behind Twilight Zone had been killed two minutes before airtime.

1097
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,600
So they.

1098
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,920
And it's ghost then appeared on Twilight Zone.

1099
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,180
Yeah, exactly.

1100
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,660
But it didn't know it was a ghost.

1101
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,080
He didn't find out it was a ghost until the end.

1102
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,540
Yeah.

1103
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,600
A ghost.

1104
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,480
It's like at the beginning of the Twilight Zone.

1105
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
Oh, my God.

1106
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,520
It doesn't know it's a radio show.

1107
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,020
And then everybody else is a radio show.

1108
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,480
But finally, the horrible twist arrives.

1109
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,500
I too was a radio show.

1110
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,620
That whole time.

1111
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,080
Oh, my ghost brother.

1112
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,400
I'm not one of those mannequins or ghosts or robots.

1113
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,420
Time to face the challenge of the ghost bots.

1114
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,420
Okay.

1115
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,720
So we get out the radio robot.

1116
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,980
This radio water will feel great.

1117
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,200
The ghost in the shell.

1118
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,500
The spirit in the machine.

1119
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,280
If you like caveman robot, you'll love ghost robot.

1120
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,800
It turned out to be there all the time.

1121
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,900
Robots did have souls.

1122
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,220
As we found out when they started showing up as ghosts in vast numbers.

1123
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,580
What if like Tom Cruise were the robots and the robots from Mars were nice?

1124
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,020
Oh, sorry.

1125
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,660
Well, that disproves that.

1126
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,060
And you can see the way they act.

1127
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,340
I still go back to the classics.

1128
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,840
First thing I ever typed in on YouTube.

1129
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,100
Hitler versus Jesus.

1130
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,660
Who won?

1131
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,920
What was horrifying was four different projects came out.

1132
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,600
Of what?

1133
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,300
What was the title?

1134
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,360
Hitler versus Jesus.

1135
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,600
Which has always been live here.

1136
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,380
So you got Hitler and Jesus on the moon and Hitler has nine lugers and Jesus has the power

1137
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:13,820
to forgive.

1138
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,660
Oh, great.

1139
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,120
Way to go, Jesus.

1140
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,080
Why don't you forgive the hell out of Hitler now?

1141
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,400
Just start forgiving.

1142
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,420
Okay.

1143
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,180
I forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you, forgive you,

1144
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,000
forgive you, forgive you.

1145
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,260
Of course, all the other rules of physics are in process.

1146
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,400
Six and a half million times.

1147
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,840
More than that.

1148
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,260
You could jump really high and then leave the moon.

1149
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,260
You can jump really high and jump up in the sky.

1150
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,660
You can float in space.

1151
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,580
Oh, at this point, I'm not sure.

1152
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,580


1153
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,580


1154
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,580


1155
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,580


1156
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,580


1157
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,580


1158
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,160
Is that my tinnitus or is that the show?

1159
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,300
Jack hammering on the run.

1160
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,500
Wouldn't it be cool if I could just do this?

1161
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:47,800
Okay.

1162
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,400
Oh, it stopped.

1163
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,660
It hurts, but it stopped.

1164
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,340
The silence sent the jungle away.

1165
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,860
I sent the music to my heart.

1166
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:01,720
Now, this next day at Dr. Dark's drive-in, he'll be showing Iron Sky, which does have

1167
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,740
Hitler on the moon.

1168
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,780
It also has Kurt Kursteiner in the movie.

1169
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,400
Have you seen it yet?

1170
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:06,780
Yeah.

1171
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,140
Okay.

1172
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
So, you've seen Kurt.

1173
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,180
It has their Fuhrer, who is not Hitler.

1174
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,500
He's the Fuhrer that followed Hitler and made the movie.

1175
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,600
You did not see that in your mind as you watched it?

1176
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,940
I certainly didn't.

1177
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,660
The studly Nazi who ends up going working for Sarah President Palin.

1178
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:20,900
Yeah.

1179
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,320
It's not Dougie.

1180
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,540
He really reminds one of Kurt.

1181
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,460
And some of the shots, the way he's lit, unbelievably funny to me.

1182
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,320
Oh, yeah.

1183
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,720
It's that guy I met on a submarine with Hitler and how he was the cook and it was

1184
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,340
a horrible dream.

1185
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,780
It was no dream.

1186
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,340
Princess, what was that movie we saw that ...

1187
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,560
It really did have Papa Joe Mama in it.

1188
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:41,840
God.

1189
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,260
The history of life?

1190
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,200
Did she hear you on the UFO?

1191
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,500
No.

1192
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,400
I can't hear him.

1193
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,880
Van Helsing.

1194
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,260
Van Helsing.

1195
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:48,540
Yeah.

1196
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,480
The horrible movie about monsters.

1197
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,360
Van Helsing.

1198
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:52,860
K-Rob, like us.

1199
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,140
A side character who's a monk, who's kind of like the cue to James Bond, is the cue

1201
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,940
to Van Helsing.

1202
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,180
And he makes weapons and stuff.

1203
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,980
And that guy kind of talks like Papa Joe Mama.

1204
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,800
Yes, yes.

1205
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,400
And he looks like Papa Joe Mama.

1206
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:12,560
He does.

1207
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,620
Coincidence or conspiracy?

1208
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:22,580
Seriously, look at Van Helsing again and think about not that Queersteiner guy, but Papa

1209
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,240
Joe Mama.

1210
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,180
Gotcha.

1211
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:30,980
Kurt Queersteiner was the guy who did the Expose Bob website that has angered so many

1212
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,180
earnest and all-knowing subgeniuses.

1213
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,200
So many.

1214
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,460
Why would anybody do something like that?

1215
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:45,460
About once a year, some newbie discovers exposebob.com and gets so upset that this idiot

1216
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,780
would say such terrible things about the nice, innocent, funny church of the subgenius.

1217
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,340
Yeah, I mean, where do these people come from?

1218
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,340
Where do they get off?

1219
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:01,560
All this talk of brainwashing and testicles and vice grips in Dobstown and so forth.

1220
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:01,580
Those are rumors.

1221
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,540
A few little incidents.

1222
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,800
And they make like, that's what we're all about.

1223
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,900
You know, once a rumor gets out, why, it might as well be true.

1224
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,060
Well, since they're saying it's true, I guess we might as well pull out those vice grips

1225
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,360
and clamp them on.

1226
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,400
Yeah, I mean, we're already blamed for it.

1227
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,120
We might as well.

1228
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:17,780
Yeah, sure.

1229
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,760
If they're blaming, if they're saying we're kidnapping teenagers and brainwashing them,

1230
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,960
well, we might as well go ahead.

1231
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,020
We'll go ahead and kidnap some.

1232
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,360
Like them.

1233
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:28,940
Yeah.

1234
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,560
Yeah.

1235
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,440
Like those listeners there.

1236
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,100
Forever, they'll be forced to listen to this show.

1237
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,720
The Hour of Slack from the authentic church of the subgenius.

1238
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,200
Avoid all cheap Bob imitators not found at subgenius.com.

1241

And now to close out the show, a Nirvana cover by the Psychoskeletons seen on SoundClick.com.

1242
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:06,300
A pleasant little ditty called, I hate myself and want to die.

1243
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:08,520


1244
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:08,520

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

1269
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,040
What's that sound?

1270
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,300
You listen,

1271
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,140
Dee.

1272
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,660
What's that sound?

1273
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,020
Broken hearts and broken bones.

1274
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,340
Think of how a castrated horse feels.

1275
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,140
One more quirky,

1276
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,500
cliche phrase.

1277
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,680
You're the one I want to refill.

1278
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,360
And then someday,

1279
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,420
what's that sound?

1280
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,500
In the someday,

1281
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,380
what's that sound?

1282
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,360
In the someday,

1283
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,280
what's that sound?

1284
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,140
In the someday,

1285
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,000
what's that sound?

1286
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,880
In the someday,

1287
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,660
what's that sound?

1288
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,480
For Sire,

1289
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,980
there is no more money.

1290
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,440
We gotta get some money.

1291
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,540
That dirty,

1292
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,140
purgish,

1293
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:29,820

1300
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,380
thurton,

1301
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,080
buster night.

1302
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:35,920
Friends,

1303
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,180
we're glad you listened to this show,

1304
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:45,440
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1305
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,520
And not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1306
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,100
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

1307
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,060
But if you truly love Bob,

1308
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,640
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1309
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,560
you should go to Subgenius.com front page,

1310
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,120
or especially the radio page,

1311
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,140
or the catalog store pages,

1312
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,440
and help out financially as best you can.

1313
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,800
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1314
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,660
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own subgeniuses.

1315
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,440
We want to make situations worse.

1316
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,360
But some of you still have jobs.

1317
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,740
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1318
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,780
even if it's only once a month,

1319
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,280
from enough of you.

1320
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,700
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1321
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,020
All we're saying is that

1322
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,400
glow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs,

1323
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,180
if you don't pay dogs.

1324
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,080
We also take checks and money orders to

1325
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,000
Subgenius Foundation.

1326
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,200
P.O. Box.

1327
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:45,640
Subgenius Foundation.

1328
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:45,640


1329
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:45,640


1330
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:55,440
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1331
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,660
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1332
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,940
.
