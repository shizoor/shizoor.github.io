1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Ah, yes, dear friends, welcome to the Hour of Slack, number 1,370-something.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:21,480
And may this Hour of Slack be the most slackful of all the hours heretofore and forthwith.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Your time of listening is now your time of deep, relaxing slack.

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,940
Slack is the soft voice, slack the luminous cloud.

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,200
We in our slack rejoice.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,360
And thence comes all the charms or ear or sight,

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,500
all melodies the echo of that voice,

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,780
all colors a suffusion,

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,140
all vision of that light.

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,560
And though the exists once more withheld the lights of their countenance

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,860
from the helpful, hopeful, upturned faces of the ex-day postulants,

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,700
we have not even been challenged.

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,020
Nay, rather than that, our faith has been reinforced even more

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,360
so that we are truly the children,

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,920
the warriors of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,940
Praise be to God.

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,440
But not the worriers, sir.

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,620
We're not the worriers of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,860
We're not worried because we have faith in the ultimate success of our mission,

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,420
the Nameless Mission,

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,140
a small part of which is to bring you broadcasting opportunities

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,160
such as this one,

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,360
where you and we can participate together victoriously in what we call,

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,640
the Hour of Slack.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,160
That actually hurt my Adam's apple.

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,500
I have done that so many times in the last few days.

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,400
I've developed a bruise on my throat.

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,700
In Adam's fall, we sinned all.

29
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,420
And the bruise on the throat, which the Bobcaster feels,

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,640
is only cognate to the bruise on the heel given by that old serpent, Satan.

31
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,660
Yes, the adversary, the evil one,

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,560
was nipping at the heels of the faithful at Exde.

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,160
But even old Sequa,

34
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,680
most monstrous denizen of the watery depths,

35
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,000
took only four minor victims.

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,720
When we expected a holocaust of many,

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,900
including even the most faithful.

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,220
Perhaps the locals had fed him the sacrifices,

39
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,640
which, according,

40
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,040
according to Native American tradition,

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
are his due.

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,380
But perhaps he, like the holiday itself,

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,340
decided, for no reason that could be named,

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,780
to be kind and forbearing,

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,400
and to have the faith,

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,600
the faith in Bob.

54
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,860
Way down south in the Piney Woods

55
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,800
There's a gospel quartet singin'

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,760
like it should've got the hair slicked back

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,360
White suit so fine

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,120
At the Wednesday night revival

59
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,600
Turpentine

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
Got the rollin' bass

61
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,680
Got the baritone

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,800
Got a ringin' high tenor

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
Reachin' Jesus on the throne

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,740
And a smooth lead singer

65
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,660
Got the women cryin'

66
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,720
Sweatin' salvation

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,680
Turpentine

68
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,220
Turpentine

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,680
Turpentine

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,020
Save my soul, spirit of the pine

71
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,120
It's a masterpiece waitin' to be signed

72
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,860
Cleanin' my brushes

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,500
Turpentine

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:30,900
A spoonful of sugar and hold your nose

75
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,840
It'll kill everything but the Holy Ghost

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,240
It's a pine, dark communion body, blood and wine

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,460
In the folds of the choir ropes

78
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,740
Turpentine

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:41,860
Turpentine

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,700
Turpentine

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
Save my soul, spirit of the pine

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,840
It's a masterpiece waitin' to be signed

83
00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:09,700
sign, cleaning my brushes, turpentine. I'm sitting in the back pew, thumbing through the hymns,

84
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,560
trying to figure out how to write me one of them. Got a story to tell, could do some testifying,

85
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:25,140
but God ain't giving me the calling, turpentine, turpentine, turpentine. Save my soul, spirit of the

86
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,760
pine. It's a masterpiece, waiting to be signed, cleaning my brushes, turpentine. When they lay me

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,340
down in a minor key, and they shovel my words in on top of me, I'll be in that quartet with some

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,820
friends of mine, an eternity of Wednesdays, turpentine.

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:53,540
turpentine, turpentine. Save my soul, spirit of the pine. It's a masterpiece, waiting to be

90
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:04,240
signed, cleaning my brushes, turpentine. Turpentine, turpentine. Save my soul, spirit of the pine. It's

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,040
a masterpiece, waiting to be signed, cleaning my brushes, turpentine.

92
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,300
I'm a dead cat on the line.

93
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,780
They tell me that once upon a time, they had some sub trying to get a message over the

94
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,520
telegram box.

95
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,040
The company sent a man out to inspect the line.

96
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,540
In making his report, he said that he found that a cat had gone up to the line and he

97
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


98
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


99
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


100
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


101
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


102
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


103
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,540


104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,620
had been telegraphed to and died on the line.

105
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,760
That was the reason why they couldn't get the message over the line.

106
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:37,280
The child doesn't seem to be farther in no way than the dead cat on the line.

107
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,120
Do you hear me?

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes.

109
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,240
Yes.

110
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,420
Yes.

111
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,080
Yes.

112
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,260
Yes.

113
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,640
There's a child here just outside.

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,640


115
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,880
Where is he?

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:49,880


117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:49,880


118
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:49,880


119
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,280
Do you hear me?

120
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,300
Yes.

121
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Yes.

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,120
Do you hear me?

123
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,200
Yes.

124
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,660
Yes.

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,520
Excuse me.

126
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,520


127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,520


128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,520


129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,520


130
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,520


131
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,520


132
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,220
It doesn't matter whether it's child's mother or not, she knows it's her child.

133
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,900
I thought you knew your child's father?

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
Well, yes.

135
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,480
I think I know my last result.

136
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,420
Yeah.

137
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,540
Yeah, you think you know.

138
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:13,860
There you go.

139
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,600
Well, you may not know.

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,020
But if you don't know, you've got the last word on the question.

141
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,700
There you go.

142
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,860
But I am one man that thinks all children should favor their father.

143
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,480
All right.

144
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,540
Did you hear me?

145
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:32,900
Yeah.

146
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,300
Oh, yeah.

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,480
I bet that's enough.

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,820
Well, the best I can tell you, hasn't that one guy don't favor me at all?

149
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,340
Hmm?

150
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:41,900
No, sir.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Don't say that.

152
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,120
And don't walk like it.

153
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,620
No, sir.

154
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,360
And don't talk like it.

155
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:47,800
No, sir.

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,740
Have that fella like you.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,160
No, sir.

158
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,340
But as a dead cat on the line.

159
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,860
That's right.

160
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,960
But, you know...

161
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,040
So annoying..

162
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,040


163
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,380
Now that you're back,

164
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,380


165
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,540
You little bingos...

166
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,380
Go catoos.

167
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,920
musen strap fifty-fifty only

168
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:40,920

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,480
Thank you.

170
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,520
Thank you.

Thank you.

176
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,960
Thank you.

177
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:42,980
Thank you.

178
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,340
Thank you.

179
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,540
Thank you.

180
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,580
Thank you.

181
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,520
Thank you.

182
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,360
Thank you.

183
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,080
Cool's out, but you've all got something learning to do.

184
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,020

miserable

miserable

202
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,340
miserable

203
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,340


204
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,340


205
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,340


206
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,900
miserable

207
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:04,900


208
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,080
amazing

209
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,360
slowly

210
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,220
stop

211
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,480
shit

212
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,800
hey

213
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,780
smoke

214
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,420
does

215
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,220
this

216
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,220


217
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:35,840
breaking. I just ain't happy unless I'm miserable, miserable, miserable.

218
00:17:43,380 --> 00:18:05,820
Ah yes dear friends. Ah yes, yes, yes. Another hour of slack. The 1638th hour of slack.

219
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:15,500
That's a fair amount of slack. Oh the credits, that's right. Thanks for reminding me there

220
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:25,340
Satan. That song we just heard, Misery Bull, was of course the Rainmakers from Kansas City,

221
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:33,060
Missouri. And we also heard a song by them at the very beginning, Turpentine, about turpentine

222
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,120
drinking church folks.

223
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Uh, the, the, before Misery Bull, that song about where the guy talks the audience into

224
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,700
giving him his keys, that's Dr. Argus Fox and the Right Angles recorded live. Humans

225
00:18:51,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Are Okay, the somewhat softer song, was exposed foreheads. Exposed with an X and foreheads

226
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,400
with a four, numeral four.

227
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,020
That's how we heard the song, and what's in there, is that, I think it was the leading

228
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
singer

229
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,100
and then we.

230
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,320
Where is it?

231
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,320


232
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,320


233
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:25,080
Right 와서 cask.

234
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:25,940
Yup.

235
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,260


236
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,580
Right wise.

237
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,080
Rightカ.

238
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,880
Yeah.

239
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,020
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

240
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,320
I'd just like to add my thanks to the Preacher Comforts Coordinator here.

241
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,620
Beautiful downtown listless behavior.

242
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,660
It's been a long, long, long time.

243
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,020
Sorry.

244
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,840
That is a long time.

246
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,320
Me too.

247
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm sorry too.

248
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,200
I'm sorry three.

249
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,380
I'm sore.

250
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,540
Well, I can see why you're both sore, because you have canubial bliss together every Saturday evening.

251
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,700
But I was just married to a sandalwood snail for the last half an hour.

252
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,640
Bonford, they're pretty slippery.

253
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,000
Yep.

254
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,320
Muselaginous snails.

255
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,840
Sensuous snails.

256
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,260
Yeah.

257
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,600
You made my toes curl up like a little dog.

258
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,040
They go crawling up you, kind of scraping at you with their tiny little teeth.

259
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:33,400
Yeah.

260
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,820
Scraping the fungus off.

261
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,500
That's what they have on.

262
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Have you ever been sucked by a leech?

263
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,900
Yes, I'm afraid so.

264
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,480
Yes, I have too.

265
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,500
In fact, I had a pet leech a couple of, well, it's been about five years since I had my scum aquarium.

266
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,180
But when I was filming, when I was a wildlife photographer filming microbes,

267
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,100
I actually had an aquarium.

268
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,740
I had an aquarium full of slime with a little heat lamp on it.

269
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,520
I would get water from the graveyard pond and places like that.

270
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,120
So I'd always have lots of new micro life in there.

271
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,860
Graveyard pond.

272
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,080
Yeah.

273
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,060
One day, it wasn't all microscopic.

274
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,820
There was an actual leech in my tank.

275
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,140
I had to get rid of him because he was eating all my pets.

276
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,240
Well, I think my story is more interesting where I went swimming.

277
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,240
I went in a bad place and walked out of the water and stuff.

278
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,880
And there were these things that are already sucking a bunch of my blood confirmed on my body.

279
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,100
Yeah.

280
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,080
Well, that's nature.

281
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,960
Especially if you're a young child and you don't need.

282
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,080
It's leeches.

283
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,760
You know, I know.

284
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:58,680
Dave, did you know that of all of the many, many, many millions of species of life forms that are animals on this planet,

285
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,000
many more of them are parasites that live inside.

286
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,740
Other animals than.

287
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,940
Then like us or our dog or cat.

288
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,880
Well, actually, we and the dogs and cats are parasites in a way.

289
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:22,620
But I'm talking about, you know, like we're we we're so big that we have parasites living inside us and on us and they have parasites.

290
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah.

291
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,220
Yeah.

292
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,900
I mean, even the fleas have fleas upon their backs to bite him.

293
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,200
And so at infinite.

294
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,280
And that's.

295
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,060
Completely wrong way of quoting Jonathan Swift.

296
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,720
But I never can remember the correct.

297
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,600
So classy.

298
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,420
It's a Swifty.

299
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,140
That's all you need to, you know, let the audience know that it was a Swifty.

300
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,620
You don't have to go too much further than that.

301
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,620
At least if you want to, you know, entree versus the backside, as they used to say in Henry Walden,

302
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,260
Harden, the throw throw or whatever his name was.

303
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,180
The guy, you know, with the snake hair.

304
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,680
His hair is awful.

305
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,900
It's the nature boy.

306
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,980
Yeah.

307
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,740
The until he saw Gorbius, the Margon and stuff like that.

308
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,480
And then all the snakes killed him and stuff.

309
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,140
I think that's how I was.

310
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,660
He's mixed.

311
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
He's doing a mashup.

312
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,580
Yes, he is.

313
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,200
His brain is doing the day brain is doing a mashup.

314
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,440
He's making my brain hurt because I can't keep up with it.

315
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,280
But it's OK.

316
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,040
Don't stop.

317
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,960
Well, you don't have we're not really going anywhere, especially since I'm in charge of my side of it.

318
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,360
Somebody else could do a better job, I think.

319
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:32,840
But.

320
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,640
I'm the only one who volunteered.

321
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,740
That's right.

322
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,660
Actually, there's some poor sumbitch trying to call right now.

323
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,800
I don't I have no.

324
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,880
Obviously, they've never listened to this show before.

325
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,180
Well, they know that.

326
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,300
And that's why we know not to pick up that line.

327
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,740
Right.

328
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,980
Because if they were listeners, they'd know not to call.

329
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,380
Right.

330
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,600
Well, there's only one person allowed to call.

331
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,060
Well, the one time we thought it was going to be.

332
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,460
I mean, we were talking to Dave and it was Philo.

333
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
That's true.

334
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,580
And then we Dave got cut off.

335
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,140
That was because it was that it was in Texas.

336
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,480
Yeah.

337
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,720
Philo tricked us.

338
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,220
Yeah.

339
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,260
Yeah.

340
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,820
I could only do one phone caller at a time there.

341
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah.

342
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,940
Here we choose to only do one caller.

343
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,300
Yes.

344
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,820
And his name is based on on Hellenic cuisine because it's a form of Greek pastry.

345
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,860
If we did.

346
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,920
What used in a lot of Greek pastry with honey and walnuts.

347
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,720
If we did let anybody call in, if we just picked up the phone anytime somebody called

348
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,720
show that follows our show in Cleveland.

349
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,160
Yes.

350
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,960
About half of the calls we get would be kind of like this.

351
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,240
Hey, y'all.

352
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,180
I just want to tell you I saw Bob.

353
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:52,780
Yeah.

354
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,680
I see Bob.

355
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,460
I love Bob.

356
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,980
And I said, it's UFO.

357
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,100
And it came down and it mutilated this cow and Bob was on it.

358
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,960
That's what.

359
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,860
What the hell, Bob?

360
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,360
What the hell, Bob?

361
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,640
What the hell?

362
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,800
What the hell is that?

363
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,740
Because every other one would be basically like that.

364
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,320
They would be just like the very first calls to the very first time that Philo and I were

365
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,300
ever on the radio.

366
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,940
Because every time we ever did any show that just let people call in about every other

367
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:28,820
call was insipidly unoriginal, stupid and with a fake southern accent.

368
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,640
Because you know, you have to act.

369
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,320
You have to sound like Billy Graham to sound like a preacher.

370
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,720
Yeah.

371
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,480
God.

372
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,060
Thanks.

373
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,420
But I think Saturday Night Live covered that 35 years ago.

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,600
Yeah.

375
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,980
But you got to remember a lot of these people that wrote in these noisy complaints are extremely

376
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,640
flatulent, especially this time of the year with the summer on the halfway wane like a

377
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,940
twilight zone between fall and summer and stuff like that.

378
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,620
One of them you got to explain.

379
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:01,940
What's the story?

380
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:01,940


381
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:01,940


382
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,620
You know, they're flatulent and they send him his ruined carcass.

383
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,360
I might add.

384
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,540
Believe me.

385
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,720
I said, believe me.

386
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
They're flatulent enough, they can join our band.

387
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,560
Well, they have to join our band if you do it in the right way.

388
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,720
That's the cross-eyed, dim-witted way.

389
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,640
If you believe as firmly as you can, that some way there's a way to get Toto back to

390
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,040
Kansas in time for the next Home Run Derby or Tuesday or whatever it is.

391
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,600
They could just leave.

392
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,660
We'd all be fighting by the time we come back here,

393
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,860
especially if they all believe in the burping up sharia law and syrup and egoism.

394
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,480
Is it possible to get Toto back to Kansas?

395
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,440
As a rumored child, you perhaps could,

396
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,440
because you have this strange and illustrious corpse act,

397
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,020
which is now Oklahoma law,

398
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,640
that says even if a child is as ugly as a dog,

399
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,320
you can still transport it past state lines.

400
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,960
Oh, no, no, they switched over to sharia law in Oklahoma.

401
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,780
Oh, yeah, that's right.

402
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,580
Yeah, the Muslims took over Oklahoma,

403
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,000
just like the Oklahomans were so terrified it was going to happen.

404
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,620
I mean, they were, half of Oklahoma, more than half of Oklahoma,

405
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,940
has been kind of adjusting their own,

406
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,980
their own lives around the fear of the Muslims coming in

407
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,720
and taking over the whole state of Oklahoma.

408
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,240
You just look around Oklahoma, it's like everybody's wearing a burka.

409
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,620
So it's already happened.

410
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,680
I don't know why they're even worried about it.

411
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:47,520
And if the last I heard, Obama did go and take away all of the guns.

412
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,300
Yeah, it took him 30 years to do it, but he still got it done before.

413
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,920
The gun salesmen are acting like that didn't happen.

414
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,320
It's like, oh, Obama's going to come and take your guns,

415
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,060
so you better buy more of them.

416
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,460
It's like, dude, that already happened.

417
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,380
Obama took all the guns.

418
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,660
Hillary stole all the uranium and gave it to the Russians

419
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,760
after infecting molested children with it in a pizza parlor.

420
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,160
All of that stuff you can read on the Internet so you know it's true.

421
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,840
And everything else that's on, you know, the expensive TV,

422
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,040
that's all fake.

423
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,060
That's fake news like the Bible or Book of the Subgenius.

424
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,460
Anybody can write a book.

425
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,220
Of course.

426
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,100
Anybody can do a book.

427
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,220
Yeah, I believe that for a very long time.

428
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,080
I was under lunar influences.

429
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,940
I was under the power of the greater elves and the people with big ears.

430
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,560
And they had me confused in the parking lot one time

431
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,620
and told me that I better not jump out the window

432
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,980
or I could be in grave error of fictional reality.

433
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,220
Oh, I remember that, Dave.

434
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,620
Dave.

435
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,960
Those weren't really elves with long ears.

436
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,920
We were at the Fantasy Fair science fiction convention.

437
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,100
I'm still pondering whether is Munchkinland like in another cosmos or galaxy?

438
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,640
It's in Oz.

439
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,560
Oh, it's in Oz. Right.

440
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,360
What exactly happened from a scientific viewpoint, standpoint?

441
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,540
What happened? Starting when?

442
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,920
When I got into the argument with the elves and you said they weren't real.

443
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,000
You said they were like knee-jerk.

444
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,380
They were like the

445
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,640
They were cosplay people.

446
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,340
People in shorts.

447
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,100
That was at the comics con.

448
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,440
That was at the comic book con.

449
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,480
Dave's never been to one of those things.

450
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,020
He thought all those people were real superheroes.

451
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,840
They're posers, Dave. Posers.

452
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,900
No, they're not posers.

453
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,300
They're aficionados of fantasy and science fiction and comic books and stuff.

454
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,120
And they like to dress up.

455
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,440
Yeah, you wouldn't want to regurgitate the same thing back to them

456
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,860
because you could lose your heavy list.

457
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,440
Oh, they all regurgitate the same.

458
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,000
The last time I saw them.

459
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,320
I haven't been to Dragon Con in a while, but the last time I went,

460
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,780
there must have been 40 Heath Ledger jokers walking around.

461
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,040
That's true.

462
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,600
That's a real easy one to do.

463
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,440
But it was much harder to be all of the Watchmen,

464
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,880
but I saw several clusters of those.

465
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,380
Uh-huh.

466
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
And of course, you can have an entire.

467
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,700
It's not a comic book convention unless there's 10,000 stormtroopers

468
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,540
parading down the middle of the street.

469
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,100
And I'm not kidding.

470
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,580
They do that in Atlanta every year.

471
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,820
I don't know.

472
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,560
I don't know if it's 10,000, but it's like a thousand stormtroopers.

473
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,500
Yes, they amass.

474
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,460
Star Wars stormtroopers, not Nazi stormtroopers.

475
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,920
In the days of the inclination and the acclimation, these are all needed.

476
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:43,060
You have to get everybody ready for a police force that can really do its job.

477
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,560
Like, you know, has hand grenade propelled launchers and Soviet-style missiles

478
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,680
and some barbecue aprons that you can wear on the back of your head.

479
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,680
Well, you know.

480
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,940
You know.

481
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,320
The prophets, a lot of people, a lot of subgeniuses, and the late Dick Gregory,

482
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:13,380
feel that when a Hollywood movie comes out with a bunch of crazy alien stuff going on in it

483
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,220
and children getting kidnapped and wars and rumors of wars,

484
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,780
that that's all just to soften you up because it's really going to happen.

485
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,880
They're going to make it happen.

486
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,920
That's why for 75 years, I've been in the movie industry.

487
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:24,920


488
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,360
For 75 years, there's been movies about flying saucers.

489
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,600
They're softening us up.

490
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,400
I'll bet you that they soften us up for several more thousand years before the aliens actually get here.

491
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,220
The ones they're talking about.

492
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:45,480
I mean, because they have this limited idea of aliens as these saucer-riding, physical, breathing things.

493
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,460
They don't necessarily have to have bodies at all.

494
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,720
No, they have soggy jaws.

495
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,740
And we don't either.

496
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,760
We just have to...

497
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,680
Big as the moon.

498
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,460
Yeah.

499
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,660
It is what you just said is completely and totally true.

501
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,040
No, my medical alert just went off.

502
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,860
What did it say?

503
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,740
It was very untrusting with the Monster Hunter music.

504
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,880
The alarm blending with the Monster Hunter music was interesting.

505
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,880
Well, that's what makes it so bloody and so good and juicy and fun.

506
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:24,900


507
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:24,900


508
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,500
I've been playing a video game that makes me sick.

509
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,000
I've almost completely beaten the game.

510
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,480
I've played it for so many hours that...

511
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,160
Wait, wait.

512
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,200
I smell cooking.

513
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,160
I smell meat cooking.

514
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,980
It's just burned oil.

515
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,880
Is that the substance of your dissolution there?

516
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,500
No, no, no.

517
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,040
That was good.

518
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,700
Popcorn smells.

519
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,940
I can't remember the serious subject that I was talking about.

520
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,020
How can that happen on this show?

521
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,140
I can't imagine how that would happen.

522
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,020
Here, let's toast some marshmallows.

523
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,980
Oh, yeah, good idea.

524
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,520
That'll bring everything back.

525
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,920
Aroma, it had something to do with aroma, maybe, I don't know.

526
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,420
Mmm.

527
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,220
Mmm.

528
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,180
Well, it was cooking music that was on for a minute.

529
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,360
Oh, I was talking about the video game that makes me so sick.

530
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,100
Right.

531
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,720
Well, I've been playing Monster Hunter for years,

532
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,660
and I've been seeing this game called...

533
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:29,480
Big Game Hunter, where it was bears and lions and water buffalo and stuff.

534
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,640
I wasn't gonna spend 30 bucks on a...

535
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,000
It's for the Wii.

536
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,700
But I found a copy for $2.

537
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,980
And I started becoming a big game hunter as kind of a...

538
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,200
Because I like to be outdoors.

539
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
It's horrible.

540
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,360
It's horrible, Dave.

541
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,440
Horrible.

542
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,400
But I love to be outdoors.

543
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,640
I love to be outdoors.

544
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,680
And I love to look at animals through a scope,

545
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,460
preferably a movie camera, telescopic lens.

546
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,520
But in this game, in order to be able to explore the cool deserts,

547
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,860
you have to shoot a certain number of innocent herbivores and ungulates,

548
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,300
like, you know, bighorn sheep and stuff like that.

549
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,580
Yeah.

550
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,800
You have to sneak up on them, kill them, and then tag them, whatever that means.

551
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,640
But then they kind of skip over all the bloody stuff.

552
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,000
Where you have to hang them up by their feet, bleed them, cut their belly open,

553
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,980
pull all their guts out, peel their skin off.

554
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,500
Buh.

555
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,280
Yeah.

556
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,740
They leave out all that stuff.

557
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,760
That's not part of the game.

558
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,060
Anyway, it makes me sick every time I have to kill one of these innocent creatures.

559
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,900
And yet you can't stop playing the game.

560
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,480
Well, not if I want to explore around the next corner.

561
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,580
And as we all know, slack lies around the next corner.

562
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,240
That is always true.

563
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:50,960
That is true.

564
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,620
But I think you're gonna disfigure yourself if you play the game.

565
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,580
I think you're gonna continue this policy.

566
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,620
I hate to sound like the bearer of ill tidings, but it seems to me you've kind of left your senses behind

567
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,760
once you've exterminated that last cabinet piece that you've been working on.

568
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, I discovered this and I discovered that.

569
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,860
And you can make the lines, too, if you just hold your nose.

570
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,200
Well, you can't always hold your nose.

571
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,380
And sometimes things are more truer than you thought they were.

572
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,900
Well, there was a time when I got too into these games and I would...

573
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,360
Mm-hmm.

574
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,440
When the game was over, I'd be covered with blood and scratches and bites.

575
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,240
And I actually lost a couple of teeth during...

576
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,460
It's like you black out and you do all this fighting in this game, all this...

577
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
You get all beat up and when...

578
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,120
It's all virtual.

579
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,360
When you come out of it...

580
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,980
Well, not...

581
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,020
That's what I'm saying is...

582
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,080
Remember that...

583
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,800
Princess, will you remember that time when my character, Stangor, had a real rough fight in the desert?

584
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,320
Yes.

585
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,740
And you walked in and I was covered with sweat?

586
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,180
Oh, yeah.

587
00:35:53,620 --> 00:36:00,740
And then the next fight he did, it was in the snow and you walked into our bedroom and I had icicles hanging off my nose.

588
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,540
Uh-huh.

589
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:07,120
And then the next time, it was a really, really big monster and it beat me and you walked in and I was bitten in half.

590
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah.

591
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,760
Yeah.

592
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah.

593
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,840
He really gets into the game.

594
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,820
You can get too into this stuff.

595
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,280
Yeah.

596
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Yeah, but what...

597
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,320
You can't...

598
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,880
You know, there's a lot of these elderly people that play these games.

599
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,780
They'll be right in the middle of a real exciting part of it and they'll start pooping.

600
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,080
And they want people to...

601
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,820
They want people to un-force themselves to not poop.

602
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,140
And they think they can because they believe in mind over matter.

603
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,380
But most of them don't realize what an immaterial force everything is.

604
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,400
You know, like...

605
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,800
Speak for yourself, man.

606
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,280
It's like Puccini's...

607
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,520
Well, yeah, I am.

608
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm a fan of Puccini.

609
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,080
They start pooping?

610
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
La La Donnie Mobile.

611
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,860
I remember that song.

612
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,080
These women are fickle.

613
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,920
That's why I didn't say necessarily pooping.

614
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,640
I mean, you know, kind of figuratively, metaphorically pooping.

615
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,540
Ah, okay.

616
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,060
I mean, you know, kind of figuratively, metaphorically pooping.

617
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,060


618
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,060


619
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,060


620
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,060


621
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,840
But, yeah, I don't know.

622
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,720
They're just doing all this improved poop all to the new boys.

623
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:06,720


624
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,220
Yeah.

625
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,640
Whoooo don't you know!

626
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:11,640


627
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:11,640


628
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:11,640


629
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,540
Some asshole herb ones.

630
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:14,540


631
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,060
A little bit of 빠 died inside.

632
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,400
But they'll get paid in centres in, oh my投 this year.

633
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,400


634
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,400


635
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,500


636
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,500


637
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,500


638
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,500


639
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,120
Oh my gosh, there's just so many awkward faces.

640
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,340
Go ahead.

641
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,920
I want to get some more.

642
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,840
Oh, this is the first time I've got.

643
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,060
Oh and don'tablo relivein We're doing a more appropriate podcast.

644
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,060


645
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,060


646
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,940
exactly what you just said, Dave.

647
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,220
Me too.

648
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,720
I've said that exact sentence

649
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,340
is on the tip of most Americans' tongues.

650
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,220
The only reason they're not all saying

651
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,840
exactly what you just said

652
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,400
is because they're not on this show.

653
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,140
Right.

654
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,440
Right.

655
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,060
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

656
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,140
Well, enough is enough goodwill,

657
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,620
you know, speaking spiritually.

658
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,820
We're all trying to do our bit.

659
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,040
We're all trying to do our part.

660
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,040
Well, Princess, we and I are hurrying

661
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,680
to pack up and go down to Texas

662
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,640
and save everybody.

663
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,240
We're going to take sponges.

664
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,200
I was going to ask you

665
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,880
how far Katie is

666
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,720
because I knew of some people

667
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,320
living in Katie who thought

668
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,280
that they were going to be okay

669
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,100
because it was on slightly higher ground

670
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,240
and then a bunch of it wasn't.

671
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,360
Living where?

672
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,360
Katie?

673
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:12,920
Katie.

674
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,780
How do you spell that?

675
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,520
K-A-T-Y.

676
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,360
It's a Houston, about an hour from Houston.

677
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,340
Oh.

678
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,680
A Beulah to Cleveland's worth of Houston.

679
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,300
Hmm.

680
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,560
About an hour drive

681
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,680
in a metaphorical laundromat automobile.

682
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,700
You know, like...

683
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:31,900
Oh, yeah.

684
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,700
Anybody...

685
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,780
Red-nosed reindeer.

686
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,640
They're underwater.

687
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,240
They're underwater.

688
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,260
The jackalopes are swimming

689
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,480
with little oxygen tanks on.

690
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,800
The jackalopes are swimming...

691
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,420
The rattlesnakes have tiny little oxygen tanks.

692
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,000
Scuba mast.

693
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,160
I love when you sing,

694
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,480
man.

695
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh.

696
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,060
Yeah, we, uh...

697
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,100
Uh, yeah.

698
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,060
Yep, yep.

699
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,200
Yep, we've got to move our entire...

700
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,520
This time we're going to move more

701
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,320
of the Subgenius Foundation archives

702
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,060
to the laboratory in Texas.

703
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,560
It's all going to end up...

704
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,960
First, it's all going to end up

705
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,200
lining the hallways

706
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,160
until we get our shed built.

707
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,280
We're going to have to get some Mennonites

708
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,860
to raise us a new barn

709
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,260
with an air conditioner in it.

710
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,500
Well, I know where you can get

711
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,160
a lot of cheap slave Mennonites,

712
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,580
just like you don't even have to go.

713
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,540
It's an Internet site

714
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,140
that you can actually go to,

715
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,000
and it's codified, you know.

716
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,280
Mennonites are us.

717
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,340
Mennonites and Amish and such.

718
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,780
Mennonites.com.

719
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,740
Mennonites and Amish and things.

720
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,860
What I don't like is when you see

721
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,320
a bunch of them smoking cigarettes,

722
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,300
driving, and now they're driving automobiles.

723
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,880
I've seen them drive automobiles.

724
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,780
I'm not talking about Mennonites

725
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,820
who are allowed to drive.

726
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
I'm talking about Amish people

727
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,580
driving motorized vehicles.

728
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,740
They can do that.

729
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,520
If they're working for somebody else,

730
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,440
that's perfectly legit.

731
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,800
They were always able to drive

732
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,900
if they were working for someone else.

733
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,260
Yeah, if they're working for the English,

734
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,060
they can fly jet planes

735
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,600
if the English are paying them.

736
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,100
Absolutely.

737
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,500
They're not a nice workaround.

738
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,160
They're still stupid.

739
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,080
Our friends that lived in Amish country

740
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,660
said that they have all kinds of

741
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,280
tricky ways of getting around their rules.

742
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,320
He's seen some of the fanciest

743
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,460
8-track deck speaker systems

744
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,940
in Amish buggies.

745
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,100
I'm not kidding, by the way.

746
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,440
That's not an exaggeration.

747
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,760
He really did know some Amish people

748
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,760
who had really, really good 8-track players

749
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,320
and killer speakers.

750
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:47,940
And they...

751
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,280
Well, some of the kids deck their buggies,

752
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,800
like lowriders, you know,

753
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,120
like...

754
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,380
Only it's not the kookarach.

755
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,040
It's a different bug that they're handling.

756
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,900
You know...

757
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,440
They're listening to Metallica

758
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,160
as they're trotting,

759
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,140
clopping down the road with their horses.

760
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,780
You nailed it, right?

761
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,560
Seriously, on the buggy.

762
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,360
Anyway, yeah, we need to...

763
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,580
I hear they have really good speed, too.

764
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,300
So we need to meet the Mennonites

765
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,740
and the Ammonites in North Texas

766
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,440
and get them to barn racing.

767
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,640
Yeah.

768
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,980
I honestly, we don't have...

769
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,140
The place in Texas is nearly as big

770
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,960
in terms of usable space

771
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,660
as the one in Cleveland Heights.

772
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,420
But it's a lot younger.

773
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,000
It's only about 50 years old

774
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,920
instead of 120.

775
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,320
Yes.

776
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,380
Well, what about naked Luciferians?

777
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,520
Well, you can't see...

778
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,140
There's naked Luciferians

779
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,940
all over both neighborhoods,

780
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,060
but in Cleveland Heights,

781
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,480
you can't walk around naked.

782
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,000
Out on the ranch, you could.

783
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,760
You can't?

784
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,680
But you just gotta watch out for the goats.

785
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,000
Because they don't...

786
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,960
If they don't like you, they'll butt you.

787
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,060
Right in the butt.

788
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,620
Yep.

789
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,240
I wouldn't want to walk bare naked

790
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,420
through a crowd full of ducks or geese

791
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,600
or any kind of wandering minstrels

792
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,180
like goats or something like that.

793
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,020
But, Dave, you know,

794
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,360
here we are talking nonsense

795
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,320
and we've got these public airwaves

796
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,620
and there's young and old people out there

797
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,340
who are, well, obviously,

798
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,960
if they're looking to us for advice,

799
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,060
they deserve what they get.

800
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,700
But...

801
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,080
But...

802
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,860
They may be looking to us for slack.

803
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,960
Oh, that's right.

804
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,120
So that for...

805
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,160
Just for one hour of slack,

806
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,940
they can briefly forget

807
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,160
their job

808
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,500
and it

809
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,260
and her

810
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,800
and him

811
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,420
and them

812
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,540
and that problem

813
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,300
down there.

814
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,960
No, not down there.

815
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,060
Further, a little bit lower.

816
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,820
Oh, yeah.

817
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,660
Oh, oh, oh, no.

818
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,840
No, up a little.

819
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,020
Up a little bit more.

820
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,400
No, no, no.

821
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,440
Harder, harder.

822
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,680
Harder.

823
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,080
I'm trying to squeeze.

824
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,400
Ow!

825
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,720
Yeah.

826
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,860
Now you're talking.

827
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,280
No, but seriously, there's people...

828
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,500
It was your idea to drink

829
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,740
precious bodily...

830
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,960
well-warmed over precious bodily fluids

831
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,040
and I took your advice.

832
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,440
There's people out there

833
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,320
that read Facebook and the news

834
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,800
and watch television...

835
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,180
Yeah, I've been to read my book.

836
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,820
A thousand times more

837
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,060
than I...

838
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,280
I do.

839
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,140
And they're so scared

840
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,700
and miserable and nervous

841
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,420
because they know

842
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,400
what's going on all the time.

843
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,400
They know how sick

844
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,420
all their friends are.

845
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,000
They know how jealous

846
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,620
they should be

847
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,500
of their other friends

848
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,740
who aren't on the internet

849
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,700
but are out hiking up and down

850
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,500
the Grand Canyon.

851
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,900
They know how scary

852
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,060
the weather is.

853
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,040
They know that the weather

854
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,840
is a thousand times more scary

855
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,360
than it's really going to be

856
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,220
unless it's a hurricane,

857
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,420
in which case it's the other way around.

858
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,420
And...

859
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,720
Yeah, there's people living

860
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,640
in anxiety and fear

861
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,540
all the time.

862
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,000
They're so scared

863
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,140
to quit looking at the TV

864
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,800
and the news

865
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,320
that they can't get around

866
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,620
to cleaning up their basement.

867
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,720
And so...

868
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,320
They're wading through paint cans

869
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,360
every time they come home from work.

870
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,900
Old paint cans

871
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,740
that are sealed up

872
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,600
and the paint in there is dried up

873
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,240
if there's any paint left at all,

874
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,040
but they still haven't got it.

875
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,920
They don't get rid of those paint cans.

876
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,420
The reason I know that

877
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,560
is because today,

878
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,360
we, Princess,

879
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,080
we and I sat on my porch

880
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,020
and opened

881
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,980
35 paint cans.

882
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,500
Easily.

883
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,680
And not a one of them was easy.

884
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,800
Oh my gosh, in Cleveland.

885
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,700
Well, the man will come

886
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,480
and take them away

887
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,320
if it's dry,

888
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,460
if they're dried out.

889
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,480
So...

890
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,780
And 90% of them were

891
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,100
and the rest are drying out.

892
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,460
But by golly,

893
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,340
it's hard to get

894
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,440
30-year-old paint cans open.

895
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:49,880
Yeah.

896
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,280
I had to just rip at them

897
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,860
with pliers, basically.

898
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,880
And why do they work

899
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,040
when they're not supposed to,

900
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,000
when they're supposed to decay

901
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,260
at a certain penumbridge?

902
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,820
You know, like in the...

903
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,700
When the ex-officiato guys

904
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,920
and the papal envoys

905
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,000
used to all hang out,

906
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,620
crowding into one

907
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,600
little small...

908
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,680
See, that made me feel

909
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,600
so much better,

910
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,960
what Dave just said.

911
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,680
That made me feel better

912
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,140
about everything.

913
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,340
My wrist,

914
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,000
my injured wrist

915
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,880
from prying the cans open,

916
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,960
it quit hurting.

917
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,680
Aww.

918
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,760
Dave, you're so good.

919
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,940
So, see, this show

920
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,820
is good for something.

921
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:23,900
Well, that's why

922
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,540
they call me Dr. Dave,

923
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,060
because I know just exactly

924
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,080
that his ankle was on fire there,

925
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,400
like he was talking about,

926
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,240
and then there was...

927
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,500
All that stuff was going on.

928
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,680
He's psyche.

929
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,660
Dr. Dave is such a good friend

930
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,260
and doctor that if your face

931
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,040
is on fire,

932
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,760
he won't just wait

933
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,740
for you to notice.

934
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,640
He'll let you know.

935
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,420
He'll tell you.

936
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,480
Man, that's a good doctor.

937
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,300
Before it burns off.

938
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,920
You know, a lot of your friends

939
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,500
will just go,

940
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,580
man, check it out.

941
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:48,940
He's a good doctor.

942
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:48,940


943
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:48,940


944
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:48,940


945
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,180
His face is on fire.

946
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,700
He didn't...

947
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,760
Let's wait until it's half burned off

948
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,460
and then tell him.

949
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,260
Yeah, look...

950
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,960
That's why most...

951
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,380
A lot of people are that way.

952
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,780
Probably half the folks out there

953
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,080
just let their friend's face burn off

954
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,680
because they think it's funny.

955
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,480
They're too cool

956
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,420
to even say anything.

957
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:04,920
Right.

958
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,080
And if you're...

959
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,300
They can sandwich

960
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,640
as far as they're concerned.

961
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,440
Right.

962
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,060
You know...

963
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,900
They really do...

964
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,960
They just can't...

965
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,280
They get out their marshmallows

966
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:16,940
and start toasting.

967
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,220
Princess,

968
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,920
we are your friends.

969
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,880
Your face is on fire.

970
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,240
Put your face out.

971
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,420
You don't have to come over there

972
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,600
and hit you with a face.

973
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,260
With my lips?

974
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:29,700
Okay.

975
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,280
Well, I told you.

976
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:31,800
I warned you.

977
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,140
That was a great

978
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,640
Doctors For Wotan song.

979
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,000
Remember that one?

980
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,300
Would you tell me

981
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,140
if my face was on fire?

982
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:41,900
Yeah.

983
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
I remember that.

984
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,280
Beautiful, beautiful...

985
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,700
Hey, man.

986
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,160
Hey, man.

987
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Your face is on fire.

988
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,400
Come on.

989
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,420
Come on.

990
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:48,480
Come on.

991
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


992
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


993
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


994
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


995
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


996
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


997
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


998
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,480


999
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,920
He set his faces on fire.

1000
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,140
So we can do Doctors For Wotan anytime.

1001
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,980
You just have to turn off the background music.

1002
00:46:59,140 --> 00:46:59,320
Right.

1003
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,100
This is very pretty.

1004
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,240
I must tell you,

1005
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,300
in a certain way,

1006
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,680
I've expressed myself.

1007
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,660
I don't want you to slap my finger.

1008
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,280
I would never, ever slap your finger, Dave.

1009
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,100
Never.

1010
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,140
We have a song about our dog, too.

1011
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,720
Hello, dammit, in the grass.

1012
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,340
Hello, dammit, in the grass.

1013
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,040
We're gonna kick some varmints, beep.

1014
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,560
I like to kick the varmints,

1015
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,380
beep, before laughing.

1016
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,740
It's wonderful to me.

1017
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,380
I don't remember how I get there,

1018
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,100
but it's a very, very special place

1019
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,200
in my heart.

1020
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,800
Is that your heart?

1021
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,060
That's what the kids are calling that thing now, huh?

1022
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,420
That's real clever.

1023
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,680
I like that.

1024
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,540
I like that.

1025
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,320
I like that.

1026
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1027
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1028
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1029
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1030
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1031
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1032
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1033
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1034
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,320


1035
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,880
You're mocking my vowels.

1036
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,300
That's a polite way of saying, you know.

1037
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, my heart is itching.

1038
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,600
Would you scratch it?

1039
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,180
I think we know what they mean.

1040
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:00,700
I forgot about that.

1041
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,620
I'm glad I always watch this.

1042
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,800
Honey, would you hold it while I run water through it?

1043
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,560
No, that one is very abstruse to me.

1044
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
I don't know exactly what that means.

1045
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,240
You'll figure it out later.

1046
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,940
Just thinking about it.

1047
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,100
You sure?

1048
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,800
Yeah.

1049
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,800
I'm going to be standing up all day wondering who licked the cow, what's wrong, and who

1050
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,860
invented it.

1051
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,360
When you figure it out, you'll get real turned on, and then you'll go looking for somebody

1052
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,500
to do that with.

1053
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,300
I ain't licking for nothing.

1054
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,020
I've already took enough lickings in my life.

1055
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,040
Right now, I'm standing up pure and proud.

1056
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,680
What nationality am I again?

1057
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,500
I think you should lick some abstruso myself.

1058
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,100
Abstruso?

1059
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,220
I thought some absinthe.

1060
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:44,560
Yes.

1061
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,100
Wouldn't that be better?

1062
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,220
Absinthe?

1063
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,160
Yeah.

1064
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,540
You could lick some absinthe.

1065
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,120
And then have some abstruso on top of it.

1066
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,520
Right.

1067
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,260
And some obscuro.

1068
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,260
Obscuro extemporadio.

1069
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,600
Yeah.

1070
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,960
And then side jokes for the nerdiest nerds.

1071
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:05,800
Exactly.

1072
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:06,560
Yeah.

1073
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,200
Well, we've all been in the same bowling alley constricted by our valve motions and kept

1074
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,780
asunder in our own little, little ways.

1075
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


1076
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


1077
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


1078
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


1079
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


1080
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,780


1081
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:22,180
rocking chairs, and they only let us out just a scant five minutes ago before sundown was

1082
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,760
going on.

1083
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,880
Next thing you know, we're all locked up again, you know?

1084
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,800
I mean, psychosomatically speaking.

1085
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,720
Right.

1086
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,060
Right.

1087
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:37,060
Because you wouldn't want that to really happen in the physical world because, well, I guess

1088
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,640
it is in a physical world in a lot of ways, but not enough to make me cry.

1089
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,980
Oh, virtual lockup's bad enough, man.

1090
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,980
Yep, they're not going to make me clench my bowels.

1091
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,940
Oh, you think they're not going to?

1092
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,620
Your bowels are already clenched.

1093
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,160
You just don't know it.

1094
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,380
You get used to it.

1095
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,120
You think it's normal.

1096
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,020
Of course I thought it was normal.

1097
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,680
What else am I supposed to think?

1098
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,560
Of course.

1099
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,980
Princess, I realize that we can't go to Trammell Fossil Park.

1100
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,180
Why is that?

1101
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,820
Because I'm going to be driving a truck.

1102
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,680
Yay.

1103
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,960
It'll take an extra day.

1104
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,420
It'll take an extra day of truck rental.

1105
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,100
Oh, that's right.

1106
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:17,580
No.

1107
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,600
We'll have to do it on the way back.

1108
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,760
We'll have to do it on the way home.

1109
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,220
Yeah.

1110
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:27,680
There's fossil parks in Ohio that have trilobites and trigger bites and stuff like that that

1111
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,920
we don't have in Texas.

1112
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,520
And they're on the way.

1113
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,940
And I had made plans to go there, but now we realize we can't haul a trailer.

1114
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,840
We can't do that.

1115
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,100
We've got to put everything in a truck.

1116
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,600
We can't do that.

1117
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,080
And then put the dog and the mom in the van.

1118
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,800
Because anything that ticks off smart people makes Trump supporters real happy.

1119
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,960
I don't exactly understand how you made that conclusion, but I like the cow come.

1120
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,420
Do you want me to say that one again?

1121
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,020
I'll happily say it.

1122
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:04,720
Would you please?

1123
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,780
Anything that ticks off smart people makes Trump supporters real happy.

1124
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,460
Is that insulting enough for somebody?

1125
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,160
Poor snowflakes.

1126
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,980
Poor snowflakes.

1127
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:21,560
Oh, the sissies are picking on me again.

1128
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,120
The nerds and sissies and queers and girls are picking on us big fat white boys.

1129
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,760
Hey, hey, I'm going to go play video games and escape the fact that I don't want to go

1130
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,740
apply for a job.

1131
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,620
Oh, no, this video game, it has girls in it.

1132
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,660
How queer.

1133
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,420
He kissed a girl.

1134
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,520
Girl.

1135
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,800
Girl.

1136
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,080


1137
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:43,360
Girl.

1138
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:43,580
Girl.

1139
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:43,780
Girl.

1140
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:43,780


1141
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:43,940
Girl.

1142
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:43,960


1143
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:43,960


1144
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:43,960


1145
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:43,960


1146
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:43,960


1147
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:43,960


1148
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,040
Girl.

1149
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:44,860


1150
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:44,860


1151
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:44,860


1152
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:44,860


1153
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:44,860


1154
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:44,860


1155
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,880
Everything is just reversed.

1156
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,100
It's all upside down and backwards.

1157
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,800
And inside out.

1158
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:50,700
Yeah.

1159
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,300
Yeah.

1160
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:52,620
Yeah.

1161
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,180
The moon goes behind the sun.

1162
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,780
The shadows are bright and the light bulbs cause darkness to come.

1163
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,500
It's just everything's upside down and backwards.

1164
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,240
It's all Ipswiched.

1165
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,760
It's Ipswiched.

1166
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:13,180
Did we talk at great length about the Osiris landing and the Wednesday?

1167
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,960
Yeah.

1168
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:13,960


1169
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:13,960


1170
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:13,960


1171
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:13,960


1172
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,540
The winter solstice?

1173
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,360
I mean, the eclipse?

1174
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:17,680
The eclipse.

1175
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,480
Well, did we?

1176
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:28,080
We, I think Dr. Legume and that orgasmic amplifier sort of broke the eclipse.

1177
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,260
It wasn't our fault, exactly.

1178
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:39,560
I mean, the instructions said to do it at certain dates, and one of them was the eclipse date, August 21st.

1179
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,260
That's probably what happened then.

1180
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,060
Well, but it was also my birthday.

1181
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,980
But why would that matter to somebody?

1182
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:53,200
I mean, those instructions date from 1952, I think.

1183
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,340
I wasn't even born then, so why would Bob care about my birthday?

1184
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,520
So I think that's a coincidence.

1185
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,880
But he might have known there was going to be an eclipse.

1186
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,320
Yes.

1187
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,460
Because they have charts of that kind of thing.

1188
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,980
Not that Bob would have to look it up.

1189
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It would be a lucky.

1190
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,800
It's a guess on Bob's part.

1191
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,060
That's all he has to do is guess, and it's always going to be a lucky guess.

1192
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,360
It's always going to be a guess.

1193
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,640
Even if he's wrong, it's going to end up being lucky for it.

1194
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,200
That's our Bob.

1195
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,820
That's the way it goes, and we're mighty damn glad about it, too.

1196
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,440
There's no way of getting around that.

1197
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,320
He makes a million dollars every time he screws up.

1198
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,460
Yeah.

1199
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,040
Yeah.

1200
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,680
That's Bob.

1201
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,740
Yeah, that's Bob.

1202
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,920
Yeah.

1203
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,080
Some people think that's like the cosmic and funny.

1204
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,720
line, and I don't think that is.

1205
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,340
I think that's one of the sell it to the rubes lines.

1206
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:57,000
That's the one that gets normals to send us $35 thinking they're real weirdos.

1207
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,460
Yeah, we're all dead.

1208
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,980
These subgeniuses, they're only in it for the money.

1209
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,400
Get it?

1210
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:02,960
Ha, ha, ha.

1211
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,420
That's funny.

1212
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:05,960
Okay.

1213
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,400
Whatever.

1214
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,660
I think I understand what you're saying now for certainly.

1215
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,260
You're saying that the Church of the Subgenius,

1216
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:18,880
some kind of ripoff hoisted on humanity by one guy who claims to be the world's greatest

1217
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,220
salesman, but it turns out he was a vacuum cleaner in not another lifetime.

1218
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,820
He sucks.

1219
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah.

1220
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,780
Bob sucks because he's a vacuum cleaner.

1221
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,340
Not only that, he's a Red Devil brand vacuum cleaner.

1222
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,460
Very powerful and satanic.

1223
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,720
Oh, he's a shark.

1224
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,600
Those are all vacuum cleaner brands, folks.

1225
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,980
Yeah, I was trying to think of something.

1226
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,560
I'm sorry.

1227
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,380
He's a Hoover.

1228
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,200
He's a regular Herbert Hoover.

1229
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:49,980
Oh, wait.

1230
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,380
No.

1231
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,840
Well, what about-

1232
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,300
Jay Edgar.

1233
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,520
He's a damn Jay Edgar, that Bob.

1234
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,140
He sucks.

1235
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,520
Buddy.

1236
00:54:59,340 --> 00:54:59,820
Hoover.

1237
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,920
Boy, that's really obscure.

1238
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:08,140
You know, because people born after a certain point, there's no such thing as a Hoover vacuum

1239
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,420
cleaner.

1240
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:08,780
Right.

1241
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,220
Or Kirby.

1242
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,840
There's Red Devils and Shark.

1243
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,380
They don't know what Kirby means.

1244
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,040
Right.

1245
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,380
And there's no Hoovers either because the DOJ is now the FBI and the PBM.

1246
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:17,960
Right.

1247
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,960
Kirby is a video game.

1248
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,380
It's not a vacuum cleaner.

1249
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:21,600
Yeah.

1250
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,960
And there's a lot of things that people born after a certain date, they don't even know

1251
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,760
the meaning of the word like honor, truth, honesty, wisdom, humility.

1252
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:34,660
Right.

1253
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,460
Those words, a CD, an LP, those don't mean anything to modern kids.

1254
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,520
Well, there's no-

1255
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,920
Film.

1256
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,840
They don't know what film is.

1257
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,960
When you think of going from, say for instance, from a cassette player-

1258
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,500
Knowledge.

1259
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,480
They don't know what that is.

1260
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,160
That's all just, that's all old stuff to them.

1261
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,240
Smells funny.

1262
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,520
Well, I don't know if they're getting their-

1263
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,060
Honesty.

1264
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,520
What's that?

1265
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,040
That's fake news.

1266
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,220
That smells funny.

1267
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,140
It's all musty.

1268
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,280
Smells like my grandpa's pipe.

1269
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:03,980
Phew.

1270
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,700
Now that's a mouthful.

1271
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,040
It smells like mom's ashtray.

1272
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,240
I don't understand that one.

1273
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1274
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1275
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1276
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1277
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1278
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1279
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,360
I don't understand that one either, but I know that's a very powerful image.

1280
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,460
And if you want to, like say, Dreyfus or one of those real famous guys from the 20th century

1281
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,740
and stuff, who like wear funny pants and dance around, make hand signals and gestures and

1282
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:31,380
stuff like that, you know, as well as I do, you've always must give the appearance of

1283
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,820
moving forward, never from side to side, because that's more like a Romanian acrobat or some

1284
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,560
kind of foreigner.

1285
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,220
But if you can keep your eyes on the prize, so to speak, and you can keep your eyes on

1286
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:42,220


1287
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,640
the prize, and follow the stinking star, you could come home in a bag.

1288
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,860
Cat, you in a bag.

1289
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,920
You need to bug out.

1290
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,120
And we're going to bug out of this show because it's about two minutes till the hour and we're

1291
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:01,900
getting ready for incoming show, which will probably pick up more listeners, I bet.

1292
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,600
Lately, Dr. Sinister's been getting more over, more internet listeners than we have.

1293
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,980
And all this time I've been calling you-

1294
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,220
That's-

1295
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,120
It's probably because I play such-

1296
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:19,620
I play such terrible music, such as this tune coming up from Dr. Argus, Argos fucking

1297
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,340
Argus Fox.

1298
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,100
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

1299
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,620
And the right-

1300
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,600
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

1301
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,680
And goes, good night, Dave.

1302
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,740
Good night, Dave.

1303
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,260
Good night, Dave.

1304
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:26,540


1305
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,800
The guy that's like football team, those jobs are not for him.

1306
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,300
Turns into a real estate agent who believes in discipline.

1307
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,020
The guy who's first!

1308
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,300
Just use cocaine, the wild boy breaking free

1309
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,860
He'll end up in a court of law as a prosecuting QC

1310
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,460
Remember the school captain, success is a matter of time

1311
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,780
You can hear him now as he screams

1312
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,160
Crack, you missed the stop sign

1313
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,680
Forget Snoop Doggy Dog, forget old iced tea

1314
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,940
True word, hell, that on the streets is produced by the DOT

1315
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,900
What's he used to striving?

1316
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,000
Life's road in front unravels

1317
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,480
We get to do the driving

1318
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,460
Don't choose the direction we travel

1319
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,020
Do your homework, your whack for weeks, go paint the goddamn line

1320
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,180
Don't matter much when you hear that scream

1321
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,760
Crack, you missed the stop sign

1322
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,440
Crack the stop sign

1323
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,080
Crack the stop sign

1324
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,220
Two, three, four

1325
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,500
Crack the stop sign

1326
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,720
Crack the stop sign

1327
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,160
Some time in the next two thousand years

1328
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,680
God's gonna wipe out the streets of man

1329
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,180
I'm banging on a gun before I end the year of town

1330
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,900
Here's to the arts and junkie

1331
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,120
Porky to napkin

1332
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:39,440
I'm a man of the arts

1333
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:39,720
I'm a man of the arts

1334
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,000
With a tragic waste of potential

1335
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,480
We the chumpies on the street either

1336
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,100
Close your door to what you got

1337
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,500
You're the fruit of their mind

1338
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,260
Who cares what you reap

1339
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,880
It's Crack, you missed the stop sign

1340
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,780
You're the fruit of their mind

1341
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,140
You're the fruit of their mind

1342
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,140


1343
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,180
You're the fruit of their mind

1344
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,380
But I thought just the other day

1345
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,680
Man, could that baby run?

1346
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,500
But you know what they always say

1347
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,840
He's always a better one

1348
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,480
He's got a tumor in my brain

1349
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,120
He's creeping to my lungs

1350
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,460
And I search around in grief

1351
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,980
If I need a better one

1352
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,940
Oh, I need to wait to watch the answer question

1353
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:39,420
They're going to throw this out there

1354
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:39,420


1355
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:39,420


1356
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:39,420


1357
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,140
They're throwing us out of batter

1358
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,740
A choice is a matter of waiting to see

1359
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,540
So kids, yeah you can do it

1360
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,740
You can be your best

1361
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,220
But girls can do anything

1362
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,460
Except be presidents

1363
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:49,620
I'm ok

1364
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,540
You're ok

1365
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,220
We're ok

1366
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:51,900
We're fine

1367
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,660
Thought I heard a city dreamer

1368
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,140
Crack, you missed the stop sign

1369
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,240
Crack, the stop sign

1370
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,460
Crack, the stop sign

1371
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,340
Crack, the stop sign

1372
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,560
Crack, the stop sign

1373
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:07,760
Crack, the stop sign

1374
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,220
Crack, the stop sign

1375
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:09,400
Crack, the stop sign

1376
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:09,400


1377
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:09,400


1378
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,120
Break the sound time

1379
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,180
Break the sound time

1380
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,000
Break the sound time

1381
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah!
