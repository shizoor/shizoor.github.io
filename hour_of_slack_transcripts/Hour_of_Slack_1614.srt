1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
In obtaining this record, you have taken the first step towards self-improvement, toward attaining those goals that are important to you.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,180
Not that this or any other record contains any magical powers, or that any spoken words have the power to transform you in any way.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,120
The power is within you, within your mind, and more specifically, within that part of your mind of which you most likely are unaware.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,720
The Self-Genius Power of Swagging!

5
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,140
I did get to be on his show, and here it is.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,580
That turning point through the daily in-depth study of God's Word.

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,320
We are quickly lining up. We want to see you. We want to help you.

8
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,720
And I want you not to miss Dallas tomorrow night.

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,720
Please put it on your calendar. Get there. Be there.

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,100
It's going to be a night unlike any that city has ever seen.

11
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,500
And Dallas has seen some pretty strange things.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,080
So don't miss it for anything.

13
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,060
And speaking of some pretty strange things, before I get to the rest of you callers out there at 1-800-821-TALK,

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,940
we've got some publicity.

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,920
There are some publicity seekers out there.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,360
They are a strange bunch.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
Maybe someday we'll do a larger show on them.

18
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,040
But I wanted to talk to them briefly because some of them plan to be there tomorrow night.

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Yes, I am aware of them.

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,700
I have been sent their literature through the years and have never really talked to one of these particular people.

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,580
But some of you may be aware of the Church of the Subgenius and their God, Bob.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,340
At least they have good taste, tongue in cheek.

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,900
And I've got one of their representatives on the line with me right now, direct from Dallas.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,500
Ivan Stang.

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:02,980
Ivan!

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,240
Oh, Bob, at long last.

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,220
You are the current church leader of the Church of the Subgenius.

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,260
Well, I just work here, Bob.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,820
I'm working for Mr. Dobbs.

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,240
Bob Dobbs.

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,180
Right, Bob Dobbs.

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,260
I'll tell you, I'm so glad to finally be on your show.

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,600
I've been listening for years.

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,780
Years?

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,760
Well, especially around Halloween.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,300
I love your Halloween shows.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,180
Now, how have I managed to fail by not getting through your thick head after all these years to get you from Bob to God?

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,680
Oh, you, Bob, you have saved me so many times.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,940
I have converted over to Christianity almost every time I ever listen to your show.

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,880
And then go back.

41
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,340
Well, we believe in the short-duration personal savior phenomenon.

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,680
Bob Dobbs himself considers himself a short-duration personal savior.

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,140
Now, come on.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Now, you people have really had...

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:04,120
10,000 people ante up $30 a piece to join this internet religion, this religion of the

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,580
quickie printer, tabloid-style cigar-smoking, pipe-smoking God who will come to Earth soon

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,040
to take everybody away in pleasure saucers.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
You've really gotten people to pay $30 a piece?

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,940
Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,620
Absolutely.

51
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,220
And we've sold about 100,000 copies of our books.

52
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,940
Okay.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,440
So what now?

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,300
I mean, we've been around for 20 years.

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,980
Now, in a nutshell...

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,860
Now, for the people out there who've never heard of this sort of thing before, you are

57
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,140
what?

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,420
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is a religion that Bob started specifically to help the

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,720
mutants, the misfits, the disbelievers, and also those who would believe anything in our

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,260
fight against the conspiracy of the normal people.

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,880
But you're definitely not normal.

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,300
Nobody's going to ever accuse you of that.

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,980
Well, in that respect, I think we probably have a lot in common, Bob.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
All right.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,960
All right.

66
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,460
TouchÃ©.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,500
You believe that the world is due for demolition on July the 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.?

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,240
Praise Bob.

69
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,260
That is correct.

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,900
52 days from now.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,780
And if it doesn't happen?

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,520
What kind of a question is that?

73
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,080
I mean, you think we're going to end up looking ridiculous like those poor little religious

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,660
nuts here in Garland right around the corner from me?

75
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,540
Remember the...

76
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,220
Oh, yes.

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,100
Yes.

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,140
God's Salvation Church.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,540
Yeah, the Taiwanese folks.

80
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,920
Yeah, they happen to just be very, very nearby.

81
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,040
I went over there and gave them my $30 just in case, you know.

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,880
We've been telling people to have faith in Bob.

83
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,080
I figure I might as well practice what I preached for once.

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,220
Now, you say it's...

85
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,620
In your literature, you say it's not too late to be saved.

86
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,600
All you have to do is send $30 to Bob.

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,380
And I want folks to understand this is not Bob Larson.

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,580
This is Bob Dobbs the God.

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,420
Oh, Bob?

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah.

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Yeah, Bob Dobbs is probably a lot cheaper for salvation than you are, Bob.

92
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,120
And you can eternal salvation or triple your money back.

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,440
It's not a bad deal now, is it?

94
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,560
Well, how do you know if you don't get it to get your money back?

95
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Well, you'll have to cross that bridge when you come to it.

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,120
Now, some people...

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,760
Let me put it this way.

98
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,560
If you end up in hell as a result of investing $30 in Bob Dobbs' church,

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,100
he will meet you at the gates of hell with a check for $90 and a little booklet called

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,540
How to...

101
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,640
Enjoy Hell for Five Cents a Day.

102
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
It's $89.95, I think.

103
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:36,960
Now, other than having a good laugh and creating something out of minds that otherwise would

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,140
be wasted on something probably even worse than this, what are you people up to?

105
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,680
Basically, Bob, we've declared war on God.

106
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,280
Now, I know that that sounds...

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,380
I mean, that's kind of taken on a big job.

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,040
We've been pulling God's leg for a long time.

109
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
And that's a very large leg.

110
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,680
It takes a lot of nerve, and you damn well better be funny if you're going to do it.

111
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,800
But we have gotten so sick and tired of this invisible monster that everybody keeps talking about

112
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,320
that is so weak and pathetic that it has to be defended by illiterate little old ladies

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,660
and rednecks against jerks like me.

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Now, what kind of a God is that?

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,560
We're just sick and tired of putting up with it.

116
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,600
This thing's been, you know, allowing...

117
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,440
Starvation and hunger and all this stuff all over the world.

118
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,200
We've just had enough.

119
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,980
They've been telling us for years we were going to go to hell.

120
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,700
What else could we do but start our own religion?

121
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,340
Are you guys going to be there tomorrow night?

122
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,300
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

123
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,080
Now, we don't plan any kind of disruptions.

124
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,880
We're generally very polite folks.

125
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,260
Well, you're going to see God tomorrow night.

126
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,440
You're going to see God in action.

127
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,740
You're going to see the supernatural like you've never seen it before.

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,240
Then what?

129
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,700
Well, if I'm impressed, I'm sure I'll convert.

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,440
I've...

131
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,040
And put $30 in the offering.

132
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,940
Many gods have a lot of chances,

133
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,900
and I've worshipped many, many gods and demons,

134
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,100
but, you know, I always end up coming back to old Bob Dobbs.

135
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,140
Now, there are people out there who probably think

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,660
you are some secret friend of mine that I just put up to this for comic relief.

137
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,540
I don't know.

138
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,540
You haven't mentioned.

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,160
You people contacted me this week and said,

140
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,340
Oh, by the way, since Bob's coming to Dallas,

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,460
maybe he'd like to talk to us.

142
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,380
Oh, yeah.

143
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,500
We happen to have been, you know,

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,940
because our end of the world is coming up very soon,

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,080
we've been on kind of a big PR blitz.

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,100
And I'll tell you what, Bob,

147
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,640
it is a big relief for me to talk to somebody

148
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,000
with even the slightest bit of sense,

149
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,380
because mostly I've been on the radio with drive-time classic rock jocks,

150
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,600
which is the lowest form of life on earth.

151
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,300
You and I absolutely agree.

152
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,400
And I'd rather be talking to a fellow religious nut

153
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
than one of these normals, if you don't mind,

154
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,040
you know, present company excluded.

155
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,800
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,260
I have Richard on the line.

157
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,420
Richard, you called in a second ago to ask a question about this guy.

158
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,220
What's your question, Richard?

159
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,260
Yeah, I wanted to know if basically if this kind of thing was serious.

160
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, friends.

161
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,920
Oh, man.

162
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,620
I forgot how funny all that stuff was.

163
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:24,540
This guy called in who he was actually the guy from the alt dot.

164
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,820
Fan dot Bob dash Larson News Group,

165
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,760
which is not really a Bob Larson fan club.

166
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,860
They actually kind of make fun of the guy and so forth.

167
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,360
And this anti-Bob Larson guy called up and said,

168
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,420
Reverend Stang, what are you doing on the air with this adulterous radio preacher?

169
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,300
And I knew what he was talking about, Bob Larson.

170
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,200
Bob Larson has had some problems in that respect,

171
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,460
much like our current acting president.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,840
You know, some guys just have these organs.

173
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,860
And I jumped in and said, you must be talking about me.

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm sure you're not talking about Bob Larson.

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,060
And the caller said, well, basically they censored him.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,380
Yeah.

178
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,780
He was totally, completely removed from all human reality.

179
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:40,460
Oh, but check out what Larson tuned in as he faded back in after the, you know, censored out stuff.

180
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,480
He fades back in going, well, you know, I've got a lot more nuts calling me than you have in your whole religion.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,660
And, you know, friends, he's right.

182
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,980
And it's kind of a sad commentary, isn't it?

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,220
I've got more nutcases who listen to me than follow you.

184
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:11,640
And we're not going to glorify these idiots out there and jerks who try to take advantage of religious fanatics like you to attack sane people like me.

185
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:19,460
But, Ivan, I want to know, in all seriousness, how many people belong to your religion?

186
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,340
It's just you and a couple of buddies.

187
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,380
Where do you get the figure of 10,000?

188
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,420
No, we, Bob, quite simply.

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,200
Seriously, we have four books that have been published by Simon & Schuster, the first one being Book of the Subgenius.

190
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,520
It's still in print.

191
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,460
About 100,000 copies is sold.

192
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,800
I've printed, well, 60,000 or 70,000 copies of our little pamphlet, our equivalent of one of those chick comics.

193
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,900
And we have had at least 10,000 members sign up over, I mean, we've been around for 15 years.

194
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,180
Bob predicted that there would be millions of them and that we would have taken over the world by now.

195
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
But I think the conspiracy read Bob's prophecies, too.

196
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,340
And prophecy heeded is prophecy fulfilled.

197
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,840
And you are the sacred scribe of the church.

198
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm the one, I'm the guy who has to do a lot of the dirty work, yeah.

199
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,380
I assign the sacrifices and that kind of thing.

200
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,300
All right, well, I tell you what, one of these days we're going to get you back and talk a little longer.

201
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:25,420
I would suggest, however, beware those little old illiterate ladies, as you refer.

202
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I referred to them a moment ago.

203
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,060
Because there are some godly women of the Lord who deeply resent what you just said.

204
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:42,020
And they are going to kick your spiritual butt with the power of prayer if you show up on Friday night.

205
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,640
So beware.

206
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:54,940
Those people that you denigrate have got more spiritual power and common eternal horse sense.

207
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,420
And they're looking for you.

208
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,420


209
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,420


210
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,420


211
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,120
But this little finger than you've got in a lifetime of pursuing illicit religions.

212
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,140
And they're ready to take you on and they're ready to pray you into the kingdom.

213
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,440
So I say prayer warriors, my friends in Dallas, be there.

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,460
As you can see, it's going to be an interesting evening.

215
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I got David on the line.

216
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,300
Hello, David.

217
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,240
Let's go from the ridiculous to the sublime.

218
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,600
David.

219
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,900
There are so many logical and thoroughly possible ways in which the entire tribe of mankind.

220
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,520
time could be wiped off the earth at any moment hey hey why don't you knock on that trap door

221
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:40,680
there and say y'all three times go ahead do it man okay y'all y'all no i'm not gonna say it the

222
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,980
third time because you know i won't get one i didn't think i was gonna that's right that's right

223
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:53,940
i know your tricks last time i did i had bad luck for 10 years man that's where old me mr

224
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,320
mr tooth decade that's right and then ultimately that was because of your truth decay when one

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,080
stops to think what a tiny little grain of sand this haughty world of ours actually is in the dark

226
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,700
sea of space the spectacle of man's inhumanity to man becomes a cosmic joke what's interesting to a

227
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:23,540
dog to run to a hunter with a pack to kill uh master uh uh mr bush says my opponent

228
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:32,640
wants dick it's wrong to cross against the cars and when i'm president we will tell scientists

229
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,060
that they can't lead the world against the computers

230
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,640
i want dick certainly the president's very large and very important

231
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,700
there you go large and important friends uh thanks lemur

232
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,860
and artemia celina

233
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:07,400
and welcome dear friends to hour of slack number 1614 and we're going to start with a rant

234
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:17,460
a rant called i have no ass and i must by roger n a

235
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,920
formerly known as the good reverend roger now roger n a

236
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,740
routique

237
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,160
boys there talking about more thrifting people and the

238
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
rd

239
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,940
i'm

240
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:03,040
Now, I normally do not soil myself with human politics, but it's impossible to avoid this

241
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,680
time around.

242
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:11,100
The moment you turn on the TV or the internet, an avalanche of raw sewage pours out and ruins

243
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,860
the carpet.

244
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:19,280
It's like a production line making assholes, one right after another, and there's no getting

245
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
away from it.

246
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,540
So, I've stopped trying, and so I'm going to do my part to push this bad puppy right

247
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,680
off the cliff.

248
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,240
It's not a time to keep a straight face, and life is going to be very, very hard on those

249
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,060
who aren't serious about having a good time.

250
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,840
And I plan on having a very good time indeed.

251
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,800
Who can blame me?

252
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,960
Actual, real, no bull.

253
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,060
Bullshit Nazis are coming out of the woodwork thinking their day has come.

254
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:01,720
The hills are alive with the sound of hayseeds and Klan members screeching and touching themselves

255
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,740
in triumph.

256
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,900
But the funny thing is, even though their guy won, nothing is working out for him.

257
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,600
The senate is a tangled mess, the courts are publicly urinating on executive orders, and

258
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,660
the people who voted for Trump are devouring themselves.

259
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:19,940
Oh, that's just the way things are.

260
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:19,940


261
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:19,940


262
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:27,220
spitting out bits of their own skin as they proclaim that America is going to be great again.

263
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,920
It is. You just watch.

264
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,080
Never mind that people in Kentucky don't look happy at their victory,

265
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,440
or West Virginia, or the suddenly impoverished cattle kings in Texas and New Mexico.

266
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,440
Never mind that some po-buckers are starting to mumble about their health care

267
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,080
as if they suddenly realized that all the things Trump said apply to them too,

268
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,200
and that this is real, not just showing those liberals a thing or two.

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,140
Richard Spencer got a flying elbow to the jaw,

270
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,020
and the alt-right started asking where the liberal tolerance went.

271
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,660
But we were all too busy laughing to listen.

272
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,040
A long time ago, a few crusty old subgeniuses talked about

273
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,420
the fact that we were all so busy laughing that we couldn't even listen.

274
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,420


275
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,840
The coming weird times.

276
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,400
Well, those times are here now, and they're going to get a lot weirder.

277
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,880
I'm okay with that.

278
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm on the crazy train with the primates,

279
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,860
making choo-choo noises while the boiler overheats,

280
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,740
and I wouldn't trade it for anything!

281
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,340
Well, almost anything.

282
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,720
I'd kind of like for my aging parents to have health insurance and all that good stuff,

283
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,220
but since that isn't going to happen,

284
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,380
why not roll the state down the stairs just to hear it crash?

285
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,060
I've become an unrepentant wrecker,

286
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,420
and I make no apologies for it.

287
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,840
This is, after all, what 61 million people demanded.

288
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,720
They, being the idiotic hominids they are,

289
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,020
wanted an administration that would pay attention to them.

290
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,080
Be careful what you wish for, stupid humans.

291
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,660
This is exactly why you can't have nice things.

292
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,060
But you and I, dear listener,

293
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,300
we're Yeti, and we will not be governed!

294
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,560
We wobble.

295
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,600
We oscillate.

296
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,560
When you crush us in the fist of the state,

297
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,560
we just sort of ooze out between its fingers

298
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,820
and dance off down the street laughing

299
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,740
and happy slapping passing po-buckers.

300
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,740
They may have two million people under arms

301
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,420
and twice as many people under arms,

302
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,100
and twice as many police,

303
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,240
but we have Bob.

304
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
They may have the banks,

305
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,060
but we have slack.

306
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,900
They may have twelve aircraft carriers,

307
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,020
but we have Dr. Legame and G. Gordon Gordon.

308
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,340
Even if he had to leave the country for reasons best left unspoken.

309
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,380
Orton Nenslow once said that if you,

310
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,260
quote,

311
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,780
freak the mundanes,

312
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,660
they'll find ways to make sure you wish you were never born.

313
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,020
But they're doing that anyway,

314
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,860
so why not take them with us?

315
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,420
Why not skip merrily along into the apocalypse

316
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,360
with your pants full of shit

317
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,600
and a stupid grin on your face?

318
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,400
Anyway,

319
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,860
that's why I can't rant anymore.

320
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,320
Or kill me!

321
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,080
Well, kill Reverend Roger N.A., friends, actually.

322
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,520
He wrote that, I didn't.

323
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,900
But hey, here's a pertinent and brand new song

324
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,480
from an upcoming album, an unreleased album,

325
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,980
by Exposed Foreheads.

326
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,840
You're hearing it here first.

327
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,580
Push Me by Exposed Foreheads.

328
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,980
I understood you everything,

329
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,220


330
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,220


331
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,400
I want you to see

332
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,400


333
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,400


334
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,320
And we're free.

335
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,620
Or representing your paymentÃ©rÃ© næ¿.

336
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,880
la muita n Health quiere,

337
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,780
suda aè¯´?

338
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,280
Au revoir!

339
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,920
Bye bye!

340
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,720
Me cerro yo que voy

341
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:38,880
Yo elegante

342
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:38,880


343
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm your family

344
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,240
You have driven me mad Wei

345
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,040
Hook her up, gonna raise the bar

346
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,500
Time's up, show us where you are

347
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,560
Step up, it's time to commit

348
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,100
Plane to sea, we all stepped in it

349
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,620
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

350
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,780
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,880
Mark my words, time will come

352
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,260
Step up, we're here for fun

353
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,580
We want it now, we want more

354
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,740
We're not the droids you're looking for

355
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,520
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

356
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,760
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

357
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,700
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

358
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,680
Oh-eh-oh

359
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,220
Oh-eh-oh

360
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,480
Oh-eh-oh

361
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,780
Oh-eh-oh

362
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,040
Oh-eh-oh

363
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,860
Oh-eh-oh

364
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,240
Oh-eh-oh

365
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh-eh-oh

366
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:02,940
Hey!

367
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,340
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

368
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,580
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

369
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,800
It's a joke, it's not funny

370
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,040
Open the cage, I'm not your monkey

371
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,320
Here's the judge, here's the steeple

372
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,740
Open the cage, I'm not your monkey

373
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,080
Here's the judge, here's the steeple

374
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,640
Open the cage, free the people

375
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,560
Time's up, we won't behave

376
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,160
This ain't your new wave

377
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,340
Step up, it's time to commit

378
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,880
Claim to seed, we all stepped in it

379
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,420
Let your pants down, gonna dance now

380
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,700
Lead me to the ledge, push me to the edge

381
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,640
Oh-eh-oh

382
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh-eh-oh

383
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,460
Oh-eh-oh

384
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,520
Oh-eh-oh

385
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,080
Oh-eh-oh

386
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,740
Oh-eh-oh

387
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,640
Oh-eh-oh

388
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:03,640


389
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,680
Let your pants down

390
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,260
Gonna dance now

391
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,780
Lead me to the ledge

392
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,360
Push me to the edge

393
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,740
Amazing!

394
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,280
Amazing!

395
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,560
Push Me by Exposed Foreheads.

396
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,080
And that band name is spelled starting with an X,

397
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,360
and the second word begins with the numeral 4.

398
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,900
And now we have another subgenius rant.

399
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,820
In fact, it's a live, all-new,

400
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,140
Subgenius 101 type of introductory rant

401
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,760
by Reverend Baby Bear,

402
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,200
delivered at the 2017 Winter Star Ball in Cleveland

403
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,340
at the Beachland Ballroom.

404
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,560
But it is sadly incomplete, friends.

405
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,040
Neighbor Joe recorded it on his phone,

406
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,940
but it ran out of batteries after five minutes.

407
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,520
And he started kind of late,

408
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,220
so he caught her just as she started explaining

409
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,780
the conspiracy.

410
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,500
This is THE conspiracy,

411
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,300
or, as we call it,

412
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,800
The Con for short.

413
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,420
And believe me,

414
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,540
they are in fact looking to con you.

415
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,920
The conspiracy lives within all of us.

416
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,260
Yes, you too.

417
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,740
And you, yes.

418
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,220
You, all of you.

419
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,420
And many of those responsible don't even know they're part of a conspiracy.

420
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,240
It's that insidious.

421
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,280
It's that need to squash the weird, the strange, and the different.

422
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,540
That need to shave off

423
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,120
all the rough edges

424
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,920
until you leave everything smooth and regular.

425
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,640
The idea that you can buy your way to happiness

426
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,760
if you only got that new car,

427
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,880
or the right brand of beer,

428
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,720
or picked up that new gizmo or gadget to complete you and make you whole.

429
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,200
But, of course,

430
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,780
your slack lies not within what you can buy.

431
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,860
Slack is here to set you free from the bonds of the conspiracy.

432
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,200
Free,

433
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,600
from the guilt and the insecurity and the falseness.

434
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,900
Free for $35.

435
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,940
All of that is free for $35.

436
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,060
Now what kind of a deal is that?

437
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,420
It's a good one by golly.

438
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,240
We're the only church to offer you your money back guarantee,

439
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,420
salvation,

440
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,460
or triple your money back.

441
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,800
If you find yourself at the gates of hell with no Bob in sight,

442
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,180
we will be there for you.

443
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
We will give you triple your money back.

444
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,100
The fact that we've never had to offer such a refund

445
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,140
should be proof positive

446
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,160
that what we are selling is bona fide and true.

447
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,260
Why,

448
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,920
could we possibly stay in business if we were liars?

449
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,780
Of course not.

450
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,340
Wouldn't the free market separate the chaff from the wheat

451
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,100
and we'd be on the cutting room floor?

452
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,580
Capitalism in action!

453
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,900
Praise Bob, this system works!

454
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,300
Praise Bob!

455
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,880
Now there is another important aspect to this church

456
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
that I would like to expound upon,

457
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,340
and that is X Day.

458
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,800
Now we all know that we're here for Starwood,

459
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,040
but did you all know that there is another weirdo festival

460
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,120
that takes place at Wisteria before Starwood?

461
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,860
Yes!

462
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,000
It's going!

463
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,580
It's called X Day,

464
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,580
and this year is the year.

465
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,100
It's finally,

466
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,320
1998.

467
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,280
Every subgenius worth his bath salts

468
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,100
knows that the world will end on July 5th, 1998.

469
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,360
We also know, of course, that 1998 has yet to come.

470
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,700
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

471
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,060
Duh.

472
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,180
The conspiracy has attempted to hijack the calendar

473
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,380
so we don't quite know what year it is.

474
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,020
But I am so very confident

475
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,000
that this year will finally be the year

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,280
that the Xists come

477
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,900
to sweep us up into the boundless pleasures of space

478
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,580
and leave the world a burning cinder behind us.

479
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,080
Yes.

480
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
There is another reason to get right with Bob,

481
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,040
aside from the wisdom of his infinite stupidity.

482
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,280
Bob struck a deal with a group of beings known as the Xists.

483
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,920
They were able to agree on a date,

484
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,120
July 5th, 1998,

485
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
as the time that destruction would befall

486
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,980
this benighted and belligerent dustball that we are all upon.

487
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,980
And that subgeniuses alone would be spared from this calamity

488
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,620
to be taken aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

489
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,300
or sex gods,

490
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,960
or amorphous shape-shifting aliens,

491
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,560
or whatever it is that you're into,

492
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,360
no judgement here.

493
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,180
And with them,

494
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,040
we would fly through space forever

495
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,520
and know the bountiful pleasures of slap.

496
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,520
It's so crazy, it must be true!

497
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,720
In...

498
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,480
Oh, thank you.

499
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
In closing,

500
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,980
if seeing advertisements for fast food

501
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,540
can cause your mind to go screaming,

502
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,220
screaming through time and space,

503
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,160
and break down into an existential crisis,

504
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,460
if watching a co-op worker twirl their hair

505
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,760
makes you feel like you're going to murder someone,

506
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,180
if the bland realities of this world

507
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,000
can cause mental trauma

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,480
until you don't know if you're crying from laughing

509
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,940
or laughing from...

510
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,480
Crying.

511
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,860
I'm crying.

512
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,520
Because the tape ran out,

513
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,220
and we never get to hear the rest of Reverend Baby Bear's rant.

514
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,940
About the only thing that's going to make me feel any better about that

515
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,580
is cheery music.

516
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,880
In this case, an instrumental by Reverend Robert R.

517
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,620
called...

518
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,300
The Goats! They March!

519
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,100
The Goats, The TheoryGills!

520
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,760
And they throw their own silly,

521
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:11,760


522
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:11,760


523
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:11,980
about sacred Luke!

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

533
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
Thank you.

534
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,280
Thank you.

535
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,300
Thank you.

536
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,300
Thank you.

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,480
Thank you.

538
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,040
Thank you.

539
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Thank you.

540
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,100
Thank you.

541
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,540
Thank you.

542
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,140
Thank you.

543
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,720
Thank you.

544
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,380
Thank you.

545
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,380


546
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,380


547
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
Is that a live one on the Satanist line?

548
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,420
Patch them through to me. I'm in the mood.

549
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,400
Thanks. Hello, this is Satan.

550
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,980
Can I help you? Hello?

551
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,440
Yes. Yes, real time.

552
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,400
Your altar is working. Prayer is

553
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,060
answered. Metroton here, aka

554
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,580
Satan. Hello. I hope you are well.

555
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,640
Use your head. I don't

556
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,440
need a phone, because I am the devil,

557
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,380
as you call him. As you have called

558
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,280
me. If you're a thinker, it's because

559
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,320
every atom vibrates, and we Archangels

560
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,940
can tune frequencies. Whoa!

561
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,740
Smart kid.

562
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,340
Okay. Satisfied? No hidden

563
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,380
devices anywhere in that ritual space you

564
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,160
just smashed up? And now stage

565
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,360
two, panic. Easy. Deep

566
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,220
breaths. Relax. It's okay.

567
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,260
Can I tell you a joke? You

568
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,340
cracks me up

569
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,420
how solemnly you fools always do the magic

570
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,340
right up until you find it really working.

571
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,320
Okay.

572
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,460
No, no. It always works. Just this

573
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,320
one time, I decided not to ignore

574
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,360
you punks with your hoary old orisons, and I

575
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,320
picked up. Please don't make me regret it.

576
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,800
Yeah, this is really.

577
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,120
You skipped ahead to the cynical phase.

578
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,440
The fawning worship is boring, but

579
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,420
not so fast. I will have

580
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,600
your respect. I am he whom you called

581
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,700
up. Metroton, the fired Archangel.

582
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,360
You're still

583
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,460
there. Well, thank you, since you addressed

584
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,560
me as sir. Yes, I'll take a few questions,

585
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,380
but no. No, no. I'm

586
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,440
not in the wish-granting business. Never was.

587
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,420
And this is not even my name.

588
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,560
You know who you get when you call up like this?

589
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,120
Not Satan. Sanitation.

590
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,440
This is my office line. I'm chief

591
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,560
of psychic discharge, disposal, and recycling.

592
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,420
No, the only joke

593
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,600
is how you humans can abuse the gift

594
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,300
of faith. One guy writes

595
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,400
down something he pulled out of his ass, and soon

596
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,320
you're all taking it like it's fact. This is a

597
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,380
serious problem you have. Like, call

598
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,260
in me the evil one? Like thinking

599
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,920
garbage men are made of garbage.

600
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,820
Well, good luck telling anyone.

601
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,620
Oh, psychic discharge.

602
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,320
Or karma clean-up? You could call us the

603
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,200
ultimate spa and recreation center.

604
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,300
Yeah, but listen, it is

605
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,400
no fun trying to force your way down

606
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,580
here. Got that? No guards,

607
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,980
no heroic struggles, just

608
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,280
suicides are plopped alone into a

609
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,620
hideous nightmare swamp.

610
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,440
Eventually they do, but

611
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,260
that's right, we don't burn

612
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
anything. The only hellfire

613
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,980
is a few fanatically devout

614
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,500
arrivals who immolate themselves with frustrated

615
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,160
blind faith and goddamn pride.

616
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,240
We try yelling over and over between

617
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,400
their shrieks, only you can stop this.

618
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,300
We can't. But, oh, you think

619
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
that's cool, huh? Jesus.

620
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Yeah, I do, in fact. He and I

621
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,260
are on okay terms, and I'm still

622
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,180
employed by the same wise and wonderful

623
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
boss in a vital, mostly boring

624
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,040
career with duties and benefits.

625
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,220
I like it. The good life is the same

626
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,820
everywhere, kid. A mix of...

627
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,680
May I suggest you first

628
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,560
get a life before suggesting I've

629
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,820
sold out? I know, you wanted a big

630
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,540
badass rebel for chaos!

631
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,220
Welcome to reality.

632
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,980
No, you listen! I don't give one preacher's

633
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,660
toasted gonad, if you believe me or not.

634
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,940
You need to hear this. My staff and I lost

635
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,600
the human power contract because we were

636
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,700
just like you, young and proud and smart, yet

637
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,680
too dumb to know how little we really

638
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,640
knew. I'm glad we got schooled and moved

639
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,620
into garbage where more engineers ought to be put.

640
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,880
I'm sorry, I started dumping on you.

641
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,520
What's your name, son?

642
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,840
You're welcome, David. And again, sir,

643
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,720
I apologize. I bet too many

644
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,860
yell at you already. I can

645
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,340
do better. Little friendly advice?

646
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,860
Life's a constant balancing act,

647
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,580
like a seesaw rocking between

648
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,000
ideal and practical, self-defense

649
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,840
and giving. I'm no one special,

650
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,880
yet I am special.

651
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,740
Best way to find the sweet spot each time

652
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,560
is to start low-key, participating.

653
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,800
Two ears, one mouth? Chill

654
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,760
is best. Yeah, that says it. You're a

655
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
thinker. You keep a journal? Aye.

656
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm really glad I met you,

657
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,020
David. You're a righteous dude.

658
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,720
Thank you, but don't get a big head about this, okay?

659
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,780
We met purely by chance, just

660
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,360
like winning the lottery. Well,

661
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,680
can't say I never even give Satanis the time

662
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,700
of day. Sometimes I do. At the

663
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,160
tone, the time will be

664
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,300
wasted! Tom!

665
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,420
Tom! Tom! It's only

666
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,100
teenage wasteland!

667
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

668
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,240
That was

669
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,680
Reverend Watt D.

670
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,740
Falk, with

671
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,580
a call-in to Satan.

672
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,260
Thank you, Reverend Watt

673
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,640
D.

674
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,080
Falk.

675
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,720
And now we're gonna cut back to the summer of

676
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,940
2016, 19X Day.

677
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,820
Uh,

678
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,060
it's a bit with

679
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,340
Dr. Howell about a new

680
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,640
subgenius game that I had just

681
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,620
gotten in the mail.

682
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,660
This was recorded live in front of an

683
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,360
audience at Wisteria's

684
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,220
Cafe.

685
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,300
Tell him about the buttons.

686
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,800
The buttons. Tell him about the buttons.

687
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,720
Oh yeah, yeah, we got a, um,

688
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,100
oh wait.

689
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,580
We got a last minute

690
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,600
shipment in from the subgenius cafe

691
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,560
press shop

692
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
of the

693
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,260
very timely

694
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,680
don't blame me, I voted for Bob

695
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:19,860
button.

696
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,540
Which is gonna come in handy no matter

697
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,240
what, no doubt.

698
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,500
And we have ten of them.

699
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,720
I bought a ten pack. I think they're

700
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,660
four bucks a piece. We also

701
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,800
got some fridge magnets in that have the

702
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,280
Church of the Subgenius logo

703
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,920
drawn by

704
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Hellswami Satellite Weavers

705
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,620
in 1979.

706
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,320
No, that would be

707
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,440
early 1980. Anyway, those are

708
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,420
available, fridge magnets in the button.

709
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
Oh, and here's something I need to

710
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,740
to both show off

711
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,500
and investigate. We'll all open this

712
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
together. This is a game

713
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
made by some people in

714
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,420
Austin called

715
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,540
Angry Ogre. Another

716
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,720
great Angry Ogre game. They

717
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,880
got permission to do a game called

718
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,540
Bob Balls.

719
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,420
They contacted me about

720
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,060
two years ago, I think.

721
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,440
It was a Kickstarter project

722
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,540
and I tried to

723
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,380
warn them, as I do

724
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,520
everybody. Don't expect to

725
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,740
make a lot of money off Church of the

726
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,520
Subgenius. We're not that

727
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,660
well known because the average

728
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,640
human being is not capable

729
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,820
of knowing of us.

730
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,760
That's why we're still

731
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,020
here. That's why they haven't

732
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,800
gotten, you know, done, ganged

733
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,600
up on us, which they could easily do. Anyway,

734
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,760
they actually did do their

735
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,480
game Bob Balls and I got a

736
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
I think they sold a grand

737
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,560
total of 29 of

738
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,420
them. I got

739
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,460
and I got a $135

740
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,600
royalty. But

741
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,160
I'm going to open this now.

742
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,800
It's not a

743
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,380
video game.

744
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,660
It's not a video game.

745
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,540
Uh...

746
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,680
We'll find out.

747
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,300
It's no longer insanely

748
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,800
collectible. I'm so excited. It's just like Christmas.

749
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,860
Woohoo! Oh, I wet

750
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,360
my pants.

751
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,700
Okay. Oh, look on the back

752
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,540
it has a green alien. It has a

753
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,680
green girl in a bikini on the back.

754
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,480
Holding

755
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,380
the Bob Balls box.

756
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,340
The official game

757
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,520
of Over Men Everywhere.

758
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,140
That's sexist.

759
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,360
The Bob Ball offers

760
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,540
a perfect combination of awesome

761
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,320
and balls in a

762
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,660
revolutionary mind-altering format.

763
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,700
This instant classic is a

764
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,580
reimagining of the longer to brew

765
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,620
hit game you've heard only whispers

766
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,520
about from another tier of

767
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,720
consciousness. Try to

768
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,740
save your mutant family and get them to

769
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,580
the pleasure craft before X-Day.

770
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,780
Beware, there's only enough room

771
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,920
on the love saucer for one family.

772
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,460
Well, they must not know about

773
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,720
St. Andrew's. Saucer built

774
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,800
for infinity. The other

775
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,540
will be condemned to fry

776
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,440
on earth with the rest of the normals.

777
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,680
So pull the wool over your own

778
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,600
eyes, grab some dice,

779
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,460
and praise Bob or

780
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,760
kill him. You've never played

781
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
with balls like this.

782
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,820
Wow.

783
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,160
That's pretty good.

784
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,480
Now,

785
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,560
the box comes out. Now he's

786
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,080
opening the box, ladies and gentlemen.

787
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,380
It's got skulls and

788
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
attacking people on

789
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,800
the rim. And there's

790
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,540
that symbol,

791
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,040
like a caveman.

792
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,700
A caveman trying to strike

793
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,600
a skull. He's trying to hit a skull there.

794
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,660
It could be the mindless primitive trying

795
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,400
to suppress the emergent

796
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,640
subgenius. Or it could be a

797
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,700
yeti trying to strike down

798
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,080
the imago of death.

799
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,780
And get this, it has a CD

800
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,000
with it. I had no idea. Songs

801
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,560
to play Bob ball

802
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,780
and to do other things to

803
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,660
too. Well,

804
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,440
maybe you better spin that platter

805
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,080
down.

806
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,640
They've done the printing in such a way

807
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,560
it's like green on orange. It's hard to read.

808
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,580
Bob ball intro,

809
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,520
yeti calls,

810
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,300
rob a bank,

811
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,120
bobby bubble,

812
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,260
baduino,

813
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
mario 2-ish,

814
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,480
bottle of beer, pirate dance,

815
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,240
tired of light and fires,

816
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,420
A E I O U,

817
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,320
hey hey mojo,

818
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,760
it goes on and on and on.

819
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,280
We'll see.

820
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,920
Here's the rule book.

821
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,540
It's not very long.

822
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,760
We like

823
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,720
short rule books.

824
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,400
We only have one real rule.

825
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,020
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

826
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
Move each Dobbs head in a straight

827
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,620
line the number of pips

828
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,180
on the assigned die.

829
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,200
Hmm, okay.

830
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,560
You have three dice to roll.

831
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,560
Oh cool, look there's little plastic

832
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,180
dice with the Dobbs head.

833
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,580
Numbers on all sides

834
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,680
except for the Dobbs head. Dobbs head dice and then

835
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,560
some pieces white and some pieces

836
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,380
pink with Dobbs heads

837
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,560
in pyramids. But why don't you open up

838
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,580
the board, Stang? Let's see what the board

839
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,620
looks like. The whole game is built around

840
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,120
the board.

841
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,780
Open it up and

842
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:16,900
huh?

843
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,600
Well it's got an eyeball in the middle

844
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,020
of it. That's always a good sign.

845
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,580
Flying saucers on the borders.

846
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,560
That's a standard procedure.

847
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,160
It looks like the

848
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,640
Tholian web, if you'll pardon the

849
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:30,960
reference.

850
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,600
Let's push play on that. So

851
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,360
I don't know, I guess

852
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,320
maybe somebody can game test.

853
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,540
Yes, we have so many game

854
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,680
players here, maybe they'd like to

855
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,660
play Bob

856
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,380
Ball.

857
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,980
Hi, I'm Reverend Ivan Stang and this is

858
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,620
Bob Ball. Darn it,

859
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,820
it's fun. The official game

860
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,000
of Over Men Everywhere.

861
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,580
Bob Ball offers the perfect combination of

862
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,560
awesome and

863
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,620
balls in a revolutionary

864
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,280
mind-altering format.

865
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,140
This instant classic is a reimagining

866
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,480
of the longer to

867
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,600
brew hit game you've heard only whispers

868
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,500
about from another tier of

869
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,020
consciousness.

870
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,740
There's some Bob

871
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,620
Ball music. Bob Ball music

872
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,280
going on.

873
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,300
Well this is, this is fun.

874
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,640
To look

875
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,560
at anyway. Yes,

876
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,820
this will be the one thing that makes the fortune

877
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,720
that eludes the church of the subgenius.

878
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,660
Don't forget this, you left this out.

879
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,820
Can't play Bob

880
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,760
Ball without your pink pieces

881
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,900
and there you go.

882
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,780
Well which is it young fella, you want ice

883
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,460
to freeze or get down on the ground?

884
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,760
Mean to say, if I freeze

885
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,540
I can't rightly drop.

886
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,160
If I drop, I'm gonna be in motion.

887
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,200
You see? Shut up!

888
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,300
Okay then.

889
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,580
They close the doors at 6pm

890
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,440
and they move the money

891
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,480
at night.

892
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,800
The blends are drawn, everything's

893
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,720
in order. It looks like

894
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,160
we're right on time.

895
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,660
Everybody check

896
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,640
your watch.

897
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,920
Tie your shoes and get in line.

898
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,780
Tonight's

899
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,240
a night of our sweet

900
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,660
Bob has given

901
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,640
us great insight and wisdom.

902
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,620
So it

903
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,580
is again with a heavy

904
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,580
heart that I see Bob rendering

905
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,620
public service to the people

906
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,800
of this country for some

907
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,640
period of time.

908
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,160
And it is a hope

909
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,760
that we are going to be able

910
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,700
to help Bob

911
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,400
fulfill

912
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,900
one of his whims

913
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,640
which is to sit

914
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,680
down and write a book.

915
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,740
He will not

916
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,560
because that book is

917
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,900
entitled Bob Matters

918
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,580
and I am much

919
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,120
richer for it.

920
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,820
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

921
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,740
No time to find the entrance.

922
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,280
I'll just drive straight to it through the solid rock.

923
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,620
No time for opening windows.

924
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,180
Clark Kent may need a plane but Superman doesn't.

925
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,340
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

926
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,820
Hi, I'm Bob One

927
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,160
for A1 Slacks and I'd like to take a moment of your time.

928
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,100
Thank you.

929
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,620
And I'd like to tell you about the nice folks

930
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,760
down at A1 Slacks. They handle a needle

931
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,800
just the way your mother used to and the results

932
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,820
are racers, capers, tapers and bummers

933
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,220
such as you've never worn before.

934
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,220
The Action Man's Go-Go Now Generation

935
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,280
Happening Slacks for the Go-Go Now Generation

936
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,420
Action Man on campus and off.

937
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,720
And remember, you can get a good education

938
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,020
and win valuable prizes too.

939
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,440
Thank you, Bob. You're welcome.

940
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,880
And now, back to our movie.

941
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,400
Wherever there is mystery, intrigue, romance

942
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
in all the strange and dangerous

943
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,500
places of the world,

944
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,380
there you will find Bob.

945
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,200
I got off a plane, got off in Spain,

946
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,760
pulled it out and did the same damn thing.

947
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,900
I claim all these garbage dumps.

948
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,140
Hallelujah!

949
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,140
Shut up!

950
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,240
Hallelujah!

951
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,580
Shut up!

952
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,100
Shut up!

953
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,100
Shut up!

954
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,200
Shut up!

955
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,520
Shut up!

956
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,540
Shut up!

957
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,960
Shut up!

958
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,200
Shut up!

959
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,440
Shut up!

960
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Shut up!

961
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,220
Shut up!

962
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,260
Shut up!

963
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,160
Thanks to Leigh Murr for the collages

964
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,380
and to the Firesign Theatre.

965
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,140
And now,

966
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,520
the Rudy Schwartz Project.

967
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,460
And then this Democrat mayor gets up

968
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,200
he said, wow, I think it's

969
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:00,240
time to celebrate the glorious life

970
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:00,240


971
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
And that was Donald Trump!

972
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,460
Tra la la,

973
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,620
empty in the air,

974
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,040
everybody sing because

975
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,740
we're celebrating today.

976
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,680
Ho yo yo,

977
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,720
slippity dippity do,

978
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,820
it's time to celebrate

979
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,200
the glorious life of Donald Trump.

980
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,140
Take the time to ponder

981
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,140
what Donald Trump has done for you.

982
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,220
Your neighbors are the bottom

983
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,200
eyes, their assholes through and through.

984
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,540
Stop and think what

985
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,620
Donald Trump has done for us.

986
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,220
Everyone's a fuckhead,

987
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,740
their brains are full of pus.

988
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,520
Tra la li,

989
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,740
with the yoodle far.

990
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,300
Everybody gather up,

991
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,880
come on, don't pass the buck.

992
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,600
Straddles, get down from

993
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,100
Ain't it Seattle? Hop and skip and chomp.

994
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,420
It's time to be a sociopath

995
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,140
and vote for Donald Trump.

996
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,240
Part of the problem

997
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,680
and part of the reason

998
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,620
it takes so long.

999
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,620
Nobody wants to hurt each other anymore, right?

1000
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,520
And they're being politically correct

1001
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,720
the way they take them out.

1002
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,720
Look at my African American over here.

1003
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,580
Look at him.

1004
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,120
Are you the greatest?

1005
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,480
I love the old days.

1006
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,440
You know what they used to do to guys like that

1007
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,840
when they were in places like this?

1008
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,620
They'd be carrying them on a stretcher.

1009
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,740
Oh Lord,

1010
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,200
I'm so sorry.

1011
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,200


1012
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,200


1013
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,200


1014
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,420
Ah, will we dance in knowing tongue?

1015
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,920
The ghost of less

1016
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,580
mathematics will rise up and sing the song.

1017
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,320
Wompty doodle

1018
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,000
puddle dum, he's completely

1019
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,060
nude. Donald's got

1020
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,060
a boner, that's because he's

1021
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,920
not a prude.

1022
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,940
Lock the doors and get involved, rise up

1023
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,060
and take a stand.

1024
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,180
Donald Trump's the guy to make America

1025
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,060
great again.

1026
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,840
Are you watching Infowars or

1027
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,160
spittle on your chin?

1028
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,020
Lubricate your rectum with your

1029
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,600
fist and we'll disdain.

1030
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,300
Tra la lu,

1031
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,440
cock-a-doodle-doo,

1032
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,860
he'll deport the Mexicans,

1033
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,600
the Muslims and the Jews.

1034
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,620
Tra hit-a-lee dum,

1035
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,760
stuff your head inside your room.

1036
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,080
Join the clap and gout your

1037
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,920
sheet and vote for Donald Trump.

1038
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,960
Hop and dance, good-bye

1039
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,060
to France, it's Mussolini's second

1040
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,580
chance. Twenty million

1041
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,200
white supremacists can't be wrong.

1042
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,200
Tra la la,

1043
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,040
yuck-a-doodle-doo,

1044
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,120
donnie trump and

1045
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,700
Vladimir Putin, party hand in hand.

1046
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,380
Ho, yo, yo,

once in a while, man, say the

1052
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,880
brains are full of glass. It's time

1053
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,780
to hear the air revolve.

1054
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,020
Vote for Donald Trump.

1055
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,800
I can punch him in the face,

1056
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,340
I beg it.

1057
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,560
We having a good time?

1058
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,560
USA,

00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:00,660
who is here?

1060
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,420
USA,

1061
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,200
alright yeah, get him out, try not to hurt him.

1062
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:06,900
USA,

1063
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,140
if you do I'll defend

1064
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,640
you in court, don't worry about it.

1065
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,480
USA,

1066
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:14,480


1067
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,940
The Rudy Schwartz Project friend. A song

1068
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,740
we're forced to love.

1069
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,200
and now, back to

1070
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,620
Ask Dr. Hal

1071
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,160
at 19xDeadrill

1072
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,980
for a

1073
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:29,980
bonus point.

1074
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,160
from Dr. Howell.

1075
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,320
Well, pardon me, Stang,

1076
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,080
but that last one was a five-bucker.

1077
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:38,760
I know.

1078
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,420
So I've got to do another short one.

1079
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,140
Oh, right, right.

1080
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,760
I'll make it a quick one.

1081
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,460
Now, this one is called

1082
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,300
The Story of Jim

1083
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,200
Who Ran Away from His Nurse

1084
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,500
and Was Eaten by a Lion.

1085
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,840
That's the title.

1086
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,940
There was a boy whose name was Jim.

1087
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,020
His friends were very good to him.

1088
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,760
They gave him tea and cakes and jam

1089
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,120
and slices of delicious ham

1090
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,640
and chocolates with pink inside

1091
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,840
and little tricycles to ride.

1092
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,700
They read him stories through and through

1093
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,180
and even took him to the zoo.

1094
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,160
But there it was,

1095
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,560
the dreadful fate befell him,

1096
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,280
which I now relate.

1097
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,280
You know, or at least you ought to know,

1098
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,600
for I have often told you so,

1099
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,280
that children never are allowed

1100
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,080
to leave their nurses in a crowd.

1101
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,460
Now, this was Jim's especial foible.

1102
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,220
He ran away when he was able.

1103
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,820
And on that inauspicious,

1104
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,580
suspicious day,

1105
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,360
he slipped his hand and ran away.

1106
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,960
He hadn't got a yard when,

1107
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,420
bang, with open jaws,

1108
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,720
a lion sprang

1109
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,420
and hungrily began to eat the boy,

1110
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,980
beginning with his feet.

1111
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,860
Now, just imagine how it feels

1112
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,060
when first your toes and then your heels

1113
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,800
and gradually, by slow degrees,

1114
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,200
your shins and ankles,

1115
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,400
calves and knees are slowly eaten,

1116
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,120
bit by bit.

1117
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,000
No wonder Jim detested it.

1118
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,620
No wonder that he shouted,

1119
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,100
hi!

1120
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,440
The honest keeper heard his cry.

1121
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,540
Though very fat,

1122
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,800
he almost ran to help the little gentleman.

1123
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,300
Ponto, he shouted as he came,

1124
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,900
since Ponto was the lion's name.

1125
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:55,760
Ponto!

1126
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,040
Ponto, he ordered with a frown.

1127
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,540
Release it!

1128
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,480
Stop, sir!

1129
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,460
Put it down!

1130
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,540
The lion made a sudden stop

1131
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,840
and let the dainty morsel drop

1132
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,880
and slunk, reluctant to his cage,

1133
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,920
snarling in disappointed rage.

1134
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,160
But when he bent him over Jim,

1135
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,620
the honest keeper's eyes grew dim,

1136
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,280
the lion having reached his head,

1137
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,820
the miserably,

1138
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,560
miserable boy was dead.

1139
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,940
When Nurse informed his parents,

1140
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,620
they were more concerned than I can say.

1141
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,300
His mother, as she dried her eyes, said,

1142
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,340
well, this comes as no surprise.

1143
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,440
He would not do as he was told.

1144
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,480
His father, who was self-controlled,

1145
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,240
bade all the children round attend

1146
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,340
to James's miserable end

1147
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,820
and always to keep home.

1148
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,740
He was a hold of Nurse

1149
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,800
for fear of catching something worse.

1150
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,400
Hilaire Belloc.

1151
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,040
All right, let's go on with the $1 level of questions.

1152
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,860
No, how about the $1 level of show?

1153
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,220
This was Hour of Slack number 1614,

1154
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,760
assembled in March of so-called 2017,

1155
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,800
at Tarzana.

1156
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,200
Sands Radio Station at

1157
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,760
stange-ranch-at-sub-genius-dot-com.

1158
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,440
And that's the website you can look

1159
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,920
at to know anything.

1160
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,140
We've been busy,

1161
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:46,320
we were at South by Southwest last week.

1162
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,900
We were treated like princes and

1163
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,280
space princesses.

1164
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,840
it was fabulous

1165
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,120
some wonderful people are working on a documentary

1166
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,720
about Church of the Subgenius

1167
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,680
and they filmed us

1168
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,100
us and Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Paul Mavridis

1169
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,020
and I'm sure you'll hear some good recordings from that

1170
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,820
when they're done

1171
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,300
in the meantime, friends

1172
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,640
let's end with a delicate instrumental

1173
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,780
from the Psychoskeletons called

1174
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,060
Idea Man

1175
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:28,000
again, this is the Psychoskeletons

1176
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,040
Idea Man

1177
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,040
Idea Man

1178
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,040
Idea Man

1179
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,040
Idea Man

1180
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,460
Idea Man

1181
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:01,580
Idea Man

1182
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:01,580


1183
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,960
Idea Man

1184
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,940
Idea Man

1185
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,520
Idea Man

1186
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,540
Idea Man

1187
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:09,920
Idea Man

1188
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,620
Idea Man

1189
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,000
Idea Man

1190
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,000


1191
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,860
Idea Man

1192
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,400
Idea Man

1193
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,360
Thank you the Psychoskeletons

1194
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,780
and this is that little last tacked on

1195
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,620
internet part of the show

1196
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,040
friends where I, Reverend Ivan Stang

1197
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,080
exhort you to whip it out

1198
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,880
go ahead and join the Church of the Subgenius

1199
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,120
we aren't kidding about that

1200
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,400
you get some great stuff

1201
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,300
with your $35 ministership

1202
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,600
including the right to be a real minister

1203
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,040
and perform marriages, seriously

1204
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,940
and booklets and bumper stickers

1205
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,060
and metal pin

1206
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,620
and decals and more booklets

1207
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,820
and frameable certificates

1208
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,580
really wonderful frameable certificates

1209
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,120
I must say

1210
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,740
to tell the truth

1211
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,740
I think the best thing we ever did

1212
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,320
was the book of the subgenius

1213
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,080
or maybe Revelation X

1214
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,440
or maybe the Bobliographon

1215
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,660
but those last two are out of print

1216
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,460
the book of the subgenius is still in print

1217
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,120
you can get signed copies from us

1218
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,620
at subgenius.com

1219
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,580
well signed by me anyway

1220
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,360
that's also my handwriting

1221
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,280
on the padded puffy envelope

1222
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,660
that brings your subgenius stuff to your door

1223
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,060
yes I actually write that

1224
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,260
hand write those

1225
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,220
partly to keep my hands working

1226
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,600
and partly just cause

1227
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,440
so you see it's personalized

1228
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,320
no it kind of is

1229
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,920
when you join

1230
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,960
and you read about the

1231
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,420
members only part of the internet

1232
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,420
not Facebook

1233
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,220
but scrubgeniusforum

1234
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,720
who is it that looks up your name

1235
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,340
or remembers handwriting it

1236
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,060
me

1237
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,200
I'm the gatekeeper

1238
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,080
are you my key master

1239
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,240
I hope not

1240
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,020
anyway

1241
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,800
yeah that's it friends

1242
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,700
think about looking into our books

1243
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,740
our videos

1244
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,200
in fact you can get previews of our videos

1245
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,340
you can see the whole things

1246
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,980
and brand new stuff

1247
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,680
that's being cranked out by the Ministry of Slack

1248
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,960
on Philo's special Roku channel

1249
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,220
on television

1250
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,700
yes on television if you have a Roku machine

1251
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:45,280
and if you don't just look at Dr. Philo's page on Vimeo

1252
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,260
or Vimeo or whatever the hell it is

1253
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,420
I should know

1254
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,940
I just went to South by Southwest

1255
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,220
but I still don't know

1256
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:52,700
uh

1257
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,960
we did have fun

1258
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,320
but

1259
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,040
and they got their footage I think

1260
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,580
so everything's fine

1261
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:01,840
friends

1262
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:02,940
thank you

1263
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,480
for listening

1264
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,300
and uh

1265
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,740
bragging us up

1266
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,760
when appropriate

1267
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,560
praise Bob

1268
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,420
and good night

1269
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,180
bye
