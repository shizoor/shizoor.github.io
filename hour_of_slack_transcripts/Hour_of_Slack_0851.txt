Bob, Bob, love you.
Bob, Bob, love you.
Bob, Bob, love you.
Light your prop eyes up and test your facts.
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.
Praise Bob, Bob, and Connie's rack.
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.
All bow before the great metal lord.
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways with other pockets of humans on this planet.
Where we thought we were alone, we know there are now other human forms that believe in God.
And we know that Bob is a conscious mutation.
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.
Have you ever met Bob?
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.
I know what you do.
Cause I do it too.
Intelligence.
Intelligence.
Am I as smart as I think?
Probably not.
That's good.
Daily disease cannot feel pain.
Hey, I'm Jeff and welcome back to My Depth in Music,asy.com.

Thank you for watching.

electrical shows your科.io depends on me.
held on August 10th in Cleveland.
The third annual one organized by several old subgeniuses and fellow Devo fans.
Reverend Toth Wilder, Reverend Scott Orsi, the good Blinker Boy at AOL.com,
and help from Steve Sinek.
And, oh, friends, it's just been great.
Because I love the Devos.
We have a lot in common, the church and the Devos.
We're both owned by Bob.
We were both controlled by Bob completely for quite a long time.
And we both share a philosophy.
We don't always have the same kind of music, but sometimes we do.
We always have the philosophy.
A special philosophy, a little different, depending on which cult you're talking about.
But it is a philosophy for the different.
You know, in pamphlet number one...
What the hell?
This is Herb Alpert here in the background.
Friends, did you know that Herb Alpert was the guy who signed Devo to their very first big-time record deal?
Anyway, friends, the Church of the Subgenius has called itself the Spaz Church of Macho Irony.
And it's a church of macho irony.
And as I enjoyed the various cover bands covering Devo,
and the new and old and rare Devo materials that were dredged up for each of these conventions,
I got to thinking and pondering about the spazfulness of the great spaz bands.
And the ones I was thinking of primarily are ones from the 80s.
Elvis Costello, who I actually used to sort of resemble back in the day.
And Talking Heads.
I never was that into Talking Heads.
But they were a great spaz band, I suppose.
And David Byrne is a deuce-paying subgenius twice over, just as are several members of Devo.
Ah, friends.
But, you know, some people...
And of course, there's spaz bands today.
And we'll be playing a lot of that.
But, you know, some might say that the spaz, the spaziness and spazitude
of the weirdos shows no dignity.
That it is somehow silly and unmanly.
But, nay, my friends, nay!
I say the ability to spaz is our treasure.
And the inability to spaz is the curse of the blockhead and the pink.
Because think, is not the sexual orgasm coming?
The ultimate...
spaz attack?
The spaz of sex, friends.
The spaz of letting your own mutant abnormality out.
Do you really care what the others think?
Well, sure you do.
But, why let on?
Friends, as Bob Dobbs said very recently to his young ward, Dr. Onan Canabite,
Bob said,
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.
Friends, you think about that as you spaz out in this, uh...
Friends, white, you just white.
You just white.
You just white.
You just white.
Is there anything religion can do to help?
Help me find my friend?
Well...
we could join together in prayer.
Uh huh.
But is there anything useful we can do?
No.

Just talking about the
devolutionisation of man and stuff, ma'am.
The other week I was over at my Aunt May Beale's house.
Me and my cousin Bubba were talking about third world politics and the effect on the
micro farm workers of the southern United States.
And all of a sudden it hit me.
Mark Mothersbaugh was right.
Man was devolving.
Turning back into the most simple of primates.
This would explain daytime TV and Jerry Springer being so popular.
Why the hell would it not be on a fucking record label?
But right when I was about to tell Bubba about this, he turned on Jerry Springer.
And as I watched that 13 year old prostitute straddle the Pope.
I was like, what the fuck?

I couldn't think anything but.
What a damn fine country we live in.
God bless fucking America.
Devolutionization by a group called the Cryogenic Strawberries.
An unusual group.
I think they're on mp3.com too.
Or somewhere out there.

Super thing.
I'll tell you what it takes.
A very simple thing.
Simple thing.
Iron nerves like the pilot of a jumbo jet.
Jumbo jet.
For a girl on the go who hasn't got there yet.
Magnetic trombone blowing.
Sympathetic saxophone.
The evidence kept growing from below.
Hidden motivations buried in the past.
Still give a strength for the super thing.
Ran along.
A rude surprise every time it rings.
Every time it rings.
Every time it rings.
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing.
Normal thing.
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right.
Do it right.
Super thing.
The thing that makes you bigger than life.
Magnetic trumpets blowing.
Sympathetic saxophone.
The evidence kept growing from below.
I don't even know why I'm doing my magic.
I don't even know what were�� Turner throws.

That's what they said back in the...

You're walking on the street.
You can't believe you're me.
Come on now.
That's right.
I'm...
You're walking down the street.
You keep lifting your feet.
But you never find a place to go.
Never find a place to go until somebody...
Man, you never even knew what history...
I say what history was the back of your hand.
That's right.
Uh-huh.
I say get off of the street.
Get off of the street, boy.
People gonna think.
Yes, they're gonna think.
People gonna...
People gonna think you're a spaz.
Come on now.
That's right.
Uh-huh.
You're pretty shook up,
so you're gonna get a cup of water
just to...
Calm you down.
But when you turn around,
some joke or some jealousy.
I say...
Hey, you know it was a mama's tea.
That's right.
Uh-huh.
I say get off of the floor.
Get off of the floor, boy.
People gonna think.
Yes, they're gonna think.
People gonna...
People gonna think you're a spaz.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.







Uh-huh.
Come on now, that's right
You wanna sit down when you know some clown's gonna try and pull away your chair
So you stand and stand, stand and stand until
Now you can't stand any longer
Hey, you know you shouldn't have sat down
That's right
I said get off of the floor, get off of the floor, boy
People gonna think, yes they're gonna think
People gonna, people gonna think you're spades
People gonna think you're spades

Well, here's an example, it's not a Devo song
Although Little Theodore later on in the show
Will cover Through Being Cool
Here's Little Theodore with
I Don't Care
I don't care about the economy
It has no effect on me
All I need to be happy
Is a woman that's cruel and a place to pee
I don't care about the government
I think it's about time it went away
I resent dirty politicians
I resent
Just like me, they're all hell-bent
I don't want to hear about big stars
They should all be behind bars
Maybe we can ship them off to Mars
Or take off their clothes and expose their scars
I don't want no more of that press
They're responsible for our mess
If we knew
What was best
We'd live our own lives
And skip the rest

The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
And his twins were unaware
The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
And nobody even cared
And he wore a hat
And he had a job
And he brought home the bacon
So that nobody knew
The mongoloid, the mongoloid
The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
Happier than you and me
The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid

You put me in a situation
Going through soft core mutations
Down under where the lights glow

I found this piece by
Beol and Elvin the Sewer Rat
I said it's all just wind and sails
Are we not men?
We are demons
Are we not men?
We are
Are we not men?
We are demons
We are demons
We are demons
We are pieces
On theheres.

Come healing road and businesses
Teachers and men
To dance the love
Are we not men?
We are demons
Are we not men?
We are demons
We are demons

Are we not men?
We are human
Are we not men?

I sing a song
Just when it seems
But then it's all
Don't go

Are this a blur?
Are we not men?
We are human
Are we not men?
We are
Are we not men?
We are human
But let's leave things of this world behind
And walk now down the path of Bob
For this brief minute of slack
From the church of the subgenius
And we find then the family falling apart
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth
Our rival churches do
About how the children are getting exposed
To too much this and too much that
What they ain't being exposed to
Is a little bit of mom and dad
Forget the pornography
I don't care
It makes me mad, my friend
The hypocrisy
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy
As Bob Dobbs once said
I don't practice what I preach
Because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to
But that preacher can get up there on TV
And oh, he's so glad to keep you normal
Keep you working so hard
You don't even know your own wifey anymore
And your kids
You don't know your kids any better than your employees
So, friend
Let there be slack
And you don't have to be a
You don't have to be a

You may not be aware of this
But we are in the middle of World War III
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear
The weapon is the human mind
Or lack of it on this planet
That will determine our future
Capital punishment for airline passengers
Who attempt to save money
Spud men and gas lines
Who forgot that guns don't argue
And tourists
Attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island
Add up to a major attack
Of corkscrews in the brain
We must fight back
We must know what we want
We must want what we need
And what we need is duty now for the future

Paper information from the Church of the Subgenius at Post Office Box 204206 Dallas, I mean Austin.
Whoa!
Austin, Texas 78720.
Yes, the office moved.
Again, that's P.O. Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.
As seen on www.subgenius.com.
The band Devo, they've got a new album coming out called Shout, which will be out in about a month.
They've done a cover version of Hendrix's Are You Experienced?
And the Subgenius Foundation.
The Subgenius Foundation in association with Tele Music Corporation is going to be putting that video together.
It will be loaded with special effects and probably a cameo appearance by the ghost of Bob Dobbs.
And by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix, too.
This is a whole, you know, combining two churches in one.
Yeah, I'm serious.
This ought to be quite a seance-packed shoot.
But aside from the videos that we're trying to do, there's a lot of...
The whole music video thing is kind of a funny...
Situation in that that whole world is loaded with what I consider false slack.
And, you know, endless repetitions of the images of half-dressed girls and fast cars and pills.
What is false slack?
Well, half-dressed girls, fast cars and pills without Bob.
