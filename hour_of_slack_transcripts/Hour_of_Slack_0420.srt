1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,900
It is the bizarre story number one.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Lee Harvey Oswald was shot at 1217 Eastern Standard Time by a man named Jack Ruby.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,940
Oswald died at 2.07 p.m.

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,460
Lee Harvey Oswald died just 48 hours after the president in Parkland Hospital,

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,100
in the same hospital, the same emergency room, the same operating table,

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,400
and in the same town, Dallas, Texas.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,180
Jack Ruby, the man who killed Lee Harvey Oswald, was only charged with carrying a weapon.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,700
Jack Ruby, seen here with the blood of Oswald on his face and shirt,

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,920
is being transferred through the same...

10
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,980
Dallas City Jail by the same police,

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,200
handcuffed with the same handcuffs that Oswald was wearing,

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,920
through the same hallway, through the same door that Oswald passed through,

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,320
the same town, Dallas, Texas, time 4.45 p.m., the same day.

14
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,600
...the internationally known golfer.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,740
And the golfer comes out now.

16
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,220
Oh, it's... looks like the projectionist has fallen asleep.

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,020
Oh, there's the head.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:25,760
It's the head.

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,140
He's been ready.

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,260
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,960
This is Arnold Palmer.

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,680
Hi, golfers.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,280
Ah, yes, dear friends.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of flack,

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,180
with your host, Reverend Ivan Stagg.

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,680
Nice job.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,500
Anyone in which you've been denied slag by the conspiracy, sir?

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,160
Um...

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,260
Perhaps you understand.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,440
Maybe.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,320
Um...

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,200
Perhaps you understand.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,560
Maybe.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Do you have anything to say to the defendant?

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:11,540
No.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,800
No, no.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,020
No, no.

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,420
There's a shot.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,280
No, no.

40
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:16,640
No.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,620
Oswald has a shot.

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,080
No.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,680
There's...

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
There's something wrong with the machine.

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,620
No, no.

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,640
Something has happened in the motorcade route.

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,900
Something, I repeat, has happened in the motorcade route.

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,100
There's numerous people running up the hill along the side L Street,

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,660
down by the 7th freeway.

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,580
General Police Officer, uh, runs up the hill at this time.

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,720
Stand by just a moment, please.

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,560
Something has happened in the motorcade route.

53
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,320
Stand by just a moment, please.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,700
This could maybe, uh...

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,140
Hey, let me, uh, offer you a theory.

56
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,720
Okay.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,220
Because, uh, I have an uncle who was in the Secret Service

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,660
when, uh, President Kennedy was assassinated.

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,840
Yes.

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,060
Yes, ma'am.

61
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,160
He had, uh, he had an interesting bullet wound that, uh,

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,140
he never had prior to that incident.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
He was in the motorcade.

64
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,760
But the angle was totally wrong for him to get shot.

65
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,360
Wait a minute.

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,980
You mean your uncle?

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,720
That's right.

68
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,880
Your uncle got hit?

69
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,860
This was in, uh, when Kennedy was assassinated.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,440
Correct.

71
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,340
He was wounded in the right hip just above the hip.

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,660
Well, I'd never heard of anybody being hit but...

73
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,820
Watch it.

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,780
Kennedy and Connelly.

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,520
In Dealey Plaza?

76
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,780
Let me put it this way.

77
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,100
Yes.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,420
He was supposed to come to a family gathering the next day,

79
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,760
which is only about 200 miles away from Dallas.

80
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,420
Yeah?

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,320
He didn't show up anywhere in the family for one month.

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,420
Nobody knew where he was at.

83
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,420
And when he finally did show up, he had this interesting new scar.

84
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,480
On his thumb?

85
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Just above the right hip.

86
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,320
And I know scars because I've had a lot of them through my life.

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,500
Yeah.

88
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:33,720
Yeah.

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
That bullet had to do some strange gyrations.

90
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,800
This got me interested in studying about, uh, assassination attempts

91
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,600
and how they can be done.

92
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,100
Where was he in the...

93
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,820
Uh, this could be an international audience at this point.

94
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,060
Oh, my God.

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,840
This is a, a very exciting moment for those of us who are involved in the pilot game.

96
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,260
The, the brain was found complete with brain stem.

97
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,040
Now, it does, it does have a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:04:01,720
a little bit of damage to the revitalization of the company from part of the

99
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:01,940
game, right?

100
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,900
All of the components used to be the main core of our mission.

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,400
foliage necessarily to.

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,240
Current policy.

103
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:12,900
Exactly.

104
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
were right after in the Johnson administration.

105
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:43,120
Here I was 25 years ago in the fifth grade when I was behind this fence with a high-powered automatic rifle.

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,240
Oh, I just had a squirt gun. My dad wouldn't let me use his rifle van here that day.

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,020
He gave me a whole bunch of trouble about it.

108
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,760
There's a huge crowd here at Dealey Plaza on November 22nd.

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,760
A lot of media people wishing something would happen, us included.

110
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,580
A lot of cameras.

111
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,820
A lot of idiots.

112
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
And a lot of...

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,260
The lady's taking our picture now. We're the gunmen behind the fence for her.

114
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,220
Firing media shots at every living thing.

115
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,220


116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,960
A man who's a living or dead president who might drive by in body or ghost.

117
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Well, this is one of those things that if it hadn't happened, someone would have had to have made it happen.

118
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,160
Something has happened in the motorcade.

119
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,080
Something has happened in the motorcade!

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,580
Twenty-five years have passed since the effect of bullets...

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Hey, hey! Look out!

122
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,040
No!

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:06:18,240


124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,700
I think I'm gonna fall down the stairs!

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,020
No, you don't have to.

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,080
Hey, watch out guys.

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:36,100
Shoot your own direction, streaming only on your examination cluster.

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,300
I should do a pause and read something about it.

129
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,220
Oh, a boring dialogue both.

130
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,220


131
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,380


132
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,240
But it's just to watch youræ˜¼

133
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm a passing motorcade at 11 miles an hour.

134
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,820
Such a gently speed, 11 miles an hour.

135
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,000
At the time of place of greed, let's pull that limousine down.

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,960
I'm a passing motorcade at 11 miles an hour.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah.

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,280
Yeah.

139
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,920
Yeah.

141
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah.

142
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,660
Yeah.

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:26,960
Yeah.

144
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah.

145
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,500


146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,000
The harbor was made to order.

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,300
A rider collected a drifter and a barter.

148
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,820
Oh, one kind of version I passed.

149
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,220
America was happy.

150
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,280
The Brexit had been cast.

151
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,120
And he lived.

152
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,060
11 miles an hour.

153
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,140
Such a deadly speed.

154
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,180
11 miles an hour.

155
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,160
At the time of place of greed.

156
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,400
Let's pull that limousine down.

157
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm switched on my speed.

158
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,220
Left her like a shower at 11 miles an hour.

159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,340
11 miles an hour.

160
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,340
Yes, dear friends.

161
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
11 miles an hour.

162
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:14,960
Yeah.

163
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,320
whoa.

164
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh, and Paul's shirt is not rvy.

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,240
Was.

166
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,900
Was not was?

167
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah, damn right.

168
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:19,840
No was.

169
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,340
Yes.

170
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,720
And you know what?

171
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,060
Right.

172
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,380
Yeah.

173
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
On this Kennedy thing.

174
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,820
And we're going to keep talking, but we're going to keep chasing the gunman tonight.

175
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,920
A fascinating surprise.

176
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,120
The Ð½Ñ–JÃ¡ numerous.

177
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,020
a new era in collective mythology. With the ritual sacrifice and slaughter of John F. Kennedy,

178
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:48,160
35th President of the United States, the conspiracy nailed the door shut on its reputation as well as

179
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,100
the hopes of an entire generation. History was once again successfully captured from those to

180
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,940
whom it happened. Can we ever forget the grim pre-empting of an entire day's worth of valuable

181
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,720
network time, the muffled drums, the heavy thud as the conspiracy dropped their review copy of the

182
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,160
Rusty Warren Commission on our heads? The murderers were so sure of themselves that they issued a

183
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,800
steady stream of press releases about their involvement in Dallas. In spite of this open

184
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:32,880
bragging, there has been no executive reaction. Nobody really cared. We lost our faith on that

185
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,480
long ago, warm November afternoon out on the greasy knoll that overlooks the plaza. There were

186
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,540
the tourists on the banked hill, the whole crowd turning as one at the sound of the first shot,

187
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:55,040
solemn and respectful, women red-eyed and tearful, men in their dark suits, still and uncomfortable

188
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,040
under the hot television lights. We stared angrily into the black limousine that day and cursed the

189
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:10,120
merciless and unintelligible God. We must look deep within our bleeding hearts to see the

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,160
ichor of false patriotism no longer clogs our diseased and cholesterol-lined arteries. We must

191
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,760
ask ourselves over and over again and again how many more senseless media specials can be milked

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,360
out of our tragic national anguish, and what is our percentage? And most of all, we must

193
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,700
remember to keep that shining, irresponsible vision of the future unsullied by the mudmen of

194
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:49,240
the past and the madmen of the present. For the next 60 minutes, sit back, open your bowels,

195
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,860
and experience an astral recreation of the events surrounding this most mysterious of

196
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:02,300
international crime. From the sneering lips of Zorchtron, the malevolent crystal star being,

197
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,160
channeled through the voice of Mrs. Adel Goldstein, KNON's resident Midnight Psychic.

198
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,420
The Church of the Subgenius is not responsible for fractures of interdimensional consciousness, cellular

199
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:23,140
oral incontinence, nor personal violence resulting from close contact with the macro-verse of pain and retribution.

200
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:30,740
It's terrible. There's so much for that macro-verse of pain and retribution. Where's my background music?

201
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,700
Do these microphones worth? Yeah, they'll work good enough. Good enough for subgenius work, dear friends.

202
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:52,240
I can just barely hear what's going on, but that's all right. It's been a long week, folks. One and a half weeks ago,

203
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,620
I actually finished that damn book, put it in the mail, and got on an airplane an hour later.

204
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:06,900

205
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,840

goods the assassination conspiracy scandals of course the they're the

215
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,700
primary focus of the research at this point turning into an art form he also

252
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,040
and his white beams on in the background

253
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,780
those are the secret service mail

254
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,600

at least this one will find out again

262
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,900
no tragedy

263
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,540
but our 50th state was used as the staging area for an assassination

264
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,480
which will live in infamy in american history

265
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,380
a terrified mom shocking story i'm going to go to the hospital

266
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
i'm pregnant with jfk's space baby

267
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,120
i'm carrying a dead president's baby sobbed a terrified mom to be who is desperately pleading for god to save her unborn child

268
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,020
from being sacrificed in the name of national politics

269
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:09,980
the cia plans to kidnap my child and sacrifice it on an altar during a sinister black mass to celebrate the inauguration of george bush

270
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,640
said goodwin t 34

271
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,320
the fbi told me that my poor baby would be hung upside down and have its throat cut

272
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,380
they would then collect this duo of the gods and satanic goblets and use it to kill me

273
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,380


274
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,780
and that's the return of the kinder gentler nation

275
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,820
the described woman's nightmare began several months ago when she was kidnapped by a flying saucer in melrose utah

276
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,560
during the night shift at the 7-eleven where she was just getting off work

277
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,320
i was about to unlock my car when this glowing ufo flew over the parking lot and

278
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,220
shone a beautiful reddish orange light on me

279
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,800
and my mind was filled with heavenly kawaiian

280
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,740
the next thing i knew i was naked strapped to a pulsating flesh-like table

281
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,620
while tiny horrible space creatures with big friendly eyes

282
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,780
it exists

283
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,220
our reporter has broken up an emotion at the sight of this horrible scene

284
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,560
aliens played by how robin's corporate

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,760
just when i thought i couldn't take it anymore

286
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,740
i felt gentle hands start to massage my neck

287
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,180
and when i turned around there was jfk

288
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,540
i can tell you it really set me back

289
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,380
i was still

290
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,460
he had been my favorite president since i was a little girl

291
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,600
well i guess i was a little girl

292
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:19,600


293
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,660
i was scared and i let him comfort me a little too much if you know what i mean

294
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,240
after it was over they brought me back to the parking lot like nothing had ever happened

295
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,500
took off without even so much as a goodbye

296
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,940
the next day i found out i was preggers and then the calls from the cia began

297
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,480
a dear john letter eh

298
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:44,560
they said that the only way to return the soul of jack kennedy's son to its rightful home alone the stars was by murdering my baby said the frightened woman

299
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,600
that first eerie call was followed by countless others all concerning our unearthly connection to the world

300
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:49,900
the first time i heard of jack kennedy's son's death was a

301
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:58,660
it was a total misconception her home has been burglarized and vandalized and she even had a complete tax audit going back to 1963 even though she was only a child at that time

302
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:16,340
anthropologist leon swain an english ufo researcher has called for a multinational investigation and full disclosure to the public i'm as excited as anybody at the thought of another cute kennedy kid especially after all these years but i don't think we scientists should look at things through rose kennedy colored glasses

303
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:28,500
and then all of a sudden that afternoon we were sitting we lost all our business as a result of the assassination

304
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:41,520
we were sitting at the table where the waiters sit during their breaks and one of the guys went out there wasn't any radio in the place and we couldn't find out what was going on we were all very eager for news

305
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,600
one of the waiters came walking back into the place he was creole and he spoke like kind of a funny kid

306
00:20:49,620 --> 00:21:09,580
he said they found the guy who did it and i said uh i said oh what was his name he says i don't remember he says it was uh son of a gun it was a funny name he says what's up he uh he went he was a marine who went to russia for two years i thought i knew him i was in the rains with him

307
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:19,280
oswald that was easy then i was i was then i was i was very proud of him i thought my god that's great you know he uh

308
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:44,420
he actually went out and did something like he did why he did it though what did you feel like oh okay i was going to ask did you feel like he did what he wanted what did had he fulfilled something that you saw in the marine corps because he wasn't for one thing i i took him to be the marxist that he told me he was at the time i didn't examine a lot of the contradictions and what he was saying to me like to read 1984

309
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,920
and it was like

310
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,320
uh

311
00:21:49,620 --> 00:22:19,620


312
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:27,600
there was a well of course touches on right mind control which is do you think oswald was uh was it

313
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,640
just slicing the pie of mine i think i'm an android i think oswald was an android i think we're both

314
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,580
mine we were both mind control victims i think that i think what happened was like they captured

315
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,280
a bunch of german scientists after the war that were in the mind controls cia got a bunch of them

316
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,520
and kgv got a bunch of them i think they begin comparing notes and they begin to say my god this

317
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
is this is heavier than atomic power what are we going to do with this this is a lot heavier than

318
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,480
we're going to do with it i think they uh began experimenting on selected subjects i think i was

319
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:02,120
one of them i think oswald was one of them i began to experience audio hallucinations when i was in

320
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,880
that outfit with oswald they went on for the rest of my life for about 10 years i thought they were

321
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,780
i thought they were spiritual experiences i got into edgar casey and i was

322
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,820
always writing down my dreams and they were always coming true and it was like

323
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:27,460
i just got so much into that world view that i couldn't imagine a materialist universe any

324
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:36,840
longer and then one day i begin to find out more and more about mind control and difference uh

325
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:44,880
he's been shot he's been shot he's been shot lee oswald has been shot he's been shot he's been shot

00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:33,900
xx

339
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,160
bullet bounce!

340
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:49,420
Really Playing 11 is awesome. Do the jet plane now. Do Wow! Call us today!

341
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,840
Lee Harvey was a friend

342
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,660
of mine.

343
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,100
I was born in Dallas

344
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,360
in 1952.

345
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,880
Lee Harvey moved across the street

346
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,260
on Beckley Avenue.

347
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,000
He used to throw the ball to me

348
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,820
when I was just a kid.

349
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,500
They say he shot the president

350
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,940
I don't think he did.

351
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,620
And Lee Harvey was a friend

352
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,500
of mine.

353
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,880
He used to take me fishing

354
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,720
all the time.

355
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,680
He used to throw the ball to me

356
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,600
when I was just a kid.

357
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,460
They say he shot the president

358
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,840
I don't think he did.

359
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,720
I seen that picture of him

360
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,920
with pamphlets and a gun.

361
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,740
The shadows are pointing

362
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,280
every which way

363
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,980
but there's only just one son.

364
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,880
Someone take that photo

365
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,160
and snuck away.

366
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,820
And if they say he shot

367
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,900
the president

368
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,320
I don't think he did.

369
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,020
And Lee Harvey was a friend

370
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,780
of mine.

371
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,100
He used to take me fishing

372
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
all the time.

373
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,840
He used to throw the ball to me

374
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,700
when I was just a kid.

375
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,480
They say he shot the president

376
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,860
I don't think he did.

377
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,260
I don't think he did.

378
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,480
I seen it all on TV

379
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,080
Lee Harvey got gunned down.

380
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,480
Murdered by Jack Ruby

381
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,980
the biggest sleaze in town.

382
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
He stuck that gun into his ribs

383
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,120
and said here's looking at you kid.

384
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,460
Ruby killed Lee Harvey.

385
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,400
Harvey TV proof he did

386
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,340
And the old

387
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,380
G was a friend

388
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,960
Of all

389
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,880
Of all

390
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,500
He used to take me

391
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,800
Fishin' all the time

392
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,280
That's right, he did

393
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,600
He used to

394
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,680
Throw the ball to me

395
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,500
When I was just

396
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,380
A kid

397
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,660
They say

398
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,400
He shot the

399
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,100
President

400
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,440
I don't think

401
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,920
He

402
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,480
Did

403
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,560
Oh, yes

404
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,120
Oh, yes

405
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,540
Dear friends

406
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,820
And, well, we'll stop

407
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,740
There and let our little tape

408
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,660
Roll down towards the end

409
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,100
For right now

410
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,060
And

411
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,780
We'll just relax

412
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,400
And

413
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,180
I finally

414
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,460
Got the headphones figured out

415
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,760
So, it'll be all right

416
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,660
I hope

417
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,220
It'll be all right

418
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,660
Are you all right?

419
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,040
Reverend Susie

420
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,100
Oh, and that was

421
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,640
Well, our good friend

422
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,980
Reverend Jay Cotton

423
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,040
You know, he shouldn't be down here today

424
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,940
If I thought about it

425
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,920
We should have called him up

426
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
And had him come on down

427
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,380
That nasty boy

428
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,940
Oh, he's so evil

429
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,520
And

430
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,760
Yeah, Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

431
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,360
We always

432
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,960
Well, this is our traditional

433
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,340
Kennedy Day show

434
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,600
We do

435
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,940
You know, as our regular hour

436
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,220
Of Slack listeners will

437
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,380
Recognize

438
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,640
We have certain holidays

439
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,760
We always just rerun the same shows

440
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,520
Christmas, Halloween, and Kennedy Day

441
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,060
Kennedy

442
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,760
Kennedy

443
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,420
And in two days you have Patsy Day

444
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,240
It's like Christmas Eve and Christmas

445
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,200
With a day in between

446
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,560
Hey, Lamar

447
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,200
Was there any wonderful new news

448
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,220
Regarding, I mean, anything new

449
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,100
That's been released

450
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,740
That I didn't hear about at the convention

451
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,660
Down there at the symposium?

452
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,560
Let's see

453
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,020
Well, suitable for this show

454
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,340
In all those documents being released

455
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,720
There's a letter from George DeMorenshield

456
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,820
Oswald's good buddy

457
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,400
DeMorenshield was this big-time engineer

458
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,400
And suave, sophisticated white Russian type

459
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,180
And this is a good buddy of his

460
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,680
And it's this letter that's been declassified

461
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,920
That George DeMorenshield apparently wrote

462
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,060
And I've just read about it

463
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,620
Haven't seen it

464
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,560
To his good buddy, George

465
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,620
Who says, to my good friend, George Bush

466
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,480
Wow

467
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,440
And of course, George Bush's phone number

468
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,100
Was in George DeMorenshield's

469
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,120
Phone book, address book

470
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
After DeMorenshield was

471
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,140
Was murdered, killed

472
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,860
Committed suicide

473
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,780
Even as he was getting ready to be questioned

474
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,720
By the House Select Committee investigation

475
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,860
So, I mean, just little things like that

476
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,360
More Dallas police files

477
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,700
That somehow never made it to the Warren Commission

478
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,680
Or the House Select Committee

479
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,340
So it's just

480
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,720
Oh, the old briefcase

481
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,900
Full of pics

482
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah, so there's all sorts of just neat little stuff

483
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,140
Photographs of the rifle being found

484
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,380
And things that Dallas police officers

485
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,200
Made copies of and salted away

486
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,500
And otherwise the evidence just disappeared

487
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,200
And now these guys in their old age

488
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,260
They're putting it out in books

489
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,680
And it's good to get the stuff out

490
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,880
Well, it's like dinosaur skeletons, you know

491
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,840
They're just gonna keep digging up new ones

492
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,820
We hope

493
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,540
And of course extinction

494
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,920
Can be serious, dear friends

495
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,380
Oh

496
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,360
Yes, yes we have an actual

497
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,040
A real Kennedy researcher

498
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,240
In here tonight

499
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,280
That's Lamar Waldron

500
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,580
I am a real

501
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,400
Terrible national tragedy

502
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,660
Only those who have

503
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,760
Hearts of stone

504
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,060
Can snicker and titter

505
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,500
At this terrible event

506
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,940
Who goes for

507
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,700
John Dunn

508
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:44,840
John Dunn

509
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,040
Picking his nose in front of the state carpet

510
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm picking his nose in front of the state carpet

511
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,500
Hail to the people in triumph and fancies

512
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,020
God bless me, the ever-been kind

513
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,360
Hail to the people in triumph and fancies

514
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,360


515
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,220
...opposed in counts of possible

516
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,660
Pound action against Oswald

517
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,640
Someone said there is strong feeling

518
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,820
From the state in that direction

519
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,500
What's that about?

520
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,440
Ah yes

521
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,640
What a horrible

522
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,220
Horrible show this is, dear friends

523
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,440
I know it's horrible

524
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,800
I know the subject matter

525
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Oh well that's what I am

526
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,060
I'm a disturbed about

527
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,160
I don't blame you, Jack

528
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,600
Believe me, it is not that I am against people imitating me

529
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,540
It is not that I am against people imitating me

530
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,760
It is just that he's misusing the language

531
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,060
He has me saying Cuber instead of Cuber

532
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,460
It's not funny

533
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,200
It's not funny

534
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,840
It's not funny

535
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,300
Not funny.

536
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,200
Everybody knows that there is a vast difference between Cuba and Cuba.

537
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,460
I don't see what's so funny about that either.

538
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,720
I've just been informed by the Department of Health, Welfare and Education

539
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,720
that in certain schools in this country, the children are spelling Cuba, C-U-B-E-R.

540
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,180
Now you know that's not right.

541
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,880
That is not right.

542
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,540
I see what you mean, Jack, and I'm behind you 100%.

543
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,620
We're all behind you, Jack, 100%.

544
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,640
I think that there's no question that had Oswald been tried, he would have been acquitted.

545
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,960
That does not mean to say that I'm certain he is innocent.

546
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,440
But certainly his guilt has not been proven.

547
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,600
And a whole vast series of episodes and activities raise serious questions in my mind

548
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,700
as to whether or not some two months before the assassination,

549
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,780
an effort may have been underway to frame the early officer.

550
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,620
My fellow citizen, it means my eyes, my dear.

551
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,580
It gets murkier and murkier, dear friends.

552
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,440
I love it.

553
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,140
Me too.

554
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,300
Now, let's see.

555
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,780
Now we'll go through my little notes.

556
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,380
See, this is how article writers.

557
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,620
No, Doug, the crowd is really picking up again.

558
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Of course, the thirst for blood is, they're riled up here.

559
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,120
Was it at 1225 or 1125?

560
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,460
Boy, you got me.

561
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,800
Doug, I tell you.

562
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,600
But I think the crowd here is ready to see some action.

563
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,140
I think they are ready to see some brain fragments splattered across the street.

564
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,920
At least in retrospect, if nothing else.

565
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,320
It's a lovely thing, a beautiful thing.

566
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,320
It's what it makes.

567
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,140
What makes America.

568
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:14,660
Right.

569
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,080
You know, love of spectacle.

570
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,700
It's a meaning.

571
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,420
Yes, it brought meaning into our lives.

572
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,020
Hi, Mom.

573
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,280
Whatever time it was, it meshed.

574
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,460
It meshed.

575
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,920
It sure did.

576
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,500
It meshed.

577
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,860
The ritual was complete.

578
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,980
Takeover happened and they live.

579
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,060
And they are here today in record numbers.

580
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,060
Yeah, this is looking out.

581
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,560
Here from the grassy knoll.

582
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,900
You see a huge crowd, probably about the same size as the crowd here 25 years ago.

583
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,160
Probably so.

584
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,820
Just about the same, but a lot more cameras than there were then.

585
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,260
It's a damn shame we don't have more angles on that incredible pornography shot.

586
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,620
Abraham Zapruder on that day, which so many Americans have.

587
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,320
Oh, boy.

588
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,340
Two weeks on TV.

589
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,300
Even my little kids drawing pictures of presidents getting their heads blown off.

590
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,160
I just think the way new technology has let us see the president's head being blown up is just, it's a miracle.

591
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,540
It's a wonderful miracle of technology.

592
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,100
I guess at this point we'll just hobble on out of here.

593
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:37,000
Looks like the guys with the big cameras, they have the stage, really.

594
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,720
Get all this footage.

595
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,240
I was kind of hoping somebody would throw some firecrackers.

596
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,660
I think we got the important footage.

597
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,040
We got the last living witness.

598
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,580
Only we know where President John F. Kennedy really is.

599
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,840
At least where the brain is.

600
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,640
The brain is driving a taxi cab in Argentina.

601
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,320
Well, that gets rid of him pretty quick, doesn't it?

602
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,720
See, there was a TV camera pointed at us while we were saying that.

603
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,100
When I said the brain was driving a cab in Argentina, she turned away because they don't want people to know.

604
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,880
That's right.

605
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,940
It's a cover-up.

606
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,080
They don't want, there's no way.

607
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,920
Massive cover-up.

608
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,200
It's just, it's dangerous knowledge.

609
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:26,900
And frankly, the only way to throw suspicion off yourself is to tell the truth because it sounds so ridiculous, so insane, that they'll let you live.

610
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,040
He came down the street.

611
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,060
They came, see this is the null part.

612
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,820
See, they came down this street right over here.

613
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,140
And they turned on that one and came over here and then took a left on this one.

614
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,140
And when they got about to the, where that, see that post right there?

615
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,360
You can see the left.

616
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,600
That's the window Oswald was in.

617
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,320
Up there.

618
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,060
It's the second one from the left.

619
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,080
The second one from the top.

620
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,400
Is it the third one?

621
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,440
I don't know the second one.

622
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,360
Well, the other guy was in the third one.

623
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:56,980
Yeah.

624
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,180
And supposedly there was another guy up here in the Daltex building.

625
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,320
This building right up here.

626
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,560
The umbrella man was giving signals right down here somewhere.

627
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,480
Calling Mr. Oswald.

628
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,500
Calling Mr. Oswald.

629
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,320
Well, anyway, the point is, is that, however, a lot of the kinds of things that people have brought up,

630
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,920
about the Warren Commission and about the Kennedy assassination,

631
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,360
have sort of gotten tilted off into this area, the area of the fringe participants.

632
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,320
And as we stated at the earlier part of the show, and as we're going to prove conclusively next week,

633
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,240
um, the fringe has very little to do with it.

634
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,460
Although, as with any event of any magnitude, fringe groups have become attracted to it.

635
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,700
And I don't know anything about Mr. Thornley other than what we've talked about here.

636
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,960
But, uh, fringe groups certainly are attracted to events of this magnitude.

637
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,340
However, as we stated before at the beginning of the show, you either believe in the Warren Commission,

638
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,200
or you believe in the laws of physics, and there are no, uh, two sides to that particular street.

639
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,880
It is strictly a one-way voyage.

640
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,140
Anyway, so I hope that we can put the Church of the Subgenius to bed with that.

641
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,960
In fact, why don't we formally do it? I'll, I'll stay right here.

642
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,460
If you want to talk about the Church of Subgenius, call up Bob Nelson and talk to him about it.

643
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Don't bother us with that nonsense anymore.

644
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,880
Call the Church of the Subgenius. Anyway, back to the phone.

645
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,440
I thought, uh, bringing the crowd's all right.

646
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,360
Oh, what the hell was that?

647
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,320
That's the wave.

648
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,160
Well, uh, what I understand is how you got in.

649
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,300
I was in the Marines with Oswald.

650
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,000
You knew him personally?

651
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,900
Yes. We were in, uh, Marine Air Command Squadron 9 together at, uh, a subsidiary of, uh,

652
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,480
a tall Marine base called LPA at that time.

653
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,220
That was before he went to Russia?

654
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,280
Yes, uh, spring of 1959.

655
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,720
You're actually serious about this, it sounds to me.

656
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,680
I thought that you were just joking.

657
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,360
That's the central mystery of my life.

658
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,000
No, no.

659
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,440
I wish I was, too.

660
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,600
Whenever you hear guests on this show, they're real. We're not making dough.

661
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

662
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
It's Cary Thornley on TV.

663
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,240
It might be early, but sometimes, sometimes it's like, uh,

664
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:13,220
I become almost heathen-frenic about it because it's so incredible that people listen to you if they think you're joking until they finally find out that you aren't, you know?

665
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,420
Right.

666
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:22,780
Uh, I talked to a man in New Orleans, uh, actually in Harahan, Louisiana was where most of our conversations took place.

667
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:32,020
Between 1961 and 1963, a man that at the time I didn't take very seriously because he repeated himself a lot.

668
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,820
He seemed like maybe he, his mind wasn't together.

669
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,500
He seemed extremely paranoid. He believed in conspiracies.

670
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,660
Uh, he came on like a Nazi. I was afraid of him.

671
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,780
One of the things he said to me once was, uh, he said,

672
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:05,380
Don't you think the next war against communism, instead of being against Cubans who are white people because they're of Spanish descent and haven't mixed with the Indians very much,

673
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,000
ought to be against, uh, an Oriental race?

674
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,600
I sat there and I said yes.

675
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,320
I didn't want to become a star in one of the snuff movies.

676
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,320


677
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,740
He'd also discussed with me.

678
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,560
Uh, this man talked to me about assassinating Kennedy.

679
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,400
I talked to him about assassinating Kennedy many times.

680
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,380
Oh, Dad.

681
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,400
And it was like, I didn't even realize any of it was relevant until the Watergate thing broke.

682
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,040
And in about 1975, I became what seemed to me at the time extremely paranoid.

683
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,820
After bending over backwards not to be paranoid for years.

684
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,260
Even though I'd come to believe that, uh,

685
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,240
the assassination of Oswald was a conspiracy and the murder of Kennedy was a conspiracy.

686
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,240
Um, it was like, uh,

687
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,760
it was something at the time that just seemed too paranoid to even think about.

688
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,180
And I think about this business about causing a war to happen.

689
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,180
And somewhere like Southeast Asia instead of Cuba.

690
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,400
Because maybe the Russians still had missiles in Cuba.

691
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,640
And maybe, uh, they made an agreement with like Nazis in Huntsville, Alabama or somewhere.

692
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,000
Uh, not to make, not to invade Cuba.

693
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,620
So I go around with a little rubber stamp now that says, uh,

694
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,760
that says, uh, NASA-Soviet, racist NASA-Soviet coup.

695
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,160
I have, I've got such a problem in communicating.

696
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,760
I don't have any communications anymore that people think that I'm advocating a racist NASA-Soviet coup.

697
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,640
Uh-uh.

698
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,540
So how did, how did you find subgenius?

699
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,000
Uh, Ken, Ken Vanars gave me some stuff.

700
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,700
And he says, this is something like the 12 famous Buddha minds.

701
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,080
And, or one way or another he implied that.

702
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,480
Uh, I said, all right.

703
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,820
When you're confronted with a serious, serious subject like the Kennedy assassination

704
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,620
with as much information that's available on it.

705
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,060
And instead, you know, what you want to talk about is that what interests you is the church of the subgenius.

706
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,280
Well, you know, don't complain when you see what goes on.

707
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,660
Because frankly, you know, the church of the subgenius is nonsense.

708
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,900
I mean, it's triviality.

709
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,720
It has no significance, uh, for any, anything that anybody's going to care about.

710
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,880
Now what's, there's, I know there's some more.

711
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,820
Daltex building.

712
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,080
This building right up here.

713
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,260
The umbrella man was giving signals right down here somewhere.

714
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,140
Calling Mr. Oswald.

715
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,520
Calling anyone at the scene of you.

716
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,380
Taking all the hooters.

717
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,360
There's a chance you might have seen him.

718
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,080
There's a thousand variations of every witness in a file.

719
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,360
Jennifer would send some copy.

720
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,200
And she comes back with a smile.

721
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,140
Says, I hear that South America is coming out of style.

722
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,740
More news today from Dobstown.

723
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,500
The recent political unrest was quelled yesterday by a force 10 monsoon of devastating proportions.

724
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,120
It all but leveled into China.

725
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,420
Our special Dobstown correspondent,

726
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,800
Alec J. Hidel, is on the line via shortwave radio.

727
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,980
Uh, Mr. Hidel, I understand your friends call you Lee?

728
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,300
That is correct, yeah.

729
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,880
Satellite photos confirm the Mele Peninsula and surrounding regions have been scoured clean by Typhoon Connie.

730
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,500
The devastation is absolutely stunning.

731
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,700
Not so much as a crappy black and white portable TV or a clock radio seem to have been spared.

732
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,600
In order to give a clear and concise and short answer to each question,

733
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:56,740
I would say that the facts and figures from a country like Pakistan or Burma would even reflect more light upon how many television sets and how many radios and all that.

734
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,940
This, I do not think, is something to be discussed tonight.

735
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,060
The most frightening aspect of this is that Connie took most of the 93 frop crop back out to sea with her.

736
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,460
How is Dobstown holding up under this incredible pressure?

737
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,600
Well, I think that's a good question.

738
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:23,280
Well, in any country emerging from a semi-colonial state and embarking upon reforms which require a diversification of agriculture,

739
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,920
you're going to have shortages.

740
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,480
As for public sentiment at that time, I think even at that time, even before the revolution,

741
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,720
there were rumblings of official comment and so forth from government officials.

742
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,600
We are, however, not particularly interested in what the latest members of the government are saying.

743
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:42,600


744
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,740
I think that's what the leaders of the rightist organizations have to say.

745
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:53,900
It's very convenient for rightist organizations to drag out this or that literature of reporting to show a fact which has not been established in law.

746
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,860
It sounds like you've been having trouble from all sectors.

747
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,820
What about the conspiracy efforts to close down the home for slackless children?

748
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,820
Have they succeeded?

749
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,300
We have been investigated from several points of view.

750
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,460
That is, points of view of taxes, allegiance, subversion, and so forth.

751
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,180
The findings have been, as I say, absolutely zero.

752
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:23,420
With the Soviets out of the way, right-wing elements such as Pat Buchanan and Rush Limbaugh maintain that Dobstown will be the site of the next Red Scare.

753
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,400
Is that poppycock or mere balderdash?

754
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:37,120
We are not at all communist-controlled, regardless of the fact that we have been investigated, regardless of any of those facts.

755
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,400
Our aims and our ideals are very clear.

756
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,440
And in the best interest of the people, we are not.

757
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,340
We are keeping with American traditions of democracy.

758
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,700
Well, Lee, I've got to tell you, you're still a folk hero back here in the States.

759
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,100
Oh, faking your own murder and hiding out for 30 years.

760
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,220
Has it really been worth it?

761
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,180
Well, that is, of course, very provocative, and I question, I don't think it requires an answer.

762
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,840
But you turned your back on a promising career in stand-up comedy.

763
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,440
People are still raving about your lounge act.

764
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,140
And the last one, the one out at the Sands in Vegas,

765
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,000
the Pinocchio bit where you tell these outrageous lies.

766
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:21,660
Republicans are not a, well, Republicans are an established political party representing a great many people.

767
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,940
They represent no radical point of view.

768
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:29,220
They do not have a very violent and sometimes emotional opposition as we do.

769
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh, stop it, stop it, I'm running.

770
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,460
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

771
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,440
Mmm, truly funny men like you are just all too rare.

772
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,840
We are in a monarchy, Shirley.

773
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,520
Lee, you sound like a guy who likes to really swing.

774
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,460
That's one of our main points.

775
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,940
We are for that.

776
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,400
Hey, forget all this ideological we stuff.

777
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,840
I want to know more about you.

778
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,300
Oh, yeah, you, baby.

779
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,180
There's just something about a man-licker carcano man.

780
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,440
Oh, all of us Uber drivers.

781
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,540
We're just a bunch of

782
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:15,260
Oh, you're our favorite Patsy since Patsy Clive.

783
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,420
We even started a fan club dedicated to you, sugar.

784
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,480
Uh, the honorary chairman of this committee, the name of that person, I certainly don't know.

785
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,840
Oh, it's the reverend Suzie the floozy, honey.

786
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,460
It's me.

787
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,980
I'm the captain of your love boat.

788
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,380
Oh, come on.

789
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,540
Give me your number and I'll be there in a snap.

790
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:49,580
Uh, well, as I, uh, well, I will answer that question directly then since you will not rest until you get your answer.

791
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,900
Ooh, baby, I'll take the Concord to get there to you.

792
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,040
You're the hottest thing since Coral of Pandit, honey, and I've got to have you.

793
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,660
Take me, lone gunman.

794
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,640
Ooh, give me an address so I'll have something to give the cabbie when I land.

795
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,440
There's a signed operating procedure for a cabbie.

796
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:07,440


797
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,060
It's a political organization consisting of a, uh, political minority, uh, to safeguard the names and the number of its members.

798
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,020
Well, if that's the way you feel, forget it.

799
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,900
Well, I never, and I probably never will at this rate.

800
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,840
Hey, Stang, where's Jack Ruby's number?

801
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,500
Uh, I think we've got it back here somewhere.

802
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,120
Oh, look at that.

803
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,440
We get three flashes and then, uh, the lights come back on.

804
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,360
They have screaming sirens.

805
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,580
And then Jack Ruby's standing in front of you.

806
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:39,900
Mm-hmm.

807
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,240
Uh...

808
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,500
Instructions on bath taking.

809
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,840
And the conscience of America finally rose up to confront even the President of the United States.

810
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,200
I would have never been a quitter.

811
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,660
Okay, that's my dad.

812
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,280
He wanted to go. My return was complete.

813
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,320
That was a family tape.

814
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:01,720
Sir.

815
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,960
Okay, so what we'd like is a little information for the court so that we may be able to decide

816
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,600
your participation in this crime or event or celebration as the court deems it.

817
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,680
It is very easy to understand.

818
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,960
He bites the lower cortex...

819
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,760
Is this the tape we're seeing now, Judge?

820
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,260
...and rips the medulla oblongata out with his teeth.

821
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:21,540
Judge!

822
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,540
Judge, give me that.

823
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,140
Yes.

824
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,360
Okay, peck some.

825
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,440
It may seem strange, but the nutritive effects are most beneficial.

826
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:41,840
This is a car with a mass confusion, a crawling and a kiting.

827
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,860
There's the police official.

828
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,620
Who is he?

829
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,600
Jack Ruby.

830
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,600
Jack Ruby?

831
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,200
Ruby.

832
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,840
He runs the Carousel Club?

833
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,140
Right there.

834
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,560
Where was he in the motorcade?

835
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,420
He was directly behind the presidential vehicle on the left, excuse me, right side of the car.

836
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,540
On the, in the...

837
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:03,960
That's right.

838
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,020
It looks like he would have glanced off the limousine.

839
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,020
He was, uh...

840
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,020
I told you his name, but I can't remember those.

841
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,740
This one hit him only.

842
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,880
Well, it looked like he jumped into the car, but there was another agent who pushed him onto the car when the car sped away.

843
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,340
Would you write me, please, at Box 1465?

844
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:17,560
45.

845
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,280
Better yet, hang on to your name and get in touch.

846
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:20,640
Is that all?

847
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,340
We're out of time.

848
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,080
For the sake of the people that would like to get more information...

849
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,960
Somebody's firing 122 rockets into the center of the city now, and they're not kidding.

850
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,720
I'm with you.

851
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,200
Right.

852
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,180
He was staying up here filming it.

853
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:45,540
Supposedly, uh, there was, uh, a bunch of people over here, or somebody over there saw a guy with a gun, and he asked him what he was doing, and he said he was with the Secret Service.

854
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,080
Either that was back here or it was over behind that center.

855
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,380
But he had a .30-30 with him.

856
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:49,640
Yeah.

857
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,160
Yeah, the Secret Service.

858
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,060
And, uh...

859
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,240
Long distance.

860
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,680
And he flashed identification and everything, you know?

861
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,120
And, uh...

862
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,940
And there were three invisible green energy beamings hovering directly at him.

863
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:00,940


864
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,340
Exactly overhead.

865
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,680
Not only that, but there was a, uh, a clown that nobody knew about.

866
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,600
Yeah, a clown.

867
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,200
And a crutch.

868
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,320
Yeah, a crutch.

869
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,700
Clown sniper.

870
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,120
Gun.

871
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,060
Crowds, and just anybody.

872
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,040
They're just, they're compelled to do what they're programmed to do.

873
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,920
And when you flash anything and say, you know, ID, you can go like this.

874
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:18,480
Yeah.

875
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,080
And they'll take...

876
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,220
They'll see, uh, an ID, a badge there when you do that.

877
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,780
Their mind will manufacture one.

878
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,000
It's weird.

879
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,800
But there was a lot of people who probably saw everything that went on.

880
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,120
And caused the, the whole bit with the Earl Warren Commission.

881
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,660
And the influence that the, like them guys flashing the badges had when they were here.

882
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,060
It's all just dispersed now, you know?

883
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,300
Yeah.

884
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,920
There's no way you can collect all that stuff again to, to make it sound, you know, normal at this time.

885
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,680
Well, but, uh...

886
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,320
It's logical.

887
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,800
...fake anti-war and important PSN people that were presuming other false assassins.

888
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,060
Yeah, right.

889
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,700
Yeah.

890
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,700
To pull off the real graphic.

891
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,420
Maybe that's what Doug Wellman is.

892
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,680
Oh, and this morning, depressed over your estrangement from a wife who views you as a dismal and pathetic failure,

893
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,680
you rose before dawn, kissed your sleeping children, put your last hundred dollars and your wedding ring into a Demetaz cup,

894
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,200
which Marina's mother gave you for a wedding present, and came here to kill yourself.

895
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,060
Who are you?

896
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,980
I'm your friend, Lee.

897
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,000
I don't have any friends.

898
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,380
Yes, you do. You just haven't met them yet.

899
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,680
Show me your badge.

900
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,520
Oh, what?

901
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,280
You bastards think you're so smart.

902
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,800
I know my rights.

903
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,540
You try to interrogate me in my place of business, I can sue you for harassment.

904
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,960
Ah, you think I'm with the FBI.

905
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,380
I have a right to see your badge.

906
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,720
Search me, Lee. You think I got a badge?

907
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,500
Come on, search me.

908
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,680
The FBI.

909
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,320
You really love those morons, don't you?

910
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,680
Hell, why wouldn't you?

911
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,640
No one else cares if you live or die.

912
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,000
Those guys can't get enough of you.

913
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,940
How was your day, Lee?

914
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,740
Selling your secrets to the Soviets?

915
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,200
Sabotage any defense plans?

916
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,120
Kick off your shoes?

917
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,320
Tell us all about who you are.

918
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,200
I'm sorry, Lee.

919
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,120
It's just so sad.

920
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,080
I mean, it's all you ever wanted, isn't it?

921
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:00,780
So much for the FBI.

922
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,640
Someone who won't leave you alone.

923
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,360
Someone who wants to hear about your day.

924
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,420
Someone, anyone.

925
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,480
Your mother.

926
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,420
Mother Russia.

927
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:06,940
The Marines.

928
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,160
Your wife, Marina.

929
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,880
Attention must be paid.

930
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,560
What's that mean?

931
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,780
It's from a play.

932
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,780
About a salesman.

933
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,220
A man very much like you.

934
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,020
Independent, proud.

935
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,420
A decent man who tries and tries but never gets a break.

936
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,820
So he does something dumb.

937
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,040
When things go really sour, when he realizes that his whole life has been a failure built

938
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,560
on lies, he kills himself.

939
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:30,760
He's a real man.

940
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


941
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


942
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


943
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


944
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


945
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


946
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


947
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


948
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,520
And when he's dead, his wife stands at his grave and says, attention must be paid.

949
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,000
She has to beg the world to pay attention to this poor, misguided nobody.

950
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,160
Tell you something, Lee.

951
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:42,780
I'm an actor.

952
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,720
And I'm a good one.

953
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,120
But Willy Loman is a part that I could never play.

954
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,440
And I don't think that you should play it either.

955
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

956
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,560
What do you want, Lee?

957
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,500
You know so much.

958
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,220
Why don't you tell me?

959
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,300
You want what everybody wants.

960
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,340
To be appreciated.

961
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,180
To be valued.

962
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,740
To be another person.

963
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


964
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


965
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


966
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


967
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


968
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


969
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


970
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:00,740


971
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,880
To make people's thoughts, for them to think of you and smile.

972
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,780
You want somebody to love you, Lee.

973
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,080
Right?

974
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:09,860
Isn't that it?

975
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,600
Lee.

976
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
Yes, forget it.

977
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,360
What?

978
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,280
It's never going to happen.

979
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,200
It's a fantasy.

980
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,080
You've got to give it up.

981
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,780
I'm going to kill myself.

982
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,280
Don't you think I've given it up?

983
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,520
No, I think you're going to kill yourself because you think that's how to get it.

984
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,180
When I'm dead, then they'll be sorry.

985
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,520
When I'm dead, they'll know how much they love me.

986
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,420
When you close your eyes.

987
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,980
You probably see the funeral, don't you, Lee?

988
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,140
A gentle rain is falling.

989
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,060
Everybody has umbrellas.

990
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:34,380
Shut up.

991
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,700
There's Marina weeping quietly.

992
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,660
You're sobbing children clutching at her skirt.

993
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,000
Your mom, your dad, every boss who ever fired you.

994
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,540
Sorry, Lee.

995
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,420
It's just so childish.

996
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,100
It's so dumb.

997
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,860
You think you're dumb?

998
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,920
If I shouldn't kill myself, then what should I do?

999
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,580
Go home?

1000
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,900
Beg her to take me back?

1001
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,680
Plead with her?

1002
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,260
Beat her up?

1003
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:49,900
You tried all that.

1004
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,360
It doesn't work.

1005
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,300
I know it doesn't work.

1006
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,740
So tell me what I should do.

1007
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,080
You should kill the president of the United States.

1008
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,420
What?

1009
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,240
His plane landed at the airport.

1010
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:00,400
He was in a hurry.

1011
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,400


1012
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,060
He was here 15 minutes ago.

1013
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,180
He's coming into town to make a speech.

1014
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,300
His motorcade is going to go right past this window.

1015
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,240
When it does, you shoot him.

1016
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:09,980
You're nuts.

1017
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:10,840
Maybe I am.

1018
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,300
So what?

1019
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,860
I didn't come here to shoot the president.

1020
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,180
He didn't come here to get shot.

1021
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,140
All your life, you've been a victim, Lee.

1022
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,120
A victim of indifference and neglect.

1023
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,940
Of your mother's scorn, your wife's contempt, of Soviet stupidity, American injustice.

1024
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,200
You finally had enough.

1025
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,700
So how are you planning to get even?

1026
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,120
By becoming your own victim.

1027
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,560
I am not a murderer.

1028
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,280
Who said you were?

1029
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1030
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1031
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1032
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1033
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1034
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1035
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,380


1036
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,840
You just said I should kill the president.

1037
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,040
Lee, when you kill a president, it isn't murder.

1038
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Murder is a tawdry little crime.

1039
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,400
It's born of greed or lust or liquor.

1040
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,240
Adulterers and shopkeepers get murdered.

1041
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:49,520
But when a president gets killed, when Julius Caesar got killed, he was assassinated.

1042
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,740
And the man who did it, Brutus.

1043
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,940
Ah, you know his name?

1044
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,400
Brutus assassinated Caesar, what, 2,000 years ago?

1045
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,680
And he is a high school dropout with a $1.25 an hour job in Dallas, Texas, who knows

1046
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,380
who he was.

1047
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,200
And they say, famous people.

1048
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,680
Boy, you expect some lies.

1049
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,260
This is stupid up here on the sixth floor.

1050
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,340
All what I do, throw school books at them?

1051
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,040
What's in the package?

1052
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,880
What package?

1053
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,340
The package that you brought to work.

1054
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,900
What's in it?

1055
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,040
Curtain rods.

1056
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,520
Oh, just a show.

1057
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:22,800
Shut up, Sean.

1058
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,380
Marina wanted me to take them.

1059
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,840
Just a little show in this package full of curtain rods.

1060
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,760
And what a nasty show it is, dear friends.

1061
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:38,820
And you can get worse things than this show from the Church of the Subgenius, believe

1062
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,340
it or not.

1063
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,360
There's actually quite a bit that's the printed word and the visible word.

1064
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,380
And I'd like to give you the post office box number to write to for free information.

1065
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:57,820
Of course, a self-addressed stamped envelope would make it even more free for us.

1066
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:57,820


1067
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,340
You'd probably get more.

1068
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,020
And just write to b-b-b-Bob, won't you?

1069
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:12,960
At post office box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1070
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:19,820
Yes, where we teach them to shoot at presidents and at people who shoot at presidents.

1071
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,560
75214.

1072
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,660
And thank you, Lamar.

1073
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:27,800
Thank you, Bob.

1074
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:27,800


1075
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:27,800


1076
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:27,800


1077
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:27,800


1078
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,240
And Susie for coming down to the show.

1079
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,520
So nice for you to have us.

1080
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,760
And Susie is a lot to have, dear friends.

1081
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:46,840
The questioning and the satire of the subgeniuses, the stupidists, the satirists, surrealists,

1082
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:57,260
those who dare to stumble on their own thoughts, hobbling along on the questions.

1083
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:57,920
Or their own bricks.

1084
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,600
Or their own bricks of their belief.

1085
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,240
The bricks of their beliefs.

1086
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,140
That's us, dear friends.

1087
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,740
That's the subgeniuses.

1088
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,120
And we're, I guess I should.

1089
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:07,940
Well, that's just not who he thinks.

1090
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,700
I should explain what you're listening to here.

1091
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:18,780
This is, of course, the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack with your host, Reverend Ivan

1092
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,300
Stang.

1093
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:25,560
And I'd like to, of course, this show is not normally about the assassination of John

1094
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,060
F. Kennedy.

1095
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,240
We just happen to have come to the show to talk about the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

1096
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,240


1097
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,240


1098
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,240


1099
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,240


1100
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:27,240


1101
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,200
And I'd like to welcome you back from a lovely convention about that thing.

1102
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,500
And so that's the focus tonight.

1103
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,700
You can get other information about the Church of the Subgenius beyond its involvement in

1104
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:45,080
the Kennedy assassination by way of Kerry Thornley, Oswald's Marine roommate, by writing

1105
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,680
to our post office box for free information.

1106
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,920
And that box number is, got that pencil ready, Lee?

1107
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,060
It's box 140307.

1108
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,220


1109
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,220


1110
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,220


1111
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:15,100
And that's Bob at Dallas, Texas, PO Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
