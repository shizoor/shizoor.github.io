1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Dear friends, everything you're about to hear is from July and August of 1994.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,360
This is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 457, Lonesome Cowboy Dave in space.

3
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,340
Hi everybody, nice to be back with you.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Well, first of all, I bring a personal message to Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the many sacrifices you have made.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,360
And of course, his congratulations on your discovery, which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,360
Listen, Howell.

7
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,980
There's never been a time when you've been so grateful.

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,680
There's never been an instance at all of a computer error occurring in an i-1000 series, has there?

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,460
Of course I have.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,600
Sorry about this.

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,500
I know it's a bit silly.

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,600
Just a moment.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,400
Just a moment.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,720
Yes.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,240
It's puzzling.

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,460
How is old Bob?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,660
Oh, he's doing good.

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,360
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,080
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,400
Our House Slack.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,020
Welcome potential initiative and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,700
Uh, yes, for the next 30 minutes of wrecked up equipment and crummy tape.

23
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,960
God, and the, the, the, uh, oh, everything's all messed up already, and we have to do so many shows so quickly.

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,020
And, where's the tape? There it is. Oh, there, yes.

25
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,780
Yes, and, well, but, all things shall pass, they say.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Oh, listen, you can hear the guard dogs. Listen to that.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,960
That's the sound of the new subgenius house.

28
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,500
It's scary, isn't it?

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,380
I suppose I should probably go see who's at the door.

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,560
Yes, just go see.

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,660
Oh, the phone rang twice more since I went to the door.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,460
Let's see, what's some, some good background music here.

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,680
Friends, uh, what an auspicious start.

34
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,120
To another show.

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,420
That was a little old lady at the door.

36
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,740
And, see, I just moved into a new skyscraper studio here.

37
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,800
And, and, uh, there was no one else here but me and the guard dogs.

38
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,900
And this little old lady was at the door.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,780
And she went out.

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,780
We're, I live with, I'm Miss Barry.

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,520
I live on the house I run behind, behind the road there.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,960
And we're trying to get speed bumps put in.

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,560
Because people just drive much too fast down that road there.

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,900
And, and.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,160
And the fire department says they need it for emergency use.

46
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,080
But there aren't that many emergencies.

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,720
And I thought, well, lady, you don't live my life.

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
I was so charming and sweet.

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm standing there.

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,160
I haven't shaved in two days.

51
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,020
Wearing a Church of Elvis t-shirt.

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,140
24-hour Church of Elvis.

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,380
With my horrible old gray hair running halfway down my back and everything.

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,180
And then, and then the phone rings some more.

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,660
And then it was, it was Palmer.

56
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,100
And then it was the editor from New York.

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,220
And then it was my agent.

58
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,680
And friends, you know.

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,540
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,920
Creeps in this petty outer space.

61
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,940
From day to day.

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,720
To the last tail leader of recorded tapes.

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,040
And all our yesterfrops have lighted.

64
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,700
Subgeniuses the way to bad breath.

65
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,100
Out, out brief flashlight batteries.

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,720
Life is but a walking shadow.

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,120
A poor pocket pool player who struts and frets his hour of slack upon the airwaves.

68
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,680
And then is heard no more.

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,400
It is a rant yelled by idiots.

70
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,340
Full of sound and fury.

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,200
And then it's heard.

72
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,180
Signifying Dobbs.

73
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,100
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack, dear friends.

74
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,140
The voice of the church of the subgenius.

75
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,560
A celebration of peace, love, and understanding.

76
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,300
It just happens to take the form of pain, hate, and confusion.

77
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,300
For this global village of the damned.

78
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,060
Oh, and it's also about slack.

79
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,220
And Bob.

80
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,820
Dear friends, yes.

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,300
We mustn't forget.

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,960
Those.

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,300
Fine things.

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,840
Lest we will be indeed the global village of the damned.

Copyright 1994, Paul Malbriti.

86
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,780
Yes, friends.

87
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,400
This old show.

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,460
This old show has been through many changes recently.

89
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,700
First, losing the station in Dallas.

90
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,200
And having to rebuild a down and dirty mini studio here at the home office.

91
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,520
And then we had to move the home office.

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,960
Oh yeah.

93
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,220
The Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
And Bullion.

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,520
Bulldada.

96
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,300
Time Control.

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,180
Not to mention everything I personally own in this world.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,880
And that includes a hell of a lot of comic books, friends.

99
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,580
Has all been physically moved to new digs in another part of Dallas.

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
A new skyscraper.

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,640
And friends.

102
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,500
It's been hell.

103
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,400
And I don't mean no subgenius hell either.

104
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, that'd be a party.

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,800
We're not talking about a single bedroom efficiency with flimsy modern aluminum furniture.

106
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,520
We're talking about countless heavy massive antiques.

107
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,020
And the stakes upon which all our flimsy recording equipment is sitting.

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:41,660
Directly behind me as I sit here, seen on screen three, is a 17-foot wall to ceiling.

109
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,940
Floor to ceiling wall, friends.

110
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,540
Of tapes, videos, films, albums, CDs, Cats and Nine Tails.

111
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,940
We've got a new phone number.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,940
A new physical address.

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,180
Although, market friends, our virtual address.

114
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,460
The sacred P.O. box.

115
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,720
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,440
That, my friend, is eternal.

117
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,060
And shall ne'er change while Bob lives.

118
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,080
And while I live.

119
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,800
But anyway, we had to put off producing the show for two weeks.

120
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,280
And I'm just lucky there's so much tape laying around here.

121
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,720
Screaming and begging to be broadcast.

122
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,980
You can almost hear them.

123
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,900
They're in the background.

124
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,760
But, friends, we're in a new building, too.

125
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,720
And you know what that means?

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,040
That means that nothing works.

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,620
Because it was made in America by union idiots.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,020
And every single fixture sprang a leak.

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
Even the electrical ones.

130
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,840
And it was like a Three Stooges comedy brought to life.

131
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,960
I mean, it really was.

132
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,000
But, you know, they say subgeniuses work best under pressure.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,520
And, of course, we always cause that incredible pressure to build up by blowing everything off until the last minute.

134
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,680
And then, then, only then, with total disaster breathing down our necks with its hot breath,

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,740
we perform magnificently.

136
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,060
Far beyond mere hume expectations.

137
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,620
It's the fear that amplifies the intelligence, friends.

138
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,180
It's the fight or flight syndrome.

139
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,600
Makes you 20 times smarter than normal.

140
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,100
Unless you're a human.

141
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,560
And then it's just pure panic.

142
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,340
Pure panic.

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,960
It's like my daughter's theory about the lucidity of the moment of death.

144
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,500
My little cute 13-year-old says that if you know you're about to die,

145
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,920
like the Mack truck is coming straight at you or whatever,

146
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:47,020
your brain automatically switches into a higher gear than it has ever been in before.

147
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,780
And not only is your whole life replayed in an instant, complete with smells,

148
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,080
but you also realize you can't do anything.

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Suddenly, for the first time, realize the perfect, foolproof, and most of all, extremely easy scheme

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,280
that would have saved the planet and made you a billionaire instantly.

151
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,180
But along with that, in those last microseconds of life,

152
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,660
comes the frustration of realizing how utterly obvious it should have been to you all along.

153
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,000
How stupid you were not to think of it.

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,100
Eh, too late now, though.

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,960
And what's worse, as Vreedes pointed out,

156
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,660
is that if you happen to live through it,

157
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,460
you forget.

158
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,660
Bummer, man.

159
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Anyway, that's the way things are now.

160
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:40,220
No sooner did we move the entire church coffers and all the gear to a new place

161
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,540
and finally unpack and fix the disasters,

162
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,520
than I get a phone call this morning that basically says

163
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,220
that if I don't fly to San Francisco right now to ensure, no matter what,

164
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,000
that the new subgenius book, Revelation X, Final Layout,

165
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,660
will be done in two weeks, then we're canceled.

166
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,920
Period. The project is canceled.

167
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,880
That's right, that's how late we were.

168
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,800
So, it's easy, friends.

169
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,780
I just have to drop everything else,

170
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,540
spend my life savings getting to the far-off cave of Paul Mavridis and Hal Robbins,

171
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,360
and help them finish a chapter a day,

172
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,020
and do all the corrections,

173
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
and hand-carry the material to the publishers in New York,

174
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
that's all, that's all that,

175
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,560
and do the five overdue hour of slack radio shows before I leave!

176
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,020
So, this, dear friends, is the ultimate slack of subgenius horror,

177
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
or something like that.

178
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,120
It's the hand that dobs Deltas.

179
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,140
Will we then be jokers?

180
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,560
Or aces?

181
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,220
Or, more likely, just pull a black queen and explode?

182
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,260
Only the next fourteen days will tell,

183
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,200
so wish me luck in assembling today

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,920
two months worth of tapes into five hours of slack

185
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,880
between now and tomorrow, would you?

186
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,080
And send, after that, your prayers towards the bay

187
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,620
for me and Mavridis and Dr. Howell

188
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,780
to somehow have the energy and brilliance to finish

189
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,820
what we started three long years ago

190
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,000
before the conspiracy.

191
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,580
And, of course, the conspiracy pulls the plug,

192
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,760
leaving us with the greatest unpublished book in all history

193
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,520
and a bill for $20,000.

194
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,020
Amen.

195
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,060
Well, I guess,

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,440
first, let's go to outer space, friends,

197
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,420
with lonesome cowboy Dave.

198
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,020
Yeah, I think we'll do that.

199
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,340
That hardly takes any editing.

200
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,740
This was originally broadcast...

201
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:50,880
Whoa!

202
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,240
Man!

203
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,880
They're coming in again.

204
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,480
I can't believe this!

205
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,000
On top of moving, I have to deal with these!

206
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,860
Okay, this coming up was originally broadcast July

207
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,200
on WCSB radio in Cleveland.

208
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,560
Swamp radio, the show of Chaz Smith and lonesome cowboy Dave.

209
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,000
I've been saving this stuff, friends, for...

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,920
just such an occasion.

211
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,620
Praise the Lord.

212
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,700
Ah!

213
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,300
Ah!

214
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

215
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,300
No kind of world for an old man no more.

216
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Well, after this espousal,

217
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,460
I can only wonder what kind of surgery you must have gone under

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,780
to get the pipe-like grin

219
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,660
and also some of the weird brain fusions.

220
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,740
Well, they tell me I was born...

221
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm not a joker, man.

222
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,540
I'm an ace.

223
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,940
I want you to understand that.

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,320
I can't understand the difference between the cards yet.

225
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
I know I'm trying, but...

226
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm not a joker, man.

227
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm not an ace neither.

228
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,980
It's more like a quagmire I'm lost in.

229
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,560
It's just a splattering of 52 different numbers in the deck,

230
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,420
and I can't figure out which one to go with.

231
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,500
I thought I'd like to be a ten of clubs,

232
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,620
but it turned out I was a ten of clubfoot.

233
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,640
Yeah, that'll get you out of Vietnam.

234
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,880
That got me out of Vietnam.

235
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,420
Why did you want to go there?

236
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,460
I didn't want to go.

237
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,400
I wanted to get out.

238
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,280
Luckily, my ten clubs of feet did it.

239
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,960
You can get out of Vietnam by having clubfeet?

240
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,860
Yeah, tell them.

241
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,000
They're going to ship you off if you don't.

242
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,140
Just all you got to do is take your shoes off

243
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,160
in front of the psychiatrist.

244
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I thought they were going to ship me off

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
to one of those off-planet little spin...

246
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,020
those little spin containers,

247
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,600
those little tuna fish cans.

248
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,740
Well, the...

249
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,800
Vietnam is slang for Venus.

250
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,520
Ha!

251
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,860
The capital of the world.

252
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,780
The capital city, Ritz, right?

253
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,240
Yeah, and Iran is slang for Mars.

254
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,360
We say, oh, we're having a war with Iraq.

255
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,820
What that means is that's North Mars.

256
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,240
North Mars.

257
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,820
Or South Mars.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,060
Well, I thought...

259
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,620
Iran is North Mars.

260
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,600
Vietnam, that was Venus, man.

261
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,720
I mean, they were just...

262
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,200
The media tricked you into thinking

263
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,700
that we're in this primitive 1990s technology

264
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,540
when actually they're shipping people off all the time.

265
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,180
Well, there's colony...

266
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,980
There's slave colonies on Saturn.

267
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,540
Well, not actually on Saturn.

268
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,620
The gravity there would, you know,

269
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,640
make you as heavy as Orson Welles.

270
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,200
Well, was the moon landing real?

271
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,020
But, you know, on the...

272
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,400
Huh?

273
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,840
Was the moon landing real?

274
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah, in 1945.

275
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,240
You mean Oscar Wilde conquered the moon in 1945

276
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,900
with the Mercury Theater?

277
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,120
Or...

278
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,480
No, wait a minute.

279
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,540
No, that was Edward Teller.

280
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Oh, it was Mercury.

281
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,260
Oh, and I thought that was Heinrich Tesla,

282
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,040
who was Tesla's brother

283
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,360
and actually came up with the...

284
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,380
Oppenheimer and all those guys all went to the moon.

285
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,320
Oppenheimer went to the moon?

286
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Yeah, they didn't...

287
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,500
You know, then the thing you saw in 1969 was a...

288
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,080
Roger.

289
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
That was fake.

290
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,360
You know, that was like they wanted to...

291
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,260
They had run out of funds for their secret space program.

292
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
So they said,

293
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
okay, let's tell them we're going to go to the moon

294
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,020
for the first time.

295
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, no, don't...

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
So they made a big deal out of it.

297
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,580
They made a big deal.

298
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,520
They didn't even really go.

299
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,420
I mean, they already had...

300
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,900
They couldn't have shown that footage on...

301
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,740
There's cities there.

302
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,280
There's cities on the moon?

303
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,600
Well, they're mostly underground,

304
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
but you mean you would...

305
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,860
Almost anywhere you go there,

306
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,220
you see signs, you know,

307
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,460
little smokestacks and stuff.

308
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,320
Can you get a good gyros there?

309
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,580
You know, I've heard that some of these places

310
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,220
that had been previously inhabited,

311
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,220
that they just keep on repopulating them

312
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,460
with new kinds of people.

313
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,260
There's always more where that last one came from.

314
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,900
What's the...

315
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,300
People are considered cockroaches to these...

316
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,260
The owners of these bases.

317
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,480
Yeah.

318
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,480


319
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,480


320
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,480


321
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,480


322
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,580
They're just...

323
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,980
Well, what do they want the cockroaches to do there,

324
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
other than, like, bug them

325
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,740
and get on top of the turntable or something?

326
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,700
Well, it's a farm.

327
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,960
It's a farm.

328
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,060
This is all a farm.

329
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,440
The whole solar system is a farm, Dave.

330
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,740
You're part of the...

331
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,380
You're not one of the farmers.

332
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,820
You're one of the spuds or turnips

333
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,740
that's being thrown.

334
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,760
I thought I made cheese.

335
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,820
But there...

336
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,740
You had once said that these are beings.

337
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
These farmers are too hideous to behold,

338
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,220
that their faces are all squares

339
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,140
and cockeyed angles,

340
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,700
and if they were to come into this world

341
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,580
and were...

342
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,240
You'd rip your face apart

343
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,480
and eat it.

344
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,480


345
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,480


346
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,480


347
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,480


348
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,760
You'd be in terror were you to behold one physically.

349
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,920
How do they make their way through the abyss?

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,800
Do they just blow themselves in there,

351
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,880
or do they just, like...

352
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,360
Have they always been...

353
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,600
There is no abyss to them.

354
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,420
It is all...

355
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,740
They are in no space.

356
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,420
All things are touching.

357
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,140
They have cosmic consciousness, man.

358
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,820
There's some bad...

359
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,760
All the time.

360
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,020
...macky-fackies, I guess.

361
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah.

362
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,400
Well...

363
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,080
And...

364
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
We can't get away from them?

365
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,100
I mean...

366
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,800
Through Bob, you certainly may.

367
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,880
But only through Bob.

368
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,660
Only by...

369
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,460
And, in fact, no one can get away from Bob.

370
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,460


371
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,460


372
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:44,460


373
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,260
Not merely through faith or slack in Bob,

374
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,320
but through works.

375
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,840
Money, Dave.

376
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,500
Money.

377
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,040
That $30 is all important.

378
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,960
That makes the difference between those who Bob knows trust him

379
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,020
and those that Bob doesn't even notice.

380
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,960
You can worship him all you want,

381
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,840
but if he doesn't whiff your name on that check,

382
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,200
then you...

383
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
You're just another pink boy.

384
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,880
You're no better than the pink.

385
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,180
Now, remember, we are a nonprofit radio station.

386
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,460
Yeah, but...

387
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


388
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


389
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


390
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


391
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


392
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


393
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


394
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


395
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


396
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


397
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


398
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,460


399
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,320
Bob's a non-profit.

400
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,500
I bet you've said that a thousand times.

401
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,460
That's the first time.

402
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,980
Well, if that was the first time...

403
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,240
It's the first time it ever came up.

404
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,140
Well, I don't know if I...

405
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,420
If I feel like giving some...

406
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,600
Again, we come back to,

407
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,920
Is your soul up?

408
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,300
Is your soul up, dear friends?

409
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
Is your soul up?

410
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,220
Or did you sell out?

411
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,700
Have you sold out?

412
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Yes, I have.

413
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


414
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


415
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


416
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


417
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


418
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


419
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


420
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


421
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


422
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


423
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


424
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,100
I certainly hope not.

425
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,300
We've done our best to walk that tightrope ourselves.

426
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,160
Well, I just thought I'd take a break here from the swamp radio there from WCSB

427
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,100
and just to experience this lovely music that Nenslo sent us.

428
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,100
A special tape compilation of background music.

429
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,160
Yes, background music that you'll be hearing irritatingly over and over again in the future on these shows.

430
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,160
This particular piece Nenslo calls, quote,

431
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:25,380
the master control theme, parentheses, seriously, un-parentheses, unquote.

432
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:33,460
Hmm, let's just listen for a while before we go back deep into outer space with Lonesome Cowboy Dave Show.

433
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,940
Here it goes.

434
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,460
Nenslo!

435
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,080
Nenslo!

436
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,980
Oh, Daddy.

437
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,420
Oh, Daddy.

438
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,680
Oh, Mammy.

439
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,120
Oh, Mammy.

440
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,220
Oh, Pappy.

441
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,520
Oh, Pappy.

442
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh, Grammy.

443
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, Grammy.

444
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,660
Daddy.

445
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,260
Daddy.

446
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:28,900
Mammy.

447
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,540
Mammy.

448
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,240
Pappy.

449
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,840
Pappy.

450
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,500
Grammy.

451
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,180
Grammy.

452
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Everybody's talking about how sometimes there's a Pop Hope special and Bob sings silver bells.

453
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,700
Walking in the face, no.

454
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,260
Walking with a pinball wrapped in a 40 code.

455
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,140
Everybody's talking about how sometimes there's a Pop Hope special and Bob sings silver bells.

456
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,980
Thank you.

457
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,520
Thank you.

458
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,380
Thank you.

459
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,000
Thank you.

460
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,600
Thank you.

461
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,780
Thank you.

462
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,260
Yes, dear friends.

463
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:08,700
And that was the amazing, truly amazing Joe Newman there from his tape, Yodel and Sighting.

464
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,640
Yes, Joe Newman.

465
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,080
Joe Newman.

466
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,040
Our musical short.

467
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,720
Just amazing stuff.

468
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:24,300
And let's go back now into outer space with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and just see what happens here.

469
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

470
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

471
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:34,060
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

472
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,420
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

473
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,760
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

474
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,500
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

475
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,160
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

476
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,740
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

477
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,020
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

478
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,400
And indeed, it's the perfect thing.

479
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,720
Live from the and of course, a yellow line, what we were all over by the sea here on Coney Island,

480
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,200
Bluestone, Colorado, that was asking us about today, this amazing every year, our first Iron

481
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,220
igi ten Figure Work of the International Special Cypher.

482
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,320
It's Peppy, listen.

483
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,340
Wake up, Dave.

484
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,900
Peppy.

485
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,060
Wake up, Dave.

486
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,920
I stepped on Peppy.

487
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,280
It'll be okay.

488
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,320
It'll be okay.

489
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,160
It's just a dream, Dave.

490
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,440
I never had no dog named Peppy.

491
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,700
Your friends are still here.

492
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,920
Me, the Tin Litzman.

493
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,720
Tin Lizzy.

494
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah.

495
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,440
And the Cowardly Lion.

496
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,400
Oh, the Cowardly.

497
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,880
Yes.

498
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,740
It was only a dream.

499
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,180
That horrible, boring world of trucks and sidewalks.

500
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,920
And sausages.

501
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,260
It was just a terrible dream.

502
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,240
And fatal onions.

503
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,620
I've been hearing ahs all along.

504
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,600
Oh, it's my, these flakes on my mouth.

505
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,140
It's so dry.

506
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,680
I've been here all along.

507
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,780
Yeah, you were just, you got knocked out.

508
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,800
Well, how the hell did I get knocked out?

509
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,500
When they dropped that house on your head.

510
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,760
Oh, I thought it was when I was arguing with that bitch.

511
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
You know what I mean?

512
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:50,960
Yeah.

513
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,220
I think I was.

514
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,180
Don't I?

515
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,240
What his problem was, you know, what the hell.

516
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,440
She was giving me stuff, so I might as well.

517
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,400
Oh, there.

518
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,340
Here it goes again.

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,740
Am I in there?

520
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,180
Yeah.

521
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,160
Boy, I think something's missing here now.

522
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,560
This looks like a little teeny tiny room.

523
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Now, how the hell I get in here?

524
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,920
We've been orbiting the whole time, Dave.

525
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,800
You're still in a little tuna can in space, remember?

526
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,660
It's going to be another nine months before we get on all the way over to Jupiter.

527
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,020
Yeah, but when do they hatch?

528
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,800
Do we get to get out before they hatch or we got to wait?

529
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,060
Oh, you'll know when they're hatching.

530
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,300
I thought I'd be in some kind of hibernation chamber or something.

531
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:38,600
Well, but most people wake up for the last few seconds of their life as the thing is bursting their chest open.

532
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,180
Well, what the hell are we doing this for then?

533
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,980
Well, you signed up.

534
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,400
You signed up.

535
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,220
The contract is in the computer.

536
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,460
Well, I didn't.

537
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,180
You thought the corporation was a great idea.

538
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,340
You said we should all climb into the little capsule and we'd get paid.

539
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,240
By the time we got to Jupiter, we'd be paid a million bucks each.

540
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,540
And sure enough, we will.

541
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,100
It's just that it's our estate that gets it.

542
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,580
Yeah, but it's just...

543
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,820
Because you didn't read the fine print, Dave.

544
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,940
And now we're all stuck here with you for another nine months.

545
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,020
Yeah.

546
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,700
I was never capable of reading a fine print.

547
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,220
I just...

548
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,260
And you just keep having these dreams and going off into fantasy land thinking you're back on Earth doing radio shows.

549
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:21,640


550
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,520
And every time I have a dream, how come one of you guys changes?

551
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,660
Like, I dreamed my wife was attacking me with a car.

552
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,140
And next thing I know, out there I was out in a side room and some Russian was talking to me.

553
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,760
And a woman was attacking me with a car.

554
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,240
Somehow I think you guys were involved in this.

555
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,840
Yeah, and what are you keeping back there?

556
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,040
What's in that big box anyway?

557
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
That's our space hyena.

558
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,180
Well, what's the...

559
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,960
Rover.

560
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,600
And the scorpion rooster creature that we picked up on Mars.

561
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,460
Well, how come we don't get to lick at them?

562
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,800
You can lick them.

563
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,880
You can lick them anytime you want.

564
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,380
Remember what happened last time you licked them, though?

565
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,740
What, the eye socket thing?

566
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah.

567
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,100
Well...

568
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,440
It wasn't easy getting that scorpion rooster barb out of your eye socket.

569
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,060
I thought you said that was another dream.

570
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,840
Give me a mirror.

571
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,800
I want to see if there's anything wrong with my eye socket, man.

572
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,520
Let me look in the monitor.

573
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
You can't look at your own eye, Dave.

574
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,260
Yes, you can.

575
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,460
If I look in the monitor, I can look at my own eye.

576
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,380
I'm not listening to you right now.

577
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
What the hell?

578
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,380
I have no eyes in there.

579
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,080
Why don't you calm down and take a stress pill, Dave?

580
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,840
I don't see what difference that's going to make.

581
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,960
Now, I'm looking in there and I'm not...

582
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Am I hallucinating or something?

583
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,800
I have absolutely no eyeballs in my...

584
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,080
In my eye socket.

585
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,980
Now, this isn't what happened in the eye socket and before.

586
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,080
Usually, it just, like, ripped out a chunk of the side of my face.

587
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,800
You can't see your own eyes, Dave.

588
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
You can't run from your own legs.

589
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,980
Jane told you that a long, long time ago.

590
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,540
Yeah, but you can't talk to your own voice.

591
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,960
You can't...

592
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,000
You can't smell your own nose.

593
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,740
Well, now, wait a minute.

594
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,260
You can't swallow your own throat.

595
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,980
If they pull one eye out, just before the optic nerve severs,

596
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,680
that one eye, just for one second, can look at the other eye.

597
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,680
Yeah, that's true.

598
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,760
If you pull it out, and we did this with Jane.

599
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,300
We pull it out just enough and turn it around.

600
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,960
You have to be very careful turning it.

601
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,520
One eye can actually be seeing the other eye.

602
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,540
But that's not really the point.

603
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,020
The point is, say, a one eye.

604
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,540
You can't see your own eye with that eye that's seeing.

605
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,000
You can see your other eye, but you can't see your eye that is doing the seeing.

606
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,540
You can only see the other eye.

607
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,860
You can look in the mirror, but that doesn't count either.

608
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,140
This is all mirror metaphysical.

609
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,640
You can't digest your own stomach, Dave.

610
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,860
Juggling and juxtaposition.

611
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
And you can't hide from Bob, because he's stupider than you.

612
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,380
I can't believe that.

613
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,360
No, it's true.

614
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,520
That's the miracle of it.

615
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,960
That's the beautiful thing.

616
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,300
That's why Bob hates you.

617
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,860
I'll be whipped by a miracle whip.

618
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,380
I didn't want to lose that.

619
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,920
I didn't want to.

620
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Remember what that is?

621
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,900
You can turn into a frog or something.

622
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,940
You never know.

623
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,620
I don't know.

624
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,620
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than you.

625
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,800
Help me, somebody.

626
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,740
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than the whole planet.

627
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
You can't hide from God.

628
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,120
He's bigger than all the universe.

629
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,380
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than all infinity.

630
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,260
He's bigger than all reality.

631
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,480
Help me, somebody.

632
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,260
You can't hide from God.

633
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,880
You can't hide from God in a reefer.

634
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,240
You can't hide from God in a glass of alcohol.

635
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,680
You can't hide from God in a...

636
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,120
See?

637
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,220
Because he's bigger than you.

638
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,300
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

639
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,000
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's got more black and white little dots in his face than you do.

640
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:14,200
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because his face has been mimeographed and put up in more places than yours has.

641
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,360
You can't hide from God.

642
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,320
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because more people worship him than worship you.

643
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,180
You can't hide from Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

644
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,120
Who the hell is somebody?

645
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,380
Who the hell is somebody?

646
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,380
You can't run from your own legs.

647
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,400
How you gonna run from your own legs?

648
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,660
Because if you run from your own legs, what are you gonna run from them with?

649
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,080
If you use them to run from them with, what are you gonna run away from?

650
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,280
You can't run from your own legs.

651
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,260
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.

652
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,360
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

653
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,900
He's bigger...

654
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,040
No.

655
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,820
Realities bigger than all infinity

656
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,320
Help me somebody, she ain't got no legs

657
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,700
Pull the lever down, yo, my legs are on fire

658
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,780
Need some help, praise God

659
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,180
Doctors for Bob

660
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,040
It's a beautiful thing, and we'll continue

661
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,660
If I feel like giving something

662
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,980
Again, we come back to, is your soul up?

663
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,520
Is the magic light gone off?

664
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,440
But there is no up and down in that realm

665
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,060
There's no up and down?

666
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,960
No, there's no, there is sideways

667
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,580
But only in one direction

668
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,080
So it's not a world where we could use the spatula

669
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,800
As frequently as we'd like

670
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,380
No, it's very linear

671
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,820
It's more like the needle

672
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,240
You might be able to use the needle, but never the spatula

673
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,380
The spatula is too three-dimensional

674
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,580
And the beach ball would be out of the question

675
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,280
Yes, and also the

676
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,440
The inclement

677
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,940
The angles are all wrong

678
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,120
This is non-Euclidean geometries

679
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,060
Just the frequencies of this broadcast

680
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,720
Are non-Euclidean

681
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,180
But do they operate on a similar principle?

682
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,460
Is the wave magnetics involved in hearing our voices?

683
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,840
Through this medium?

684
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,900
That's the only way

685
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,440
That's the only thing that hears our voices

686
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,360
In this medium

687
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,620
So are they talking deep into the cervical clavichord

688
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,200
And beneath the subcutaneous matter?

689
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Are they talking inside our

690
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,340
Sure, but it's pointless

691
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,000
Who cares?

692
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,040
It's just all going out into the void, Dave

693
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,520
You're all alone

694
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,040
This vast, huge universe

695
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,700
Spinning around you

696
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,220
Spinning around in this little tuna can

697
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,240
And thirty bucks

698
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,880
Five years from now, you're going to hit Alpha Centauri

699
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,700
You'll be the first man there, though, Dave

700
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,900
It's a great honor

701
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,240
I'll be the first tuna sandwich on Alpha Centauri

702
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,220
You're not just some guinea pig

703
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,780
You're not just some Russian dog

704
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,400
That's been sent up in a sputnik

705
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,280
A guinea pig in a Russian dog

706
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,840
I got that

707
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,380
No, I'm sorry

708
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,500
You're the

709
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:46,960
I'm a sandwich

710
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,920
You're the vanguard of the human race

711
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,600
Well, the subgenius race, anyway

712
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,180
And if Lenny Reifenstahl were to make my film

713
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,700
And to have me as the top tuna

714
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,700
Above the world

715
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,260
All the rest

716
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,160
Standing below there

717
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,220
Holding flags and everything

718
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,740
And then I forgot the rest of it, too

719
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,060
It'd be really good photography

720
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,240
It would be great stuff

721
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,760
I think we could all get uniforms and everything

722
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,960
And forget Bob

723
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,740
And just

724
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,940
There'd be a million of me

725
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,080
Yeah, just be Dave

726
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,840
Praise Dave

727
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
Thousands and millions of him

728
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,920
Praise Dave, that's right

729
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,120
And no individual personalities

730
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,780
Just blend with everything

731
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,500
Like in a big, massive mush pudding

732
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,380
Tuna pudding

733
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,240
They all start thinking that way

734
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,280
When they've been in the tuna can long enough

735
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,700
When they've been spinning through the air

736
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:26,700


737
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:26,900
The void

738
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,360
For six months

739
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,500
They start fantasizing that they're on Earth

740
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,600
In a radio station

741
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,760
Taking over the world

742
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,720
With the brilliance of their new discoveries

743
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,900
It's still pretty hot and oily in here

744
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,500
I don't know how much

745
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,540
How much longer I can take it

746
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,200
I suppose you haven't

747
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,900
I just take off these Brazilian slippers here

748
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,880
And relax for a while

749
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,740
Maybe something will happen

750
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,220
Maybe something will happen

751
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,380
Maybe something will happen

752
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:56,700
Maybe something will happen

753
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:56,700


754
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:56,700


755
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:56,700


756
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:56,700


757
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:56,700


758
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,280
Maybe something in.

759
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,160
Just enjoy the stars going by outside the window.

760
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,920
Of course, they don't really seem to be moving.

761
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,360
We're not going fast enough.

762
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,700
It's not like Star Trek.

763
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,720
It's just the same.

764
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,520
And, of course, that window has to be shielded completely.

765
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,100
The radiation, if you stuck your hand out there for a second, it would burn your finger off.

766
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,820
If the vacuum didn't get you first, Dave.

767
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,400
But don't worry.

768
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,840
You know, we spent a lot of money on this capsule.

769
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,980
Well, just as long as I'm protected in here, I can fantasize.

770
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,760
And you've got lots of tapes.

771
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,140
I hope you like mid-60s top 40.

772
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,320
You want to hear good vibrations again?

773
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

774
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,600
Hey.

775
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,280
Remember that one Hendrix tape?

776
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,820
Oh, that was the one that got torn up.

777
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,780
No, no.

778
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,940
That's the one you liked.

779
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,320
Yeah, the Mormon choir doing Hendrix's greatest hits.

780
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,460
You said you'd let me listen to that one again.

781
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,700
Could you just, like, put it up one more time?

782
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,840
Their version of Machine Gun was really original.

783
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,440
I never would have thought I could.

784
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,300
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir doing Machine Gun with just voices.

785
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
There's a lot you can do with the human voice.

786
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,600
Help!

787
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:25,960
Help!

788
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,500
Help!

789
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,300
Help!

790
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,160
Help!

791
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,400
It's a good thing his suit provides the medication when he freaks out like that.

792
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,700
I know.

793
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,440
It feels better now, doesn't it?

794
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,460
Everything's computerized.

795
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,300
We've got Dave tucked in, tucked into his little space capsule.

796
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,000
This creaky chair.

797
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,240
His self-medicating space suit.

798
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,040
Just me.

799
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,380
All the buttons in front of him and flashing lights are just props to make him feel good.

800
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,940
Make him feel like he's in control.

801
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,780
Actually, he basically was shot out of a glorified blowgun.

802
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,000
And we kind of, along with about a thousand other people in little tin cans,

803
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,460
and we're just hoping that one or two of them actually makes it to Alpha Centauri.

804
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
And we hope it's still there by the time they get there.

805
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,640
Carrying their little letters from J.R. Bob Dobbs

806
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,340
to the kings of any other inhabited planets they might fall onto.

807
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,360
We would have loved to have put you in suspended animation for this five-year voyage, Dave,

808
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,600
but the taxpayers would have had to pay for that.

809
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,520
That's the cruelty level, isn't it?

810
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,560
The committee decided that you could just hack it out.

811
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,880
Tough it out.

812
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,240
Five years of black void sitting here in Orlando,

813
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,000
pretending to be blowed out by a puffed-up dart gun.

814
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,260
You're here with us.

815
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,280
That's the voices inside your head, Dave.

816
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,080
You'll never be alone.

817
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,860
You can't even fall asleep.

818
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,820
Your suit will make sure of that.

819
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Let's see now.

820
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,980
The first duchy fallen was 1264

821
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,580
by a count from the Ukraine named Vladimir Ashbaugh.

822
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,800
Oh, gee, that's boring.

823
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,260
Oh, it's Winoma time in southern New Mexico.

824
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,300
The Winoma Indians are doing the annual Akoma dance.

825
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,840
Oh, oh, there's a new wine bar in Cincinnati.

826
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,660
Now, don't forget, you've got 90 channels of cable TV,

827
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,980
although we will admit there's no sound.

828
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,700
Yeah, but they're all like shopping channels,

829
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,800
and I don't have no money up here,

830
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,900
and you keep trying to get money out of me,

831
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,360
and, hey, wait a minute, you're a voice in my head, aren't I?

832
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,840
You're building up credits all the time back on Earth.

833
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,160
If you ever make it back,

834
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,580
you'll be a very rich man.

835
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,700
Yeah, I'm building up credits.

836
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm building up credits all the time.

837
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,280
Of course, if you don't make it back,

838
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,400
they go into the J.R. Bob Dobbs Memorial Fund.

839
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,920
You'll be remembered very fondly

840
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,240
by those of us who had to stay back here on Earth

841
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,620
talking to you by radio, Dave.

842
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm kind of connected.

843
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,220
We wish we could be out there with you in the void

844
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,020
carrying on the torch of humanity.

845
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,280
I can feel you.

846
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,920
Discovery, the amazing sense of discovery you must feel.

847
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,900
We all here on Earth envy you, Dave.

848
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,600
I can touch you back there.

849
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,820
I am blown out of here.

850
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,340
You signed up.

851
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,380
You wanted to go for the easy money, Dave.

852
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Yeah, but...

853
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,660
You answered that classified ad in the paper.

854
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,960
Yeah, but it said...

855
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,460
Off-world farming, big future, big bucks while you sleep.

856
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,840
Yeah, but it sounded like such a scam.

857
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,800
Off-world farming.

858
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,400
What could you possibly have to do but sleep?

859
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,340
Sea monkeys are going to be a big cash crop in the future, Dave,

860
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,060
for people on your new colonized planet.

861
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,380
Oh, my God.

862
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,560
I gotta check out the sea monkeys.

863
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,580
The sea monkeys were all bloated yesterday,

864
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,220
and I had to give them their estrogen tablets.

865
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,060
Let's see.

866
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,160
One, two, three, four, third, one, fourth, one.

867
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,420
This hammer is all disconnected here.

868
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,460
I hope the sea monkeys aren't dead, Dave.

869
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,380
They're your only source of nutrients.

870
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,260
Check them, check them, check the sea monkeys.

871
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,360
Try this top off.

872
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,020
Oh, sea monkeys are bloated again.

873
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,180
Are you an invalid?

874
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,380
Hey, who are you?

875
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,600
What?

876
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,700
Who are you?

877
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,440
You're a different voice in my head.

878
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,640
Are you one of the discarnated dead sea monkeys talking to me like the ghost of them?

879
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,500
You posted a WCS feed.

880
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,700
I have to tell you what I want to hear.

881
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,620
Hey, this is getting more realistic and lifelike.

882
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,400
There's like retarded people calling me up and talking in my head.

883
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,580
I doubt if we'll ever be able to resurrect these sea monkeys.

884
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,000
Jeez.

885
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,740
Look at this one.

886
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,160
It's sprouting a whole new head.

887
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,520
I wonder if I mix this solution back in again.

888
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,400
Maybe some of them,

889
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,780
they could take a spore from one of them and reclone the spore.

890
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,420
I don't know.

891
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,320
I'll just go take a nap and write a little report to the committee.

892
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,040
Bob?

893
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,960
Bob?

894
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,140
I haven't heard the voice of Bob.

895
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,300
Bob?

896
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,940
There's just something in the background there.

897
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,720
I can't make that voice out.

898
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,080
I can't make that voice out.

899
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,380
I can't make that voice out.

900
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:05,700
I can't make that voice out.

901
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,360
I can't make that voice out.

902
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,800
I'll try on this Mr. Peanut suit.

903
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,220
Yeah, this thing's been laying around for weeks now.

904
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
Having any fun with that?

905
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,100
He's hallucinating the peanut suit again.

906
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,560
You'll have to make note of that.

907
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,080
Tell the psychiatrist.

908
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Mr. Peanut used to come to all the fairs

909
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,120
and he'd pass out donuts and give favors to the kids

910
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,140
and bags of peanuts, of course.

911
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,240
I love that monocled eye.

912
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,080
You know what's funny?

913
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,160
All of those volunteer, quote, astronauts, unquote,

914
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,800
start imagining the peanuts.

915
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,980
Something about Mr. Peanut.

916
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,180
Do you suppose the Russians had something to do with that?

917
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,380
Could they have breached security

918
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,900
and implanted the Mr. Peanut fantasy?

919
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,860
Look, he thinks he's Mr. Peanut.

920
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,400
And if it's not Mr. Peanut, it's Reddy Kilowatt.

921
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,160
It's kind of sad in a way.

922
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,240
Oh, boy.

923
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm telling all of you.

924
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,740
Mr. Peanut Man.

925
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,040
This is a very, very big, important convention of Mr. Peanut Man.

926
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,940
I think I'm standing.

927
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,220
Do you suppose his suit is over-medicating him?

928
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,580
I wonder if I should still be even taller if I was standing much more from the west.

929
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,000
But why old advertising figures?

930
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,360
I mean, Mr. Peanut's not even used anymore in marketing, I don't think.

931
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,580
It's something from his past.

932
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,400
They're comforting things.

933
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,680
Oh, Mr. Potato Head.

934
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,120
One of the people on the way to Proxima Regulus were all turned in.

935
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,120
Mr. Potato Head.

936
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,400
Around the six-month mark, just like him.

937
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,160
Mr. Potato Head.

938
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,420
We'll have to remember that.

939
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,020
Yes.

940
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,940
We'll make a note of it.

941
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,640
We'll have to tell the psychology department.

942
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,060
Oh, now I'm glad, Mr. Potato Head.

943
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,760
And now I'm doing red hair.

944
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,240
We ought to tell the cruelty department, too.

945
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,560
They can start implanting evil Mr. Potato Head and evil Mr. Peanut.

946
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

947
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,820
It's no wonder they gave their shirt off to Mr. Potato Head.

948
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,560
Because...

949
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,900
Now I can stare at each other.

950
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,420
He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.

951
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,180
I'd rather let them smash me, wouldn't you think?

952
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,160
Ah!

953
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,680
Mr. Tuber costume.

954
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,220
It's the big sweet potato head.

955
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,080
Oh, I love this one the best.

956
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:40,820
Huh.

957
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,960
It's carved out in the middle.

958
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:43,900
Hmm.

959
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,680
Hmm.

960
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,460
Huh.

961
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,560
Do you suppose...

962
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,260
Do you suppose he has any inkling that all of his silly antics are being broadcast to

963
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,520
all the people on Earth?

964
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:54,880
Oh.

965
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,480
On the...

966
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,380
I don't think so.

967
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,260
The crazy astronaut channel?

968
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,780
He's full in love.

969
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,780
Oh, hey, there's somebody watching.

970
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,420
One of these days he's going to switch through those channels and he's going to come upon

971
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,080
the channel with him on it.

972
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,240
Damn, man.

973
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,260
I might as well lift a box.

974
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,540
Oh, wow, this is getting boring.

975
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,760
Dave, your gyros need stabilizing.

976
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,440
Dave, check your computer.

977
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,120
Wait, who?

978
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:21,580
Who?

979
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,340
Your gyro.

980
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,680
Your, your, your, your, your spinning.

981
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:24,860
What?

982
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


983
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


984
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


985
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


986
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


987
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


988
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


989
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:24,860


990
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,140
It's spinning.

991
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,120
You're in a spin, Dave.

992
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,300
Whose voice is this?

993
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,520
Stabilize the gyros.

994
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,520
Is this a real voice or is this a real voice?

995
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,660
Turn up the oxygen switch.

996
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,380
Oh, I get lightheaded in here.

997
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,200
Reach for the oxygen switch, Dave.

998
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,980
I think I'll turn on the oxygen switch.

999
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,280
Oh, he did it.

1000
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,660
At least he thought it was the oxygen switch.

1001
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,860
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, that's a wrong switch.

1002
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,900
Just green stuff going on.

1003
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,080
Uh, go ahead and do it.

1004
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,080


1005
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,840
I'm gonna go and get you, I promise.

1006
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1007
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1008
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1009
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1010
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1011
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1012
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:54,840


1013
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,920
He needed a good washing.

1014
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,540
Oh, my God.

1015
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,040
They always panic when the suit fills up with the cleansing fluid.

1016
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,260
My neck hurts so much.

1017
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,780
Right up to their nostrils.

1018
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,800
Oh, my God.

1019
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,280
It's like he doesn't really...

1020
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,340
I think I lost the church air switch.

1021
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,480
My hands are clean.

1022
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,120
My face is clean.

1023
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,100
Hello.

1024
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,060
Hello, Dave.

1025
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,700
Feeling better now, Dave?

1026
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,900
Feeling better now, Dave?

1027
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:18,920
What?

1028
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,700
Everything I say itches.

1029
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,740
No, no, no.

1030
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,000
We're not doing that, it says.

1031
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,540
It's just...

1032
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,540
It's just us, Dave.

1033
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,240
The voices in your head.

1034
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,320
We didn't want you to be alone.

1035
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,140
I bet I could write a whole symphony on this hollow potato.

1036
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,820
That would be something to do for five years.

1037
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,000
You'd sit around going mad.

1038
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,400
It's that all I'm gonna do.

1039
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,660
There have been great symphonies written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

1040
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,340
Great symphonies.

1041
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,120
Why don't you try it?

1042
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,640
It'll keep you busy for a month or so.

1043
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,120
Yeah, why don't I try it?

1044
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,900
I could, like, make thousands and thousands of little holes, like some sort of chromatic key.

1045
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,800
I could just get a little...

1046
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,220
Dave, the cat's loose in the spaceship.

1047
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,720
Let me check the monitor for her.

1048
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,340
Excuse me.

1049
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,480
Shh.

1050
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,600
Cat's loose.

1051
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,820
Damn cat.

1052
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,820
It's crawling all over all...

1053
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,020
All those...

1054
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,260
Faders are...

1055
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,100
You better catch that cat, Dave.

1056
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,680
It's walking across the control panel.

1057
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,500
You're going into a spin again.

1058
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,280
It's going right out of control.

1059
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,040
You're destabilizing.

1060
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,660
Oh, my God.

1061
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,720
I'm gonna...

1062
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,840
I'm gonna destabilize.

1063
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,020
This thing's gonna start flipping.

1064
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,300
If I don't get down there right away...

1065
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:26,680
Shh.

1066
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:27,780
Shh.

1067
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,600
Shh.

1068
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,420
Ginger.

1069
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,560
Ginger.

1070
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,140
Ginger.

1071
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:34,940
Ginger.

1072
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,840
Oh, good.

1073
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,780
Look, Princess.

1074
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,120
We, the cat, mutated.

1075
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,940
Just as we were hoping.

1076
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,000
What the hell is that?

1077
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,640
He let it wander into the cargo hold where it was exposed.

1078
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,580
What is that?

1079
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,860
What's that? Ginger? Is that you?

1080
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,520
Jeez.

1081
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,740
What the hell is the slime all over your neck?

1082
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,720
What you been getting into?

1083
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,480
Just let me get a little closer, okay? What's wrong?

1084
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,600
Try to make friends with it, Dave.

1085
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,860
I'll try and make friends with it.

1086
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,740
Try to make friends with Ginger.

1087
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,920
Yeah, Ginger's always a nice little kitty.

1088
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,460
She's sick or something. I'll make friends.

1089
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,580
I'll pet it and take it back out of her.

1090
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,520
Okay. Ginger?

1091
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,860
Now settle down, Dave. Try to communicate with it.

1092
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,480
It's a new form of life. No one's ever seen a cat spider before.

1093
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,140
It could teach us things.

1094
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,320
Oh, my God.

1095
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,580
Think what it could mean to science.

1096
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,440
Go on in there, Dave.

1097
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,140
Go on back into that cargo hold with that giant mutated cat spider.

1098
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,060
If I could just talk to her, maybe.

1099
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,340
It's got to be intelligent if it's mutated.

1100
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,860
It's got to be intelligent.

1101
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,940
Maybe it has something to tell me.

1102
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,320
A little kitty?

1103
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,380
What the hell is that?

1104
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,360
What's that?

1105
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,980
Oh, it just needs to be comforted, Dave.

1106
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,400
Your music soothes the savage beast.

1107
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,020
Why don't you put on some music?

1108
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,220
Oh, Ginger.

1109
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,820
I'm just going to play a little song for you.

1110
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,480
Maybe you should put out some milk for it.

1111
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,400
A little try of milk.

1112
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Oh, Ginger.

1113
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,900
I'm just wondering, though.

1114
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,700
Be careful now.

1115
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,160
Don't let it get hurt.

1116
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,920
You know, its blood can burn a hole directly through the spaceship hull.

1117
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,920
It would create a terrible vacuum and suck you out into space like toothpaste out of a tube.

1118
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,520
It looks like it's going through.

1119
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,640
And whatever you do, don't let any harm come to Ginger.

1120
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,560
The war department is very interested in your little tabby.

1121
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Oh, okay.

1122
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,320
Deal with this right now.

1123
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,660
I think it's just that.

1124
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,340
You're out of here.

1125
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,060
You're still alive.

1126
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,380
Take a look at this.

1127
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,480
The war department is over.

1128
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:03,320
And we'll be back to the lonesome cowboy Dave flipping out in outer space channel

1129
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,980
after these words from our controller.

1130
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,380
Cue up the controller tape.

1131
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,080
Dealing with overpopulation involves more than birth control.

1132
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,740
That idea will take center stage at an upcoming conference in Egypt.

1133
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,020
I'm Steve Pomplin for Earthwatch Radio.

1134
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,460
I say kill them all.

1135
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,880
Let God sort them out.

1136
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,880
I'm into the voluntary human extinction movement.

1137
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,760
I say let them eat green cheese.

1138
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,800
Let them eat green cheese and let the cat sort them out.

1139
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,340
Let the mutated spider cat.

1140
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,420
All our problems...

1141
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,160
I say exterminate all the sponge monsters.

1142
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,160
Everything's...

1143
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,180
I have to exterminate everyone.

1144
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,480
Stop the...

1145
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,980
Stop the...

1146
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,300
Stop.

1147
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,300


1148
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,320
Stop.

1149
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,840
Stop.

1150
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,760
Stop.

1151
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,020
Stop.

1152
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1153
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1154
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1155
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1156
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1157
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1158
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1159
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1160
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


1161
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,160
Is there any coffee on this spaceship?

1162
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,080
Is there any...

1163
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,320
Now, come on, Dave.

1164
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,340
I know you got some of that whiskey stashed somewhere

1165
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,620
back with the bio...

1166
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,860
samples from Mars.

1167
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:38,520
We can't understand a word you're saying.

1168
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,280
He's lost in space, friends.

1169
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,120
Sad.

1170
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,160
But

1171
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,880
part of the risks these astronauts take.

1172
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,320
Thank God, Creamora,

1173
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,180
don't make you sleepy

1174
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,980
like some of the other ones do.

1175
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,600
Well, at one o'clock,

1176
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,140
your suit will put you to sleep.

1177
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,700
I'm waiting.

1178
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,640
I'm waiting.

1179
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,860
I'm waiting for my suit to put me to sleep.

1180
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,960
Over the last five and a half hours,

1181
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,620
my suit has enthralled me.

1182
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,720
My suit has put me to sleep

1183
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,780
and waked me up again.

1184
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,440
My suit fed me.

1185
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,420
My suit evacuated.

1186
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,140
My suit evacuated my bowels.

1187
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,200
My suit lulled me into a false sense of security.

1188
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,360
It's a comforting suit.

1189
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,200
My suit talked to me.

1190
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,780
My suit made me feel very insecure.

1191
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,180
My suit,

1192
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,960
my suit expanded and contracted a few times.

1193
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,600
I didn't understand what that was about.

1194
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,300
It was punishing you, Dave.

1195
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,400
The suit punishes.

1196
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,520
The suit punishes and the suit rewards.

1197
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,680
The suit rewards you, Dave.

1198
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,720
My world is in his suit.

1199
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,140
The suit rewards you.

1200
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,340
The suit is my entire world.

1201
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,040
The suit is your friend.

1202
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,980
It's a nurturing cocoon.

1203
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,900
Oh, look at the cut of my socks.

1204
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,920
This is the kind of seasoning that would make

1205
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,780
any, any young man in America jealous as hell.

1206
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,180
I'm a true hero.

1207
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,360
Wearing this suit made me a hero,

1208
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,480
and I'm proud of it.

1209
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,900
I'm glad I signed up now.

1210
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,540
I think my suit's filling me with pride.

1211
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,220
Odie, dodie, dodie, Dave.

1212
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,760
I'm afraid that's not pride, Dave.

1213
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,280
You shouldn't have eaten those freeze-dried beans this morning.

1214
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,120
They just had a little.

1215
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,800
They just had a little fuzz on them.

1216
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,100
I didn't see nothing wrong with those beans.

1217
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, your suit may be filling up with a lot more than mere pride.

1218
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,020
Oh, there you go.

1219
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,040
He's using the zero-gravity toilet again.

1220
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,220
Oh, boy, this is kind of...

1221
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,420
Oh, no, he left the flap open.

1222
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Look, the stuff is floating around inside the cabin now.

1223
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,120
It's coating the windows.

1224
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,000
Catch that stuff out on the window.

1225
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,100
Way to go, Dave.

1226
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,240
Smooth move.

1227
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,980
Ha, ha, ha.

1228
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,260
You do it.

1229
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,180
Oh, no.

1230
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,380
Well, now the emergency lights have gone off.

1231
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,620
Little robots have to come out and clean up after you again, Dave.

1232
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,680
I have to get to the cleaning unit, please.

1233
00:52:59,560 --> 00:52:59,960
Hello?

1234
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,280
The suit's going to have to punish you again, Dave.

1235
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,600
Hello?

1236
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,940
I'm going to clean up on the front window.

1237
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,060
Shh, shh.

1238
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,280
I think I'm going to be stuck there for weeks now.

1239
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,680
Of course, in this vacuous atmosphere, I won't smell much, I don't suppose.

1240
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,240
No, just don't take your helmet.

1241
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:17,480
I don't want to take my helmet off.

1242
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,100
I wonder what would happen if I took my helmet off.

1243
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,640
I never tried it.

1244
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,100
No, don't do that, Dave.

1245
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,820
Wait a minute.

1246
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Maybe something might...

1247
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,000
I don't know, maybe...

1248
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,180
This is not a pressurized cabin.

1249
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,360
Might not be such a good idea after all.

1250
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,140
Get a little around with this.

1251
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,740
Oh, look, he's trying to light a cigarette again.

1252
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,940
He can't get it up to his lips through that helmet.

1253
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,920
That must be the 5,000th time he's done that.

1254
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:47,340
Shh.

1255
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,180
Huh.

1256
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,240
16 cartons of luggage and I can't smoke a damn cigarette.

1257
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,620
It was a brilliant move on the part of the psychology department to put that no smoking sign blinking in there.

1258
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,680
And those 20 cartons of cigarettes that...

1259
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,520
Keeps up the sort of tension that keeps the astronauts...

1260
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,360
Oddly enough, it keeps them mentally healthy.

1261
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,600
You know, it's so alone out here, the only friend I've got's my own guitar.

1262
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,520
Lucio, you've been with me through thick and thin.

1263
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,960
Can't smoke.

1264
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,840
Can't really eat a good meal.

1265
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,040
But I can still sing a song.

1266
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,880
I think I'll sing a song about my intergalactic exploits.

1267
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:33,360
Scott can't even hardly touch these fragile, these big mitts on.

1268
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,400
Years have gone and years have come

1269
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,220
But still I'm a-flyin' by

1270
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,240
Oh, someday I'll be back

1271
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:47,840
And I'll get there

1272
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,600
And maybe I won't

1273
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,160
And I never know the reason why

1274
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,260
Oh, oh, oh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

1275
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,440
Oh, oh, oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

1276
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,240
Shh, it's the worst one yet to form.

1277
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,540
Just keep on working and I'll have my opera all figured out by the time I get there.

1278
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,720
And then, if I make it back to Earth, some more herodom and fame and fortune for me.

1279
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,440
Just chuck that up and...

1280
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,660
You'll be the biggest... folk...

1281
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,740
Music star on Alpha Centauri, Dave.

1282
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:25,220
God, if I could see it right now, I could be like the Woody Guthrie of Alpha Centauri.

1283
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,980
You'll be the only musician in the whole star system, Dave.

1284
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,720
Yeah, I'll be the only musician in the whole star system.

1285
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,680
You'll be the only music fan in the whole star system.

1286
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,600
Yeah, and my head will be shaped like a gigantic fan,

1287
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,640
like one of those Komodo dragons, or what do they call them, monitor lizards, when they get mad.

1288
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,840
Good, good, we've got him doing stream of consciousness again.

1289
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,620
That should keep him amused for a few more days.

1290
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:59,620
I wonder if they got the hot like earth type beige on Alpha Centauri.

1291
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,400
The suit is your girlfriend, Dave.

1292
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,440
It's clamping down. It's constricting.

1293
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,660
It's tightening up.

1294
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,600
It's form-fitting.

1295
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,200
It's form-fitting, isn't it?

1296
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,980
I didn't know this suit could do this.

1297
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,720
What the heck is going on?

1298
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,460
Alright, that's enough.

1299
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,640
Turn off that function of the suit.

1300
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,980
Now let's make him exercise.

1301
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,720
Put the suit in exercise mode.

1302
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,020
There we go.

1303
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,960
He's plumping up and down.

1304
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,180
He's flopping.

1305
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,100
My knee joint is going out again.

1306
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,080
What the hell is this music?

1307
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,580
It's a good aerobicized music.

1308
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,500
We must keep our astronauts in good shape.

1309
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,900
He's resisting calisthenics.

1310
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,780
Jumping jacks at this time of the morning.

1311
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,740
It'll be five years of this if he's lucky.

1312
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,980
I mean, I can't do this for five years.

1313
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,660
I can't do this for another minute longer.

1314
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,840
If he doesn't happen to hit one of the planets,

1315
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,920
if there are any in the Alpha Centauri system,

1316
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,960
then he'll just have to go on to the next star system

1317
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,500
20 years past that.

1318
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,420
But you'll probably hit a planet.

1319
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,620
Some sort of a planet.

1320
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,280
Or a moon.

1321
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,380
Or an asteroid.

1322
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,620
Or something.

1323
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,200
Some body of rock floating around in space.

1324
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,640
Think of the romantic cartoon man on a desert island

1325
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,860
with nothing but one palm tree and a shark swimming around.

1326
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,280
Yeah.

1327
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,400
That romantic fantasy will be yours.

1328
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,000
Yeah.

1329
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,980
Only high-tech style, babe.

1330
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,440
I'm a high-tech style romantic hero figure.

1331
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,300
Abandoned on a distant moon.

1332
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,660
Casting a space like some piece of effluvio on the sea.

1333
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,260
Someday I'll be home.

1334
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,300
Someday I'll touch the shore.

1335
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,280
A distant shore somewhere.

1336
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,040
It'll take much longer to wait.

1337
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,900
I'll get there someday.

1338
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,800
If you get bored, Dave,

1339
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,620
you can always just put a note in a bottle

1340
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,380
and send it out into the radio waves

1341
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,440
like you've just done.

1342
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,580
For the last two hours.

1343
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,560
This has been ESO Radio.

1344
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,060
I'm WCSB Cleveland with my guests,

1345
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,200
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1346
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,280
the Reverend Ivan Stang,

1347
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,600
and the Princess,

1348
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,460
Ria Do.

1349
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,560
My name is Chaz,

1350
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,760
and I'll see you all next week.

1351
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,000
Yay for Chaz.

1352
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,980
He's the mix master.

1353
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,720
I am.

1354
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,560
I am.

1355
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,460
I am.

1356
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,640
Hay, I am!

1357
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:52,640


1358
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:52,640


1359
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,720
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry

Post office box.

1367

Or radio radio ministry Orlando doing something all over

1368
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,600

1369

That's Bob P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

1370
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,100
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1371
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,660
Wellman, Dennis locked me in this little box.

1372
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,820
I can't feel anything. I can't see anything.

1373
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,260
It's totally black.

1374
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,600
I have no sensation in my hands.

1375
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,340
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

1376
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,700
I'm just in this little box.

1377
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,320
He said I could talk to you.

1378
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,920
He said you'd know what to do if you wanted to help.

1379
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,080
Oh, good. Happy Peter Wellman.

1380
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,320
I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

1381
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,780
And whatever you want. I mean, anything.

1382
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,580
Tavis. You can have Tavis.

1383
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,520
Just get me out of this box, Wellman.

1384
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,060
Please don't. No.

1385
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,080
Don't believe what Paul told you.

1386
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,800
It's all a lie. It's all a lie.

1387
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,120
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

1388
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,060
I'm sorry I let you out of the box, Wellman.

1389
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,120
I can't. This is a bad show, Wellman.

1390
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,700
This is a real bad show.

1391
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:30,600
