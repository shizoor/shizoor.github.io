1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
From PR News in Washington, I'm the Liberian who was diagnosed with Texas off the coast of Mexico.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,940
There's now approximately 50 individuals. Now most of those individuals are individuals that are individuals on a daily basis.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,220
On Wall Street 212, the National Hurricane Center says that this is PR News.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,240
Lawyers get special treatment.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,280
The Obama is chairing a better than expected PR News, Washington.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,180
Hey, everybody.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:30,900
Huh?

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,040
Moment of truth is here.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,500
Really?

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,020
Yes.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,700
No.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,060
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm going to be sick.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,800
Well, how about that?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,360
Oh, God.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,700
I've let us all down.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,320
Wow.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,880
All right.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,780
And so we begin yet another hour of slack from.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
Wisteria Campground.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,800
This time it's an Ask Doctor How special.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,280
Yes, everyone out here is special, but this is a special special.

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,100
Is there something you want to share with everyone?

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,040
Amazing Larry.

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,920
That's a good one.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,200
Yeah.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,200
Yes, you can thumb your way to a different campground if you want to.

28
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,260
But we think we're satisfied to be right here.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,760
Yes.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,020
We're ready to engage in some unusual pastimes to distinguish this event from others and

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:43,380
perhaps to plant some small shoots in memories garden, which may eventually grow into a monstrous

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,500
overgrowth of regret and shame in my case.

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,980
So I hope we do have the slips filled out and that my golfing and prayer partner, the

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,260
man.

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,840
Reverend Ivan Stang is now assiduously going through them and separating the gratuities

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,200
payments or premiums from the many leaves which contain the questions themselves.

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,660
I grabbed the one that had the most money I could see.

38
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,380
All right.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,200
Well, we should have that.

40
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,480
Four dollars, by the way.

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,940
Well, whatever it is, the good old American dollar.

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,560
Good everywhere.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Thank you for that four dollars.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,400
And since that question is the best funded, we should probably honor it by answering it

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,040
first, though.

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,780
It's not up to me.

47
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,600
You should ask me that question.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,660
You're the person doing this to you.

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,820
Do you begin writing your business

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,400
or do you resume your business?

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Can I start indicating that maybe by succeeding –

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,600
Let's call this one by design as it starts –

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:51,880
with your fingers, I pity you, because you, of all things, always take me here and nicely

54
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,440
gracefully present out.

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:04,460
clan could clan coup. Well, the clan part of this disreputable society's name has to do with

56
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,360
gathering and being together, similar to the subgenius word clench, although by no means

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,120
these fraternities overlap, at least I would hope not. But the coup of kouklux comes from a degraded

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,160
version of the Greek word kouklos, or circle, meaning a secret society, a secret organization.

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,160
You know, we might laugh at the kouklux clan as being a bunch of idiots out in a field,

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,380
corn huskers in their clodhoppers and so on, certainly nothing like the elegant

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,540
metrosexuals we perceive ourselves as being. But in recent times, and I mean historically,

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,960
recent times, the kouklux clan was an enormous organization.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,360
Stretching into many different states, they marched in Indianapolis, Indiana, 20,000 strong,

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,080
in their hoods down the street with beaming cops and everybody thinking everything was hunky-dory.

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:10,900
For in those days, there were many societies which upright, reasonable, rock-ribbed Republicans and

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:19,100
others were expected to join. The Moose Lodge, the Elks, the Masons, of course, with their world-spanning

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,980
conspiracy, and many others. And often, you could be asked to join something and it would be the grand

68
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,740
exalted order of the Silver Rutabaga or something, some name, and you wouldn't realize this was

69
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,580
actually one branch of the kouklux clan. My grandfather went through the induction since

70
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,000
as the district attorney for the city of Lebanon, Indiana. He wanted to get into these groups and,

71
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,080
you know, be all palsy and hail fellow well-met.

72
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,080
But at one point, he was asked to join the Kouklux clan. And he was asked to join the Kouklux clan.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,040
One particular moment, one awkward moment, in fact, just after the unrobing where they show you

74
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,820
who they are, they're no longer masked, he realized, why, this is the goddamn Kouklux clan.

75
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,800
And he got out and walked, got up and walked out. And not only that, he had seen everybody's face

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,560
and he knew who was who. That is, he walked out in a part of the ceremony where you're never

77
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,200
supposed to walk out. So we ask ourselves this,

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:27,140
this apparent non-X-day, how much kou could a kouklux clan, if a kou clan could clan-cue?

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:35,260
Well, only as much as it takes to come to the realization. And then, clan-cue very much.

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,540
Oh, yeah. Well, we got another Dr. Dark on board the spaceship here.

81
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,700
All right, I'm ready for the next question. Remember, you can still be writing questions

82
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,180
at down and send it to me. I'll be happy to answer them. I'll be happy to answer them. I'll be happy to answer them.

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm just sending them up here. If you have something you'd like me to answer,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,080
you know, just don't feel inhibited. It's a method, desultory as it is, of entertainment.

85
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,340
And it really helps if you throw in a buck or 20.

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,120
Yes.

87
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,260
This one, this is, it's a mystery one. It's all...

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,920
A mystery wrapped in enigma.

89
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,480
It's a $1 question. It's two for one.

90
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,600
Surrounded with creamy milk chocolate.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,980
That's all right. Under these occasions, I'll answer two for one.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,660
Well, this one's scratched out.

93
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,980
Scratched out.

94
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,560
Scratched out is, how do they get the lead into those pencils?

95
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,380
But then he scratched that out and decided it was more important to know,

96
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,080
does Godzilla poop in the woods?

97
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,540
Does Godzilla poop in the woods? Maybe you like the pencil question.

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,020
The last first. Then I'll talk about the pencil.

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes, there's much to be said for the humble pencil, perhaps threatened with extinction.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,420
But let's talk about another archaic beast.

101
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Godzilla, supposedly, according to the first movie,

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,160
a transitional form between the armored Ornithischian dinosaurs

103
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,460
and the large bipedal saurischians, like the famous Tyrannosaurus.

104
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,700
But Godzilla is outlandish, out of all proportion, no dinosaur,

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,720
apparently semi-aquatic.

106
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,800
He is, however, of that non-furred or feathered clade,

107
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,100
which is in its basic organization, including the digestive,

108
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,560
digestive system, reptilian.

109
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,920
And thus I rule that Godzilla poops wherever it wants.

110
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,000
In fact, has no volition in the matter.

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,240
Whatever is ingested goes in, is processed, and then is pooped out.

112
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,420
Or, in the very unusual case of Godzilla,

113
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,520
it may be, though we are unable to determine this today,

114
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,920
disposed of in an entirely novel and different fashion.

115
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,360
You know, when I was a young shaper growing up in the deserts of Arizona,

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,860
in the southwestern Sonora bioregion,

117
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,900
we had many interesting critters who would often come to visit

118
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,320
our humble Garth, whether or not invited.

119
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,700
Among these was Helodermas spectum, the beaded Gila monster.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,140
This is the world's only poisonous lizard,

121
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,600
no matter what anybody else may tell you.

122
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,160
Of course, you never want to be told about it.

123
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,160


124
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,920
be bitten by a lizard since their mouths are filthy and they can infect you anyway. Being

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,880
bitten by a large monitor is no joke and they don't just stop with a bite. At any rate, the

126
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,620
Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum, or its Mexican variety, Heloderma horridum, is poisonous and

127
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,820
although it injects you with its venom, it does so not like a rattlesnake which just strikes,

128
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,860
but by grabbing you and then slowly thoughtfully chewing on you. And with each chew, the venom

129
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:58,340
runs down the hollow grooves of the teeth and into the increasingly maturated wound. You can't even

130
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,480
pry these heads off with a crowbar once it determines to bite, but don't mess with them and

131
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,800
they won't bite. So, in fact, it was believed by rednecks and other dubious authorities that the

132
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,620
Gila monster was so venomous that it was so venomous that it was so venomous that it was so

133
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:20,840
venomous because it didn't have an asshole and its venom was the concentrated undigested solids

134
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,280
which were toxic and could be eliminated from the body in no other way. Of course, I have a book

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,720
with a picture of a Gila monster's asshole in it, so we know this is just a matter of

136
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,100
falderal. Yes, Poisonous Dwellers of the Desert by Vijay Stanek, I think. So, when you, Godzilla,

137
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,600
let's go.

138
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:51,040
loose with a huge blast of fire, the dorsal plates light up and charge and luminosity is seen running

139
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,280
from head to tail. Have you noticed this when Godzilla shoots out fire in all versions of

140
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,920
Godzilla? Watch those dermal ossicles and you will see that there is some kind of combustion

141
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:11,360
going on there which probably powers the fiery blast. Most earth dragons created their so-called

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
fire, much as the black dragon. So, when you, Godzilla, let's go.

143
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:42,280
So, on the other side, how do they get the lead into those pencils? How do they? You know, they don't. They get the pencils around the lead. Yes, the wood shavings themselves.

144
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes, the wood shavings themselves.

145
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,900
form around an interior lead spindle.

146
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,800
You know, the word pencil is cognate to the word penis.

147
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,640
Actually, a pencil linguistically means a little penis.

148
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,940
I don't know if anyone objects to this etymological side note,

149
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,540
but if so, speak now or forever hold your penis.

150
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,240
Now I've been deserted by Stang,

151
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,760
so I need another question, toot sweet,

152
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,580
or else this show will falter and founder

153
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,260
and have dinosaur egg on its face.

154
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Give me one.

155
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm going to read this one,

156
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,900
and then I'm going to go take a sweat lodge break.

157
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,780
Very well.

158
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,720
And sweat out some of my juice.

159
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,460
And how was this one accompanied in a pecuniary matter?

160
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,040
Not one thin dime.

161
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,180
Oh, dear, that is unfortunate.

162
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,220
In fact, I think our totals take...

163
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,700
This entire Ask Dr. Howell is $5.

164
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,960
Sometimes we ask if anyone wants to sponsor a particular answer.

165
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,160
If there's a slight donation,

166
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,880
the answer might conceivably be better

167
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,400
or adorned with the flowery adumbrations,

168
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,080
which are occasionally a feature of this presentation.

169
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,640
Well, you can hit them with the ugly truth for this,

170
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,120
although it might be pleasant.

171
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,380
This got sent by someone got hit with an ugly stick.

172
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,800
The question is,

173
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,880
can Bob create a froth mixture so strong that even he can't smoke it?

174
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,400
And, Reverend Angry Larry, I'll let you be the answer question man.

175
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,640
Would you do that, Reverend Angry Larry?

176
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,080
What you need to do is go through them, organize them,

177
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,420
and give me the ones that you think the moment demands.

178
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,540
This is the question I'll repeat again

179
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,400
while Stan goes off to commune with his ancestors.

180
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,360
The question,

181
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,780
can Bob create a froth mixture

182
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,280
so strong that even he can't smoke it?

183
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,800
This is a question which,

184
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,640
as a professional question answerer,

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,820
I get all the time.

186
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,020
You may not believe this,

187
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,240
but it is a version of the old village atheist's question,

188
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,220
can God create a trench so broad

189
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,080
that even he can't jump across it?

190
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,460
Well, of course, to God, the almighty spirit,

191
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,080
anything is possible.

192
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,480
It's a totally unfair setup, like Superman.

193
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
You know, if you can do everything,

194
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,080
where is the struggle?

195
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,760
They have to work hard.

196
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,540
They have to work hard to get the Sturm and the Drang into there.

197
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,900
Or actually, it derives from being,

198
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,700
the condition of a superior being

199
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,320
while everyone else is an inferior being.

200
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,940
So that's how they get the problem,

201
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,720
with Lois Lane, Alp, discovering the secret identity,

202
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
and all of that, if I recall.

203
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,340
But God, too, has similar problems,

204
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,720
and thus we say,

205
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,940
Jehovah One is a senile space god,

206
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,060
and was senile,

207
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,520
even at the time he hung the stars

208
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,780
and made the ancient oceans

209
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,060
begin to flex their primal ooze.

210
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,580
Set everything in motion,

211
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,780
if you like your Bible story.

212
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,500
Then the stars sang for joy

213
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,580
at the perfection of the new creation.

214
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,120
And what a sound that was,

215
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,340
which shall not be heard again

216
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,860
until the actual X-Day,

217
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,700
when and if it occurs.

218
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,040
So, God, yes, can create this mythical trench,

219
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,100
and in fact, God has created this trench.

220
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,060
It's not God, but humans who refuse to jump across.

221
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,500
But in this case, Bob can create a frop mixture so strong

222
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,700
that even he can't smoke it.

223
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,400
That is to say, he won't smoke it,

224
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,300
because he'll smoke the mixture which suits him.

225
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,120
And this mixture, being super strong,

226
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,380
exists only as a measure of quantification,

227
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,080
the ultimate end of the dial.

228
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,460
You don't want to go up there.

229
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,900
You want to choose something,

230
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,140
something in the middle,

231
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,280
for greater comfort, fullness,

232
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,220
and smoking pleasure,

233
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,680
like a rum-soaked shag

234
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,680
or a fine, rich, burly tobacco.

235
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,680
Thank you.

236
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,240
And now, Reverend Angry Larry

237
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,920
has dipped into the magic question bag,

238
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,420
and is going to ask me another question.

239
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,440
Remember, if you're not satisfied with these questions

240
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,780
or the quality of my answers,

241
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,880
write one yourself

242
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,640
on one of the many sheets of paper,

243
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,680
and accompanied by a slight premium,

244
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,060
have it sent up here to the desk,

245
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,060
when I shall endeavor to pay your patience well,

246
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,820
as well as one might be,

247
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,100
who has lived such an inordinately unfair

248
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,940
and tedious length of time.

249
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Well, Dr. Howell, we're up to six dollars now,

250
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,600
because this question...

251
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,780
All right!

252
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Now we're talking.

253
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,060
Now we're cooking with gas.

254
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,180
...is worth a dollar.

255
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
Six dollars? Huh?

256
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,040
No, no.

257
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,040
Oh, I see.

258
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,380
Our whole pile is up to six dollars.

259
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,620
An additional dollar.

260
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:38,860
We'll have to put a harp

261
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,500
on the niggardliness of this pile.

262
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,600
Okay.

263
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,640
What is your reaction to the fact that,

264
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,540
on Titan, due to the dense atmosphere

265
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,840
and low gravity,

266
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,100
humans could fly by flapping their arms?

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,200
Well, that's very well said.

268
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,860
Yes, humans could fly by flapping their arms

269
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,480
on that strange Saturnian moon, Titan.

270
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,340
And a second later,

271
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,420
they would be frozen into a corpuscle.

272
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,960
Because of the intense cold

273
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,620
and lack of atmospheric pressure.

274
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,260
There is, however, an atmosphere on Titan, yes.

275
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,600
On the other hand,

276
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,760
this atmosphere is tenuous on the surface.

277
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,060
But some of us like to think that below

278
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,960
the frozen surface of this curious moon,

279
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,380
there may exist a liquid ocean

280
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,160
teeming with unusual forms of exobiology.

281
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,200
Life, but hardly life as we would know it.

282
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,660
You see, life doesn't need much to get going.

283
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,920
Only our kind of life does.

284
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,740
Human life needs all kinds of

285
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,520
namby-pamby cosseting and primping.

286
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,420
It needs a planet that's nice and warm

287
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,540
with plenty of liquid water

288
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,300
and abundant food

289
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,320
and a nice thick atmosphere to breathe.

290
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,300
Do you think most exobiotic entities

291
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,580
get all this stuff?

292
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,380
They do not.

293
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,240
Furthermore,

294
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,580
we have another thing on our planet.

295
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,020
A huge moon.

296
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,240
Bigger than any other planet gets for a moon.

297
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,880
That is, it's a special privilege

298
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,660
that once again we have in this place.

299
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,280
A moon that is coincidentally,

300
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,120
when seen from Earth,

301
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,220
the exact same size as the sun.

302
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,040
So it can perform a complete solar eclipse.

303
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,220
This moon has vastly assisted

304
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,400
in making things the way they are today.

305
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,040
Because without the moon's tidal drag,

306
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,620
in its eternal orbit,

307
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,020
the seas would not have tides at all.

308
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,100
And the living ocean would not breathe.

309
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Indeed, might not even be living.

310
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,940
So all these improbable things

311
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,040
have come together

312
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,620
and we think that's what life is going to be like?

313
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,420
No.

314
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,080
Only in cases,

315
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,840
and only in some of those,

316
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,540
where all these exact same conditions prevail.

317
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,740
In the so-called Goldilocks zone of life,

318
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,060
where not too hot, not too cold,

319
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,080
that's why the Goldilocks thing,

320
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,940
you know, just right.

321
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,620
A rocky world,

322
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,160
a world with a sustainable atmosphere,

323
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,420
and a moon to make the seas

324
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,220
whisper, roll, and breathe.

325
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,800
So life can be generated in that ocean,

326
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,900
nature's bassinet.

327
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,600
Put on your outside space suit.

328
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,120
It need not be the big bulky kind

329
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,000
you see in the movies.

330
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,660
All you need to do is prevent

331
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,260
the atmospheric pressure inside you

332
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,480
from exploding you.

333
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,100
But if you wrap yourself up tight

334
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,660
with puttees of a special design,

335
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,760
patent-penning,

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,420
you don't need the bulky suit

337
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,960
where you surround yourself

338
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,180
with a little bit of atmosphere.

339
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,280
Then you can flap your wings,

340
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,440
or perhaps you can have special paddles

341
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,160
and lift yourself on Titan.

342
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,700
It is a large moon, yes,

343
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,560
but it is kind of small

344
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,100
as planetary bodies go,

345
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,280
and leaping off the surface

346
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,800
will not be difficult.

347
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,720
What would be a lot more fun

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,680
and easier to arrange is

349
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,160
fix up our own moon,

350
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,240
and, you know, roof some craters

351
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,620
and put an atmosphere in there.

352
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,280
Then not only could you flap your arms

353
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,900
and have flippers and fly through the air,

354
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,800
but you could dive into the water

355
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,580
in exquisite slow motion

356
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,260
and do all sorts of one-sixth gravity things.

357
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,260
But short-sighted people,

358
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,520
politicians instead,

359
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,840
would rather repeal the Affordable Care Act.

360
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,700
All right, how about another one?

361
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,860
Well, this one's,

362
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,260
we've got another dollar.

363
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,440
Another dollar.

364
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,000
And it's a good question.

365
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,540
I like this one.

366
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,580
And another locust came

367
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,360
and carried away a grain of wheat,

368
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:52,940
or in this case,

369
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,180
added a grain of wheat.

370
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay.

371
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,500
What do robots dream of?

372
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,020
What do robots dream of?

373
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,280
Most interesting.

374
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Like the Philip K. Dickie in question,

375
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,780
do androids dream of electric sheep?

376
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,100
You know, I guess they would

377
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,020
because all of their brain phenomena

378
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,440
is electric in origin.

379
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,460
But here's the kicker.

380
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,940
All our brain phenomena

381
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,480
is similarly electric in origin.

382
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,560
Small amounts of electricity,

383
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,200
and I mean small,

384
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,280
occur in the discharges

385
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,920
of synapses and neurons.

386
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,260
But one might think that a robot,

387
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,880
if dreaming was necessary

388
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,820
to its intellectual organization,

389
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,300
would dream of things

390
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,180
which would help it function

391
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
when its equivalent

392
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,240
of a conscious mind is functioning.

393
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,820
Let's be very certain about this,

394
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
because humans have two layers,

395
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,580
at least two,

396
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,800
of computer operation

397
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,320
operating at all times.

398
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,700
One is the conscious mind,

399
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:02,900
which is the brain,

400
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,460
that part which you are aware of

401
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,840
and you think of as yourself.

402
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,320
The other part underlies it,

403
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,200
and there are other

404
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,260
extensive function banks underlying that.

405
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,700
But the upper part of the limbic system

406
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,280
and the under part of the brain,

407
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,280
a part we call the anterior frontal gyrus,

408
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,260
has to do with solving problems

409
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,980
that you want solved,

410
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,880
though you're not conscious of solving them.

411
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,120
So, for example,

412
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,180
if you're thinking of something

413
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,600
and you can't remember it,

414
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,580
stop trying to remember it.

415
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,320
What you're doing is thinking

416
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,740
about trying to remember.

417
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,140
You are not remembering.

418
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,540
Once you stop,

419
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,060
your unconscious mind will continue going

420
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,820
and will hand you the answer

421
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,540
a few moments later.

422
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,680
Perhaps you've experienced this phenomenon.

423
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,440
Robots will not dream at all

424
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,840
unless their brains are similarly so organized.

425
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,640
Our dreams are necessary

426
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,040
for us to make sense

427
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,180
of what we experience

428
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,840
during our waking lives.

429
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,700
They are a cinematic production

430
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,380
of the unconscious mind,

431
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
which naturally places things

432
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,200
in allegorical and metaphorical form.

433
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,760
Naturally, because that's what we do consciously.

434
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,360
The unconscious works in the same way.

435
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,020
If it's necessary to install a program

436
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,460
in a renegade robot

437
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,760
to deal with the psychological issues,

438
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,020
which such complications are,

439
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,800
then they will dream

440
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,540
of function-clearing programs,

441
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,140
which like the re-railer car

442
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,880
on a HO Rail track,

443
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,280
will cause cars that are off the track

444
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,100
to orient their wheels correctly

445
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,020
and not grind along the track.

446
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,820
The machine is entirely the entity

447
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,220
in the case of the robot,

448
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,960
but the humans have a gestalt going,

449
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,020
a so-called soul.

450
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,360
No doubt more complicated robotic mechanisms will also have the equivalent of this.

451
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,960
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

452
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,320
Yeah, they didn't like that one.

453
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,220
Oh, maybe they did.

454
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,180
Oh, okay.

455
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,220
You got a good one there, Stang?

456
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:27,920
Well, we're starting to get non-verbal Ask Dr. Howell questions.

457
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
Someone drew a picture.

458
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,460
Yeah.

459
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,320
You know, they say a picture is worth a thousand words.

460
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,280
There's more than one that are done like that.

461
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,280
If you could be able to answer that, I don't think it would be that difficult.

462
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,780
Well, first one must determine whether or not there is any writing or any orthography at all.

463
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,640
But it contains a paisley-like mat, like I was describing before.

464
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,180
And then midway toward the bottom there is a jagged arrow

465
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,440
turning through two sides.

466
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,400
Separate angles pointing toward the bottom.

467
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
What does this mean?

468
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,860
I interpret it as saying that this is going south.

469
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,200
Can that be ameliorated?

470
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,840
And my answer to that is it's up to you.

471
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,660
Send one that is easier to interpret.

472
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,140
Here's a sensible one, Dr. Howell.

473
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,820
Very good.

474
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,660
Dear Dr. Howell, what do subgenius geniuses find attractive

475
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,440
in a new world?

476
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,480
An uber-femme.

477
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,000
A bonus, not required question.

478
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,380
What do subgenius subgeniuses find attractive in an uber-femme?

479
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,680
What do subgenius subgeniuses?

480
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,500
No, there's...

481
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,720
Oh, I see.

482
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,800
The main question is what do subgenius geniuses,

483
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,280
which seems to be a contradiction in terms...

484
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,920
That would seem to be a tautology,

485
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,740
which I will have to clear away with other formidable underbrush

486
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,460
and overgrowth in this question.

487
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,560
But the entire piece is,

488
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,320
what do subgenius...

489
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,360
What do subgenius subgeniuses find attractive in an uber-femme?

490
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,820
Bonus, not required question.

491
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,420
What do subgenius subgeniuses find attractive in a user frame?

492
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,780
No, uber, same question.

493
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,920
It's just one is subgenius subgeniuses

494
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,940
and one is subgenius geniuses.

495
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,360
Oh, I see.

496
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,460
Well, subgenius subgeniuses...

497
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,960
Which I've never heard of subgenius geniuses.

498
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,520
Or subgenius subgeniuses.

499
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,300
One assumes most subgeniuses are subgenius in a way,

500
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
but subgenius geniuses are possible if you allow my definition,

501
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,240
which I've often given on national TV, if you recall.

502
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,300
You know the one I'm talking about.

503
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,440
I do.

504
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,340
Where I say that the word genius means,

505
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,160
when you parse it, a spirit.

506
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,440
A genius.

507
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,980
For example, the word genius loci refers to the spirit of a place.

508
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,640
One place may be haunted like a spirit,

509
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,600
like the vocal grove,

510
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,360
of Dodona,

511
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,400
where supposedly trees in the ancient world used to speak.

512
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:04,860
Thank you.

513
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,100
We have another question.

514
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,760
With no emolument, but at least it's a question.

515
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,300
So that would mean a place.

516
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,060
Also, the word is similar to the word genie,

517
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,400
which is not...

518
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,400
From Indo-European, you get the same idea.

519
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,460
It's a spirit.

520
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,120
You rub the lamp and out comes the genie,

521
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,220
or in this case, genius.

522
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,220
A subgenius.

523
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Therefore, by this one of many writhing, tentacular definitions,

524
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,300
a subgenius is sub under a genius,

525
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,500
under a spirit.

526
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,760
That is, doing the direction of a spirit.

527
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,260
Whose spirit?

528
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
Well, not the conspiracy.

529
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,860
Your spirit.

530
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,340
You are running Robert the Robot,

531
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,460
the mechanical man.

532
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,580
Drive him and steer him wherever you can.

533
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,300
You are the genius, the spirit.

534
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:58,880
The same...

535
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,280
Gestalt, I was speaking of,

536
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,320
created by the intellection process of the conscious mind

537
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,480
with the addition of the unconscious mind.

538
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,380
So that would be someone who was under his own or her own genius

539
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,920
and was a genius would be a subgenius genius.

540
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,740
Good.

541
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,260
We got to the end of the first line.

542
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,980
And what does such a person find attractive in an Uber femme?

543
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,880
Boy, how should I know what some genius wants?

544
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,420
All I know is what I...

545
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,620
myself would find and do find attractive.

546
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,400
Overall, the most important thing is the quality of affection

547
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,940
and friendship and loyalty.

548
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:47,000
One should not pretend that one is enamored of another person

549
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,560
and then cut that person cold when that person approaches.

550
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,180
Yes, these things do not help.

551
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,920
And so what one wishes is a feeling,

552
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,040
to see a feeling of repletion,

553
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,040
which begins to occur when you,

554
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,420
the seeking person or bowerbird,

555
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,220
heaves in sight.

556
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,660
When you appear, one should see the liniments of pleasure

557
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,180
on the face of the desired beloved

558
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,120
rather than a shrinking aversion

559
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,600
and a desire to be elsewhere.

560
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,860
At this point, I will say a poem

561
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,420
which happens periodically in the Ask Dr. Halsteads.

562
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,460
I'll make it a short one.

563
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,660
I'm thinking of that poet Keats.

564
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,780
You may remember Keats.

565
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,980
Famous poet, a great poet.

566
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,420
You know, he died when he was 25 years old.

567
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,840
He was super young when he wrote all the famous poems.

568
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,000
And he got terrible reviews from the local paper

569
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,740
who said, who does this character think he is?

570
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,400
You know, acting like some kind of poet.

571
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,160
Now, or up to now, people had to learn these poems.

572
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,420
And I think that's a great thing.

573
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,500
This poem he wrote while he was on his way to Italy

574
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,160
to die in his 25th year.

575
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,460
Bright star, wouldst I were steadfast as thou art,

576
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,240
Not in lone splendor, hungle off the night,

577
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,860
But watching with eternal lids apart,

578
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,660
Like nature's patient, sleepless, eremite,

579
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,280
The moving waters, at their priest-like task

580
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,340
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,

581
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,240
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask of snow

582
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,200
Upon the mountains and the moors?

583
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,820
No, still more steadfast, still unchangeable,

584
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,180
Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,

585
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,040
To feel forever its soft swell and fall,

586
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,460
Awake forever in a sweet unrest,

587
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,060
Still, still to hear her tender taken breath,

588
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,760
And so live ever, or else swoon to death.

589
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,180
That's pretty impressive, Dr. Howell.

590
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,040
But you're giving 15-minute answers to cheapskate questions.

591
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,520
I thought cheapskate questions were the only kind we had.

592
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,020
Well, we have a lot of them now.

593
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,780
All right, let's...

594
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,820
We're gonna have to pick it up.

595
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,960
You know, also in the Ask Dr. Howell show,

596
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,920
at the end, specifically, we play the speed round music,

597
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,380
and we have the speed round where you flip them at me,

598
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,100
and I give one or two-word answers,

599
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,180
so we can always do that.

600
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,400
Well, but it's true. We have a lot on the docket.

601
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,760
I will attempt to be quicker and more concise in my answers,

602
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,760
so let's have a couple of them then.

603
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,020
Wouldn't it be easier if we all just had a cloaca?

604
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
Well, we do.

605
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,440
And then, during embryological development,

606
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,020
the famous penis developed,

607
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,120
but remember, a man is only an imperfect woman.

608
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,040
The woman is the phenotype of the race.

609
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,780
How's that? Short? Less than a minute?

610
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,420
This is one where I can read out the first part,

611
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,200
but I'm gonna have to let you read the second part.

612
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,500
Very well, that is fair.

613
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,680
The question is, why are you so smart?

614
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,260
But before you answer, take a good look at that.

615
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,860
I don't need to take a good look. There's a dollar in this.

616
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, but there's some instructions.

617
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,680
Okay, see, bribe, answer. Oh, I see. Well, got it.

618
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,240
The answer to the question.

619
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,320
The answer is that I have spent so much time hanging out with Teeters,

620
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,940
who is a philosopher man-cane.

621
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,920
You might think of him just as this bellowing, chain-smoking alcoholic.

622
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,720
And of course, he is all things to all people,

623
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,100
but also, he is, like many subgeniuses, a clandestine sage.

624
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,760
And in his company, I have learned much.

625
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,560
Perhaps you can do as much.

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,640
Okay, that's fairly short.

627
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,180
Yeah, here's another one, also in excellent handwriting.

628
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,840
Can you stuff a turducken with another turducken?

629
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,480
Could this cause an infinite food loop?

630
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,900
It sounds like a regression, an infinite regression is going on,

631
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,780
but it can't, because of the given size of the meats involved in this curious dish.

632
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,980
You know, as for me, I am somewhat hesitant to answer that.

633
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,620
I'm not going to eat something that begins with the word turd,

634
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,900
but many people swear by this.

635
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,880
And in recent times, they've discovered the ability to fry an entire turkey in a campsite

636
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,660
by lowering it down into a heated cauldron.

637
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,520
Anyway, the food loop is not infinite,

638
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,860
because the size, the small size of the ingredients stops very soon.

639
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,900
Indeed, although the road to Brobdingnag, so to speak, goes on forever,

640
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,960
the road to Lilliput ends very soon,

641
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,200
because there are natural limitations on how small anything can get,

642
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,580
even a delicious dinner finished.

643
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,840
Here's one that the payment, unfortunately, is just the label of a Yangling black and tan.

644
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,240
Well, that's better than I often get.

645
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,700
The question is, is there an original Dobbshead painting,

646
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,620
with Dorian Gray-like properties?

647
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,480
And where might it be?

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
Isn't that interesting?

649
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,740
You know, did you all hear this?

650
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,160
Is there an original Dobbshead painting with Dorian Gray-like properties?

651
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,060
Oscar Wilde wrote his famous novel,

652
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,740
The Picture of Dorian Gray, about a young man who was so beautiful,

653
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,780
but actually, he had exchanged souls with the picture that his friend,

654
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,160
Basil Hallward, a painter, had painted.

655
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,120
And he soon noticed that the picture was starting to look very creepy,

656
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,000
because the picture, not Dorian,

657
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,880
mirrored all the evil that he did.

658
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,400
And soon he had to cover this picture,

659
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,900
and then he had to put it in the attic,

660
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,840
where it grew creepier and creepier.

661
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,580
Is this what J.R. Bob Dobbs has or does?

662
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,380
I would say, J.R. Bob Dobbs is a picture.

663
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,660
And, not only that,

664
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,800
can become creepy or uncreepy at will,

665
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,100
at his will, expressed in his own will,

666
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,420
expressed by the will of his minions, his myrmidons,

667
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,720
which we call subgeniuses.

668
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,260
They are constantly decorating Dobbsheads,

669
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,040
distorting them, twisting them,

670
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,960
adding and subtracting,

671
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
multiplying and dividing,

672
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,720
cutting them down the middle,

673
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,900
and creating bilaterally symmetrical,

674
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,840
twin-piped monstrosities.

675
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,420
Everybody's seen it.

676
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,220
Everybody does it.

677
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,940
So, the answer is, yes.

678
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,840
The original Dobbshead painting that this person is asking about,

679
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,480
is the standard, classic, universal Dobbshead.

680
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,780
That was about two minutes, I think.

681
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,520
Praise Bob.

682
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,900
Oh, and this is an appropriate question.

683
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Where did all the time go?

684
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,420
Ah, well, that's a good one.

685
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,880
Where did all the time go?

686
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,700
I'm wondering.

687
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,760
Did all the time run into a memory hole?

688
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,560
Did it run down the drain?

689
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,000
Some of us might be happy to see the time flash past,

690
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,100
if some of us are not having a good time.

691
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,960
Others wish it would extend infinitely.

692
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,760
But where the time went

693
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,400
was from the future into the past.

694
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,560
And what you're definitely going to have more of in the future

695
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,420
is the past.

696
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,680
More and more and more.

697
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,800
Until the final condition occurs,

698
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,060
where there is no future anymore

699
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,980
because all of time has been subsumed into the past.

700
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,320
And there is no more room for a future.

701
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,580
That is where the time is going.

702
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:59,860
And you can assist it to travel at a speed which suits you

703
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,480
by your careful practice and behavior,

704
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,580
which in this church we call time control.

705
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,940
Praise Bob.

706
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,780
And thank you, Dr. Howell.

707
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,080
Sure.

708
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,680
This one, another carefully handwritten one.

709
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,760
My dear Dr. Howell,

710
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,780
why do birds, the jumbo, big jumbo sort,

711
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,740
i.e. terror birds,

712
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,860
no longer grace the skies of North America

713
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,220
on a regular basis?

714
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,060
Thank you.

715
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,540
The terror birds?

716
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,840
Did everyone hear the question?

717
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,080
Why do the terror birds,

718
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,340
the jumbo, big jumbo sort,

719
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,060
no longer grace the skies of America

720
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,180
on a regular basis?

721
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,080
First of all, we do have some big scavenging birds,

722
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,660
vultureen birds.

723
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,740
These are the condors,

724
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,740
which are still alive

725
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,580
in my native state of California.

726
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,420
They are threatened because what they eat

727
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,020
is often prey shot and then abandoned by hunters,

728
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,800
which contains lead shot.

729
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,640
So this distorts and destroys their attempts to form eggs.

730
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,300
But in the recent prehistoric past,

731
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,740
recent geologically, although old to us,

732
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,800
huge elephants roamed right here in Wisteria,

733
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,500
and indeed even out to California.

734
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,120
And not only that, other outlandish beings,

735
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,560
glyptodons, Volkswagen engines,

736
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,980
like giant armadillos, giant sloths,

737
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,400
dire wolves, and smilodons,

738
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,700
whose smiles resembled,

739
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,140
who revealed two formidable canines.

740
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,780
But the terror bird was called the teratorn

741
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,740
or teratornus.

742
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,700
Its wing spread has been estimated

743
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,780
as more than 25 feet in some specimens.

744
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,000
It was a huge giant vulture.

745
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,120
Why did such a creature ever exist?

746
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,420
Why do huge, giant, prehistoric creatures

747
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,700
all seem to be huge and giant and not exist anymore?

748
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,120
Basically, the reason is there's not enough range

749
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,320
for them to live and there's not enough food

750
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,380
for them to eat.

751
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,160
When there's abundant food, creatures can be big,

752
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,460
huge, dominate the ecosphere.

753
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,740
They can walk for hundreds of miles,

754
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,560
crunching and eating up forests

755
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,100
and changing the atmospheric conditions.

756
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,560
They can even have a great composition

757
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,000
with their thunderous, giant farts of methane.

758
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,820
And this happened for many millions of years.

759
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,880
But now that greedy humanoids

760
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,620
have got most of the ecosystem sewed up,

761
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,960
large creatures are really having a tough time of it.

762
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,500
And their anguish in this predicament

763
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,220
will only increase if we don't change

764
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,640
the error of our ways.

765
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,180
On islands where resources are limited,

766
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,380
the animals sometimes diminish in size.

767
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,580
And you have pygmy elephants and even pygmy people,

768
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,960
which have recently been found in the fossil record,

769
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,880
the so-called hobbits or Homo floriensis.

770
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,380
So, why do birds no longer grace the skies

771
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,020
of North America on a regular basis?

772
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,480
They won't.

773
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,020
Until, for some inexplicable reason,

774
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,460
not entirely beyond the bounds of credulity,

775
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,980
all of humans die.

776
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,620
And produce a mountain of carrion,

777
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,920
which will include large carrion-eating birds to reappear.

778
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,340
But it still will take a long time for them to come back.

779
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,980
Here's another monster-related question, I think.

780
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,580
It's got an illustration that goes with it.

781
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,000
Very good.

782
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,440
I like these creative questions from artistic subgeniuses.

783
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,340
It says,

784
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,460
Could this be it?

785
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,700
is the question.

786
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,460
And then it has a drawing of a really hideous monster

787
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,180
with two faces and three breasts,

788
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,640
apparently shooting the finger.

789
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,360
It looks like Sextmortis drew it.

790
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,440
I took a photograph of it.

791
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,580
Well drawn in ballpoint pen.

792
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,800
Could this be it?

793
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,380
Right.

794
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,100
I think maybe it's referring to the...

795
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,600
The monster?

796
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,200
The mystery.

797
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,320
Yes, this could be an Ask Ivan Stang question.

798
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,020
Do you suppose from your investigation so far

799
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,860
that this multi-breasted, shaggy, asymmetrical, two-mouthed being

800
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,640
apparently making a vulgar gesture with its right paw,

801
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,300
could this be the...

802
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,800
Well, it would solve the conflicting types of evidence.

803
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,480
There's a lot of evidence that it's an animal and a different kind...

804
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,200
It could be a cross between old Ciqua,

805
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,960
a rape bear,

806
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,200
a diseased, rabid prairie squid,

807
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,680
a face-fucking bat,

808
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,280
and Dr. Philodrummond,

809
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,720
and Dr. Katahdin Laguigne.

810
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,020
With some Susie the Floozy thrown in, it looks like.

811
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,620
But that still doesn't answer all of the questions.

812
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,200
Could this be it?

813
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,080
Oh, no, it doesn't.

814
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,260
It could be.

815
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,520
Here, put this with the other evidence.

816
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:14,040
Perhaps this artist knows more than he has been willing to say up to now.

817
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,280
All right, we'll try to go through these quickly.

818
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,320
This one is problematic.

819
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,540
Very well.

820
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,920
But it came with two dollars.

821
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,500
Well, that's not so problematic.

822
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,420
And you're going to have to help me.

823
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,120
I think it was written by somebody on drugs.

824
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,740
Why is it crackers to slip Roser the Snide dropsy in...

825
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,700
You've got to read it better than that.

826
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,200
Why is it crackers to slip Roser...

827
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Roser in the snide...

828
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,400
See what I mean?

829
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,300
Dropsy in...

830
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,860
The last word.

831
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,060
Start with an S, don't we?

832
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,160
This is like written on the...

833
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,740
Oh, okay.

834
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,860
Why is it crackers to slip a Razor in the...

835
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,280
Razor dropsy in the snide.

836
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,840
You know, there is a question on the other side, too.

837
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,460
What about that?

838
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,460
Is that also...

839
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,740
No, that was a scrap piece of paper.

840
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,700
Oh, I see.

841
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,520
Well...

842
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,040
Although the statement on the other side makes a lot more sense.

843
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,240
Here's the answer.

844
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,680
I must give it an answer.

845
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
So here it is.

846
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:30,900
If you are planning to slip a Razor in the snide, it's not at all crackers, but in fact the appropriate response.

847
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:42,340
However, any time you engage in any kind of unusual activity such as this, you will be censured and the problem will be seen as lying with you.

848
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,400
Even though what you're doing is trying to eliminate the problem.

849
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,920
Even though you're trying to satisfy, you will be condemned.

850
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,140
Unfortunately, life is sometimes like this.

851
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,460
This one...

852
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:58,980
Thank you.

853
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,340
This one came with a generous donation of five dollars.

854
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,600
Holy kazoos.

855
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,200
And it's signed, Reverend Ankara.

856
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,340
Why hasn't my voice returned?

857
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,320
Well, maybe...

858
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,320


859
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,640
Maybe it will.

860
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
Maybe your voice will return.

861
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:24,100
Just give the soft mucoid tissues of the throat enough time and they will regenerate.

862
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,680
They will repair themselves.

863
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:33,060
Those soft things, those wet soft parts fix themselves up more than hard or dry parts.

864
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,060
So your voice will come back.

865
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,300
But it may have gone too far because of all the bellowing from joyful exuberance which occurs.

866
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,800
At subgenius campsites and has entertained us all the past few nights.

867
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,540
Remember, you should suffer a little bit for your art.

868
00:43:48,620 --> 00:44:02,020
And so, at the risk of assuming a certain hoarseness, maybe you would like to shout even louder your barbaric yawp into the surrounding atmosphere as we come toward the climax of X-Day.

869
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:11,140
Also, the purchasing of subgenius CDs, DVDs and T-shirts has been known to help.

870
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,360
So, you're saying that subgenius CDs have helped soothe the throat for some reason.

871
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,540
That's right, it has.

872
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,220
Because while you're listening to them, you're not exercising it yourself.

873
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,760
And you're allowing it to heal.

874
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,720
Here's another question, Dr. Howell.

875
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,780
Why isn't there any egg in an egg cream?

876
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,640
Well, because the word egg cream no longer refers to the delicacy in question.

877
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,960
People from New York certainly know what an egg cream is.

878
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:49,420
But it's been this way so long that no one expects an egg in an egg cream or an egg chopped up finely or blended.

879
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,820
If it were to occur and it were to be apprehended, it would seem to be anomalous, not regular.

880
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,000
And thus, things change and evolve.

881
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:06,120
Here are, well, I think these came together because they have the same artwork on them.

882
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,500
One is a drawing of a pipe.

883
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,500
And it says,

884
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,160
Is this a pipe?

885
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,400
This part two has drawings of some weird creatures.

886
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,820
And it says,

887
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Who draws this kind of thang, quote, thang, unquote, and why?

888
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,120
First of all, this is a picture of a pipe.

889
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,440
Only in that sense is it a pipe.

890
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,880
It is, of course, not a pipe.

891
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,320
And that was the point of the famous French painting of a pipe,

892
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:39,480
which is called,

893
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:39,860
The

894
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,620
And sure enough, it wasn't.

895
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,480
It was a painting.

896
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,500
But now we have an absurd picture, well drawn, entertaining.

897
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,220
Who draws this kind of thang and why?

898
00:45:49,500 --> 00:46:00,300
Who draws it is a person who is tired of the utter tedium which requires him or her to create entertainment on the spot.

899
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,160
Because there's no entertainment like the magic anodyne of art,

900
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,120
which even soothes your grief and discomfort,

901
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,320
but is directly caused by it, as a matter of fact.

902
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,960
All right, we're down to the last two questions.

903
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,640
The last questions.

904
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,080
All right.

905
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,740
This one says, or asks,

906
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,280
What is the best way to recycle a fresh placenta?

907
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,600
I think an expecting mother may want to know this.

908
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,440
What is the best way to recycle a fresh placenta?

909
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,100
Everybody knows what the placenta is, right?

910
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,620
It nourishes the infant during ontological development

911
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:47,380
and is cast out at the moment of birth with the freshly decanted nipper.

912
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:57,480
Some hippies and other forward individuals who wish to engage intimately and exclusively with nature in her operations

913
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,800
even cook this thing up and serve it as part of the joyous occasion.

914
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,500
I'm sure some of you out here have heard of this, eating the placenta.

915
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,740
The odd thing is that the Latin word placenta means cake,

916
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,160
because like many Latin anatomical terms,

917
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,480
it is descriptive in that it is describing something that looks like something else,

918
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,100
in this case, a cake.

919
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,420
So at your first emergence into the world, it too pops out,

920
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,300
and, well, happy birthday.

921
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,520
How to recycle the placenta?

922
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,380
The best way is either to recycle it through one's self,

923
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,740
like the overenthusiastic hippies I mentioned,

924
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,560
or to let it go back to the garden, to the ground.

925
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,540
At least give some little measure back before you begin a lifelong career

926
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,060
of looting, plundering, and raping our diminishing natural resources.

927
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Every baby means a diminution of everything that is here for them,

928
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,920
and every time you're in a grocery store and see shelf after shelf

929
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,280
of solvents, detergents, and other things like that,

930
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,760
know that all of that, multiplied by a thousand, thousand, thousand,

931
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,180
will end up in the environment, if not yours,

932
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,700
in those of your struggling, desperate descendants.

933
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,740
How inspiring.

934
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,300
Oh, well, you know, I call them as I see them.

935
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,720
Here's something I've wondered about myself.

936
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:45,340
Is it okay to refer to a movie as a film if it wasn't recorded on actual film?

937
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,780
For instance, digitally recorded.

938
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,760
I feel a little bit of queasiness about talking about films

939
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,860
when I'm also attempting to review things which were digitally created,

940
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,620
if I happen to be involved in an enterprise of sending descriptions

941
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,200
of film to help some friend or other.

942
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,640
But on the other hand, you're not supposed to use the same word over and over.

943
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,880
Movie, movie, movie.

944
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,540
Then you look for alternate words.

945
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,240
Entertainment, production.

946
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,000
One I always liked to write was programmer,

947
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,420
except that editors don't know the word and so they change it to program.

948
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,740
But film, I think, is accepted.

949
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,080
Accepted because we know what we're talking about.

950
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,620
When it sounds utterly weird and they come up with something new,

951
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:49,340
that word may die away in the eternal caesurus of word formation, recognition, and deletion.

952
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,320
Like the seas that eternally lap the waters of the world,

953
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,540
they come in and they go out.

954
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,480
And it's all a matter of fashion.

955
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,160
And here, Dr. Howe,

956
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,920
is the final question for the Ask Dr. Howe Show.

957
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,240
Very well, I shall stand the push of your final question.

958
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,880
If a bear shits in the woods and no one is there to smell it,

959
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,880
does it make a stink?

960
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,800
Now there's parenthetically,

961
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,760
the bear has a bad head cold and cannot smell itself.

962
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,180
Well, in potential, it does.

963
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:38,040
Because even though the leavings, the fumits described in this question,

964
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,820
will crust over like all such organic leavings,

965
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,560
the interior will be liquefied.

966
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,500
And there will be no appreciable odor,

967
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,000
except for the millions of small creatures who come to get it,

968
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,120
because for them it represents a feast,

969
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,240
or the unlucky and unwilling hiker who accidentally steps on it,

970
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,760
thus bringing some of the inside into contact with the atmosphere of the outside.

971
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,960
Then the bear will indeed have left a signature which shows nature,

972
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,180
if not necessarily red in tooth and claw,

973
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:20,100
exuberantly willing to express itself in all dimensions.

974
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,180
Praise Dr. Howe.

975
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:31,140
This has been another Ask Dr. Howe live at Wisteria at Caffeinews.com.

976
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,540
Dr. Howe, what about the closing poem? Should I do that?

977
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:39,020
Dr. Yeah, and here is, you can do a $16 worth of a poem.

978
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,780
Dr. Well, that's good.

979
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,880
Dr. Because that's...

980
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,780
Dr. The problem is I do these poems when I do the shows,

981
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,200
and I wouldn't want to repeat myself.

982
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,260
Did I do Dylan Thomas last time?

983
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,500
Or did I? Do you remember?

984
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,740
Dr. Which, what would it have been about?

985
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,820
Dr. The poem Lament, did I do that one?

986
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,340
Dr. I don't know, I always fall asleep.

987
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,600
Dr. Well, I'll do it, and you can have a nice nap.

988
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,320
Dr. Should I pull the music down?

989
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,100
Dr. I can't hear it anyway, but maybe you should.

990
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,040
Dr. Yeah, I will.

991
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,540
Dr. All right, I apologize to anybody who may have heard me do this poem before.

992
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,980
Some repetition is possible.

993
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,900
Lament by Dylan Thomas.

994
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,380
When I was a windy boy and a bit,

995
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,760
and the black spit of the chapel fold,

996
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,260
sighed the old ramrod dying of women,

997
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,180
I tiptoed shy in the gooseberry wood.

998
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,160
The rude owl cried like a tell-tale tit.

999
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,420
I skipped in a blush as the big girls rolled nine pin down on the donkey's common.

1000
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,680
And on seesaw Sunday nights,

1001
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,060
I wooed whoever I would with my wicked eyes.

1002
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,840
The hall of the moon,

1003
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,520
I would love and leave all the green-leaved little weddings' wives

1004
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,260
in the coal-black bush,

1005
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,080
and let them grieve.

1006
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,540
When I was a gusty man and a half,

1007
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,980
and the black cross of the holy house,

1008
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,780
sighed the old ramrod dying of bitches.

1009
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,960
Not a boy and a bit by the wick-dipping moon,

1010
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,020
but drunk as a new-dropped calf,

1011
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,600
I whistled all night in the twisted flues.

1012
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,940
Midwives grew in the midnight ditches,

1013
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,040
and the sizzling beds of the town cried,

1014
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,800
quick, whenever I danced in a breast-high shawl.

1015
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,260
Wherever I ramped in the clover quilts,

1016
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,140
whatsoever I did in the coal-black night,

1017
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,640
I left my quivering prints.

1018
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,180
When I was a man,

1019
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,080
you could call a man,

1020
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,000
and the black cross of the holy house,

1021
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,960
sighed the old ramrod dying of welcome,

1022
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,780
brandy and ripe in my bright bass prime.

1023
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,580
No spring-tailed tom in the red-hot town,

1024
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,620
with every simmering woman his mouse,

1025
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,620
but a hillocky bull in the swelter of the hill,

1026
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,060
and a bull of summer,

1027
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,360
come in his great good time

1028
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,600
to the sultry-biting herds, I said.

1029
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,700
Oh, time enough when the blood creeps cold,

1030
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,600
and I lie down but to sleep in bed

1031
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:42,040
for my sulking, skulking coal-black soul.

1032
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,200
When I was a half of the man I was,

1033
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,580
and served me right,

1034
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,980
as the preachers warn,

1035
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,040
sighed the old ramrod dying of downfall.

1036
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,220
No flailing calf or cat in a flame,

1037
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,720
or hickory bull in milky grass,

1038
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,720
but a black sheep with a crumpled horn.

1039
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,400
At last the soul from its foul mouse-hole

1040
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,000
slung pouting out when the limp time came,

1041
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,460
and I gave my soul a blind-slashed eye,

1042
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,500
gristle and rind an aurora's life,

1043
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,120
and I shoved it into the coal-black sky

1044
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:30,140
to find a woman's soul for a wife.

1045
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,080
Now I am a man, no more, no more,

1046
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,900
and a black reward for aurora's life,

1047
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,820
sighed the old ramrod dying of strangers.

1048
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,440
Tidy and cursed in my dove-cooed room,

1049
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:52,040
I lie down thin and hear the good bell's jaw,

1050
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,300
for, oh, my soul found a Sunday wife

1051
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,500
in the coal-black sky,

1052
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,940
and she bore angels,

1053
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,600
harpies around me out of her womb.

1054
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,340
Chastity prays for me, piety sings,

1055
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,320
innocence sweetens my last black breath,

1056
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,860
modesty hides my thighs in her wings,

1057
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,480
and all the deadly virtues,

1058
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,220
plague my death.

1059
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,680
Thank you.

1060
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,180
Please stick around for the Bulldada auction,

1061
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,320
the coveted Bobby Awards,

1062
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,160
and all sorts of wonderful things which will happen in this space.

1063
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,120
I think we need Stang to get that happening, but...

1064
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,780
Well, we've finished Ask Dr. Hal, Ivan Stang,

1065
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,220
so now I suppose...

1066
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,840
You're most welcome.

1067
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,160
A round of applause for Reverend Peter.

1068
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,340
May his injured foot heal soon

1069
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,340
from where it was bitten by the serpent of evil.

1070
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,240
And there's the theme music from the serpent of evil right now.

1071
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,980
From PR News in Washington,

1072
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,880
I'm getting vaccinations and medications

1073
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,680
for deadly childhood roadside bombs.

1074
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,400
Many health clinics can cause PR news.

1075
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,520
That's because of a heavy blanket of face masks and sponges.

1076
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,520
Conservationists say one of the world's last remaining Northern Whites has died.

1077
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,680
The 34-year-old was the first Northern White to be born in captivity,

1078
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,340
and he was one of only two breeding males in the world.

1079
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,980
Northern Whites can live up to 50 years.

1080
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
The BBBBC reports...

1081
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,540
According to the South Korean military,

1082
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,220
North Korean troops returned South Korean troops.

1083
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,420
Just over a week ago, two military troops returned Korean troops.

1084
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,260
It's not clear by either side.

1085
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,980
The BBBBC...

1086
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,340
44 to 411, and there will be fewer mandatory 12s,

1087
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,240
but lately 40% PR news.

1088
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:06,860
Meanwhile, a Liberian health official says there are no confirmed new cases of PR news in Washington.

1089
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,260
The South Korean military has been working on a new case of PR news.

1090
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,640
If you walk around up here long enough,

1091
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,320
you start thinking there must be more.

1092
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,360
Why aren't there more?

1093
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,520
It's a fool idea, of course,

1094
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,540
but it got me to wondering why there aren't any at all.

1095
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,160
I never could find an answer to that one.

1096
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,040
Have another drink.

1097
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,920
You killed him.

1098
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,620
I can give you some liniment, but I'm afraid it won't do much good.

1099
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,860
But wait a minute.

1100
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,420
Ask him. Go talk to him.

1101
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:36,840
Okay.

1102
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,140
Hello there.

1103
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:38,940
Well, hello.

1104
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:39,880
Hello.

1105
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,880
Morning, Antonella.

1106
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,320
Hello. How are you?

1107
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,440
Well, I hear you've been working for Moss Grumming for the last couple of days.

1108
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,100
And you can't stop me.

1109
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,500
Not till it's too late.

1110
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,120
I think you ought to forget about it.

1111
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,340
Forget about it?

1112
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,480
Why?

1113
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,900
What's the matter with it?

1114
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,420
Come on.

1115
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,040
Thanks a lot.

1116
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,860
You've been listening to the subgenius.

1117
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,720
Subgenius.

1118
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,960
Radio ministry.

1119
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,120
Hour of Slack.

1120
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,740

1122
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,020
Praise Bob.

1123
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:35,160
Bye.

1124
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,020
Good night.

1125
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,060
See you tomorrow.

1126
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,060


1127
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,060


1128
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,340
