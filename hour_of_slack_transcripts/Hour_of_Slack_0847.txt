If you are watching this video at the moment, you are the remnants of a lost planet.
That is correct, the planet Earth, which has since been destroyed.
Yes, destroyed, my friends, by the men from Planet X.
Yes, but in the time that the Earth did exist, a savior came.
And that savior's name was Bob.
And he saved a small group of plentiful young people called the subgenius,
who were led by a crazed charlatan by the name of Reverend Ivan Stang.
Yes, my friends, this Reverend Ivan Stang led this group of crazed charlatans,
the last real Americans to quote Pope David and Meyer,
to salvation, slack, and eternal happiness, pleasure, and ooze squirt.
Life dropped by the majestic bank.
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.
Thank you for joining us.
I'm Bob Gold.

We are the Black Black Space.
We are the Black Black Space.
We are the Black Black Space.
We are the Black Black Space.
Burn! Burn!
My favorite thing about this whole quest
is being able to wipe out as many people as you want
without guilt, without any feelings of remorse
or any feelings of having done something wrong.
Or at least to have fantasies of doing so without guilt.
Well, isn't it all a fantasy?
A big, fat, freaky...
Does this take you back?
To Club Tiki Banzai,
Thursday night.
I smell more than vomit.
Every time I think about Club Tiki Banzai,
I want to puke.
It smells like banana vomit
mixed with a little bit of whatever kind of green stuff
they chew on in the forest.
After you told me,
when you found El Gordo and Princess Party Girl
in your van going at it...
Oh, I wasn't supposed to talk about that in public.
No, not in my van.
That's where I had to go to sleep.
El Gordo y La Flaca.
El Gordo y Princess Party Girl.
Y La Flaca.
I couldn't believe it, man.
I thought they were enemies.
They'd been screaming at each other earlier.
And then, man, to hear that...
I can't believe El Gordo lowered himself like that.
But, you know, Brushwood and the end of the world
combined have that effect on people.
You're right.
As our little social experiment is proving increasingly each year.
Lowering, yeah.
Leveling the IQ.
Many people could hardly lift their chins from the ground.
Everything has been flattened.
The eardrum hairs...
It has flattened.
The higher register, the heart...
In fact, there are still...
Well, I did not think it was...
...flattened into the quicksilver out there in Spumanti heaven.
I did not think it was a coincidence
that as soon as I get back from X-Day,
they make the announcement about finding the 7 million year old human.
Well, pre-human.
This just pushes the...
Well, yeah.
This is the most delightful thing I've ever seen.
I held it in my hand.
It pushes the divergence point.
I just couldn't believe it.
I was filled with delight.
I was squealing like a little girl.
About 2 million years.
It was not a simian in its purest form.
But it wasn't human.
But it was so smooth and round.
And I loved it.
And I tenderly held it.
And I thought of what it might look like without hair.
But it had plenty of hair, didn't it?
I don't know.
Which one?
The first bonobo from 7 trillion bazillion years ago
that they just found 2,800 meters from the Oldenby Gorge.
The champ just found it X-Day on his cot.
Yeah.
The throwback.
The original promo Anthropocus.
The first footed man.
What I want to know is...
Or woman in this case.
Which I noticed was chasing you all over the place, Chaz.
Six-finger man.
But Chaz is six-finger man.
He don't mess with five-toe woman hanging from trees.
No.
Five-toe woman kicking nose with feet.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Why did you guys stop the international...
Before drummer.
Before drummer.

Before staying.
Why did you stop the international Red Cross from entering the campsite is what I want to know.
Hey, man.
It's part of the adventure of X-Day.
It's the mental illness, the injuries, the bugs in the ear.
Did you hear about the guy who got a Dobson fly trapped in his ear?
The gynecologist from Baltimore?
St. Michael Dark Angel.
Dark Angel.
From Quijibo cartel.
Ended up screaming for hours.
Well, that was one of the...
He had a bug, a live bug in his ear.
That was one of the penile implants.
It's on the insects that you had to develop.
Well, that's part of the fun of X-Day.
It's a challenge.
You know, some of these kids don't know how to build a fire.
They can build a computer, but not a fire.
No, that's why they kept hanging out at Tranquility Bay.
That's right.
They got to go back to the basics.
Fire.
Let's go to where there's fire.
There's much the pagans can teach us about things like fires.
I couldn't believe they were so ignorant.
Many of the young Bobby children, I couldn't believe they were so ignorant of the common ways of the folk of the forest.
They're too goddamn high.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I'm a fucking Bob.
I'm the unscoring scourge, my Bob.
Bob Burr must have been.
I can't stand his presence.
Burning man, eat your heart out.
Yeah.
Follow Stan, children.
This music just takes me right back to the...
Those pulsing bodies.
Somebody told me that, well, several people who had been to Burning Man observed that your camp looked exactly like Burning Man, but with trees and nice weather.
Yeah.
Otherwise, the same thing.
Topless maidens all body-colored up, dancing around.
Isn't it crazy?
Except for the one thing.
We also had the, you know, the lame, the halt.
The spaz, the tard, the subgenius, you know?
The weird.
The down-home people.
The for-real down-home bulldagger.
The genetic misfirings of a race gone bad.
Yes, baby.
Yes, baby.
Surely, if the flutocrats were out that night in their black chompers, they would have vomited in their own stew.
And there was fire.
Fire.
It was fun.
Yeah.
The game was lighting some fires with that waffle maker.
From the Vulcan Earth.
It's...
Oh, you got...
You didn't even see the burning of the giant Dobbs icon.
No, I was getting ready for the show.
But that was, like, kind of stalling things a little.
But that's fine.
I didn't care.
I just was...
I was in my show head.
You were...
I worried about that a little bit.
You were getting ready for a show.
Yeah.
And suddenly, you know, I mean, there you were, pumping up.
You were about ready to splort.
And suddenly, it was, you know, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Can't go now.
Mission control.
Yeah.
Hold the bus.
Wait.
We got...
We got a hold on that launch there.
Yeah.
Now, what exactly...
Don't push the button yet, kids.
Did you shed on fire?
Was it a huge facial icon?
But I was in the...
I wanted to go down there.
It actually looked like his face.
I wanted to go see it.
You know, but I...
I just had to maintain what I was doing.
It was about an eight-foot high replica of the Dobbs icon, that symbol that Jesus invented
a couple of years ago.
You know, the one...
The goon says that.
You see all the time.
The goon says he made that and gave it to Jesus.
Well, what about the 42...
The 42-foot owl that was slept from Bohemia Grove?
Like him says.
That's a funny game.
He wrote it on a napkin or something.
That's a funny game.
I'm still tickled about that owl, man.
I never saw anything like that at a Church of the Subgenius Festival.
A 42-foot owl with all of the world's powerful elite dancing around in weird druid robes and
things like that.
It was truly a sight for a sword.
Yeah.
It was weird.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

No, no, no.
No, no, no.



No, no, no.
Uh-oh.
It looks oddly like a satanic cross.
It now resembles an upside-down cross with an upside-down pipe.
Actually, it looks sort of like a rocket ship, man, with its thrusters and wings.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He who can only eat two beans, but he walked many miles.
What are you burning this year?
I'm burning...
Well, I was going to burn this, my Office Max employee ID card, but I decided to do
something else.
So I'm not burning anything except for inhibitions.
Anything related?
There was one thing definitely that talked about the end time a lot earlier.
Okay.
And I thought it might be really important for you to know that maybe we should think

Sorry, I can not take it.
Shout out?
...
Is it the fifth yet?
Did it swap?
No.
No?
Yes?
I don't watch.
Well, okay, when it is the fifth, when the clock strikes midnight, we have seven hours
left on this planet.
Seven hours left.
You have nothing to lose.
All bets are off.
You can say anything that you want to say.
All those little inhibitions, you should burn them like I burned my car last year.
Tomorrow, the world ends and we will die.
It's time for us to stand up and say what we want to say, such as myself.
I myself have been wanting to say this one thing to this person all fucking day since
I saw her.
I've just been too chicken.
Big Bad Two Beans is shy around.
Girl.
Yes.
But, but, is Rabbi available in the crowd?
Obviously not.
Rabbi?
Hi.
Hi.
I wanted to tell you that your eyes are amongst the most beautiful that I've ever seen in
my life.
And you put her.

Angels to shame with your beauty.
It's the power of Connie, bitch.
And you are the true manifestation of Connie Dobbs.
So, in other words, I really dig ya.
You're a cool chick.
I like ya.
Say it!
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob and praise burning inhibitions!

Br
You know, God hates you.
Stay away from him.
Licentiousness.
Just unbridled, uncontrolled excesses.
That was something he invented.
That was just my little bit of introduction for what I'd like y'all to do.
I mean, let's talk about getting off here.
Let's talk about loving oneself.
I mean, really, I mean, loving.
Loving oneself.
I didn't introduce myself really well, but I'm Priestess Pisces,
and I'm the founder of the little-known Wankers for Bob.
Wankers for Bob!
Wankers for Bob!
And I am going to talk just a brief bit about one of my favorite topics, masturbation.
I mean, where do we start here?
I mean, all you guys, you know, you pull the pudge, you spank the monkey,
choke the chicken, wax the dolphin, fist bang it a little bit, play pocket pool.
What?
What do we start?
Absolutely nothing, baby.
Absolutely nothing.
What I would like to say is, ladies, you've got to pet Miss Kitty every so often, okay?
Pet Miss Kitty.
Because if you don't pet Miss Kitty, you won't know how to make her purr.
Okay?
Pet Miss Kitty.
Pet Miss Kitty, but it takes porno.
I mean, God, porno.
Isn't porno great?
I love porno.
Amateur porno.
Amateur porno, yeah, there you go.
You know, and there's a lot of, you know, feminazi psychos that would say,
oh my God, you're a woman and you like porn.
Yeah, I like strip clubs too, bitch, thanks.
But, and they would want to kill people like Larry Flynn.
You know, Larry Flynn is a saint.
Yeah.
I mean.
Yeah.
What?
He's not a saint.
Exactly.
He's a crazy, he's a marvered saint, nearly.
I mean, what you have to believe is that in the past 20 years, the development of pornography
has increased at such a beautiful rate.
In ways that your granddaddy's chaplain couldn't even have nightmares about.
I mean, we're talking everything.
There's a world of geek, of buffet for both men and women and men and men and women and
women and women and toys and men and toys and probably toys and toys, but I haven't
found it yet.
Farm animals.
Farm animals, yes.
I always forget the farm animals.
You know, and many of you ever want to send me porn.
I really don't like the farm animals.
I don't like the farm animals.
I really don't like the farm animals.
If you think that's cool, just skip the farm animals for me, please.
Well, anyway, with all this said, what I'm trying to do is encouraging you to wank more.
You know, I did a little rally a little while back after the whole, you know, possible early
end of the world scare to wank for peace.
I was trying to get all you fuckers together so that you could all wank at the same time.
You guys are hard to find.
Don't talk to anybody.
Do you?
Yeah.
But, you know, wank for peace, wank for slack, wank because it gets you off, wank because
if you don't, you're going to fuck the next star named Rottweiler.
I mean, whatever.
Just, you know, the only way we're going to get off this planet is if we get off more.
Um, you know, my theory kind of is based on the fact that if you imagine all this subgenius
getting together and everybody is getting off.
We're all in a proximate same time.
The very stench of Getty's sex should be just enough to draw the saucers down from the heavens
like redneck to an Earnhardt shrine.
I mean, it should be just enough.
And so the whole reason I'm getting up here to sum up is telling you to please get off
so we all can get off the planet.
Just remember that as your mantra.
Get off so we all can get off the planet.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I heard it.
I heard it.

I heard it.
But this is how you deal with it.
Fornication and pornography.
Yes.
Yes.
Uncleanness.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
And licentiousness.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
In the Greek gushing.
Yes.
Yes.
Losing.
Yes.
Yes.
And there's pus.
Yes.
And junk all coming out of it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
And it's almost as if he gives a blanket for his men, his boys.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
And that's why we should emulate the dolphin people.
See, we are neither of the banging head grovers or of the fish, or of the food people.
Not the fish people.
You know, for a bunch of people who scream about pinks, those bobbies and subgeniuses sure
did dance to Christina Aguilera.
When this came on, the big dance techno party.
Oh, sorry.
This has just been a little bit of a surprise.












Oh, yeah.
Well, now see, while you guys were doing that, there was woe tanning at the stage.
I don't know if you were aware of this.
Actual woe tanning?
Not at all.
Oh, my God.
There was weird experimental amateur music and improvisational dance, you might say,
that was weird as Bob.
Woo!
Woo!
Lingerie?
Oh, kill me!
Socks?
Oh, kill me!
Sir?
Oh, kill me!
Ah!
Oh, kill me!











Oh, kill me!
Slacks?
Oh, kill me!
Woo!
Woo!
�
Hey, man.
We burned the symbol of democracy.
That which represents our most cherished beliefs.
We did let him hang out.
Because that's what we think of our beliefs.
Now, wait a minute here.
I heard more episodes of Ace Bob during this event than I have ever heard it in previous X-Day.
People were saying blank Bob all over the place.
I counted like 12 times.
I let Bob.
Let me tell you the skinny on Bob.
Dobbs camped out at Tranquility Base like Legume did and a few other people.
They just sort of got there, set up tents elsewhere, and then came down and hung out at T-Base.
I saw him.
Yeah, he just found himself the most comfortable chair.
It was the one with the big arms and the cup holders.
I was the most comfortable chair.
And he just sat there, never talked to anybody.
Did he put anything in the tip drawer?
Never tipped the bar.
He drained his bladder.
Never tipped the bar.
He drained his bladder.
And just had that look on his face and the pipe in his mouth.
Big wet stain.
I think it was early in the week, really.
It was Thursday night.
His fingers were numb.
When I walked into a T-Base.
T-Base Hutch grabbed my trusty compound bow off the wall.
It was the weirdest thing.
I jacked two arrows into that man's chest.
And both arrows bounced off.
Well, that's the Teflon Don himself right there.
Everybody knows about Legume's breasts.
No, not Legume.
Oh, Dobbs.
Oh, Bob was.
Oh, Dobbs is already dead.
He was wearing a bulletproof vest.
So I jacked off a third round right into his head and it sunk right.
Right in.
So to speak.
Well, that's just another example of the alacrity and the lack of alacrity and the smegma.
I dumped the twang on the cable and...
Yeah, I noticed that he didn't stop smiling.
He had an arrow sticking out of his head the entire festival until he disappeared.
It didn't really affect him, yeah.
I saw somebody had hung him for a while.
Well, he did talk to you.
And then he disappeared, huh?
Really?
Yeah, I think Saturday night they hung him.
Someone told me.
No, but I mean Sunday before we left.
He was sitting in Ed Strange's camp one minute.
And the next minute he was about the time you and Legume left.
He was gone.
No, that's right.
He was over at Ed's.
By his own intestines.
And the arrow was gone, I think.
The hanging bias.
Someone had removed the arrow from his head.
The arrow was left in your camp.
Yeah, probably.
That's why I figured you had taken him.
Not at all.
See, they don't even take them as holy artifacts anymore.
I have a feeling he'll show up again.
Oh, yeah.
Bob will return.
Well, last year after X-Day, he was on TV.
He was on the top of my hutch.
He was actually circling around up there, waving to skybound things.
He was hiding up there for a while.
He couldn't deal with things.
And then they changed his heart.
He had a heart transplant or something.
He did mushrooms or something that year, didn't he, last year?
That was the year they...
And that's when he panicked and stayed up there.
And he wouldn't come down.
It took 45 minutes to get the sucker down.
And I guess he had sold his nostril shirt.
Everyone thought he was dead, so they did a heart transplant on him.
Or some kind of organ transplant.
Well, they wanted to put some weird organ.
They had to...
Inside of him.
That he struggled a lot under.
But this year, he was much more laid back.
Everybody was.
Soprifics will do that.
I think everybody had fun.
A Hursute Messiah like Bob.
Sometime or another.
They are chattering like magpies on the internet about what fun they had.
It was...
It just...
In fact, several of them didn't sleep until just today.
Well, magpies rarely rest.
They just nest for a while and...
And...
And...
And...
And...
And...











And...
And...
I've been up for 41 hours.
All right.
And time sleep.
I can't feel my legs either.
Can I feel your legs?
Howdy.
Howdy.
Pretend like you're in Kentucky.
Howdy.
Howdy.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Reference.
doctor of squire I be, I fight against the conspiracy. With the conduits, cheats, and
lies, their nature cannot be disguised. If pink it be, then pink it dies. Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Now I thought I'd start out here, now this isn't very long, but I thought I'd start out
here with a caution that appears at the very beginning of the book of the subgenus. So
we, the subgenus of the post-human race, in order to preserve life on this planet from
imminent destruction, reestablish intelligence, regain slack, cast out the false prophets,
smother forever the fear of fear itself, receive the questionable gifts of the before life
and the space dwellers, become as overmen, unmatch the conspiracy, grip the reins of
human evolution, control reproduction and mutation, decipher the code, and destroy the
dark, placate the stark fist of removal, achieve time control, see that which must
come to pass, become as gods, find the twins with the scissors of sight, avert the rupture
of the equilibrium, and secure the financial blessings of Jehovah One, the God of wrath
for ourselves and our descendants, to hereby admit ourselves as such and thus ordain this
advertisement of the subgenus race of earth. The world ends tomorrow, and you may die!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!

Oh, what time is it?
There he is.
Good morning, Stank.
Good morning, sunshine.

It's 7 a.m.
Yeah, seconds remaining.

Oh, really? One second?

Woo!

Fuck you, Bob!
I told you this was gonna happen.
Well, I didn't tell you this was gonna happen.
Where have all the subgeniuses gone?
Long time passing.
Long time passing.

Gone to Brushwood, everyone.
Subgeniuses gone, long time ago.
When will they ever learn?
When will they ...
... ever learn?
Listen to me, you didn't get off enough last night!
You can't get off the planet.
Until you get off!
Until you get off!
Could this all just be some stupid joke?
Bobby, you missed the whole point!
Every year I see you standing there, looking up in the sky, waiting for the pleasure saucers and the sex gods to come down and take you away!
It's a f***ing analogy, you dumb mother f***er!
Every year you're waiting for the sex gods to come and take you away, you don't get it!
You are the sex gods!
Now start having more sex!
I, Bob Dobs, command it!
You're waiting for a spaceship with all your fantasies on it to come and take you away?
Yes!
If they had that, you think they'd want to pick your sorry ass up and take you in?
You gotta build your own spaceship!
We're once again, we're here, we're Bob, we're Bob!
Well, I can't imagine either.
That's gonna be a real problem when it comes to getting off here next year.
Yeah.
Cause I guess next year they say it's really gonna happen.
Oh really?
X-Day sex.
Yep.
X.
I was in a Woody Guthrie mood, that's why I brought this, you know, I was thinking about singing songs about X-Day.
I wish you would!
I wandered alone to X-Day
A pound of cheese in my hair
Stranded alone in Brushwood
With Jesus fornicating a deer
Oh shit, I mean
Oh, X-Day
Oh, X-Day
My friends got loaded and left me alone
Standing in the rain
They told my money and they took all my drugs
And shoved it in down in the rain
Oh, X-Day
Oh, shit, fuck it.
Excuse me.
Oh, man, I'm not supposed to say that yet, am I?
Well, it just causes a lot of extra work for me later on.
But that's okay, that's all right!
That's okay, it caused some...
So do you feel that your, your explungement was a success this month?
Oh, well, aside from not getting to destroy it, I think it was a success.
I mean, I didn't destroy the Earth and live forever for 30 bucks, it was great.
It was a really good deal aside from that.
I had a great X-Day.
I suppose that's kind of a disappointment, you know, if you really had your heart set on blowing 30 bucks
and getting not only eternal salvation and immortality, but, you know, the sex goddesses and so forth
and watching this place just be blown to smithereens, which was my favorite thing.
Well, we missed that this time, but you know, I mean, it may be better Bob's people than Heaven's Gate.
You know, it could have been worse.
We could have all killed ourselves for nothing, but as it is, we killed ourselves for something great,
something noble, something new in the world!
We killed our brain cells, each and every one, up until that very last one,
the one we left in Dave's head, heard now in the background.
Not, not much of a brain cell.
But, you know, that wasn't much of a brain to begin with.
Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob?
Well, first the good news. There will be an X-Day 6.
Yeah!
The bad news, of course, is that I'm standing here having to tell you the good news.
And those who've managed to peel themselves up out of bed at 7 o'clock, like I did, well, I feel stupid too.
And the Bob dummy is over there at Tranquility Base with an arrow through its head already.
And I think, now, don't hurt it too much.
Because we're going to hang it from a tree forever.
And every year that the X's don't get here, we'll go to the Tranquility Base sacred spot
and see how far the Bob dummy has rotted.
Bastard.
I still love Bob. I have absolute faith that every word Bob could say was true,
because, I mean, a holy man wouldn't lie or fuck up, would he?
Oh, yeah.
And, and, and, well, for those of you who weren't here at 7 o'clock this morning,
it was, I was almost, we were almost late.
The countdown consisted of a one.
And followed by the usual anticlimax, where everybody stares at me as if I was Bob.
And, uh, we, we, why didn't we get our saucers, man?
Here I am still trying to make, trying to make the best of the situation.
But I really feel like crying.
I wanted to, you know, be able to commit mass murder,
and have my own planet for 30 bucks.
Who wouldn't?
You know, you'd have to be crazy not to want that.
But, eh, oh well.
As I told them this morning,
I've got one thing to say, to quote the great Rudy Ray Moore,
I've got one thing to say, and it won't take long,
but Bob Dobbs done been here, took a good shit, and gone.
Cause I got no expectations
to ever pass.
And this is the way it ought to be.
Once I was a rich man,
now I am so poor.
Never in my weary life have I felt
like this before.
Your leather's like a diamond,
your passing words a swan,
and as I see you,
leaving me,
I cry.
I cry.
Oh, I cry.
I cry.
Don't they take me?
I cry.
Don't they hold me under that plane?
Cause I got no expectations
to ever pass.
This way again.
One, two, one, two, three, four.
I cry.
I cry.
I cry.
Don't they take me
to the entrance
to sell me
all the plays
Cause I got no expectations
Every day you're a part of me
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
When you're just a slice of diamond
You pass your words to swine
And as I see you
You're crying
I'm just a poor man
When I'm just a slave
To the echo of your love
When I'm just a slave
I'm just a slave
To the echo of your love
When I'm just a slave
To the echo of your love
You better
Cause I got a slippery sensation
And I'm about to fall
Oh baby, baby I want you
I'm gonna turn into hell
Gonna burn away
Cause I got a slippery sensation
And I'm about to fall again
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh and by the way, Dr. Catan Lagube on barmonica solo there.
But what the hell, the good news is we still get to party down here.
I don't know about you, but despite the turmoil,
and the human ant bed, I've been getting more slack.
So much so that just me personally,
I don't mind waiting another year.
Of course, knock on wood.
You know, though, everybody has different ideas about
how come Bob didn't show up in Texas and all that stuff.
And I think the most logical one, of course,
is that it's simply not July 5th, 1998 yet.
And Bob said the saucers were gonna arrive at 7am July 5th, 1998.
That obviously hasn't happened yet.
They've been screwing with the dates for a long time.
But there was a peculiar theory,
it's just something to think about,
the theory of the piecemeal rupture.
That it started at July 5th, 1998, just as scheduled,
and we're all being ruptured, but it's like one organ at a time.
And for you young people don't notice,
because they're just taking a break.
And eyelashes here, eyebrow hair there,
colon bacteria and so forth.
It builds up though.
You know, enough X-days.
P. Kitty's insulin productivity was ruptured on X-day 98.
And my sense of balance was ruptured at the same time.
On X-day, Pastor Craig's collarbone
has been ruptured from this day.
And on this very place,
Lake Hume's Mercy was taken and ruptured,
as well as the regularity of his heartbeat.
The kidney stone filters of a number of male subgeniuses have been ruptured.
Princess Wee's memory was taken by the aliens.
The innocence of Papa Joe Mama,
the squarest, most conservative subgenius,
his innocence was ruptured.
Uh,

Ragnar's couth was taken.
Tom was a very couth-filled person.
And now he's like the rest of us,
has become completely uncouth.
Jesus' money!
The money!
Jesus!
Jesus had plenty of money!
But, you know what happened?
There's been times when he's had to get conspiracy work.
And friends, I'll tell you why Modemak ain't here.
Modemak's virginity itself was ruptured.
From this place.
That's why he didn't need to come back.
He was already getting something.
I don't want to hang around with those nerds.
So friends, we will!
I know that sooner or later,
even if he has to take, you know,
well, brain cells, let's not even go into that.
But, and certain recent memories, that kind of thing.
Nege gets a lot of that stuff.
But, friends, you know, we all know,
or we wouldn't still be standing here unless we were clasped.
Idiots!
I mean, it's Church of the...
Wait a minute.
Oh, I just sunk in.
You didn't call it Church of the Genius, did you?
No.
No wonder those news guys were laughing at us.
Anyway, friends, we will get our missing parts back.
We will get our dead rock stars back!
John Entwistle will ride the magic bus again, my friend!
Keith Moon shall rise again!
I see a Keith Moon arising!
Jimi Hendrix will play lead guitar in the Exosauces,
and Lenny Bruce will warm up the crowd!
Janis will be there!
Jim will sing!
John will sing again!
Kirk will sing!
Bradley!
Bradley Noel, the subgenius rock star, will sing again!
And, praise God, Frank Zappa will lead the orchestra!
That's right, here we come!
Kelly Sands!
The Follis will act again!
Boris Karloff and Vincent Price will make movies again!
Bela Lugosi will be shooting up backstage!
Alfred Hitchcock will do the next Hannibal Lecter movie!
And Willis O'Brien will animate the remake of King Kong
using the most unimaginable, Rome-based computer animation!
Friends, the world will end not with a bang,
mayhaps it might indeed end with a whimper,
but let's make it not a whimper of misery,
but a whimper of sex hurt!
Prolong the sex hurt!
Bob escaped from hell, my friends!
You know, I saw Bob Dock shot and killed in 1984,
but he dug his way out with that entrenching duel!
He fucked the devil's wife and got kicked out of hell!
He beat the devil at card games!
He tricked his wife!
The devil hated Bob's luck!
And Bob escaped from hell, my friends!
And we shall too!
Sooner or later, we just gotta follow Bob
where we can find that tunnel or entrenching tool
or that pipe or whatever.
In the meantime, let it continue.
Us versus them.
Because where else would we get the energy to do all this nutty stuff
if it weren't for them trying to tell us not to, you know?
Seriously!
I mean, would we go to the movies?
I mean, we'd probably just be...
In fact, let's do that.
Just go sit around and prop and listen to good music or something.
But, you know, there is a certain amount of fun
in the eternal conflict of monkey versus robot,
subgenius versus pink boy,
Morlock versus Eloy,
Devo versus blockheads,
Quar versus bohabs,
magic folk versus muggles,
and Bob versus Connie, for that matter.
You know, the divine battle must go on.
Somebody's gonna get fucked,
and there's no reason we can't start doing the fucking ourselves.
Friends, somewhere out there,
smoking and driving and selling,
the salesman of slack
awaits you and what's in your wallet.
Does your wallet belong to me?
Bob, my friends?
Or does your wristwatch belong to the conspiracy?
The conspiracy!
Are you wearing that chain around your wrist?
Are you wearing that necktie,
that symbol of evil worn by the humales?
Well, friend,
you need slack.
And slack is right around the corner
for those who can whiff it out,
who know slack when they see it.
Friends, that's all it takes,
just to know it,
just to know that whiff
when you get that chance.
I smell slack!
I smell slack!
I'm quitting my job!
I'm run...
That's the idea, friends!
Get ready, get set, and quit that job!
I just left work on now,
so I'm on my period.
The worst thing that can possibly happen, my friend,
is you'll get a better job.
So repent!
Quit your job and whack...
I mean, slack off, friends.
Join the wankers for Bob.
Wank it, friends!
Wank it with all your might!
I was thinking of Bob Dobbs
at the moment I was gesticulating with my articulator.
At the moment of that frozen orgasm,
I saw that smiling face
and the culture in the menses of the mind itself
exploding in me.
My brain!
I am one with Dobbs now,
in a way that very few of you two-legged dogs
would do to hardly understand.
I'm leaving soon.
Or have I already gone?
Have I...?
The weirdest fucking scene I've seen
at a subgenius thing
in a long time happened here on the stage
after Pisces...
It built up from Pisces' reign.
Yeah.
She got the young, bold surrealists all fired up.
I wandered back here and found this spectacle
of Pisces, like, plastered up against this Dobbs head
and these guys writhing around at her feet.
And it was, like, really cultish.
Jack Chick should have been there to draw it, you know?
And it evolved into this...
Okay, those Cosmodeor and those other guys
were doing this weird shit music up here.
It was very, you know,
just designed to make you flip out if you're on acid.
And this just fucked-up ballet morality play
developed with Zorro and Reverend Alex and Princess Wee
up here, to that music that was definitely...
A lot of y'all saw that.
That was one of the most disturbing
and fucked-up things I've ever seen.
And, friends, I've been to Mardi Gras.
I've been to Burning Man.
I've been to Bracing Those Bulls in Pamplona.
I've seen the Eiffel Tower and a Jimi Hendrix concert.
And I never saw anything like that
fucked-up shit last night.
Praise Bob.
The subgeniuses still have it.
The bold surrealists.
The spirit of bold surrealism lives
in the young subgeniuses.
Reverend Alex Thompson!
Even pinks,
even the pinkest, pinkest pinks
know that they're not the only ones
that know that subgenie are better than they are.
And the reason for this,
even though these pinks continue to dominate us,
they make that decision,
nominate or submit,
and they'll make, they dominate.
Even these pinks know that we subgenie
are better than they are
because subgeniuses exude a moist, emotional vibe.
That's right, a vibe, my friends,
which acts upon not only slack,
the love plane, karma,
those other metaphysical energies,
and etheric, magical properties.
Yes, our, our, our powers
are deep in here in the mental life.
And friends, this is the power called
orgasmatic radiation.
That's right.
This same power, you will note,
is released when a subgenius is engaged
in what is known in human colloquialisms
as deviant sex.
Yes, yes, yes, my friends.
But you see, deviant sex,
it goes so much further in this church
because deviant sex includes
that most deviant of all activities,
which is true Yeti love.
That's right, true Yeti love.
We in this church know about true Yeti hate
because we had Janer.
We in this church know about true Yeti hate
because we had Sternadoc's caregiver.
We in this church know about true Yeti hate
because we had Father, Papa, Joe, Mama.
But, my friends, we don't know enough
about true Yeti love.
Sub-love is in its purest state upon arrival
because it is inherently slack.
Well, that is correct, my friends.
Slack is love.
Praise love!
Yes, praise love.
And this slack, this true Yeti love,
can be extended towards a subgenius
from her Yeti mate to his Yeti mate
no matter the distance, my friends.
No matter the distance between them.
You could be in Timbuktu,
your Yeti mate could be in Montreal,
and they will still know that you love them
and will for all eternity.
And this thing is mystical.
It is telepathic.
It is subgenius love.
And we need more of it
because, my friends, what the world needs now,
well, what the world needs now is to,
you know, come to man.
But what Planet X needs now
is lots of trillions of billions of zillions of subgeniuses
to extend their tentacles,
their squamous membranous mental lives
all over each other in perpetual rescort
and feel the power of love.
Feel the power of slack.
Feel the power of compassion
and desire.
And the ability to feel that,
my friends, comes from you.
Thank you.
Amen!
YAY!
