The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he didn't exist.
And like that, he's gone.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill.
The story ends.
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill.
You stay in Wonderland.
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slang.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
Make way.
Quoted.
I created light and created darkness, created goodness and created evil.
I, the Lord God, do all these things.
God is the source of evil and he admits it.
What's the burr under your saddle?
Sweet mother of God, what is the holdup?
I think we're at a cool. We can go.
We can go.
We can go.
We can go.
We can go.






We can go.
We can go.


We can go.










What the hell do you think you're doing?
Dragging your butt through the day?
Selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex.
There is a simple answer dear friend.
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.
It's JR Broadcast.
J R Broadcast.
Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in his church of the subgenius.
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.
For Bob comes to justify our sins, to unmask the conspiracy, and to get us back the slack they stole away.
It's us versus them.
Are you going to fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?
Repent. Quit your job.
Slack off and praise Bob.
Church of the subgenius eternal salvation will triple your money back.
Man, you are one pathetic loser.
There's a lot of triple tonguing in this arrangement.
Oh, I think I'll manage, thank you.
Are you digging this character? He's gonna manage.
So your boots are laced, Junior. We'll all read, all read, all read.

You're sick.
Yeah.
Going newly.
Higher, faster, farther, longer.
All right, one note.
I love it, man.
It's the greatest.
I'm in yellow tomorrow.
A frenzy of music and action.
Won't.
Reality is a sad new face.
And, uh, we're gonna be in the music at the floor.
As I said to him, to him, to him.
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
The gals have laughed and have followed me when I left their dressing room, but, uh,
I said, I imagine they were expecting somebody rather groovy looking, and, uh,
well, there you go, disappointed.
Anyway.
Oh, anyway, anyway, anyway.
Dear friends, that was a collage.
By Electric Elf.
Yes, Electric Elf.
And we'll be hearing more from Electric Elf.
Before that, some of the subgenius MTV soundtrack by me and Mark Mothersbaugh.
And the music in the background is the Swingin' Love Corpses, friends,
from the brand-newly-released Infamous Bay Dat Sessions.
So nice to have that.
And, uh, and friends, it's, uh,
it's been a rough, uh, few weeks of slack, you might say.
This, we're nearing now the Christmas Eve of destruction,
and I'm late, my friends, I'm late.
I actually fell behind a whole week's worth of hour of slack.
That's the first time that's happened in 14 years
due to, uh, an illness among loved ones,
which is all better now.
But, uh, but we're back.
We're back in Cleveland.
And, uh, trying to, uh, to catch up.
And, uh, luckily there were some great war-related songs posted to all Binary Slack,
uh, by, uh, Popes Lilith and various other folks as well.
And, uh, uh, and there's a new James Kochalka Superstar album out, my dear, dear friends.
And, uh, I got to, to pulling stuff off of a Burning Man collection that,
of just all kinds of music that Gustav Salas,
gave to us.
There's, uh, KPFA, uh, old new, old KPFA that sounds just like it's new,
with Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell,
and of course, uh, some ESO.
But first, but first, my friends,
James Kochalka Superstar with this, uh, song from the album of the same name,
Don't Trust Whitey.

They took the whole eastern nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
Brotherhood and the culture knife
Took away our native tongue
And told the English to hurry on
And all the things we made by hand
Are now a taste made in Japan
Eastern people
Eastern tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die
They took the whole eastern nation
Lotus in this reservation
Blood on we were blue shirts and tie
They took the whole eastern nation


We're still the red men deep inside
Although they changed our ways of hope
They'll never change our heart and soul
We're the red men deep inside


And on Sunday when the world has learned
Civilization will return

Our mayor has asked that we all remain calm in this emergency
Everything possible will be done to protect you
On orders from Washington
The Commander of Strategic Defense has alerted all branches of the service
This is not the usual flying saucer scare
This unidentified aircraft was seen by thousands of Americans

thousands as it flew through the Lincoln Tunnel.
If they're not careful, they're going to have an accident.
Anyone sighting a strange aircraft, phone your nearest branch of civilian air defense.
What are we going to do now?
We either go to Mars or get shot down.
So we'll go to Mars.
We'll go to Mars.
The road to the western lands is by definition the most dangerous road in the world.
For it is a journey beyond death, beyond the basic God standard of fear and danger.
It is the most heavily guarded road in the world, where it gives access to the gift that supersedes all other gifts.
Immortality.
The road to the western lands is devious, unpredictable.
Today's easy passage may be tomorrow's death trap.
The obvious road is almost always a fool's road.
And beware the middle road.
The roads of moderation, common sense and careful planning.
However,
there is a time for planning, moderation and common sense.

victims,
A dangerous road, every pitfall, every error, every snare to which every man has been liable since the beginning.
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.
The guilt and horror, fear, hate, disease, and death of human history
throws the green yield in the western lands.
How long does it take a man to learn that he does not and cannot want what he wants?
You have to be in hell to see heaven.
Eclipses and all the rest of it are in heaven.
The land of the dead.
Flashes of serene, timeless joy.
A joy as bold as suffering and despair.
Ooh la la, dear friends.
Reverend Bill Burroughs, William S. Burroughs there.
From a collection that I'm not sure what it is.
Before that, we heard some news from Abbott and Costello go to Mars.
I rented that because it has space princesses and space queens in it.
They actually go to Venus.
But at one point, Abbott and Costello sort of destroy the ghost of the World Trade Center.
And it's just amazing.
I would just say check SubSight or rent that movie.
It's very strange.
Before that, friends.
How about that Leibach version of the old Indian reservation?
They call it National Reservation.
Leibach.
It's strange indeed.

I got this two, the two flags that I can see from my window here are both a half-mass,

I'm kind of concerned.
I hope another president didn't get assassinated and then, you know, another assassin get assassinated
by the assassin's assassin.
Because, you know, I'm sick of that .
Um.
Uh.
Well, yeah, what happened?
Well, anyway.
By the way, you know what?
Did you ever, you know, did you ever notice that when you picked the skin off your feet,
even though, you know, I took a shower last night, but just, you know, just having my,
having worn the socks that I wore at Burning Man like 20 hours ago, you know, and my feet
were clean when I put them in.
And, uh, it's really, it's very sweet.
Do you ever notice that?
Do that, you know, put on the socks that you wore at Burning Man, even just for a few minutes,
and then peel the, um, the skin off your feet and eat it.
And, uh, it, it, it has a nice little, uh, sweet taste.

The truth is it was the NRA who pioneered and passed 13 funerals a day
Do I think that of course I do of course I do

You incite media bias and fuel the politics of hate
You never miss a chance to step before the cameras and play out the gun haters drama of distortion
defamation and downright lies
Eastern world it is exploding

bullets load
You're old enough to kill
But not for vote
You don't believe in war

But then the evil art dictators can
the art bombs have finally taken front
power in the far future and they object to the firing of the space gun.
They incite an unruly mob to come forward and smash the space gun, but it fires anyway,
shooting a young, comely pair of youths into space, male and female, seeding the cosmos.
They seeded Earth.
To the Indians for $24.
It was a mystery.
A mystery wrapped in an enigma.
Surrounded with creamy milk chocolate.
And velvety nougat.
And little rice crispy things.
They didn't actually have a name.
But they cost more than the inflated ones.
They had the stamp of approval.
The reason the Jews made a mistake with the man on the cross and the suffering serpent,
or the man that was suffering and bearing sickness in the 53rd of Isaiah,
their theology said you suffer because you sin.
It's carried over into Christianity to where people will say,
what those Jews did when they came to Jesus in the New Testament and said,
here's a man born blind.
Who sinned, him or his parents?
Jesus dismissed it cavalierly.
Neither, he said.
Neither.
But that the glory of God might be displayed in this moment to paraphrase the situation.
Christianity has abused Christians.
Christians.
Christianity has abused Christians.
As though when something wrong goes wrong,
or wronger,
it's because you sinned.
Oh, there will be those that will preach,
because of America's sin,
the judgment of God's on them.
Well, go to hell, you voices of the devil.
Well, go to hell, you voices of the devil.
Now, a wonderful message.
Will not be played on Christian networks.
But we have our own network.
24 hours a day.
Thank you.
Jesus, I beg of thee, don't take my life.
Return me to the womb from which I was torn.
Birth is a sin.
And the punishment...
The end of respite and the time...

And the punishment...
Is not perfect.
If you stop religion,
your rights are ruined.
Spare time with the sick.

It makes no sense.


The power of nature is abolished.

Charlton Heston in a rant by Electric Elf,

Now, where is that?
Dang it!
I put these things sitting out so that I can smoothly do a transition

Oh, hold on.

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see a red door and a hand door haven't blocked
Maybe I'll fade away, I'd have to face the facts
Man, it's not easy when your whole world's turning black
Fading black
I was black
If we look hard enough into the setting sun
These leaves will last for me before the morning
Fading black

I see them walking by, all dressed up in their clothes
I had to turn away until my goodness was
Fading black

Well, you know, some people like it, but you never can tell what will happen in the future.
For example?
For example, no one ever knew that spiders would colonize outer space.
Building webs in outer space.
NASA constructed a laboratory called Skylab in which experiments could be conducted in
zero gravity outside the Earth's atmosphere.
Sending spiders up in Skylab to see how they performed in conditions of weightlessness
was a prize-winning proposal from a high school student from Lexington, New York.


A student at the time, a graduate student, had been assigned to a class of science subjects

Because they had real Jesus on there.
So it was really spooky.
When the Apollo spacecraft with Skylab 2 and 3 astronauts was launched on July 28, 1973,
two spiders were aboard.
Of the genus Aramudus diadematos, together with two flies for their food.
A week after lift-off, spider number one was placed on a frame in a cage.
The next day, a new spider was born.



Spider number two was kept in a small tube until being released onto the frame four weeks after launch.
Seeing the spiders in space on TV was for me very exciting and worth all the years of waiting.
I saw something which no human eye had ever observed before.
Spider number two floated slowly in microgravity when introduced into the cage.
It touched the frame, bounced back and floated in the opposite direction.
Its legs were extended and hardly moved.
The spider silk which one could observe coming from the spinnerets at the end of the bulbous abdomen
wafted in wide waves through the air.
On Earth it would have been stretched tight by the spider's weight.
The spider obviously missed its usual clues.
It could no longer handle the situation in an appropriate way
and presumably waited for what would happen next.
But with perfect equanimity.
The experiment succeeded in showing that spiders can build orb webs in zero gravity.
And it is obvious that under long term conditions
spiders in a microgravity without gravitational constraints
can grow to an enormous size.
Becoming the fearsome giant spiders of legend and popular culture.
Once spiders are permanently introduced to space
in an increased oxygen atmosphere particularly
spider growth can achieve prodigies
never before
reached.

However there are
others
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic port
Aboard this tiny ship
The mate was a mighty sailing man
Skipper brave and sure
Five passengers set sail that day
For a three-hour tour
A three-hour tour
That makes me wonder
Now the ship's aground on the shore
Of this uncharted desert island
With Gilligan, the skipper too
A millionaire
And his wife
The movie star
Oh, and the rest
Well, they're here on Gilligan's Island
Here in the parajuan
On the ambrosia
In the espíritu
All that happens
is you and me


Woo,ullie
Boy, we got a loig
esterol
Man, we'll be right back
And my wife's the reason
He starts his trip


This is the gist is
And that tiny ship was tossed
Back for the courage of the grief
A little minute would be lost
And the ships are grinding on the shore
And the sun surely doesn't rise
And they're here on Gilligan's Island
And they're here on Gilligan's Island
In harmony
