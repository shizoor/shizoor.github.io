00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:10,780
Around Dodge City and in the Territory on West, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers, and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the spell of...

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,260
The Soul Genius Power of Splash!

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:44,260
I need to be saved by the church of the subgenius.

4
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,700
You do.

5
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,160
I need to be saved.

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,080
I do not know who will receive this message, but it is true.

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,560
Those of us who are so-called subgeniuses, you know, we can't figure everything out.

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,160
We're not the smartest people in the world, but we are not dumb and stupid like the pinks and normals,

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,120
you know, who have the capacity for comprehension.

11
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:23,680
We don't have any material knowledge, but look what they do with their ability to comprehend knowledge of materialism.

12
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:38,260
And the UFOs have been returning when crisis, you know, arrives, with me personally, you know, dealing with the established...

13
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,900
Welcome to Starwood.

14
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,920
10-4, will you bring her down here? Bring her down here or something?

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm going to get her.

16
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,240


17
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,360
Get her bags into her cabin.

18
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:48,980
Roger.

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:49,860
She's cute.

20
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:58,980
Ladies!

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,020
Ladies!

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,200
Ladies!

23
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,240
Ladies!

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,280
Ladies!

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,320
Ladies!

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,320
Ladies!

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,320


28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,020
Ladies!

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,160


30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,400
Ladies!

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,860
Ladies!

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,840
And everybody in between.

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:33,200
Many, many years ago, the Reverend Ivan Sang was blessed with the gospel of Bob.

34
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:43,820
And because the Reverend Ivan Sang was so dutiful in writing down this gospel, we today now have rules to ignore.

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,420
What?

36
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,140
We're going to make this a little bit more difficult.

37
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,140


38
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,140


39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:56,180
The Reverend Sang has been a huge influence on me and my life, which is why I am as internationally renowned as I am today.

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,840
Hey, Regis, why don't you boot up my band?

41
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,540
Thanks for coming out to Starwood, ladies and gentlemen.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,500
Thanks for enjoying all the phenomenal artists, preachers, and screechers.

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,240
Take it close.

44
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,400
Take it close.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,100
I got a brand new two-tone tattoo.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,600
I got it just for you.

47
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,180
Good Lord, he knows what I can do.

48
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,040
My brand new two-tone tattoo.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,100
I certainly hope the hairs do not hide away.

50
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,040
You, my two-tone tattoo to display.

51
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,720
But if they do, I'll show it to you anyway.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,160
My brand new two-tone.

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,780
Fine, tattoo Baradado.

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
forming my own.

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:59,160
I claim the title of the new one Acho.

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,700
Friends, fellow Bob's Heads

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,900
We brought the Reverend Sang to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

58
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,360
On February 15, 1995

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,540
I was exactly 20 years old

60
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,740
It was the middle of winter

61
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,340
It was the biggest show I'd ever done in my life

62
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,180
300 people joined us to praise Bob and then kill him

63
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,840
So I did what any red-blooded American girl would do

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,940
I shaved my head

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,500
And I ran around bald until the bushes were elected out

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,780
On tattoo

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,920
Je l'avais fait spécialement pour vous

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,140
Le bon Dieu sait que

69
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,840
Je vous traînerai avec mes grands

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,900
Grands tattoos

71
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,320
Je serai les universe hideaway

72

Les humains grands tattoos

73
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,280
Le slave of the faith

74
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,840
Just show it to you anyway

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,200
Mes grands tattoos

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,160

Thank you so much

86
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,620
I'm going to turn this mic over to the one you should really be applauding

87
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,940
Without this man there would be no reason for any of you to be here

88
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,860
Give it up for the award winner!

89
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,000
The one and thankfully only

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,860
The most adorable and most delectable clergyman I have ever laid eyes on

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,280
The very reverend reverend

92
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,080
Ivan Stas!

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,280
Ya ya ya ya ya ya

94
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,680
Thank you Fat Mandy

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,620
Fat Mandy dear friends

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,640
Um if you ever get a chance

97
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,300
And you will if you ever go to like Burning Man or any place really cool

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,960
There you will find Fat Mandy

99
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,860
And um welcome to Squishwood 2 friends

100
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,700
The old timers here remember an even rainier Starwood

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,160
Which was nicknamed Squishwood

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,420
And uh it's too much

103
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,280
Matt you've seen it

104
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
You've seen my preaching coat isn't it nice

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm going to take it off now because it's too hot

106
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,780
To preach

107
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,480
Hey!

108
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,460
The first Starwood I was invited to in 1990

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,580
Which was the first one uh here at Brushwood

110
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,660
I uh me and the pagans didn't know how to take each other

111
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,040
They started yelling for me to strip and preach new

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
And I compromised

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,720
I took my paints off and preached in my drawers

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,800
Um you don't have to worry it's been done

115
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,640
Laughter

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:33,520
In 1990 I was invited to speak at a at a I guess you'd call it a neo pagan festival called Starwood

117
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,860
Uh that's held every year in New York

118
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,480
And I was so impressed by the campground that they held Starwood at

119
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,260
That I decided we should have a yearly subgenius uh practice for the end of the world

120
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,620
Where subgeniuses would gather at this little campground in in rural New York City

121
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,620


122
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,520
And this is way out in the country

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,220
Uh it and um

124
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,660
The reason we picked this campground is because you can get away with just about anything

125
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,160
It's clothing optional

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,540
We can make noise all night

127
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,880
They did outlaw us using explosives

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:12,900
Laughter

129
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,380
After numerous failed experiments with rockets

130
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,980
And other flying machines that we've done over the years

131
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,360
Uh

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,820
In in some ways it it it's kind of like a little tiny burning man

133
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,060
Festival because some we all get burned

134
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,740
Laughter

135
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,100
At at the end we wait for the aliens they don't show up and we all got burned

136
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,120
But we got had a good time

137
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,380
We earned our hangovers

138
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,860
Uh fair and square

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,740
I've been off planet until recently

140
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,260
Have you really can you change into your spaceship like this other dude

141
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,100
No this wasn't a I did

142
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,160
It was it we were really on this planet but might as well have been on another one

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,860
Oh so you can't drink your drugs in and get another car huh

144
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,360
Drugs

145
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,720
Well you're on another planet I mean how else would you get there

146
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,260
Well I've got interesting new experiences

147
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:15,780
In this particular case I was just reading a very interesting Larry McMurtry book instead of the watching the conspiracy news

148
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,080
And and we just returned from the Starwood Fair

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,500
And we're going to see the Starwood Fair

150
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,500


151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,500


152
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,040
It's kind of like uh

153
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,440
Uh going on a trip to another planet

154
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,420
Is that the one that Hippy Keith went to

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,520
Yes

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Did you go there

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,480
Well Hippy Keith is the Keith whose show follows this one

158
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,460
Uh yeah he ran lights he had a job there

159
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,640
So did I

160
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:37,900
Oh really

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,400
Yeah yeah I I worked there

162
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
Was it one

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm one of the cops there

164
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Really

165
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,660
Really

166
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes

167
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,120
I heard it was a big uh gay bash man I heard you guys were all banging each other

168
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,920
Oh that too

169
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,580
That that too

170
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:51,980
Oh

171
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,740
But if you don't I wouldn't limit you know it would be a mistake to limit it to to something like that you know

172
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,020
Hey

173
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Do we like pumping

174
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,780
Yeah we like pumping

175
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,280
Do we like pumping

176
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,640
Yeah we like pumping

177
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,040
Do we like pumping

178
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,260
Yeah we like pumping

179
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,840
Do we like pumping

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,040
Yeah we like pumping

181
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
We hope it doesn't rain

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
Or if it does rain friends

183
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,800
Let's pray this time for a rain of little living frogs and fishes

184
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,820
That would be something a story to take home and tell your friends

185
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,540
And plus we'd have breakfast you know

186
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,220
Uh it'd be an unusual breakfast

187
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,920
The um

188
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,340
Uh notice it stopped raining as soon as the subgenius stuff happened you know

189
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:51,100
It'd let you know you know you can you can worship all your false gods that you want but

190
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,680
You can notice you can pull strings with the weather gods

191
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,440
Um but

192
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,220
There's there's actually uh insights to be had with the rain along with the boredom and the filth

193
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,900
I was uh the first couple of days was raining really bad and I was up at Reginald's house and I was like

194
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,000
I was like I'm gonna go to the registration I actually work for for Ace sort of

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,040
And my job is to sit up there until something breaks

196
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,180
And I'm sitting there waiting for something to break

197
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,500
And um and I was sort of bored and I noticed

198
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,980
Two youngsters jogging by start naked in the rain

199
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,860
And I thought to myself now see that'd be

200
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,180
That's something you could do in the rain when everything else is shut down

201
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,560
And I thought I'd better wait until nightfall so as to not gross anybody out

202
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,240
But then my wife said no no no here's what you do just wait until somebody even older and flabbier

203
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,560
Jogs by and then falling behind them you'll look just like Dr. Manhattan by comparison

204
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,600
Uh I really feel more like Rorschach myself

205
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,320
So uh but while I was up there at registration waiting

206
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,560
I noticed two little boys I mean really little like a a one year old and maybe a

207
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
Or maybe one and a half year old and a

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,420
Three year old or something

209
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,320
Their parents were in line bored you know at that point we actually had a line

210
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,160
But the two little boys were rolling around in the gravel

211
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,220
They had found this kind of rocky gravel out there

212
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,940
And these two little boys were just rolling back and forth in the gravel

213
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,460
And they were ecstatic they had true slack

214
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,480
They were laughing their little tiny asses off

215
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,940
While their parents were paying $200

216
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,960
For permission to act like monkeys

217
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,860
And I was thinking you know if I weighed 150 pounds less

218
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,580
Rolling around on those rocks it would probably be just as slackful for me

219
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,580
And um but my friends and I we got to talking about it

220
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,560
And I got to I just became a grandfather recently

221
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
So I'm always looking at everybody's little kids

222
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,520
But thanks thanks

223
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,280
Um but uh I've noticed all the little kids around here

224
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,480
Have such a you know they're having fun

225
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,920
Just being little kids

226
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,500
They don't know any better

227
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,620
They haven't been taught but you know they have to spend money to have fun

228
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,140
And plus everything they do is the first time

229
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,260
And I think the joint conclusion we came to so to speak

230
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,220
Was that all kids are tripping balls

231
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,260
And uh they don't know how good they have been

232
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,020
Little kids don't know how good they have been

233
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,180
Sometimes I wish I could forget everything I've learned

234
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,340
And chances are that may very well happen

235
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,820
Dr. Well how come we're not tripping anymore?

236
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,560
I don't know baby

237
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,080
Dr. Oh that's right we got all of the carts turned off

238
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,800
What what what is it?

239
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,140
It's happening

240
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,740
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooo

241
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,080
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

242
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:17,720
Dr. There must be some um some pretty crazy groups at Starwood itself

243
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,960
I mean could you talk a little bit about what you could

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,620
Because you actually help arrange Starwood don't you I think?

245
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,540
Right yeah this um

246
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,360
Starwood is one of the biggest if not the biggest uh

247
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,740
Neo pagan and world music festivals on this side of the country

248
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,960
And uh

249
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,700
I was first invited there to speak

250
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,320
I thought they were laying a trap

251
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,620
Because I'd been making fun of those people

252
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,720
You know in my high weirdness by mail book

253
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,860
And I come from basically a pretty skeptical viewpoint

254
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,900
Aside from my faith in Bob

255
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,680
Uh it's hard to get me to believe in very much

256
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,440
Um

257
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,960
I don't know that I'll even

258
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,140
You'd have to pay me a lot of money to say that I believed in very much

259
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,700
But uh

260
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,640
Nonetheless at Starwood I was very surprised to find that um

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,600
About half of the people who fall into that neo pagan category

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,940
Really are not fundamentalists of any kind

263
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,840
And they dislike the pagan fundamentalists

264
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,660
Uh

265
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,060
So they really enjoy me

266
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,160
And the subgeniuses coming in and making fun and making mockery of everything they hold sacred

267
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Because a lot of them don't really hold anything all to themselves

268
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,480
And they don't really feel that sacred

269
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,580
Or even if they do

270
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,340
They can take a joke

271
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,900
In fact my experience has been

272
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,200
The stronger a person's faith is in something

273
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,820
The more they can laugh at it

274
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,800
They can take a joke

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,780
Because it doesn't threaten them

276
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,740
It's the ones who feel threatened by mockery

277
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,420
You have to wonder well

278
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,680
If your god or your guru is so powerful

279
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,200
Why are you worried about us making a few jokes

280
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,300
True

281
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,800
But eh

282
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,140
Seems like the longer your religion has been established

283
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,940
The more sensitive you become about it

284
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
Now at Starwood

286
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,760
You'll find all manner of people gathered together

287
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,600
There's a large contingent from the church of all worlds

288
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,340
Which um

289
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,040
I don't know if you're familiar with that

290
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,360
No

291
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,740
It's based loosely on a science fiction story by Robert Heinlein

292
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,500
Uh

293
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,480
Stranger in a strange land

294
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,520
Ah that's right I've heard Wilson

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:33,780
Yeah

296
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
Wilson talked about this guy

297
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,120
These guys a lot didn't they I think

298
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,760
Yeah yeah in in that novel

299
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,960
A human raised by Martians comes to earth

300
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,980
And starts a new religion called the church of all worlds

301
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,700
One of the main features of which is polyamory

302
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,600
Uh swinging

303
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,900
Swapping

304
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,200
And such like

305
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,400
And uh I happen to know the the uh

306
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,600
I guess you call him the head of the church of all worlds

307
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,220
Uh Oberon

308
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,180
Uh Gazelle

309
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,240
Who also sells books on how to be a wizard

310
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,780
And he's a he's a real nice guy

311
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,780
He can take a joke

312
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,360
And they've got quite a a large following

313
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,960
I uh at Starwood they have their own sort of baptism

314
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,620
Or baptism in the pool

315
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,940
But I've noticed

316
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,280
That when when those old hippies leave the pool

317
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,520
It's it's a lot dirtier than when the young subgeniuses leave the pool

318
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,760
There's a there's more of them though

319
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,980
I gotta hand them that

320
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,900
They're they're pretty crowded together in there

321
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,240
They got you in the numbers game

322
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,360
Cut

323
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,400
Scene

324
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,700
Choices always were a problem for you

325
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,000
What you need is someone strong to guide you

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,360
They've been finding gum and born to follow

327
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,940
Scene

328
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,960
What you need is someone strong to guide you

329
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,820
Like me

330
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Like me

331
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,000
Like me

332
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,380
Like me

333
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,620
Like me

334
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:13,920
Like me

335
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,200
Like me

336
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,700
You know this guy comes to my house

337
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,960
He's a Satanist from one of the Satanist churches here

338
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,760
Where they sacrifice babies

339
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,060
And melt those babies into candles

340
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,440
They're skinned

341
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,640
then that's supposed to give them more demonic power.

342
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,800
Demonic power.

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Demonic power.

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,580
I don't know why it is that all of you seem to have satanic souls.

345
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,100
Sweet dreams are made of these.

346
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,060
Who am I to disagree?

347
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,140
Travel the world and the felonies.

348
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,340
Everybody's looking for something.

349
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,560
Some of them want to be.

350
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,080
They don't believe I'm Christ, do they?

351
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,600
No.

352
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,780
They will when they make me into a carcass, though, won't they?

353
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,140
No.

354
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,320
To paraphrase God, let's shed some light on this, okay?

355
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,560
Don't ask me why, but I was walking down the streets of Fairfax, California,

356
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,740
and I saw this flyer hang on a telephone pole, and it said,

357
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,660
Can God fill teeth?

358
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,360
The music that they're planning to use to crumble the morals of America

359
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,780
is this rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd, lascivious junk called rock and roll.

360
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,960
It isn't just the lyrics, it's the beat.

361
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,320
It's the beat!

362
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,920
Jesus!

363
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,280
I hope sin did this to you.

364
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,480
My whole existence is flawed.

365
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,720
You got me closer.

366
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm getting caught.

367
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,740
How this beat gets them 400 teenage girls in Detroit interviewed

368
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,640
as to why they had illegitimate babies.

369
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,360
They said not just the words, the beat.

370
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,600
His tongue is the pin of a...

371
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,300
Ready, right.

372
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,340
So how's God going to talk to me in the latter days?

373
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,180
He's going to be a better man.

374
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,640
And who's going to bring that book?

375
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,520
I don't know.

376
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
So there'll be no excuses.

377
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,940
Who's behind it all?

378
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,420
Yes.

379
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,820
Well, this mysterious E.T. called Satan.

380
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,780
Satan.

381
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,720
Satan.

382
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,860
Satan.

383
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,880
Oh, now you want to fight.

384
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,620
And I'm going to fight.

385
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,580
To the sky.

386
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,240
Tell me something about religion.

387
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,620
Some of you are too naive.

388
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,420
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

389
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,300
You can't even follow him.

390
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,060
I don't know.

391
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,940
I got me some big plans.

392
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,600
We are real, we are real.

393
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,420
Deus does not exist.

394
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,240
Uh-oh, look out.

395
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,620
It's the oppressors.

396
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,200
You will be faithful.

397
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,120
Let your hands on the radio.

398
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,320
Let your hands on the radio band home.

399
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,260
Yes, friends, we're at Starwood.

400
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,920
It's great.

401
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,840
Earlier, we heard a collage, the God and Satan collage there.

402
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,900
It was by ReverendEric.com, also known as Signal to Noise.

403
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,200
Just amazing stuff there.

404
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,240
Our opening collage was by Lee Murr.

405
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,620
And now, back to the live sermon at Starwood.

406
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:06,660
Satan looks on with approval as the denizens of Starwood fall deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit of sin.

407
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,560
Following their temptations as far as they'll go.

408
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:23,340
And after we got the books and the DVDs and the CDs, then followed, of course, the lawsuits, the child custody cases, the mental illnesses, and prison terms and so forth.

409
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,680
Just like a real cult.

410
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,720
We thought we were, we actually, to tell the truth, there was a time when I didn't even believe Bob.

411
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,800
But his most outrageous utterances all came true.

412
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,220
And sometimes the truth comes out, in fact, it almost always comes out by accident.

413
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,640
We learned a new one just this very week.

414
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:51,020
Our friend A.J. Gooch saw somebody on television flub a line.

415
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,020
The person meant to say democracy, but it came out.

416
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,480
Mocracy.

417
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,680
And he thought, that's the church of the subgenius.

418
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:14,740
So, in short, this church, the one, as Robert Anton Wilson called it, the bet, the truest of all the one true religions, you can consider it a mock-racy.

419
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:26,180
Now somebody else here, I forget who, was joking with me about our silly little cult, which incidentally has about 40,000 members.

420
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,180


421
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,180


422
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,180


423
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,180


424
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,180


425
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,860
Believe it or not.

426
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,060
We don't know where most of them are anymore.

427
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,500
But anyway, this friend said, now Reverend Stang, be careful, don't become Bob's little bitch.

428
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,420
And I was like, boy, it's a little late for that, honey.

429
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,140
You know, I've been the bitch of Bob since the late 70s.

430
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,460
And I realized, bitch of Bob, B-O-B, there you go.

431
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,580
See, you can't escape.

432
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,180
If maybe eventually everybody will be Bob.

433
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,180


434
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,180


435
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,180


436
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,660
I'm not saying a B-O-B.

437
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,840
What a nightmare that would be.

438
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:11,520
You know, in fact, the goal of the church of the subgenius is actually to prevent everybody in the world from becoming a Caucasian, square,

439
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,940
brill-cream-haired, pipe-smoking salesman.

440
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,680
That's what happens if the conspiracy wins.

441
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,100
There only needs to be one Bob.

442
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,460
There have always been Bobs.

443
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,640
But that B-O-B, you just can't get away from it.

444
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,180
Even in fundamentalist politics.

445
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,320
In the paganry, you'll notice, just the way his name is spelled.

446
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,220
There's two B's, and then in between there's this Zen zero.

447
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,880
Nothingness.

448
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
It's in the center of Bob, you could say.

449
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,460
Nothingness between two B's.

450
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,260
Two blessed B's.

451
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,260
Yeah, I have to say that every time.

452
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,020
I can't remember when that happened.

453
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


454
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


455
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


456
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


457
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


458
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


459
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


460
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,020


461
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,860
The last guest we had on last week was a member of the OTO.

462
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,620
Did they show up at Starwood?

463
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,840
OTO?

464
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,380
Yeah.

465
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,600
No.

466
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,760
No, actually, yeah, yeah.

467
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,880
There are plenty of OTO members here and there at Starwood,

468
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,960
and there are workshops given by people.

469
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,440
But usually it's not a strictly OTO type thing.

470
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:34,160
I think you get more of that over in Europe and Great Britain than you do here.

471
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,400
The OTO people that I met in England were all cool.

472
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,860
But the ones that I've known in the U.S., mostly I generally avoid.

473
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,760
Oh, right.

474
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,460
And I don't know why that is.

475
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,660
But I really haven't had all that much.

476
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,000
I guess there's some crossover.

477
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:05,260
There are a lot of subgeniuses who are OTO rejects or else they rejected the OTO after a while.

478
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,180
I was going to say, I would have thought.

479
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,240
And they didn't.

480
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,580
They didn't get the guardian demon they were promised.

481
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,400
Oh, right.

482
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,580
Or else it backfired on them.

483
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:20,280
I would have thought Alistair Crowley would be quite a compatible person with subgenius.

484
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,400
Well, I think that Crowley and J.R. Bob Dobbs have a lot in common.

485
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,800
I think that both of them sit back and laugh at their followers.

486
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,100
I often wonder about L. Ron Hubbard as well.

487
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,380
Now, lately, speaking of L. Ron Hubbard,

488
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,900
there's been battles between Scientologists and subgeniuses on the Internet,

489
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,100
kind of cross-posted between the Scientology news group and alt.slack.

490
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,000
And those are kind of fun.

491
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,140
It's really fun to watch a cult versus cult fight.

492
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,540
You know, I mean, the Christians aren't, for the most part,

493
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,300
they,

494
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,760
they,

495
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,020
they kind of,

496
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,900
they're kind of Christian about it.

497
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,800
Yeah, they turn the other cheek.

498
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah, yeah, they turn the other cheek.

499
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,340
And for the most part,

500
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,980
they don't call for a jihad against all the unbelievers.

501
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,100
We have been trying to get them to for years.

502
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,140
We outright declared war on God,

503
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,900
on God itself,

504
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,360
just to see what would happen.

505
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,040
And, of course, death is still happening,

506
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,000
and taxes are still happening.

507
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,260
And so,

508
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,700
we're not doing very well in our war against God.

509
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,360
But we had hoped to rile people up,

510
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,380
but the most that ever happens is

511
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,380
occasionally a Christian who thought he or she had a sense of humor

512
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,180
and joined the church of the subgenius

513
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,820
resigns.

514
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,340
They decide that we're not that funny after all

515
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,780
when we start bad-mouthing the Lord.

516
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh, right.

517
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,180
Personally, I feel like

518
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,460
if you're gonna make fun of God,

519
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,260
you better be funny.

520
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,260
Hmm, yeah.

521
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
If you're pulling God's leg,

522
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,440
that's a pretty big leg to pull.

523
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,660
So, you know, it's in your best interest to...

524
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,460
you better be funny.

525
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,660
Yeah, God would have some good put-downs.

526
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,120
Well, God obviously has a sense of humor,

527
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,320
a really depraved and sick sense of humor,

528
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,000
whereby some individuals who work hard,

529
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,720
and are good people their whole lives,

530
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,440
die slowly of an awful disease

531
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,080
for no reason or something,

532
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,420
or are horribly murdered,

533
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,280
and other people who go around doing the horrible murdering

534
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,260
and stealing and so forth

535
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,340
end up dying fat and happy and never get caught.

536
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,300
So, in that respect, I mean,

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,780
anything, nothing that we subgeniuses could come up with

538
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,760
could ever be as bizarre

539
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,660
and sick and twisted

540
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,820
as things that really happen in the real world

541
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,840
without us having anything to do with it.

542
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,600
Yeah.

543
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,260
You know, it's...

544
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,140
The normals have managed to outstupid even the subgeniuses.

545
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,500
That's really sad, you know.

546
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,340
Yeah, that's...

547
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,340
I think you guys need to step your game up a bit by the sounds of it.

548
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Well, we're working at it, you know.

549
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,220
Uh...

550
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,960
I mean, we're pretty good at being stupid.

551
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,600
We're...

552
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
That's not really the point of the thing.

553
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,600
The point is that...

554
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,560
is that intelligence has been misdefined

555
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,880
throughout the centuries.

556
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,420
The conspiracy defines intelligence

557
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
in a way that we don't agree with.

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,420
Yeah.

559
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,160
Um...

560
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,760
You know, their idea of smart

561
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,400
doesn't necessarily get you a date.

562
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,920
A successful date.

563
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,660
It doesn't necessarily bring happiness.

564
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,760
And it doesn't bring you slack.

565
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,040
Uh...

566
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,240
An idiot with one good joke,

567
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,120
as the book of the subgenius says,

568
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,060
is doing more for the world than a million geniuses

569
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,320
inventing super weapons.

570
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,980
And we think we have found that idiot

571
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,380
with that one good joke.

572
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,700
Have you...

573
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,660
The global village idiot.

574
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,620
Ah, right.

575
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
Oh, dear.

576
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,180
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency...

577
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,760
Subgenius Power of Slack.

578
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,180
Hello.

579
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,580
This is me, Bernard,

580
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,760
and I hope that, you know,

581
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,140
Reverend Ivan Stang receives this message.

582
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,000
Because, you know, I...

583
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,060
You know, I kind of like Reverend Ivan Stang

584
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,740
because he's very much aware of what's going on.

585
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,240
And that, you know, the conspiracy of these pinks and normals,

586
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,200
you know, this false progress, you know, technology, is true.

587
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,640
And that we are not part of the same race and species

588
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,740
as so-called humans.

589
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,680
And that something has got to happen.

590
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,220
You know, the UFOs appearing in the sky.

591
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,620
The UFOs.

592
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,060
I want to stress that the UFOs are returning in the sky.

593
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,700
When, you know, the conspiracy representing the establishment

594
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,880
subject me to their ignorance and their...

595
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:35,040
expert use of those known voices in forests,

596
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,040


597
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,040


598
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,040


599
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,040


600
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,040


601
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,200
And they speak English too

602
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,560
How many galaxies?

603
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,440
A hundred billion

604
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,300
How many stars in E?

605
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
A hundred billion

606
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,460
So the chances of me finding you

607
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,640
Are less than one in a billion trillion

608
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,460
And I still don't wanna

609
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,000
Be your friend

610
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,440
You're far too self-obsessed for me to

611
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,800
Be your friend

612
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,420
You're selfish and repressed

613
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,260
Don't wanna be your friend

614
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,920
You're scheming and you hate

615
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Don't wanna be your friend

616
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,020
My folks are here to pick me up and

617
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,300
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

618
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,020
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

619
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,540
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

620
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,840
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

621
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,880
We're not how you imagine aliens, I guarantee

622
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,660
Though we'd rather be referred to as indigenous ETs

623
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,160
And frankly our immune system's a fine one up to scratch

624
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,680
It's insulting all these movies where you never meet your man

625
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,360
After ten thousand years

626
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,280
I stopped off at your site

627
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,540
I've been intelligent

628
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,700
Hyper and beyond

629
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,760
You're assuming that the universe is chock-a-block

630
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,720
With spacemen looking for you

631
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,220
Nobody wants to

632
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,580
Be your friend

633
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,880
You're really quite obnoxious though to

634
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,280
Be your friend

635
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,480
You'd really start my prospects I will

636
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
Be your friend

637
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,560
There's something about the universe

638
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,280
Well be your friend

639
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,460
We'll all be dead at 40 years

640
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,560
And we ain't

641
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,900
Coming all the way to meet you

642
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,020
We ain't

643
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,500
Coming all the way to meet you

644
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,560
We ain't

645
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,960
Coming all the way to meet you

646
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
We ain't

647
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,480
Coming all the way to meet you

648
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,400
Okay I'm going now, it's not been much fun

649
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,980
I've given you a tune up, press this and you're done

650
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,460
I hope I'm never back so please take a hint

651
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,020
At least until you've all made yourselves extinct

652
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,500
Just stop your signals and your radio breaks

653
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,520
It's just annoying and a little cliché

654
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,500
Don't be so needy it just doesn't appeal

655
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,160
All the ghosts up here in the sky were with you

656
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,180
We don't wanna

657
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,740
Be your friend

658
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,220
You're just a little backward we will

659
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,380
Be your friend

660
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,640
There's nothing in it for us to

661
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,020
Be your friend

662
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,280
Especially in your own way we will

663
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,440
Be your friend

664
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,820
We've got our friends to think about and

665
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,540
We ain't doing all our ways and we're not doing it right

666
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,560
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

667
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,080
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

668
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,720
We ain't coming all the way to meet you

669
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,040
Be your friend by The Atterie Squash

670
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,060
You can check them out at MySpace.com slash theatteriesquash

671
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,780
Battery Squash, Reverend Diva Schematic on vocals there.

672
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,340
And all the other recordings, pretty much, in this episode of Hour of Slack,

673
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:55,880
number 1,226, are either from or about the Starwood Festival of 2009.

674
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,660
The radio phone interview, however, is from Right Where You Are Sitting Now,

675
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,300
episode 29 of the British podcast,

676
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,440
which you can hear lots more of at sittingnow.co.uk.

677
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:19,700
Oh, and the one radio clip was from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

678
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,540
Pretty much all the other recordings are location recordings made at Starwood

679
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,800
by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

680
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,440
except that one collage about God and Satan, which came from Signal to Noise.

681
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,420
And the title collage is by Lee Murr.

682
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,280
Thank you.

683
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,280


684
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,720
Now, back to Starwood.

685
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,860
Anyway, friends, this is my 20...

686
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,820
No, this is the 29th Starwood.

687
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,720
It's my 19th Starwood.

688
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,080
And unless you folks...

689
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,220
You know, we've had kind of a low turnout because of weather and the economic cataclysm

690
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,780
and Satan and Jesus and all the powerful monsters.

691
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,260
And if you want to have another Starwood that has...

692
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,180
If you want to have another Starwood that has as many acts and workshops as this one,

693
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,780
go to the Ace sales table and buy those wonderful occult books.

694
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,480
You don't have to...

695
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,700
Actually, you might as well believe everything in it.

696
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,840
That's the solution.

697
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,780
But always the lark's voice will whisper my name.

698
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,820
Come to the water and dance with me.

699
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,680
And always I'll go and deliver the same.

700
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:51,160
And always I'll go and deliver the same.

701
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:20,140
And always I'll go and deliver the same.

702
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,940
So over the years, we regularly brought in Robert Anton Wilson.

703
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,640
I got to meet Robert Shea at one of those events.

704
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,360
Shea and Wilson together, in fact.

705
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,780
They brought Wilson and Timothy Leary together a few times.

706
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,040
And I got to edit a sort of a debate or discussion between those two.

707
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,480
Terrence McKenna used to come to Starwood.

708
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
We had the painter...

709
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,340
We tried to get the painter Alex Gray this year,

710
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,380
but it turned out that he was too expensive.

711
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:07,100
But he did send some wonderful sort of copies of his big paintings

712
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,140
that were displayed in a giant dome,

713
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,560
and they were lit up with special digital effects.

714
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,720
It's hard to describe.

715
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,620
He started a church of the sacred mirrors,

716
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,080
is what it's called.

717
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,520
Church of the Sacred Mirror.

718
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,380
And I have not really looked into it that much,

719
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,280
but it seems to be centered around psychedelic artwork.

720
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,040
Specifically, the psychedelic medical illustration type artwork of Alex Gray.

721
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,120
And that makes sense to me.

722
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,420
It's like, well, yeah, if you're going to bust your ass doing paintings like that,

723
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,100
why not turn it into a cult?

724
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,500
And charge a lot to speak.

725
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,300
But...

726
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,060
And avoid taxes, if possible.

727
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,200
Yeah.

728
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,040
I might.

729
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,860
I don't know.

730
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,020
Now, almost every Starwood,

731
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I get half of my material from the mighty Starwood tour guide.

732
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,500
Because the names and concepts of the classes are often inadvertently hilarious.

733
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,740
And I don't mean to put any of them down,

734
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,660
but this particular year,

735
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,120
I had to come up with more of my own crap,

736
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,360
because the workshop names weren't as funny,

737
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
but I did find a few.

738
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,340
On Thursday, no, Tuesday night,

739
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,580
there was Party Like a Rockstar,

740
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,940
which was fun,

741
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,560
but it was false advertising,

742
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:46,500
because I didn't see Elvis, or Jimmy, or Janice, or Jim, or John, or Michael.

743
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,640
But...

744
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,600
But...

745
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:49,720
But...

746
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


747
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


748
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


749
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


750
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


751
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


752
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


753
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


754
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


755
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,720


756
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,000
But Jackson was here.

757
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,860
Right where you are sitting now,

758
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,200
two weeks ago,

759
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,820
at X-Day,

760
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,420
the Subgenius Festival,

761
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,520
which is not quite as well attended,

762
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,500
but has obviously bigger celebrities.

763
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,440
And that happened two or three,

764
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,460
at least a week after he was supposed to be dead.

765
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,740
So you see the power of Bob.

766
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,440
I like this,

767
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,400
that Phil Farber had a class called

768
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,080
ID Your Inner Pantheon.

769
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,900
I thought, man, that's...

770
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,520
Ask him.

771
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:19,720
I'm not sure if he's a fan of the show,

772
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:19,720


773
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,040
But it is a great title.

774
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,060
Elspeth had a great title.

775
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,200
I don't know what I want, but I know this isn't it.

776
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,340
I do know what I want, and this is it.

777
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,460
Thank you, thank you.

778
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,940
Somebody was doing one called Science Spirituality,

779
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,920
and I hope that's not an oxymoron.

780
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,260
At the same time, there was one called Pagan Myth Busters.

781
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,700
Spoilers, spoilers.

782
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,500
Oh, yeah.

783
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,380
The same person did,

784
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,540
Now we know we're God.

785
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,380
Now that we know we're God, what should we do?

786
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,400
Why cast Satan and his imps into the bottomless pit?

787
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:07,860
Duh!

788
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,300
Didn't you read your...

789
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,640
Whatever that book was?

790
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,080
That one we burn every X-Day?

791
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,780
Religion Without Faith.

792
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,680
That's this sermon.

793
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,140
Tantra for Beginners.

794
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,360
Uh-huh, yeah.

795
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,020
I get it.

796
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,160
Uh-huh.

797
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,980
Experience Oneness, Blessing, Brewing, Beer, Wine, and Wine.

798
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,660
Oh, that's two different classes.

799
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,140
I thought I'd naturally assume it was the same thing.

800
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,180
Oh, and here's one that caught my eye.

801
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,020
High Fairy Tea and Hot Luck.

802
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,240
High Fairy Tea and Hot Luck.

803
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:54,800
Yeah.

804
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,540
And this also caught my eye.

805
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,640
Wet Felching Magic.

806
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,900
Oh, I'm sorry, that's Wet Felting Magic.

807
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,640
I've got a one-track mind, friends.

808
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,300
And I think, yeah, that was about passion.

809
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:17,580
Now, tomorrow or Saturday, Passions of the Pot-Smoking Patriots,

810
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,280
which sounds like a fire song.

811
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,020
I'm not sure if that's on the theater now.

812
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,460
Harvey Baughson is doing that.

813
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,780
I want to see.

814
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,820
I always miss his because they're always on at the same time as my stuff.

815
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,300
Anyway, praise Ace, praise Starwood, praise everybody who puts on these workshops.

816
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,020
I'm sure they're all great for somebody.

817
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,900
I really enjoy waking up in the cabin back there,

818
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,460
and there's always one of those Tantra X-ers workshops happening right outside our little cabin.

819
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,960
Those are fun to watch when you first wake up.

820
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,160
That's a good point.

821
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,860
We all watch sports every now and then.

822
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,180
That gives me the feeling that I've got to make up my targ sandy back.

823
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,540
No, this is great local.

824
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:10,560
This is realizing that I have this thing that I can't be off often and maybe the area isn't so bad for me.

825
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,000
Hey, you want to know a really cool thing about Bob?

826
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
He never sleeps.

827
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,820
Phone light, always on.

828
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,260
Always with you.

829
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,660
Broadband, always on.

830
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,420
Wireless access throughout your whole house, always on.

831
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,780
Come on, suck it up.

832
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,220
Come on, suck it up.

833
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:49,240
Come on, suck it up.

834
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,860
From kindergarten through 12th grade.

835
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,860
You're stupid.

836
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,300
I know that feeling.

837
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,500
Hello, this is me.

838
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,060
I want to state it straight and clear.

839
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,660
This is me, card-carrying member.

840
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,360
Well, except I lost my membership card in 2002.

841
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,080
2002.

842
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,740
It's not the 1900s anymore.

843
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,760
You know, you know what I'm saying?

844
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,300
It's the end time.

845
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,740
And then I just want to say

846
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,800
that these pinks, you know, what you call the pinks,

847
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,160
they're going to get their ass kicked.

848
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,080
They put their hands on one of us.

849
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,760
They want to put us in jail.

850
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,980
They want to put us in prison.

851
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,520
But they're going to get their ass kicked

852
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,980
for screwing around with us

853
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
because we're not part of the human race.

854
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,280
The human race is a species

855
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,600
that's doomed to die,

856
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,300
to get wiped out.

857
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,260
And they better not put their hands on us,

858
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,360
so-called subgeniuses,

859
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,940
because they're going to get their ass kicked.

860
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,000
From PR News in Washington,

861
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,560
I'm making false statements to federal agents

862
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,980
high up in the atmosphere.

863
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,140
Files contained formulations and instructions

864
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,080
for making PR News in federal court Monday.

865
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,780
The White House says President Obama

866
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,460
will hold the Israeli prime minister on Tuesday.

867
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,060
We can now say

868
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,220
that we free McDonald's.

869
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,340
Our money is bleeding.

870
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,320
It's a top stuff.

871
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,900
Monday.

872
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,520
President Obama said a return to normalcy

873
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,800
can't be since late Monday.

874
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,800
We just need to find firepower

875
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,680
and be a good subscriber.

876
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,720
And this is a bonus.

877
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:18,720


878
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,800
The president's pushing for PR News.

879
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,640
Union members at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Plants

880
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,620
have taken extremely small presidential candidates.

881
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,660
The winner was 28% Mitt Romney.

882
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,400
You're listening to PR News from Washington.

883
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,760
The deal with the United Steelworkers Union

884
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,100
ensures PR News will keep six plants.

885
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,680
The protected plants are in Ohio,

886
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,940
in Kent, Ohio.

887
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,600
Firefighters broke out in Riverside County,

888
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,400
southeast of Los Angeles.

889
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,080
NASA says it was part of an experiment.

890
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,160
NASA is intended to collect information

891
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,800
about strange PR news.

892
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,700
Well, Harvey Wasserman often talks about

893
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,900
the conspiracy, the real conspiracy.

894
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,360
And he thinks we don't usually think

895
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,840
was George Washington gay?

896
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,080
What difference does it make?

897
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,760
Did the founders smoke pot?

898
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,320
Et cetera, et cetera.

899
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,900
The subgenius view of conspiracies,

900
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,340
of course, everybody has their own.

901
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,460
They're welcome to their own theory.

902
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,540
But it's true that the world is run

903
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,600
by rich people.

904
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,580
On the rare occasions that it is being run at all.

905
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,080
Generally, I think the conspiracy runs itself

906
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,060
just because people are so great

907
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,860
at building good stout cages for themselves.

908
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,420
You know, the controllers don't have to control.

909
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,480
They can just sit back.

910
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,720
As somebody said,

911
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,340
the TVs don't have to watch us

912
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,020
as long as we're watching TV.

913
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,520
They know what we're doing.

914
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,060
The only way to beat

915
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,720
the conspiracy,

916
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,420
the only way to beat the conspiracy,

917
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,820
is to be rich, I guess,

918
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,320
is to either get really rich yourself

919
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,520
or else drop out of the game totally.

920
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,520
And I wish I could say that I personally knew somebody

921
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,120
who's done either one of those,

922
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:02,900
but I don't.

923
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,420
A lot of us like to think we've dropped out,

924
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,320
but you know, we're still all at the mercy

925
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
of the rich people.

926
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,120
We just haven't been noticed yet

927
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,220
because we've been successfully hungered down

928
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,680
and haven't fought back yet.

929
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,400
And I'm in the same category myself.

930
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,060
The subgeniuses are mostly what we call

931
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,620
the clown trodden.

932
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,740
Yes.

933
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,400
But,

934
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,800
but we do know this much.

935
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,540
We know that conspiracy is all about mind control.

936
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:38,240
Would you mind if we nose in on your business over here?

937
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,220
Would you mind if we nose in on your business over there?

938
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,020
Friends, we subgeniuses are not here to mind you.

939
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,720
We're here to read your mind.

940
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,020
We mind you.

941
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,580
We're here to under-mind you

942
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,920
and mine out that old mind.

943
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,980
And not replace it, not with mine,

944
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,400
but with a much infinitely stupider mind.

945
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,180
A 2D mind.

946
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,780
A button-down mind.

947
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,100
A veritable mind filled,

948
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,280
the bedotted mind of J.R. Bob Dobbs!

949
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,640
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

950
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,580
Praise God damn, damn God Bob!

951
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,500
That is what's going to help you make it through

952
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
the workaday world.

953
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,460
We're not talking about the wimp-powerment

954
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,300
of the conspiracy.

955
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,960
We're selling you,

956
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,540
and this is written down by my friend Onan,

957
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,260
so you know it's true.

958
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,260
We're selling a genuine fortification

959
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,460
of your inherent status as

960
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,400
a superior mutant

961
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,500
fit to stand as judge, jury, and executioner

962
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,180
over anyone who might stand between you and your slap.

963
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,180
Now, what is slack?

964
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,760
Again, friends, it's different for everybody.

965
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,700
For me, slack is avoiding wild-eyed crazy men

966
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,080
screaming obscenities during performance art religious events.

967
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,420
For you, this is clearly not the case.

968
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,440
Or is it?

969
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,380
Praise Bob! Praise Starwood!

970
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,260
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack,

971
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,680
number 1226, from the Church of the Subgenius.

972
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,480
And to get more information, check out the website,

973
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,480
subgenius.com.

974
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,980
We'll close out in a second here

975
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,820
with Little Theodore,

976
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,020
the great Little Theodore,

977
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,620
from littletheodore.com,

978
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,980
from his new album, Peace is Boring.

979
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,420
Praise Bob!

980
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,760
Peace is boring!

981
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,640
Give me football!

982
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,540
I want action!

983
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,100
I'll take murder!

984
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,160
Peace is boring!

985
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,640
I crave drama!

986
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,780
Conflict and anguish

987
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,240
Keep things interesting!

988
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,720
Body counts from bombs!

989
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,280
Make good meetings!

990
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,740
Peace is boring!

991
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,680
Nothing changes!

992
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,440
Invading countries!

993
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,580
Brings twists and turns!

994
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,780
What'll happen tomorrow?

995
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,740
At least it won't be boring!

996
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,340
Smooth, straight, cardiographs!

997
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,640
It's not good news!

998
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,620
High peaks, low points!

999
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,240
Pump's blood gives price!

1000
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,820
Complications!

1001
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,760
I'm not a doctor!

1002
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,600
Like hot peppers!

1003
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,440
Energizing!

1004
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Peace is riskless!

1005
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,740
Competition!

1006
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,840
Is how we got here!

1007
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,660
Inside your teeth, riskless!

1008
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,440
Rabbit's face, lame piss!

1009
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,700
Peace means lipstick!

1010
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,600
Ideals antagonized!

1011
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,800
Lights, steel cheeks, for the cause!

1012
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,260
Now you're not boring!

1013
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,660
Shake things up, rationalize!

1014
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,000
That wave could kill you!

1015
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,780
Dry dust flows away!

1016
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,480
Peace goes nowhere!

1017
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,560
Good boy, bad ass!

1018
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,740
Sexual selection!

1019
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,700
Conquer to procreate!

1020
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,240
For the means extinction!

1021
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,180
Pilots from afar!

1022
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,280
It's win-win for me!

1023
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,440
Warrior nation!

1024
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,860
Give Serge a chance!

1025
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,720
Now that we've settled that!

1026
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,360
We're gonna get him!

1027
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,200
Don't tell me different!

1028
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,000
Peace is boring!

1029
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,860
Up your asshole!

1030
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,820
모두 시� � här이야!

1031
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,360
Peace against your bones!

1032
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,360
Force to transform!

1033
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,360
все part of the tails!

1034
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,360
War is not about powder!

1035

1038

little Theodore

1040
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,440
Theodore, the great little Theodore did that.

1041
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,640
from the album called Peace is Boring.

1042
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,700
You can get more from him at littlefeodor.com.

1043
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,320
And this is the Rainforest Band at the end of Starwood.
