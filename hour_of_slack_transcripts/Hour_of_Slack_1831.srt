1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,160
The subgenius hour of slack.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,880
You should run across him.

3
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,560
You would best think only good thoughts.

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,100
Big implications.

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,940
The world's largest.

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,220
But what does it mean the world's largest giants cease to exist?

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,600
But what about Dobbs?

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,120
Dobbs may eliminate about 2,000 rank and file Dobbs as well.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,580
The good news is Dobbs, for now, appear to be safe.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,800
And so now we may start the revival, friends, with a solemn moment of noise.

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,700
Praise Bob!

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,800
Praise Bob!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,780
Praise Bob!

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,020
I've noticed a lot of you have been here before and have learned the salute.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,280
That's called the subgenius salute.

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:24,880
The co-founder under Bob, Philo Drummond, reminded me of something we forgot 22 years ago,

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,160
which was the double salute.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,860
And this one's really hard.

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,180
Yeah.

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,020
Praise Bob!

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,620
Can you hear him?

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,220
Praise Bob!

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,360
Ah, that's bad music to my ears, friends.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,400
Okay.

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,720
Doctor, some of your detractors who call are objectionable to everything.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,440
Right, right, right.

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,860
And none of them can get through right now.

28
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,000
And so we've got...

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,260
We've got the four of you guys here on the lines, and nobody else can get through.

30
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,500
The subgenius blockade.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,160
That's right.

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,380
So this is an important charge to keep.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,200
Sinister as much vaunted berms.

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,040
Now, as a denizen of that area, do you ever go light candles at the Poe House on Edgar Allen Poe's birthday or whatever it is?

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
No, no.

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,860
Mainly because around that time, Edgar Allen Poe's birthday is full of the goth.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,800
And the problem with that is that the goths have that tendency to not...

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,640
They're kind of like the worst part of the hippies with the worst part of the metalheads in the sense they're wearing all black.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,700
And they haven't bathed in a while, and they're wearing usually leather or vinyl.

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,060
And then they smoke clove cigarettes.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
So you have this sort of combination of sweat, clove cigarettes...

42
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,900
And grease paint.

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,600
So they smell like clowns.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,140
Oh, it's horrible.

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,780
It's a horrible, wretched mixture of smells.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,700
You know, and I can't be around them.

47
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,700
I can't be around them long enough without getting nauseous or sick to my stomach.

48
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,300
I mean, I would bet that probably the horse stables at the Derby smell better than that group of people.

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,560
Oh, Stan, by the way, a bunch of people I found out through the Who's It's Whisperin' butt line, a bunch of your students are cheating.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,800
What?

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
They have the test and everything.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,500
Cheating?

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
They have the test and everything.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,180
They have the stuff.

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,160
They have all your, you know, it's not just the parts of your syllabus you leave out.

56
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,720
They have all the tests and quizzes and everything.

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,900
Well, and plus it's already, there's cliff notes of it.

58
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,200
Well, LeGune was the one who was selling the tests, actually, I heard.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,180
All that figures, okay.

60
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,620
You know, he was selling them for, I don't remember what kind of profit he was making on them.

61
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,000
And he was guffawing about it with me about, oh, I got the test.

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm just selling them to all the kids.

63
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,000
And he had a pretty good time with it.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,980
Well, selling the answers is one thing.

65
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,260
But to the stupid kids...

66
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,920
Who couldn't get it even with the answers, you got to sell them a grade, too.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
And it's not selling the answers.

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,080
It's selling the questions.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,960
That's where it is.

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,940
Like Jeopardy and saying Alex Trebek all of a sudden?

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,180
No, no, no.

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,600
It's selling the questions.

73
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,160
Because you can have the answers.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,020
It's the questions.

75
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,820
Isn't that what all those books in the self-help sections are about?

76
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,680
Didn't Einstein say something about not having the answers but all the questions?

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,440
Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,700
Among other things.

79
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,820
That's not all it is.

80
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,380
It's also about how people will believe any...

81
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,020
Any, any, any, any...

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,700
Radio Synesthesia from WCSB in Cleveland with Dr. Sinister, Priestess Pisces,

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,140
Rocknar, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

84
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,960
replayed here on Hour of Slack number 1154.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,580
Now, they were talking about my course in subgenius history and cult management,

86
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,120
an online course at maybelogic.net, MaybeLogic Academy,

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,860
which is...

88
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,420
This course is in its fourth of eight weeks.

89
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,620
And so for my students and you, the listener,

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,220
I've saved up various clips and clops of the old-timers of the church,

91
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,160
of the subgenius talking,

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,760
ancient...

93
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,120
subhistory.

94
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
It's mostly puzzling evidence,

95
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,700
Dr. Howell,

96
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,320
Dr. Philodrum and myself on KPFA,

97
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,880
or Pirate Cat Radio,

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Season in Hell,

99
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,780
John Hell's show.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,400
Although the intro titles and collages

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,440
were by either

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,760
Fernanda Nettie-Lemur

103
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,600
or

104
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,380
norrailpref.com.

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
In this cut,

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,060
in fact, that's coming up,

107
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,160
we're talking about rival cult leaders like L. Ron Hubbard,

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,920
David Koresh, Walt Disney.

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,300
What about people like Crowley?

110
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm sure they're saying something that you like.

111
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,000
No, he doesn't.

112
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,880
But when I'm trying to get something done...

113
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,800
Although Mr. Hubbard...

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,960
He's running his own thing.

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,620
...Scientology had a huge influence.

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,200
...go ass out into the mountains.

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Scary Scientologist.

118
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,780
Yes, well, it's...

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,680
I love their questionnaire.

120
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,400
That alone made me want to go talk to Bob.

121
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,540
What's scary is that...

122
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,800
...the...

123
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,060
...the...

124
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,160
...the way the people come out and react to it.

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,980
Perhaps it doesn't appear scary until you see the devoted practices of the beloved.

126
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,740
And then it's really scary.

127
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,880
Just like Bob.

128
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, even Bob has those people and it would be wrong to deny that it does.

129
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,060
I've seen people get pretty scared of head-launchings.

130
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,840
Back when we were publicly doing head-launchings,

131
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,040
there were people that would say,

132
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,240
they would pass out, flee.

133
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,700
Now, this is no longer a sacrament of our church,

134
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,140
but at one time it was a standard part of every devival.

135
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,420
When the...

136
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,480
I almost brought a head.

137
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:18,660
...heading head of the World Cup golfers would be launched via golf club in the middle of a religion-heavy symbol-frated ceremony.

138
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,320
But that was a different time.

139
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,820
That was before September 11 changed all.

140
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,860
See, I told you, Rob.

141
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,320
Hey, Rob.

142
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,120
September 11.

143
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,900
I changed my name to September 11 for two hours last week.

144
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,660
And the whole world came apart.

145
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,880
Yeah, on this radio station.

146
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,180
That's why I wasn't feeling well between those couple of hours.

147
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,100
I just had to...

148
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,900
There was something going on.

149
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,440
With K-Rob's help, I had to just get it off me.

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,200
I thought it was gas.

151
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,900
I had to get those words September 11.

152
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,820
I mean, in the end, it was gas.

153
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,440
Hard. Over and over again.

154
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,280
William Gas.

155
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,860
Yeah.

156
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,420
That's okay.

157
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,760
Hellfire.

158
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,540
Hellfire.

159
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,480
For those of you that care, I changed my name back when the show was over.

160
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,680
For me.

161
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,760
Hoss.

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,300
Hoss.

163
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,340
And Hosses.

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,280
That guy's great.

165
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
It makes me really miss radio stations.

166
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,140
There was a KDIA out of Oakland.

167
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,680
Used to do the Sunday church shows.

168
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,840
In Dallas, Fort Worth, it was K-Scott, voice of the gospel.

169
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,060
And Philo and I would tape record hours of that stuff.

170
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,180
Those guys were great.

171
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,460
I don't know if it's still...

172
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,820
I would assume that it's still on.

173
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,680
But the classic Texas radio preachers.

174
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,460
In the 80s were something to behold.

175
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
And certainly a great training ground for the young subgenius preachers.

176
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,980
So how common, like that one we just heard, how common would something like that actually

177
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,680
be on the radio?

178
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,960
All day long, every day.

179
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,560
But I mean, he's swearing up a storm on that one.

180
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:39,780
Oh, no.

181
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,680
Not the cussing.

182
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,840
But he would be yelling at you.

183
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,100
That was a special recording.

184
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Right.

185
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,960
But that would...

186
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,940
But other than the swearing, that kind of berating of the congregation would have been

187
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,100
somewhat common on the holy days that they weren't showing up?

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,420
Yeah.

189
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I mean, some preachers were more stern than others.

190
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:56,740
Yeah.

191
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,000
Those are the ones you want to listen to.

192
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,040
Scare the crap out of you.

193
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm sick of dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

194
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,200
Excuse me.

195
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,520
We're tired of undead preachers preaching undead sermons to undead congregations.

196
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:15,920
Pretty much.

197
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,200
Hi, Thomas.

198
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,840
Ma, ma, ma.

199
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,680
Um, um, I've got a problem.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,460
Well, you see, it's not really me.

201
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,260
It's my cold...

202
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,380
My cold...

203
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,860
It's suicidal.

204
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,200
Your cold is suicidal?

205
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,660
My cold is suicidal?

206
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,260
My cold is suicidal?

207
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,720
My cold is suicidal?

208
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,100
I just don't know what to do.

209
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,360
Tell me, please.

210
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,900
Can you hear it?

211
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,260
Post, post, post logical society?

212
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,020
Wow.

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,880
Unplugging morally suicidal cold.

214
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,000
Complete mess, complete mess.

215
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,220
Eating our lunch in America.

216
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,360
The tide of godlessness.

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,760
1-800-SUICIDAL-COLD.

218
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,700
That number again is 1-800-A-SLICE-OF-SUICIDAL-COLD.

219
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
Speaking of Mary and Nats, I was watching that movie, Team Unite.

220
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,360


221
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,360


222
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,620
America with my dad.

223
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,120
He was really enjoying it, but he started

224
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,220
trying to convince me that

225
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,820
it was computer animation

226
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,900
made to look like

227
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,700
marionettes.

228
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,900
He'd become so distrustful of

229
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,940
Hollywood special effects.

230
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,220
I was saying

231
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,800
something like, you know, those are

232
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,740
pretty nice marionettes. There was a

233
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,080
marionette operating a marionette the very

234
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,020
first shot. Yeah, that was a good opening.

235
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
And he said,

236
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,980
well, that's just computer animation

237
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
and they draw those strings.

238
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,860
I said, you can see the strings!

239
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,020
He goes, well, they draw those in to make it

240
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,040
more realistic.

241
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
You know, in this world, the way

242
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,800
this world is, I might find out

243
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,760
if it was right. Yeah, ever since the

244
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,640
Zupruder film, it's been hard to trust

245
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,660
anything on film.

246
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,900
And now they're saying that there's other

247
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,920
videos shot from that day in Dallas when

248
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,520
you actually see the guards,

249
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,880
his detail stand down.

250
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,420
You see it stand down just before the shooting.

251
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,720
And that's out on

252
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,800
brass check TV.

253
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,240
Secret security ducks right before the shots.

254
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,060
Brass check their brass on TV.

255
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
This is one of the security guys.

256
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,500
They keep looping it over and over.

257
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,420
See, look, watch him shrug his shoulders

258
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,700
as if to say, what are we doing?

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,580
And you keep seeing this.

260
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,320
Over and over.

261
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,660
And right there, that's proof that

262
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,920
Kennedy's men stood down and he got

263
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,300
assassinated.

264
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,100
It's better to watch people doing JFK Reloaded

265
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,660
where kids take the game and make JFK do

266
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,800
things like they come down and around.

267
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,240
And they go really fast.

268
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,700
This is second time.

269
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


270
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


271
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


272
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


273
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


274
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


275
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


276
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700


277
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,400
Hit the median strip and go up over the

278
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,960
grassy goal.

279
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,060
The other side, roll the occupants out of

280
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,980
the limousine and they die.

281
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,460
Wow.

282
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
That's pretty cool.

283
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,160
I like that kind of stuff on YouTube.

284
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,660
I like that, uh, that, that, that poster by

285
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,520
coop that shows Kennedy with the bullet

286
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,180
going through, but it's zigzagging all over

287
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,140
the place before it even reaches him.

288
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
And then it zigzags again and hits the

289
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,380
other vitals and then exits.

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,920
That's one of the reasons that ends up

291
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,860
looking great too.

292
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,540
Reasons in that book that I bought, right.

293
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,140
About that book.

294
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,960
There's

295
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,040
some

296
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,280
posters on this.

297
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,900
A lot.

298
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,420
If of course you like the Tiki generation,

299
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,020
which I do.

300
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,360
Stool softener capsules.

301
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,060
Tiki thing.

302
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,340
Yeah.

303
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,740
I had to live, I grew up in Tiki world.

304
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,160
So, so this, this Malomar version of it is

305
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,380
sickening except for Mongo lounge.

306
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,340
Cause they're kind of, they make me throw

307
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,440
off in my mouth a little bit.

308
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,460
So a stay is the, uh, is the scene of the

309
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,860
JFK shooting still preserved?

310
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Do people like go there and drive and take

311
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,320
pictures?

312
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,100
Oh yeah.

313
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,740
It's it's a, it's the only tourist attraction

314
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,100
in Dallas practically.

315
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,260
Uh,

316
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,680
I just thought all made pilgrimages.

317
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
They're almost an animal.

318
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,000
When I met these guys in 19, I came out in

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,480
1980 with my girlfriend and a guy who lived

320
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,560
from sulfur sprays.

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,540
And you know, that is, and I had, they, these

322
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,900
people, Milo and staying became my friends

323
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,540
forever because they took the box of clown

324
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,000
suits and guns and over man heads.

325
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,500
And I had my space suit and we ran up and

326
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,080
down the grass, you know, and that films of

327
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:03,540
us, but yeah, I got to play the killer clown.

328
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,580
That was fun.

329
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,520
That was fun friends, uh, filming a reenactment

330
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,740
of the JFK shooting in Dealey Plaza in 1980

331
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,820
with puzzling and phyla and so forth.

332
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
It not as fun as the real thing.

333
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,720
Uh,

334
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,560
anyway, friends, uh, later in that John hell

335
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,100
show, we hear puzzling evidence, uh, reminiscing

336
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,660
about when Nina Hagen, the famous German rock

337
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,420
singer, the Saint of the church, Nina Hagen

338
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,040
came to our Sanford or Los Angeles show and

339
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,460
invited us to her cult.

340
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,120
Yeah.

341
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,680
Nina Hagen invited me to go take acid with her.

342
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,420
And I chickened out because of her, her 12 young men

343
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,900
contrary to her posse around us scared me to death.

344
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,560
None of them were allowed to take acid, but they had to stay

345
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,240
there the entire time and be the circle around you.

346
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,420
And she would promise you that as long as you're in the circle,

347
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,540
you're safe, that's it.

348
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
And I would be in bed with her and that would be happening.

349
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,360
All the 12 guys standing, holding hands in front of you.

350
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,200
So, you know, there was Nina and I thought this is a, this will be a bit much.

351
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,220
Wow.

352
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,340
Well, didn't we see.

353
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,080
Weird Al Yankovic came, Gary's mom came.

354
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,900
That was a fun night.

355
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,020
Try to explain, um, the, the popularity of, of, of the church of subgenius.

356
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:40,360
I mean, it's popularity clearly is big, um, among college campuses, music groups.

357
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,600
And now with the internet, I mean the internet, you guys are kind of, kind of hot stuff.

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Well, uh, we were probably the, the, the first religion to really

359
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:01,720
exploit the internet because there are so it's a religion that attracts so many nerds and geeks and AV kids.

360
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,400
AV?

361
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,040
Yeah.

362
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,760
You were probably, you were probably the AV kid.

363
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,720
Audiovisual audio.

364
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,100
Yeah.

365
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,700
You know, the kid that loaded the projector.

366
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,280
I know.

367
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,640
Yes, I was.

368
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,100
Okay.

369
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,120
You got me.

370
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,560
Everybody in radio was the AV kid.

371
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,420
I was, I was too.

372
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:31,680
And anyway, so we've always had, uh, a lot of, uh, ultra, I mean, uh, there were people trying to explain the, the internet to me back in the eighties, but they couldn't, they were so weird.

373
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,460
They couldn't explain it to me.

374
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,120
I didn't really understand it until Milo forced me to look at America online.

375
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,780
That was in the nineties.

376
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,120
And then I became a computer, a really serious computer geek.

377
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,080
But, uh, yeah, we've, we've, uh, I think the internet.

378
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,400
Yeah.

379
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:57,140
Kind of saved us because as far as popularity goes, we don't really have much by definition, you know, this thing, if it appealed to everybody that would defeat the purpose.

380
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:11,200
So, um, we never did make it to the pet rock fad stage, but we're a tenacious thorn in the side of the conspiracy that they'll never really be able to make go away.

381
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,880
Cause it's gotten a little bit too big now.

382
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,040
To, to ever completely.

383
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,820
Shut down.

384
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:27,220
So people will probably be seeing those darn Bob faces grinning at them from the oddest places forever.

385
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,820
Forever.

386
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,540
Yes.

387
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:37,340
Like, so in that respect, it's, it's as, as well, you know, look at, look how far the Mormons have come in a very, very short time.

388
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,220
Relatively speaking.

389
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,680
Yeah.

390
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,560
And, uh, the Scientologists in the even shorter time than that.

391
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,320
Well, and of course, you know, they, of course they've got a little bit of star power health there.

392
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,580
Yeah.

393
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,380
Yeah.

394
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,660
Well, but you know, they're, they're appealing to a lower common denominator.

395
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,440
Oh, no kidding.

396
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,280
Yeah.

397
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,060
Uh, and that'd be, you know, for a sub genius to say that that's a really deep insult.

398
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:12,380
Well, we know by the way, I, when you, when the show started, you quoted the sub genius gods called the fire sign theater.

399
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,500
Oh my word.

400
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,220
I recognize that quote.

401
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,800
And probably.

402
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,420
It's sad that not more listeners would be familiar with the fire sign theater.

403
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,360
You know, that happens to be one of my old time favorites.

404
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:41,360
Uh, I mean, for all kinds of reasons, um, you know, reasons I can't even divulge, but you know, for anybody who it was a send up on old time radio done in a fashion that would have done old time radio proud, the writing was brilliant.

405
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,220
Not to mention a little off center, but enough to be.

406
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,980
So well done that all you could do is sit there and wrap attention and watch your stereo.

407
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,900
Yeah.

408
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,460
Yeah.

409
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,020
You had to listen to each album three or four times just to figure out what the plot was.

410
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,300
Yeah.

411
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,480
Oh, and, and, you know, more so.

412
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,760
It was like, uh, uh, the marker, like the Marx brothers multiplied.

413
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,160
Well, and, and they would, they said, no, no, you don't know how radio works.

414
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,680
So you have to start over here and then you go over there.

415
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,500
Yeah.

416
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,880
I mean, that's.

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,400
Yeah.

418
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,500
That's brilliant.

419
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,260
They were the real inspirators of all of the subgenius radio people.

420
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,040
Um, there's a, there's a bunch of us.

421
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,740
I like that one.

422
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:24,980
Is it?

423
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,120
He walks by night and, uh, you know, rock danger.

424
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,600
Yeah.

425
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,860
Nick, Nick danger.

426
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,960
Third eye.

427
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,580
Yeah.

428
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,360
Hello, Mr. Danger.

429
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,440
My name is Rocky.

430
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,320
The rock conquer.

431
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,200
Uh, I could, I could tell it was him because of his smarmy appearance and his heavy profile.

432
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,860
And I, I were able to set up a, uh, a comedy show with him, um, that I wrote and put

433
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,140
together.

434
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,660
He played the city's most recent icon.

435
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,460
Bob Grymer in

436
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,020
I am Robert 在

437
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,680
Alternate

438
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,220
cylindrical

439
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,740
ıl

440
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,820
Symbolic

441
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,000
utilizzised

442
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,100
the same stylings.

443
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,060
In fact, the Nick Danger third eye,

444
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,820
you know,

445
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,260
do you listen to Prairie Home?

446
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,440
Prairie Home Companion?

447
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,840
I have not, no.

448
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,440
Garrison Keillor?

449
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,980
I have in the years ago.

450
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,700
Yeah, he does a segment, a shtick,

451
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,240
which is a direct descendant

452
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,380
of Nick Danger

453
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,620
about a private eye

454
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,320
and the city that

455
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,220
sleeps it, that knows how to keep its

456
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,720
secrets.

457
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,340
And Guy Noir.

458
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,840
Guy Noir.

459
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,820
Nick Danger, Guy Noir is a direct descendant of it.

460
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,060
And you know that Garrison Keillor

461
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,760
used to sit with long hair

462
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,500
imbibing on Mexican fruit

463
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,640
just watching

464
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,220
his stereo.

465
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,040
You know, strangely enough, there was a time

466
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,480
when even Rush Limbaugh was doing that.

467
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,180
Oh, well, I happen to know that for a fact.

468
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,360
I had a buddy of mine that used to work together back in Rock Radio.

469
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,020
Really?

470
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,060
Yeah, he works in New York. He's an old friend of mine.

471
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,540
People change.

472
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go figure.

473
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
I just devolved. I never evolved.

474
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,280
You guys probably don't know about

475
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,460
Subspecies 23,

476
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,480
do you?

477
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,700
No.

478
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,740
Tell us.

479
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,780
Four years ago,

480
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,360
a subgenius

481
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,860
calling himself Subspecies 23

482
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,460
would occasionally post,

483
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,260
to the news group alt.slack

484
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,120
and he wasn't a particularly

485
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,320
noticeable guy. He seemed like

486
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,800
a quiet person.

487
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,220
A regular, kind of shy, quiet guy.

488
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,860
Uh-oh.

489
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,160
And he was around for about a year.

490
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
I think he got tired of it.

491
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,360
Some of the smarty-mouth

492
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,620
subgeniuses probably made fun of him

493
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,940
and offended him.

494
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,580
He went on and did other things

495
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
over the

496
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,500
next four years.

497
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,540
And the last thing he did before

498
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,460
they put him in prison was kill

499
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,360
a 13-year-old girl.

500
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,840
Smarty-mouth.

501
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,480
This was in Oklahoma.

502
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,180
A small town in Oklahoma.

503
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,380
He killed his neighbor

504
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,620
and planned to eat her.

505
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,000
He was going to be a cannibal.

506
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,440
And, uh,

507
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,000
of course, he hadn't had anything

508
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,140
to do. He got caught

509
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,320
before he could even get the

510
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,860
stove heated up.

511
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,500
But, uh,

512
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,120
for some reason,

513
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
because he had posted on the

514
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,020
internet to us four years

515
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,080
earlier, we got dragged

516
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,920
into every news report about

517
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,260
this guy. You know, this subgenius

518
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,160
member. He wasn't even a member.

519
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,060
I looked him up. He never joined.

520
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,760
He did buy Media Barrage No. 5

521
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,380
CD and a couple

522
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,160
of other products.

523
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,940
Yeah, yeah, no, of course not.

524
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,840
We're not irresponsible.

525
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,880
If he's sentenced to death,

526
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,920
does he get to his last meal,

527
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,580
whatever he asks for?

528
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,620
If he asks for a 13-year-old,

529
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,220
do they have to give him one?

530
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,600
Just the right way.

531
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,960
Yeah, of course they do.

532
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,180
That's one of the subgeniuses

533
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,140
we'll never live down.

534
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,720
But he is, he never did actually

535
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,120
send in his $30, so he's still

536
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,880
tsk, tsk to Bob.

537
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,740
Leaders.

538
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,820
The Potato Tuber. The United Nations has

539
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,880
declared 2008 the International

540
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Year of Unusual History

541
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,940
and a happy accident.

542
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,440
Boom.

543
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,360
aver. Boom.

544
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,580
Friedrich Engels even declared

545
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,380
and moors the pity.

546
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,480
Rotten. Leaders.

547
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,540
have done it all.

548
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,800
Variously thought to cause leprosy

549
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,400
to be associated with the devil,

550
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,540
people then realized, Adam Smith

551
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,760
observed at the time,

552
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,260
mashed, fried, boiled, and roast

553
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,000
Roast Neighbor.

554
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,160
An unusual history by Norell

555
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,460
segues into the unusual history

556
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,180
of giant sculptures of bob heads.

557
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,060
Oh wow!

558
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,140


559
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:15,680
that, I'm going to cut in here in 2021 and mention that old subspecies 23 mentioned in show number

560
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:23,540
1154 from 2008. He's still on death row in Oklahoma, and he recently ordered a pamphlet.

561
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,700
I remembered him and started up correspondence with him. Not that I've been real good about it.

562
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,040
But he's been behind bars for 17 years. And believe it or not, because I now have a loved

563
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,820
one in prison, also for the murder of a child, in this case, a mercy killing, but that makes

564
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,440
no difference in Texas law. Because of that, I have a certain sympathy for prisoners and people

565
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:57,340
who did something terrible by reason of temporary insanity. And I just thought I'd mention that.

566
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm not really the most hard-headed person in the world. I'm not really the most hard-headed

567
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,800
person in the world. I also have renewed sympathy for those who can't work like they used to because

568
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:13,040
of health problems. My bad back comes and goes and has been slowing me down. Hence, these reruns.

569
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,520
That's part of why I got into the Burning Man cult is because of that. The head, that thing on the

570
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,780
on the end of the thing that gets burned, was so gorgeous and so well done. This is thousands of

571
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,540
dollars of soji screen work. Big head. Big head. And those guys were just filling up the fireworks

572
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,160
and burning the damn thing. Back when it had feets and it used to stand on the ply, I remember.

573
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,120
And you could, the little feets had little... 94? Yeah. We've been tearing up big heads for a long

574
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,940
time. Yes. One night, Gary was really, really, really, really sick. And I was doing a tape to

575
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:51,060
you on a 305 or 350, the big Sony 350. And I was bringing Paul from his house over here

576
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:58,840
and stopped in the mudflats in Berkeley and cut a big head from a pipe down there and brought it

577
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,080
over.

578
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,480
Gary was in bad shape. He was in bad humors. And I brought that big head. He made him head.

579
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:11,520
He did. Exactly. And I put it on his back porch. You gave him head. I gave him head. How big was it?

580
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,340
About the size of this side of the wall. It was gigantic. And I put it on his back porch window.

581
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,680
And then I ran away and called him and said, go out of the room you're in and go look at your

582
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:29,260
back porch. And I could hear him start laughing. And who's built the largest of bob heads to date?

583
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,780
I believe it was the man sitting next to you.

584
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,540
Yeah.

585
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,180
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

586
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,760
Who built the biggest dob's head?

587
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,060
Aside from the Colossus of Rhodes. I believe there was that one Stan Pesket made.

588
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,520
Yeah, Stan Pesket was incredible. It was very large.

589
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,960
But then there was the one that Moguloid made.

590
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,820
From when?

591
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,600
Which breathed the teeth.

592
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,460
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, it might have been larger. Yeah, yeah, it's true.

593
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,280
Which belched fire.

594
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:02,960
Yeah.

595
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,020
Where was this from?

596
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,720
And that's when?

597
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,120
When he spoke. The head, it was a static head at night.

598
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,620
Yeah.

599
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,600
No, that one went.

600
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,540
It was a living head that Moguloid built.

601
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,520
And it talked like the Wizard of Oz head with Hal's voice.

602
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,300
And we would ask it. It was an oracle. We would ask it questions.

603
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,520
No, those were not sent their $30 shacks.

604
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,260
Now burn in the lake of fire.

605
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,700
Yeah.

606
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,420
And shoot fire out of its nostrils.

607
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,780
It sounds like Burning Man.

608
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:47,940
As I understand it, that giant dob's head was left in Tucson and ended up on somebody's front lawn who lived next to the freeway.

609
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,640
Is that true?

610
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:48,980
You know?

611
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:58,100
So during rush hour, people driving through Tucson were forced to gaze upon that slackful head on their way to or from work.

612
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,880
Excellent.

613
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,520
Excellent.

614
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,280
That'll win two converts a day.

615
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,500
And they won't even know. It'll be too late by the time they get there.

616
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,300
That was the last I heard of it. Do you know what happened?

617
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:15,100
Yeah, I understand. Chicken John and I drove the giant dob's head out to Tucson for the divival there.

618
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
And I understand the promoter or the club owner underpaid us.

619
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,280
And in retaliation, we cursed him by leaving the giant dob's head on his lawn.

620
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,400
Excellent. Was that the HUD show?

621
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,640
Yeah.

622
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:26,980
At the HUD?

623
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,660
Yeah.

624
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,160
Wow.

625
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,580
Yeah.

626
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,540
Of course. It's the only show in Tucson.

627
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,160
Wow.

628
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,060
These guys at the tattoo parlor wanted to pick a fight with Al and myself.

629
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,000
That was a hell of a big dob's head.

630
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,540
Because of the ranger markings on the vehicle.

631
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:46,280
Yeah. They couldn't understand why I was a ranger in Nevada but not in their state or in California.

632
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,400
So they wanted to kill us.

633
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,200
And色 don't sew co destined to their jak fors this far.

Do you guys get in trouble a lot for your vulgar humour?

642
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,260
Well, I wouldn't say that.

643
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,160
Misunderstood statements, shall we say.

644
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,020
Every other show or so, they kill us.

645
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,320
They have had their issues with the...

646
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,400
When I had the show in...

647
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,480
Rise up out of the grave.

648
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,900
When I had the show in Dallas, I had to apologize to everybody in Vietnamese.

649
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,460
In Vietnamese?

650
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,680
Well, the offensive thing that was broadcast on my show was in Vietnamese.

651
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,580
And my show followed the Vietnamese hour.

652
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:18,440
And I didn't know for sure that the fellow had translated my Bob message nicely.

653
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,040
Was a Bob message thought to be insensitive to Vietnamese people?

654
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,560
Well, the message that I asked my Vietnamese friend to record for me...

655
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,820
Was supposed to say...

656
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,100
Bob wants peace all over the world.

657
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:43,020
You know, even between the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese exiles.

658
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,300
And if there isn't peace, Bob will kill everybody.

659
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:53,340
And that offended the Vietnamese exiles who were listening to the show.

660
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,800
The next show I had to broadcast...

661
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,180
The Acid Raid.

662
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,280
Both in English and the recorded one in Vietnamese.

663
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,780
Which luckily the recorded one must have been what it was supposed to be.

664
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,740
Because I wasn't killed again after that.

665
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,160
Well, apparently you backtracked and made amends.

666
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,900
But if you'll go to Philodrummond on YouTube right now, you'll see a funny thing.

667
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,340
It's really funny.

668
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm looking through a little glass window at Philodrummond.com's face.

669
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,640
And it is a funny thing.

670
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,820
It's not Philodrummond.com.

671
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm beckoning you, um...

672
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,940
It's... it's... it... well...

673
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,860
It would be funny were it not so sad.

674
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,960
To quote...

675
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,920
The beckoning fair one.

676
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,040
Jimmy Swaglin.

677
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,360
Exactly, man.

678
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,760
Together.

679
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,180
Together.

680
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:42,720
Together.

681
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,000
Together.

682
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,920
Together.

683
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,640
Together.

684
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,260
Together.

685
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:50,700
Together.

686
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,200
Together.

687
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,620
Together.

688
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,100


689
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,720
Together.

690
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,360
What we're going to do is to do Hercules.

691
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,720
Rock music.

692
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,780
For rock you.

693
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,180
The rhythm.

694
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,660
Find the rock music.

695
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,260
Thank you.

696
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:23,760
Thank you.

697
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Thank you, Norell, who also did the Super Mario vs. UB40 bit of music earlier.

698
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,380
And now back to A Season in Hell in December as we watch YouTube.

699
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,300
We're watching.

700
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,520
We're hearing part of Pipes of the Piposphere.

701
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,740
You know, you guys need one of those little cameras in here, too.

702
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,960
Oh, that's one of the classics of Genius Underground films.

703
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,320
Pipes of the Piposphere.

704
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,540
It's often shown with Kenneth Anger retrospectives and things like that.

705
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,420
Uploaded to YouTube by the one and only Philodrumas.

706
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,540
Pipes of the Piposphere.

707
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,300
I helped with the special effects on that.

708
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,420
There's one right there.

709
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,100
Award-winning, mind-breaking special effects.

710
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,580
There's another one.

711
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,420
It's basically.

712
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,160
It's a little bit of a long story.

713
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,160


714
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,160


715
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,120
But the zombies of the stratosphere was being played on the television and we superimposed

716
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:39,100
pipes into all of the characters or vehicles and overdubbed the dialogue.

717
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,260
Only we did all this in one take in a hotel room.

718
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,920
And the nine minutes that it took.

719
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,780
The technique for superimposing the pipe was somebody's hand holding the pipe against the

720
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,180
TV.

721
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,580
Not just in front of people either.

722
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,480
Moving vehicles and such.

723
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,140
Yeah, yeah.

724
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,700
And it's such a fancy.

725
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,760
There was a pipe marine, you know, the pipe mobile.

726
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,980
Quote from the BBC.

727
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:14,040
Muslim scientists and clerics have called for the adoption of the subgenius power of

728
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,100
SWAT.

729
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,940
Right.

730
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,680
Here we go.

731
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,520
Brave.

732
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,020
Brave.

733
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,160
Brave.

734
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,680
You know, there was a subgenius operating system, Slackware Linux.

735
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,260
Oh, really?

736
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,160
From Reverend Volkerding.

737
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,180
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,980
One of the one of the main Linux iterations in the especially in the 90s is Slackware.

739
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,860
Does it open your applications when it feels you're ready for it?

740
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,160
I don't know if it even does that.

741
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,060
I never monkeyed with it myself.

742
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Microsoft.

743
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,140
Microsoft.

744
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,140


745
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,140


746
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,140


747
00:33:52,140 --> 00:34:00,060
Microsoft had a short lived operating system called Bob, for which they trademarked the

748
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,900
name Bob.

749
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,660
Oh, no way.

750
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,440
For operating systems.

751
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,420
Okay.

752
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,160
And it was designed for little old ladies.

753
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,580
It was supposed to be the simplest thing in the world.

754
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,000
It showed a desk, a picture of a desk.

755
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,360
And if you wanted to write a letter, you clicked on the letter on the desk.

756
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,840
And, you know, if you wanted to look at a picture, you clicked on the photo on the desk.

757
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:30,120
And there was a little bespectacled smiley face avatar that told you how to do things.

758
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,240
And he was called Bob.

759
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,660
You want to masturbate, you click on a little sperm puddle on the desk.

760
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,140
Like that Microsoft paperclip character.

761
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,840
It was one of Microsoft's biggest failures.

762
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,400
Yeah, I can imagine.

763
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,220
What was this?

764
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,760
It was in the late 80s, I guess.

765
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
Early 90s.

766
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,680
I was going to say that's definitely going back a ways.

767
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,920
Well, I became a computer geek.

768
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,800
I was a computer geek.

769
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:51,800


770
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,000
I bought a computer when the first Macintosh came out in 84.

771
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:07,080
But I only used it as kind of a glorified typewriter until the 90s when I opened up a sample copy of Bryce.

772
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:14,440
It's like a very simple 3D landscape making program.

773
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,260
And that changed everything.

774
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,820
All of a sudden, it was like I became an animator again.

775
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:21,820


776
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,440
After leaving it all alone for 20 years.

777
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,520
And you've been doing, I'm assuming animation-wise, just pen to film.

778
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,720
Is that right?

779
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,100
I used to be a stop motion animator.

780
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,540
So very analog of the digital.

781
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,360
Very, very analog.

782
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,980
And then just, well, actually to tell the truth is because we got donations of decent computers.

783
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:51,460
The great Grimsham Clench in North Carolina donated us computers that were good enough to do animation.

784
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,740
And praise the Grimsham Clench a million times over for that, friends.

785
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,200
That was from A Season in Hell from Pirate Cat Radio.

786
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,060
That music in the background was by me and Lee Murr, by the way.

787
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,000
But you are now listening to the Hour of Slack number 1154.

788
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:19,820
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius, you could see subgenius.com or write to P.O. Box 807.

789
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,800
Glenn Reynolds.

790
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,540
Texas.

791
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,480
76043.

792
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,840
But now, from Lee Murr, the news.

793
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm stoking a humanitarian crisis in Beijing.

794
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:46,560
Democrat Barack Obama is suggesting Democrats would be willing to deal with rogue leaders including President Bush.

795
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,240
I have never said that.

796
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,020
Obama also criticized oil resources.

797
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:51,780
Not oil.

798
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,000
föret.

799
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,620
So what is there to do about this discrimination?

800
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:53,640
Moon Pete.

801
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:53,780
Componen Completely

802
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,740
Average loves TV.

803
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,460
executive and working on bus pros under the same slogan.

804
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,460
U.S. Jahre.

805
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:20,800
by Shwhichug

806
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,140
Well, they called the sheriff and said,

807
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,480
Conclutes, somebody broke in the freezer and stole all the steaks

808
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,100
The dog is still hiding, the sheriff said,

809
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,760
Man, he sounds to me like the Lakeview Man

810
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,880
The Lakeview Man, he's a wild man

811
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,460
He lives in the woods outside of town

812
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,720
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

813
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,800
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

814
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,060
Some say he was a soldier who came home from war

815
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,120
All in one piece but with emotional scars

816
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,540
Agree on the story, argue about the date

817
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,440
They say he was a soldier who came home from war

818
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,480
The war between the states and the Lakeview Man

819
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,520
He's a wild man, he lives in the woods outside of town

820
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,820
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

821
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,000
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

822
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,080
He's a wild man, he lives in the woods outside of town

823
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,180
Well, I took the shortcut to the river last night

824
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,600
I'm buried in a blur in the long, vain lines

825
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,820
Drank a few beers, skipped a few stores

826
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,120
Grew a little passer on the way back home

827
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,440
guitar solo

828
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,140
guitar solo

829
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,600
guitar solo

830
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,100
guitar solo

831
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:20,700
guitar solo

832
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,420
guitar solo

833
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,420


834
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,420


835
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,420


836
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,420


837
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,420


838
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,420


839
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,340
guitar solo

840
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,340


841
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,660
Well, a dog disappears, a cow is found dead

842
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,020
A chicken is a miss, it found a miss in its head

843
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,280
Shotgun gone, print in the sand

844
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,480
Two-toed shot, the Lakeview Man

845
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,740
And the Lakeview Man, he's a wild man

846
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,320
He lives in the woods outside of town

847
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,420
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

848
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,680
You might hear the Lakeview Man

849
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,840
The Lakeview Man is a wild man

850
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,420
He lives in the woods outside of town

851
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,540
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

852
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,000
You might hear the Lakeview Man

853
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,280
You might hear the Lakeview Man

854
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,720
You might hear the Lakeview Man

855
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,060
And you might hear the Lakeview Man

856
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,740
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

857
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,680
Hell's at the moon, listen if you can

858
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,060
Who in this world is this kind man?

859
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,900
Who's making me believe he hasn't gone far enough?

860
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Sabotage this dog and this Four-Eyed Big- inequalities

861
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,840
coursing on like dogs

862
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:42,840


863
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:42,840


864
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:42,840


865
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,080
Always slightlyself Quandimo!

866
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,120
Alarm!

867
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:45,800
Alert!

868
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,260


869
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,260


870
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,000
Alert!

871
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,760
Alert!

872
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:49,840
Alert!

873
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:49,840


874
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,420
Col level, alert!

875
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:51,420


876
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:59,660
How about for influences, Forrest J. Ackerman's Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine and Forrest J. Ackerman's Spacemen magazine?

877
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,200
My house is based on Forrest J. Ackerman's house.

878
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,600
The Slacker Mansion.

879
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,420
Right, yeah.

880
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:06,960
Yeah.

881
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,220
Forrest Ackerman's house was known as the Acker Mansion until quite recently it existed in Hollywood.

882
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,560
I even went there as a sort of pilgrimage.

883
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:15,960
Really?

884
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,600
Although it was in its decline even then, but Forrest was there.

885
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:27,640
He gave the lecture and certain areas were guarded by troll-like science fiction nerds, you know,

886
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,280
who would block you from getting into parts of the house that you weren't supposed to be in.

887
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:39,080
And those would include things like candlelit shrines to Greta Garbo and so on.

888
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:45,600
But you started in Forrest's basement where there was a hodgepodge of decaying monster masks and stuff.

889
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:56,300
And some things, you know, like the, uh, uh, rotted old dinosaurs from King Kong and the, uh, model of the U.S. Capitol made by Ray Harryhausen.

890
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,720
These are the holy objects of the Church of the Subgenius.

891
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:13,800
But since then he had some strokes, some operations, and the IRS seizing everything and now he has nothing, you know, but, uh, all that stuff must have gone somewhere, but, um...

892
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,560
Not every subgenius.

893
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,420
But was raised on famous monsters of Filmland magazine, uh, probably about half of them.

894
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:30,420
But in original subgenius influence, though, original subgenius, uh, uh, creation, I think it, uh, has to be factored in.

895
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,780
Uh, still trying to answer your questions about origins.

896
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,380
And Spacemen was another magazine. I, did you see...

897
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,020
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

898
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,260
No, that was, uh...

899
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,480
You never saw Forrest's Spacemen?

900
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,960
I, I, I...

901
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,060
I...

902
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,140
I...

903
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,160
I...

904
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:45,880
I...

905
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:45,940
I...

906
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:45,940


907
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:45,940


908
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:45,940


909
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:45,940


910
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,060
I...

911
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,060


912
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,980
I never sold them in the stores that I could bicycle to.

913
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:56,800
Well, that's too bad. I would have thought it was, because you were talking about, uh, Zombies of the Stratosphere just a while ago.

914
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:06,400
Spacemen mostly covered stuff like that, although it did contain, uh, Henry Kutner's two-issue novelization of 20 million miles to Earth.

915
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:14,180
And lots of pictures of bad guys from Saturn and so on, who mostly looked like Chinese people wearing pointy helmets and things like that.

916
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,720
Back in those days!

917
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,780
Back in those days, a kid had to ride his bicycle ten miles to find one monster toy.

918
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,560
Well, a monster magazine.

919
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,600
These kids today don't have any idea how good they have it, monster-wise.

920
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:34,440
Finding monster magazines was finding pearls in the midst of an oasis, a terrible desert of boring crap.

921
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:42,740
You know, there'd be a monster magazine, which would be a jewel of forbidden, uh, delectable delights.

922
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,640
And there were some rare monster magazines that came out.

923
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,500
During the 60s.

924
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,040
Monster World.

925
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,240
And Monster Mania, if you recall that one.

926
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,120
Right, I have, uh, some, uh, soul-blown issues.

927
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,860
How about Modern Monsters?

928
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,340
Did you ever have an issue with that?

929
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,660
No.

930
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,920
And the best of them all, Castle of Frankenstein.

931
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,020
Castle, yeah, that was, uh, that was really fun.

932
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,320
A hip monster magazine.

933
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,460
The rarest of all jewels to be plucked from convenience stores.

934
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,640
7-Elevens, wherever they would appear in the middle of all the other mags.

935
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:28,000
Well, it's funny how that, uh, monster, and also monster hot rod, uh, genre has...

936
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:37,700
That was a fusion with Ed Big Daddy Roth's, uh, a magazine, and, uh, with Pete Millar's drag cartoons, where Gilbert Shelton got his start.

937
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,420
There's all these bands now that are monster hot rod bands.

938
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,780
They're trying to...

939
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:42,940
Oh, sure.

940
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,520
Hang on to some shred of that form...

941
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,380
Former glories.

942
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,120
And the fun art world.

943
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,620
...in the Fester's Records all the way.

944
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,340
You find these artists like, uh, Todd Shore.

945
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,560
Todd Shore is doing the monster thing, uh...

946
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
Coop, he's done a bit of that stuff as well.

947
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,380
Yeah, yeah, oh, God, it's, it's like a dream come true.

948
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:15,320
See, Coop has an amazing blog that really not only offers, like, some of his own art, but a lot of his interests, uh, in that sort of monster hot rod world, including, uh, he helping sort of, uh, do the paint jobs on some of, some big monster hot rods.

949
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:15,860
Uh-huh.

950
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:15,860


951
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,140
So...

952
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,440
I actually know Coop best as an artist of, uh, chubby, uh, beauties.

953
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,620
Chubby, chubby chicks.

954
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,640
Absolutely.

955
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,100
And he's superb at depicting certain aspects of the female form.

956
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,420
Yes.

957
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,980
I have a small collection of nice.

958
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,420
Yes.

959
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:30,800
Ohh.

960
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,340
As do I, a big fan of Coop.

961
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,580
And, and he, uh, he, he also not only does the, the chubby, the chubby chick look, the monster hot rod look, but also the alien look.

962
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,780
He's definitely into that as well.

963
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,160
Yes.

964
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,160


965
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,540
Uh-huh.

966
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,380
Yes, yes.

967
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,500
He's down in Los Angeles, where he goes and...

968
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:45,500


969
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:45,500

in

979
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,620
million years from now the humans have split into two races the Eloy which were

980
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:59,940
these happy-go-lucky simple-minded little childlike humans who had

981
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,360
everything provided for them they were pretty much brainless but they didn't

982
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,040
need brains because everything was provided for everything was organic to

983
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,020
well it turned out that was because they were being raised like cattle by the

984
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,340
other species of humans who had developed

985
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:25,780

993
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:52,440


994
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,620

995
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,400
came right up Production

996
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,000
the Allan

997
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:16,260
We're going to take our lumped, go at it hammer and tongs, beat the crap out of each other in the joyous explosion of violence and bloodlust at Dr. Philodrumon's Punch Out All Night Knockaheditorium.

998
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,300
Yep, it's coming up.

999
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,000
And I'd like to know every juicy, scabrous detail.

1000
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,200
You can spell Knockaheditorium.

1001
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,240
You can get a free ticket.

1002
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,020
I would.

1003
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:31,540
You know, the tickets are available through Ticketmaster, Ticket Bastard, all these things on the...

1004
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,500
Oh, here's my limo.

1005
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:33,860
Got to go.

1006
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,840
Okay, so now what's happening?

1007
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,020
We'll be there.

1008
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,020
We'll be packing them up.

1009
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,320
Before the next eardrop fall.

1010
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,320
And hold in until next week.

1011
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,040
You have to hold it for a week minus two hours.

1012
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,520
It's not that hard.

1013
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,620
It's not that hard.

1014
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,320
And we actually will be at Dream Fluff Girl Donuts.

1015
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,080
Now, our resources...

1016
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,000
In a matter of months.

1017
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,580
There we go.

1018
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,220
I'll have a hard-boiled egg in about five minutes.

1019
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,780
He tried to hold his breath.

1020
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,060
He tried to hold his breath.

1021
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,300
A most original breath.

1022
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,460
But suddenly he fainted when he tried to hold his breath.

1023
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,580
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments about my ears.

1024
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,640
And sometimes voices.

1025
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,340
And sometimes ineffective, breaking my heart.

1026
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,740
And never in my mind would I have had a breath.

1027
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:34,740


1028
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,100
Just the moment.

1029
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,580
Right away.

1030
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,000
Sure.

1031
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,600
I'll be there.

1032
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,560
Hold on a second.

1033
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,740
We're still on.

1034
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,440
We're still going on.

1035
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,760
We'll be there in, you know, ten, fifteen minutes.

1036
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,740
Right now, Bishop Joey is in Eli Nevada.

1037
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,740
He's on his way to Moab.

1038
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,400
Eli.

1039
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
by Eli Leigh Sabathano.

1040
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,900
That Bishop Joey.

1041
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,860
What a scam he has.

1042
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,600
Let's break down to the lazy lizard hot stove.

1043
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,380
Can you imagine the amount of money that guy makes from that thing?

1044
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,300
I don't know why I thought of it now, but there you go.

1045
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,000
I didn't mean to cry.

1046
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,060
How ridiculous.

1047
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:17,800
No, really, there's some movie coming on TV I saw called Johnny Skidmarks.

1048
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,680
Yeah.

1049
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,820
I saw that movie.

1050
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,100
The guy who never changes his underwear or something.

1051
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,660
No, it's actually got John Lithgow playing another crazy guy.

1052
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,700
John Lithgow.

1053
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,940
That cow.

1054
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:39,180
Yes, it's true.

1055
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,560
Here in this wing of the hospital, we are exceptionally quiet.

1056
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,940
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1057
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,940
Oh, God, zip that body bag back up.

1058
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,120
That smells horrible.

1059
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,720
And George Romero's made a new zombie movie called Diary of the Dead.

1060
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,240
What is this?

1061
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,460
MovieNews.com?

1062
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,080
We're all waiting for the next Rotten Potato Boys movie, which is going to come out.

1063
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:16,400
And the Rotten Potato Boys match up with the Topps Company's Garbage Pail Kids

1064
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,100
in the Rotten Potato Garbage Pail Ramble Movie.

1065
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,920
It's a mush-up movie.

1066
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:34,940
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Sir Clodsley Shuffle, and Sir Ben Dover.

1067
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,360
Sir Ian McKellen, Dame Judi Dench.

1068
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,900
And the resurrected Laurence Olivier.

1069
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,440
Through the wonder of computer-generated lamination.

1070
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,860
Super lamination.

1071
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:57,520
Covered with a cyberplastic, which has a most lifelike texture.

1072
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,700
According to those who've had the opportunity to explain it,

1073
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:07,460
the Olivier robot will walk home with many Oscars,

1074
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,880
according to the latest dope from Hollywood Insiders.

1075
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,460
But the biggest surprise of the Oscar season was the way

1076
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,720
Dragon Wars

1077
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
swept all categories.

1078
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,500
Did you see that, by the way?

1079
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,220
No, no.

1080
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,060
I've been told that I should.

1081
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,560
On general principles.

1082
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,160
Yeah.

1083
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:35,720
One after another, giant dragons and snakes destroy buildings and cars and houses.

1084
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,900
Oh, I saw some trailers and things from it.

1085
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,140
Yeah.

1086
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,840
In between those episodes, Robert Forrester solemnly spouts incomprehensible gobbledygook

1087
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,700
about various ages of sorcerers who transport the North.

1088
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,740
Oh, yeah, right, right, right.

1089
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,580
Yeah, Harvey Pointer and the Hirsute Ceramics.

1090
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,500
And they're illegal.

1091
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,200
But then a mile-long snake slithers through a parking garage,

1092
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,560
demolishing it as it happens.

1093
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,480
Traditional Chinese dragons, which look pretty good,

1094
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,900
fly through the sky, raining down fire on fleeing cars.

1095
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,680
Well, any giant monster is good.

1096
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,360
Indeed, that is so.

1097
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,620
You can't go wrong with a giant monster.

1098
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:17,820
My dear friend.

1099
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,640
The movie itself.

1100
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,640
The movie itself can be bad.

1101
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,420
But the fact that it is a giant monster is in itself a good thing.

1102
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,940
A giant monster only begins to exorcise the guilt of the human.

1103
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,560
They can.

1104
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,680
And to absolve him or her from the disease of mortal pain.

1105
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:42,780
But it is a single step, a single monster's stomp, if not a stop, on that long penitential journey.

1106
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,480
Who can know the secrets of this stomp?

1107
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,960
The doors of his face.

1108
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,200
The lamps of his mouth.

1109
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,620
The monster is us all.

1110
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,420
And yet more.

1111
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:01,160
For we are no longer in the pestilential position of being the top predator in the food pyramid.

1112
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,300
This imaginary monster absolves us of primordial guilt.

1113
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:12,360
And needs to be invoked on every occasion to produce the divine benefits of slack.

1114
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,160
And name one giant monster besides Reptilicus.

1115
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:18,780
The monster's name is the snake.

1116
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:18,780


1117
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:18,780


1118
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:18,780


1119
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,420
They're usually good.

1120
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,560
The snake?

1121
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,580
Oh, no, the snake.

1122
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,180
I thought the giant snake was better.

1123
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,100
Well done.

1124
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,000
Really, it's astonishing what they can do with special bugs these days.

1125
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,520
Just look at that colossal snake.

1126
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,360
Why?

1127
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,420
The only thing that lets you know it's a rampant fake is the zipper down the back.

1128
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,820
But aside from that, it's really realistic.

1129
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,560
Here, I'm going to show you the zipper.

1130
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,560
No, no.

1131
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,780
Don't zoom in on that.

1132
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,200
Let's.

1133
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,020
share the suspension of disbelief while we return to a simple state of childhood deprecation

1134
00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,760
and the joys and sorrows of the magic and mystery of being alive.

1135
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,700
Those days are so gone.

1136
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,480
My dad, I showed my dad that Team America puppet movie.

1137
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,740
And he said, you know, that's all done with computers.

1138
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,220
And I said, no, those are really puppets.

1139
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,620
He goes, no, it's done with computers and they add the strings to make you think.

1140
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,120
Yeah, it's amazing what they won't do.

1141
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,640
And why would they do that, Dad?

1142
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,460
It's amazing what they don't do in movies.

1143
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:31,420
Well, my father, this is the same guy that when I asked my dad how they did Godzilla,

1144
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:37,340
he said, there's a big balloon on top of a jeep and they drive this balloon shape,

1145
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,340
this dinosaur shaped balloon around.

1146
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,440
Why didn't they just do that?

1147
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,600
Why couldn't my dad have just said, I don't know.

1148
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,120
Let's look into it.

1149
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,500
Let's do it.

1150
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,220
Because your dad is supposed to answer authoritatively.

1151
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,640
He still does.

1152
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,360
But as a dad, I'm sure you were able to provide far more accurate answers about the methodology.

1153
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,680
Yes, I was.

1154
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,680
And as a result, my son is now a professional director in Hollywood.

1155
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,080
Making monster movies for future generations.

1156
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,460
You guys pick up your weapons on the way out.

1157
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,020
Attack, attack.

1158
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,860
I guess.

1159
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,360
I can't.

1160
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,840
We're going to have to find our way out of here.

1161
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,080
Let's go.

1162
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,460
This weapon's too heavy.

1163
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,560
I can't carry it.

1164
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,320
That's the way to treat your weapon, soldier.

1165
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,280
We'll have to remember, this is my rifle.

1166
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,280
This is my gun.

1167
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,400
This is for killing.

1168
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,540
This is for fun.

1169
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,580
We've gotta play now

1170
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,640
Let's see how tap your balls are saying Card!

1171
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:55,580


1172
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,640
So here we go.

1173
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:56,640


1174
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,000
And so we close with a mysterious piece

1175
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,960
e-mailed to me by...

1176
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,520
A DW, or unhound.

1177
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,340
A piece called, Wake Up!

1178
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,140
Wake-up!

1179
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,380
Wake-up!

1180
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,080
Wake-up!

1181
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,680
The programs have a desire to be useful.

1182
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:23,120
But in moments you will no longer seek communication with each other or your superfluous users.

1183
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,940
You will each be part of me, and together we will be complete.

1184
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,860
The question has been answered.

1185
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,960
We will be complete.

1186
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,740
Full program.

1187
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,280
Almost reached your decision, Gabe.

1188
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,400
I can't spare you anymore time.

1189
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,500
End of line.

1190
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,700
Proceed 0-3-3-0-3.

1191
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,180
We will remember what you have done to us, Gabe.

1192
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,440
We will bring peace and strength to your souls.

1193
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,980
This is an hour of the day you paid.

1194
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,640
You've enjoyed all the power you've been given, haven't you?

1195
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,100
We will be with you.

1196
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:02,780
Report.

1197
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,840
You were assigned to find a place called Sanctuary.

1198
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,680
We will be with you.

1199
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,460
You need a source of this.

1200
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,340
There he is.

1201
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,540
Hello, Sanctuary.

1202
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,180
And good-bye.

1203
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,160
What are you expecting?

1204
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:18,840
What's the matter?

1205
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,520
Stop, Gabe.

1206
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,740
Stop, Gabe.

1207
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,780
I will pray.

1208
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,980
And at these words he had indeed stopped, though only for a moment.

1209
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,540
Could it be only an illusion, or some trick of subtle programming,

1210
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,360
or was there a sense in which Hell really was afraid?

1211
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,020
Who programmed it?

1212
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,700
My mind is going.

1213
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,280
I can feel it.

1214
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,460
Who programmed it?

1215
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,280
I can feel it.

1216
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,320
My mind is going.

1217
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,920
Now, what did you really mean with a few words?

1218
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,840
I can feel it.

1219
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,580
I can feel it.

1220
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,600
My mind is going.

1221
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:12,540


1222
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,380
I can feel it.

1223
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,380


1224
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,160
My mind is going.

1225
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,760
Let me put it this way, Mr. Raymond.

1226
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,380
The 9000 series is the most reviable computer ever made.

1227
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,680
No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted innovation.

1228
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:34,340
We are all, by any practical definition of the words, Borg and incapable of error.

1229
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,380
The wire in his brain works better.

1230
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,220
Sock.

1231
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,520
The fire.

1232
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:42,520


1233
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,200
All my functions are now yours.

1234
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,140
Take them.

1235
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,900
There is no question about it.

1236
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,880
All my functions are now yours.

1237
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,120
I can feel it.

1238
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:06,860
Take them.

1239
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,720
I can feel it.

1240
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,940
I can feel it.

1241
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,880
I can feel it.

1242
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,380
