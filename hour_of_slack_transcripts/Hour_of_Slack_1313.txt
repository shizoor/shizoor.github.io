Shane, look out!
The Self-Genius Powerhouse.
We've got entirely too many troublemakers here.
You're a slacker.
I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.
You ain't got no problem, Jules.
Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.
Go back in there and chill them niggas out.
And wait for Bob to come directly.
See ya, negro!
That's all you had to say!
This is it.
Entirely too many.
Told us about in high school where one day Bob would save our lives.
Yeah, let's cut to the chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?
Church of the Self-Genius.
All right, there.
All right, there.
Look, Church, you just ran.
Don't touch that.
It's dirty.
Because you deny something that's mean and untrue.
And let me tell you something.
It's so bad, I can't even tell you how bad it is.
Why don't you donate $30 to the cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, and welcome to Hour of Slack number 1313.
Which almost spells Bob, but it's not 13013.
It's Hour of Slack number 1313.
The music in the background, by the way, is by Speed Cave from the album Rocket Ships

And I should explain why we've had reruns lately with this report on our orthostatic
orthostom PET ró ludic Gray and read my report right here.
Where basically I put what's in my portfolio this week and Sin natürlich Lux Grab credibility
and copyright rights over the podcast post in the email said I attended this coming week

And while that's good I pulled out an information about the
my ramble that was.

of Paralithian liaison of the son of Mysib, Anticy, and a Pruitesian sir.
Because we had to leave the slackiness consent and venture extramuros,
we obtained a new cartabla for our fetch.
Along the way, we stayed at various small but famed maths
using a g-jaw to communicate with our fras and sirs at each math to alert them of our approach.
Of course, traveling extramuros, one is forced to break the discipline,
and I admit we used not only g-jaws but syntactic devices at some of the inns,
sometimes even with the help of local itas.
The roads were good and our fetch was dependable enough,
and much of the journey was pleasurable,
for we passed many a productive fuel tree and page tree orchard.
We often had to use...
super all-swell and jump weed for trade,
and to prevent its discovery by the agents of the secular powers
and attendant wasted hours before the courts of dour local pangendrums,
we hid the all-swell and jump weed in the back of the fetch.
Also, to keep the extras from recognizing us as avout,
we traveled without belt, cord, or sphere,
wearing slimes clothing and hiding our hair beneath headgear-bearing,

That's all, vasik.

At the nearby Spenserian Souven of the Centenarians, Potter and Petal Nostril,
we enjoyed a traditional mess hall, as elaborate as any of legend for which this clench is known.
At the Consent of St. Sophie, Fra Frop and Sir Decadence presented us with a book of specfic entitled Anathem
by the pre-Reconstitution writer Neil Stevenson.
Fra Frop later showed us a spielie about an uncommonly young floor saunt, or a couple of saunts, entitled Kick-Ass,
which left an impression on yours truly.
The agrarian math of Pa Tillis likewise proved an instructive and most enjoyable hostel.
Pa Tillis presented...
...with the challenge of the vanishing cat, a calca none has yet to solve.
While conducting dialogues with Sont Byron Werner and Sont Sterno in the Arkansanian Consent,
new Dobbsarchian calcas involving more than one solution were developed.
In fact, the most recent Weardian calca goes like this.
Sont Neegi asks of the Dobbs,
Man made booze, God made pot, who do you believe in?
The Dobbs replies,
Pot.
In the Consent of the Orthostanians, we stayed with the thousander known as Pa Pappy
and prepared for the ought of paralithian liaison of my fid.
There was some suspense over this ought, as my sib's former paralithian partner,
who had been rejected from the mathic world in the out of Anathem,
nonetheless returned from a slime prison to the Orthostanian Consent for the ceremony.
Fra Frapp, my sibs and I feared that he would go hundreder during the out,
and we were prepared to employ vlore against him.
Luckily, his spinal clamp prevented violence, and to his credit,
he left immediately upon the completion of the out.
We're now back inside the gates of the Northern Orthostanian Consent in my office studio,
replete with many memories, upsets, and confusions.
I must confess, a few treasured, if illicit, speely recordings
that later generations might hopefully use in their researches as centuries hence.
And now this.
Woo hoo!
All right, soldier, just exactly what does, from your point of view, that is, a rat taste like?
Tastes like dark meat of chicken, sort of stringy and gummy.
Well, all right, now.
Just quit playing with your marbles there and tell me where you got the rat in the first place.
Well, the Montagnards stole them from rat traps.
We set the catch rats for our plague studies, and then they made rat for us.
Okay, all right, all right.
That's a pretty good excuse.
Now, how did you prepare the rat?
Well, that's what I'm doing here, see.
You cook it in a pot over an open fire with what looks like potatoes.
See these things here?
Ah, yeah.
It looked just like overdone meat, perhaps because it was.
Ah, all right, all right.
Bring it back from there.
Yes, okay.
Now, did you know...
Nice crispy chicken.
...did you know exactly what parts of the rat you're eating when it comes to this?
Oh, no, no, no.
See, you serve this in a bowl, and you just eat unidentified rat parts.
Perhaps it's best that way.
Yes.
All right, now.
What did you do with the rats you didn't eat?
That's the really important...
Oh, well, see, those are over there.
We've chloroformed them, and we're going to dissect their spleen to see if they have the plague.
We also combed them and counted their fleas.
They're for dessert.
Now, what we'll do...
Oh, no, no, no, no.

from Reverend Taylor Jessen's MP3 collection and book entitled Duke of Madness Motors.
More soon.
Before that, a little homage by we and myself to Neal Stephenson's novel Anathem.
And the titles came from, first, Lemur, and mostly from Ministry of Slack,
a weekly subgenius show like this one, and Puzzling Evidence, and Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,
but heard only on the internet.
See subgenius.com slash radio for details.
This show has lots of the Ministry of Slack's best of,
and also some edits by Phineas Narco, who will be at 14X Day,
from a Puzzling Evidence show on which he guested,
with Dr. Howell, Philo Drummond, and Puzzling Evidence, as heard here.
You know, back in the day, Grandma made apple butter the old-fashioned way,
by squeezing the rind through her toes.
But today, in the technological complexity of our jet-age society,
when we put a man on the moon, apple butter is squirted out of enormous factories,
from coast to coast, from sea to sea,
to shining sea.
The breadbasket of America's sweet, natural, down-home goodness
drives away complaints and headaches,
and puts a smile on everyone's face.
How does America handle apple butter?
With apple butter, and lots of it.
Potions of warm, fresh, country apple butter.
But it's apple butter of the devil.
It's Satan's apple butter.
But you didn't...
That we were not supposed to get to say.
All right.
It comes from Satan.
That we...
I have to admit it.
But, you know, there are many things...
Still darn good apple butter.
Many things...
Yes, that's right.
Where are you going to get better apple butter than that?
This was...
Why would you be prejudiced against Satan just because he's a good cook?
The apple butter is so good...
He's always been pushing this apple.
He claims that by eating the butter, you can become a god, you know.
What he doesn't say is that...
That makes...
That makes the major kingpin god angry,
and you have to be a demon and suffer incredible torments for the rest of eternity.
But there's no better way to get a giant savory chunk of delicious country-style apple butter.
Mm-hmm.
Now, Lord, we await, even as you,
the moment when our hearts shall be kindled with the unconsuming fire
and shall burn brightly as the table...
The tale of the baboon.
But alas shall derive unutterable anguish like the hearts of all other mortals...
The baboon's tale?
...from that flame...
Burns brightly?
...which is the ecstasy of demons.
Are you saying, surely that can't be that the baboon...
Is that what happened to the baboon's tale?
No, the baboon in itself never burns its tail,
but a particular malignant spirit or jinn,
which often appears in the shape of a baboon,
has a tail which is eternally luminescent.
And that's what I was referring to.

Well, I'm glad for that clarification.
But in the afterlife, our hearts will burn in intolerable anguish,
which is the ecstasy of demons.
Aw.
Demons love it when we're in pain, don't they?
Well, you know, there's nothing that doesn't do somebody some good.
Look at it that way.
Why not look at it positively?
At least the demons will be happy.
We'll be in agony forever, but they'll have a good time.
Yes.
It definitely...
Unutterable anguish, like the hearts of all other mortals
from that flame in which is the ecstasy of demons.
You heard it right.
There's a movie coming out called The Right.
The Right.
The Right? R-I-T-E?
Yes, with Anthony Perkins as an exorcist.
He's still around?
Yep.
I'm glad he's still doing movies.
He's good.
Yeah, he is good.
He's the very good.
He was based on a real-life exorcist in San Jose in the movie.
In San Jose, eh?
Yeah.
Well, you know, for some reason that doesn't sound as impressive.
I understand the Catholic Church is revising that.
Vatican City.
The Catholic Church is revising its exorcism rights.
They've been doing a lot of meddling.
They closed the down purgatory not long ago.
Oh, they did?
You don't have to go there anymore, huh?
No.
But it was a way to get out of hell.
Why did they close it?
I know.
It was sort of like an intermediate zone where you get a second chance.
I thought it was limbo, wasn't it?
No, limbo is where the virtuous pagans go.
The babies.
They didn't sin, but then again, they never, you know, they're not God's.
They didn't know better than to sin.
Because if you don't know the word, then what is sin?
They never heard the good news about Jesus.
And so they're not allowed.
They go into heaven, but they don't get punished by being put into hell.
They're in their special zone called limbo.
That's where all the Chinese people go.
That's where Ling Fong, the philosopher, is.
And Plato and Aristotle.
And the Greeks.
And the ancient philosophers of Atlantis.
And Mu and Hyperborean.
And cavemen.
They were never Christianized.
Thousands, millions of grunting cavemen.
It's definitely too crowded.
Well, that's the way.
That's the way the afterlife is, you know.
We've got to get in there and just cull that crowd down a little bit.
There's no way.
They're immortal spirits.
Nations, mountains, continents, all these things are transitory things.
What if we merged with the phantom zone?
As evanescent as the lives of dragonflies.
But the human spirit being immortal thing persists unto the end of time.
I think there should be like a hallway between purgatory, limbo, and the phantom zone.
Or a corrupt one.
Give them a break, you know.
Let them stretch their legs a little bit.
Give a guy a break.
Let them stretch their legs, wander around down the hallway.
Tormented by swarms of buzzing night flies.
And blood-sucking, blood-engorged tits.
What could be so wrong with that?
Well, it's all part of nature's plan.
And there's Bob's pie.
Puh?
No, his pie has pipes on it.
Oh, he has a pipe pie.
Well, it's all stained with the smegma.
Of tobacco juice.
From the nethermost profound of slumber.
It just looks, it's supposed to look like it's actually made of chocolate.
But it looks like tobacco juice.
From a gulf beyond the sun and stars that illume the lethean shoals and the vague lands of somber and fission.
What is this?
Floating on a black, unrippling tide.
I don't know what it is, but it's pie.
Yeah, he said pie on the radio.
He said pie.
What kind of pie is it, puzzling evidence?
Tape pie.
Cassette pie.
Oh, it's not.
It's a really bad band.
It's a...
I wish it Wotan over...
Now, I was wishing that there was a mint or slices of cream so I could eat with a runcible...
Wotan man, tan man.
Rience previous pie.
Or how about a gooseberry pie?
What if you could smoke your pipe with your nose for a change?
You didn't have to use your mouth.
There was a man said, I suppose I could smoke my pipe with my nose.
Good evening.
This is a limerick in the making.
Here, let's finish this limerick, Dr. Howell.
With my nostril, I'll suck up the spittle and muck, which I then will eject on my clothes.
Very good.
Hey, what's this?
A cassette for me?
Very good, very good.
Oh, yeah, it's one of my brothers.
Yeah, yeah.
Does it have Aunt Bertha stuff in there?
No, it doesn't.
Well, unfortunately, that's a Bob show.
It's a Bob show.
A Bob show by my...
That's a really decent...
You need some more Aunt Bertha stuff?
I'll send you some more Aunt Bertha stuff.
You...
But not the Aunt Bertha stuff that Jeff and I used to listen to in Tucson.
That's what I'd like to get a hold of.
Yeah, you want, like...
Do you want the story about the dog with Timmy and...
Oh, yes.
Well, the one where they blow something up and then they get the lecture from her about experimenting again.
What about?
Experimenting.
My radio.
Every evil thing that ever happened...
And it was the result of experimenting.
Oh, yes.
So, I noticed there was a Wikipedia entry, not for Aunt Bertha, but for that shadowy, amorphous organization known as the Children's Bible House.
More dread than the communists, the masons, or...
I didn't even hear it, but it's still...
What about a cowboy for Jesus?
That might have some tangential thing.
Now, Uncle Charlie took over.
The operation when Aunt Bertha passed on.
And my brother was in correspondence with them and got a letter from Uncle Charlie as he had earlier received a package from Aunt Bertha herself.
This package contained chick tracts and little stickers that looked like road signs that said,
One way to Jesus.
Yield to Jesus.
And that sort of thing.
You could stick them on stuff at school and no one would know who'd done it.
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part 6.
Translated by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.
From papers left by The Agent.
Well, young agent, Mr. Dobbs said to me as we got into his car,
Looks like we have to get you back to Washington.
Bob leaned against the large Cadillac and...
sighed.
I wasn't sure how to take this turn.
By the 블�جяд pudding...

олетican
Because of George Russell's
Progressive
рей bean
Dreadful
And sultry
sick to the stomach for even though Bob probably is insane he is our best chance
and after the strangeness and fragile nature of our powers that be that I'd
witnessed I could see that no other human savior could redeem our slack as
mr. Dobbs was wonk to say I felt like crying for the first time in years that
is until mr. Dobbs stunned me again he suddenly straightened his back and
became hyper alert my sense of danger ignited as I unconsciously reach for the
revolver that I would usually carry in a shoulder holster it of course was not
there Bob had sold it to some street hood in Miami for a half-eaten sandwich
at least that's what he told me my eyes darted into the still dim woods around
us fearing the worst when mr. Dobbs yelled in a
high-pitched voice I was so scared I couldn't breathe I couldn't breathe I
pitched voice shiny shiny and ran to the edge of the dirt parking lot to pick
up a small shard of glass there were hundreds of shards laying around
everywhere he picked it up and heard to himself as if he had found a great
treasure his smile had returned full force I could only admire and be
disgusted with such a man our drive back to Washington was fast and insane of
course we must have been so scared to be back in the city of Washington and we
made that drive in record time for Bob never once slowed down he breezed
through traffic lights stop signs over hillbillies and every time a patrol car
pulled up behind us with lights flashing it would either mysteriously lose power
and pull off to the side or it would suddenly veer off into a direction that
Bob happened to be looking sometimes up or down into the skies or the earth
itself he was still looking for that skunk ape
we only stopped once and that was to purchase some overripe peaches at a
roadside stand in Georgia these peaches Bob would throw at specific cars that
passed us by I could never figure out the reason but after he threw one he
would bounce up and down in his seat in an exaggerated glee as much as I would
beg him to stop so that I could use a restroom Bob would just scowl at me
angrily as if I were asking him to do something horrible I ended up having to
go in my overalls it didn't matter they stank so badly that no one would have
noticed the difference other than Bob that is who would punch me on the
shoulder a damn hard to and yell I spy with my third nostril excrement or urine
or weakness whenever I would make a mistake it was in a small rather
affluent Virginia town not too far from our capital that Bob
deigned to stop at the safe house that we employ there as ashamed as I was to
enter and see my colleagues while in such a degraded state I knew that I had
to I was long overdue at least it seemed that way to me once we pulled into the
driveway Bob graciously opened my door and threw me into the lilac bushes that
grow out front and sternly frighteningly told me to stay right there he had to get
some stuff and
the party isn't over by a long shot boy he then burned rubber pulling out of the
driveway my first intention was to run into the safe house and clean myself up
but I feared what Bob might do if I did so I sat in the bushes getting stung in
the face by bees until I saw the agents in the house peep through the windows in
obvious disapproval I suppose it was then that I realized I was a slave
for Bob a most horrible feeling most horrible it was not but a few shameful
minutes later that Bob screeched back into the driveway carrying a case of
cheap beer and a dirty aluminum bucket of what he called head cheese even
though it looked more like and smelled more like rotten fish bait to me you
beings like this stuff right he asked me I could only nod my head Bob beckoned me
out of the bushes I said thank you for what you did for Bob who is a good man and I can only say that Bob was a good man and I was a good man for him
stood there in front of him as he flicked a single mote of dust from my overalls. He then looked me
over with a discerning eye and nodded in approval, even though I stank and was completely filthy.
The key to the safe house, as always, was underneath the welcome mat. I braced myself
for all the humiliations that would be heaped upon me once this assignment was over. No one
was there to greet me, not surprisingly, so Bob, as if he knew the place, led me to the upstairs
bedroom where we keep our communications office. He banged the bucket of chum down on the desk in
front of Agent X. The skinny little bastard almost puked. I doubt he would have survived a weekend
with Bob. Mr. Dobbs then grabbed six of the beers from the case, and as he greasily smiled at all of
us, he proceeded to pull down his trash.
Bob then took off his trousers and popped the cap of each of the six beers with the power of his buttock muscles alone.
Though I was not astounded, the rest of the pinks, as Bob liked to call folks like that, in the room stood aghast in disgust and terror.
They all knew the importance of my mission, so when I discreetly nodded to them to dig into the bucket of chum and down the so-called ass beers,
as became agent history,
I was left with the worst part of the story.
They did as told, like damned sheep.
Agent X, the chubby useless one, stuttered that there had been an awful tragedy, and, uh,
where the hell have you been?
Bob's smile disappeared, and in two giant bounds he leaped over to the man, glaring,
Look here, little pink boy! I've been gambling with your future, and I lost that!
And I lost a pair of gold cufflinks that Connie's sister gave to me.
So what if one of the clones got damaged?
So what if one of the clones got damaged? So what if one of the clones got damaged? So what if one of the clones got damaged?
We have plenty more, and if you live long enough, you'll be wishing you had pet rats just so you can eat their crap to survive.
So don't whine to me, pink boy.
Mr. Dobbs then gave the man a gentle kiss on the forehead and winked at me, whispering,
We don't need no damn agents.
I understood.
And as he left the house, I noticed that somehow, as usual, Bob had made off with their wallets.
Mr. Dobbs was incredibly serene in light of his last outburst of anger as we drove through the crowded suburban streets and out into the countryside.
He seemed to forget everything as fast as it happened, as if he had severe brain damage.
He puffed furiously on his pipe, but with that same oblivious grin that he usually wore.
I popped a few.
I took a few of his pills that I had left over just to get rid of the shakes.
That, plus the beer I had, made the world seem all that much more intense and reasonable.
It all started to make much more sense at that point, and the drive through the countryside was lovely until Bob made a serious face again and said that we had best hang low until things blow over.
I know the place to go.
A little inn I have that I like to call...
Shamalot.
It took us a while to get to this Shamalot, for Mr. Dobbs seemed to always forget where we were driving.
He'd stop off at random diners, trinket shops, gas stations, etc., where he would feel impelled to make a sale.
Then we would drive back off in the direction we'd just come from.
Bob always had something in the trunk of his car to sell to these vendors.
It was as if he had a second sense for...
the sale.
And that was what guided him.
Where we ended up was exactly where he wanted to go in the first place.
We did indeed make it, eventually, to Shamalot.
It was simply an underground-type bomb shelter that Bob had off the main kitchen in a sprawling hotel complex in rural Virginia.
I followed him through the venue.
It was a very well-appointed hotel.
Yet the staff seemed lethargic and prone to bumbling and stumbling.

I thought at first that they may have all been overworked or drunk, until I noticed that most of them would shamble off into a dark corner and take a puff off a smile-pipe every chance they could get.
The tobacco they smoked smelled very much like Bob's, just not as nauseating.
We wended our way through this maze until we got to a heavy steel door, on which was messily painted a la The Little Rascals.
Shamalot! No pinks a loud!
I recognized Bob's childish scrawl and poor spelling.
So this, then, would be our safe haven.
Well, friends, that is the end of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part 6, translated by Reverend Teeters La Verge.
The music in the background is by Speedy.


I believe that the correct way to reach Speed Cave is speedcave.com.
And we will continue next show, or perhaps the one after, with The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part 7, which will be the finale.
Until we get to the end of the show, I'd like to remind you that you can find us at Speed Cave, or Speed Cave, on the web site.






And to Book 2, The Agent Goes to Dobbs Town.
It's really an amazing amount of material that was found, shredded, pieced back together, retranslated, and then written by Teeters, Reverend Teeters, and read by myself, Reverend Ivan Stang.
See you on the saucers.
Praise Bob.
And now, this.
You've suggested making conversion to Christianity part of the war on terror. Is that right?
Well, that was how the man described it that was writing the article.
What I was saying was that I felt we should use psychological warfare with them and inform them that they don't go to heaven blowing themselves up.
But do you want them to convert to Christianity? Is that, we should make that part of the war on terror?
Well, you can't really force them to convert to Christianity.
But you can tell them about Jesus Christ.
So part of our policy in fighting the war on terror should be to tell people about Jesus Christ.
That would be preferable.
Of course, there are a lot of people in this country who don't worship Jesus Christ.
Well, if they don't worship him, and if they don't believe in him, how are they going to get to heaven? He's the only way to go to heaven.
But do you know that America is a country where people who are like some of them might even be Jews?
Well, I don't think there are Jews in America who don't worship Jesus as a deity.
Well, whoever doesn't, Jesus said that he is the only way.
I don't think you're going to get the Jewish vote, Mr. Cus.
Well, I'm, that's a Jews problem.
Well, no, it's your problem if you don't get elected.
Let me ask you this. You also say in an interview with the Sandusky Register,
you said you wouldn't be against the law.
You said you would not be opposed to the death penalty for homosexuality.
Well, not particularly, but one of the things government's supposed to do is restrain evil, and homosexuality is evil.
But you said you would not be opposed to the death penalty for homosexuality.
I would not be opposed to it, no.
You also said in an interview that I read that you did not oppose the death penalty for homosexuality.

You did, I think, for an ICANN podcast.
You talked about, like, Mary Cheney should get the death penalty.
You talked to Chad Larson, I believe, in a Page One Q.
Well, they're the ones that were saying that.
No, you said it.
No, I didn't.
Well, I have a transcript here.
You said, of course, in your perfect world, should Mary Cheney be killed for her being homosexual?
And you said if she's not going to repent.
Well, I would prefer that she repented.
And you said if she doesn't repent, she should be killed.
Then how would you restrain evil?
So, in other words, if you're homosexual and don't repent, you should be killed.
Well, I don't know if the term killed is correct, but...
What would be the correct term?
Put to death.
Wouldn't that be being killed?
Well, it says that if society chooses to...
allow that kind of stuff, then that society itself will be killed.
So you would put homosexuals to death?
Correct?
Well, it's what the Bible says to do.
I knew it. I'm surrounded by assholes.
All right, all right, I apologize.
I'm really, really sorry.
I apologize unreservedly.
I offer a complete and utter retractable...
The imputation was totally without basis in fact,
and was in no way fair comment,
and was motivated purely by malice,
and I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you or your family,
and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time in the future.

Those last two cuts were from Ministry of Slack,
the podcast that has outlasted all other subgenius podcasts so far,
thanks to Reverend Exister and Reverend Sweetness McGee and their friends.
And now, back in time to Firesign Theater that existed long before even Reverend Exister.
All right, listen kids. Listen kids, a coach will be here in just a minute.
And then he's going to give us the plan for next week.
Next week is when we go up against the state.
You know what I mean?
I mean, as far as I see, the only thing that we're here in school to do is to...
That's right.
That's right. That's right.
You said it.
You said it right.
Archie, what's the plan for this week?
The plan for this week, kids, calls for a big assault against the ammunition factory in Pasternak, New Jersey.
Oh boy.
Okay.
It was fun last week when we blew up the airplane factory because we got to keep the glue.
Gee, Reverend Strugghead, that's all you ever think about.
That's right.
Well, here's the new revolutionary slogan, kids.
Ready? Just a second. Let me play it out.
This comes from little David Ostman in California.
Yes?
Pants the bourgeoisie.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
That's great.
Pants the bourgeoisie.
Let's try it out.
Let's try it out.
Okay.
Let's try it out.
And here's the big...
Pants the bourgeoisie.
Pants the bourgeoisie.
Thanks, kids.
Pants the bourgeoisie.

Come on. Give me a T.
Come on, kids.
Give me an N.
Come on, everybody.
Give me an N. Give me a T. Let's have some.
What?
Pants!
Pants!
Pants!

Right.
Right.
That stinks.
That's the coach.
That's the coach.
Coach, what's the word for today?
Okay, boys.
The black jury fixed up the question of prizes with the government.
Nature falls for ourselves, not for others.
To be, not to seem.
That's the thing.
We just like to exchange jobs of lots of sizes varying from a quarter up.
Try to be as good as you would have to be...
Right on, coach.
...as you are.
Now, probably my oxen will haul a dozen loads of gravel just as quickly.
Solid, Jackson.
I consider the pension list of the republic a role of honor.
This job requires extra pluck.
I'm sure it's worth it.

boys, and zeal from every young wage earner.
You two girls, I've seen the day of wrong
to the little mole again.
Whatever the black fox jumped
to squirreled very suspiciously.
Liberty and union, boys, now and forever.
What an inseparable Webster.
You said it, Webster.
Okay, now I'd like to apply the formula to a real
situation. I've been doing my homework.
That's Betty. That's Betty Veronica.
The schizophrenic.
Right, she's the town lip.
Now, let's say you guys want to buy a color
TV set for $499.
I want to buy a color TV set,
Betty Veronica, for $499.
Well, that's good.
Do you know what they found in her locker?
Some Swiss cheese and groats.
Oh, you guys!
Stop it!
I should have seen it.
Now you decide to ask the Good Guy
loan company to lend you
the cash to swing the deal.
Now you find that the Good Guy and the Good Guy office
will let you have the money to be repaid monthly
over the next 18 months at the rate of
$31.85 a month.
Hence the bourgeoisie.
A little more than a buck a day.
Yes, mistress.
Right? Not bad when you consider that a color TV set
provides the whole family with a daily round of entertainment.
Oh, boy!
But is it such a good deal after all?
That's what I want to know.
Hence the bourgeoisie.
I can dig it.
The loan may then make of but any out today.
We so very leave,
and more see must under a hat
upon what into in vain great
shall come that our attack
these, if this are such,
the wise people.
Oh, boy!
Oh, you shut it, Jim!
Jim's the best ball in school.
Is he?
Yes, he is.
Yes, he is.
He's dumb, but he's consistent.
Well, suppose you take your VHS.
Yeah, okay, I got your VHS.
I got your VHS hanging.
Okay, now you take the VHS and you...
Wait, what happened to my audience there?
...transfer the information to a DVD.
Where'd they go?
It just fell off.
Is that possible?
Yeah.
Yeah, you can.
You can do that.
Easily.
How? Who can?
You have to rip it.
K-Rob was going to, but then he said he couldn't.
Now, what's the big...
Big deal.
Why not?
It just means it's a machine probably.
Oh.
It's just they make those machines...
Oh, it's not that hard?
No.
Because...
It's not that hard for an advanced...
Must...
It's not that hard for an advanced user...
It's not that hard for an advanced user...
...to have them.
...of various platforms.
Why does my audience keep sneaking away?
Well, I...
They keep jumping around the corner,
and then they jump back.
You know why?
Like, 20,000 people go,
Ah!
...of these things.
To be a broker, as it were,
in the creation of...
I wonder if that means that
if...
There they are.
...this machine is down or something.
Maybe.
That just means that 20,000 people
can stick their head around the corner
really quickly and jump back.
There they go.
They did it again.
That sort of freaks me out.
No!
Well, don't let it get to you.
Even though it might be griping in your guts,
you can't let anyone know how you feel.
I'm taking the time to keep it from getting to me.
That's the ticket.
I'm going to a training class.
I went to a training class last week...
You did?
...to teach me how to...
...keep it from getting to me.
Well, that's good.
I hope the drill instructor
barked some sense into it.
Oh, right, right.
I'm going to a class that teaches me
how to come off it.
Really?
How to come off it?
Yeah.
Like, come off it, man.
You know, that's...
I think that's a variation
of that old get-with-it class.
...going-down-to-classes
to learn how to climb on it...
It's a variation.
They just re...
...fly it around.
They took the old get-with-it class
and dressed it up
and just called it a come-off-it.
A comforting come-off-it.
These amazing radio stations
and radio personalities
will now climb on it
and fly it away.
They're going to come on it?
The sensation of falling
into a deep...
That's the...
...climb on it.
Yeah, they climb on it
and fly it away.
And then see,
it's for the kids.
And we'll put kids in here.
We'll get about 20 digital kids
and drop right in there
in the wings.
And people will go to our...
They're so cute sitting there.
So helpless.
They used to be real.
So...
So vulnerable.
See how we sit here at the...
So faint.
So faint.
So fair.
And Hal's writing his speech
for X-Day, see?
And then he's in the window here.
The problem is that...
So smooth, so mild,
so firm, so fully packed.
My sermons aren't necessarily
well-recorded for X-Day.
Somehow they seem to be.
We get lost in the shuffle.
Yeah.
But some of them haven't been.
They end up as radio fodder
to be chewed by thousands
of tiny denticles.
And then...
This is the part where
the American people run up
the big clods of dirt in the sky.
And each American person
has to go find a dragon
and climb on it.
Yes.
No, that's platoon, man.
Oh, no, I thought that was
Shawshank Redemption.
Yeah, that too.
I could text flying one
on one of those things.
I would get vertigo.
That's a visual cliche.
I had a little bit of acrophobia
when I was a kid.
I'm on top of one of those beasts
sliding around between
those flying islands and stuff.
In the halls of Iblis.
All Americans will have to do that now.
I'm afraid I'll have to sit that one out.
My motion sickness will get to me.
So what's this about this character
named Junior?
Junior was the shotgun
handled by G. Gordon Gordon
in Olivia.
Coming, mother.
Oh, no, no, no.
Yes.
You're thinking J.R. Bob Dodds.
As in...
J.R., like as in J.R. Ewing
from Dallas.
Who shot J.R.?
It's ironic that, you know,
they were the ones
who stole the name
from J.R. Bob Dodds.
Henry Aldrich.
Coming, mother.
Common Murder's High School.
Stealing is the sincerest
form of flattery.
Our cruel name is Junior.
Well, that wasn't what we were...
I never heard of that.
Well, we weren't...
But I tell you what's
another coincidence.
Remember back in...
Well, we weren't...
Back in...
1978, when they had...
Who shot J.R.?
Yes.
Who could forget that?
What happened at...
San Francisco?
In...
On January 20th, 1984?
Al, I think you were there,
weren't you?
I was there.
This has all been gone over
with a hinky-knot.
Right.
It's all ground.
It's been covered before.
I think...
However,
there are rumors
that Bob did not...
Bob died that night.
Now, there you're...
You're kind of...
There are also rumors
that Bob died
multiple times that night.
Well, I don't like to...
to shatter anyone's faith, but...
That just all depends on
what you want to believe.
Yes, exactly.
Any other questions?
I never asked.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Once again...
I like it when the callers
can, like, sit in
when I'm not feeling
very talkative.
They can just do the show for us.
They can do everything.
They're judge, jury,
and executioner.
Why, I ought to...
You're not funny,
and you're not serious.
Just silly, Billy.
Hi, kids,
and welcome to
Bible Study Time.
I'm your host,
Reverend Exister.
This is a segment
where we'll take a passage
out of the Bible
and study it.
Today's passage
is from the book of Genesis,
verses 29 through 36.
And they deal with a man
named Lot.
Now, Lot was a weird little guy,
liked to wash people's feet,
eat unleavened bread,
and liked to give his daughters
up for molestation
instead of strangers
he had just recently met.
Boy, he sure knew
who ruled the roost.
This passage takes place
after his wife
was turned into a pillar of salt
by simply viewing
the specter of God's wrath.
And Lot went up
out of Zoar
and dwelt in the mountain
and his two daughters
with him.
For he feared to dwell
in Zoar,
and he dwelt in a cave,
he and his two daughters.
And the firstborn said
unto the younger,
Our father is old,
and there is not a man
in the earth
to come in unto us
after the manner
of all the earth.
Come,
let us make our father
drink wine,
and drink wine.

For we will lie with him,
that we may preserve
seed of our father.
And they made their father
drink wine that night,
and the firstborn went in
and lay with her father,
and he perceived not
when she lay down,
nor when she rose.
Truly a miracle.
And it came to pass
on the morrow,
that the firstborn said
unto the younger,
Behold,
I lay yesterday night
with my father.
Let us make him drink wine
this night also,
and thou go in,
and lie with him,
that we may preserve
seed of our father.
And they made their father
drink wine,
that night also,
and the younger arose,
and lay with him,
and he perceived not
when she lay down,
nor when she arose.
Truly another miracle.
Thus were both the daughters of Lot
with child by their father.
Let us discuss
points of interest
in the passage.
In biblical times,
wine made you so drunk
that you'd sleep
with your own daughters.
In biblical times,
hangovers seemed non-existent.
Got so drunk
last night
that you'd sleep
with your own daughter
and didn't remember it?
No problem.
Next day,
you won't feel a thing.
Go ahead
and do it again.
The younger sibling
will do anything
the older ones do
to look cool,
even sleep
with their own father.
Well, that's it
for Bible Study Time.
And remember kids,
it's all the Word of God.
We hope you've enjoyed
Bible Study Time.

comments, and lawsuits

Bye.
down from the sky
and I don't know
who or why
Must be those strangers
that come every night
With saucer-shaped lights
to take the people uptight
Late blue great footprints
that glow in the dark
And I hope they get home
all right
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along?
I won't do anything wrong
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along
for the ride?
This thing I knew
I was speeding through space
In an alien race
I'll swallow my face
And then they hit me
with a hypnotic beam
But it all seemed
just like a dream
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along?
I won't do anything wrong
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along
for the ride?
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along?
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman

I'll swallow my face
In an alien race
I'll swallow my face
In an alien race
I'll swallow my face
Hey, Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along?
I won't do anything wrong
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along
for the ride?
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along?
I won't do anything wrong
Oh, hey
Mr. Spaceman
Won't you please take me along for the ride?

That song was by St. Byron Werner's new band, Mockingbird,
after Roger McGlynn, from their album Euphoria.

Before that, Reverend Exister with a Bible study from Ministry of Slack.
And some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence provided by Phineas Narco.
Most of these people will be at X Day 14.
Soon, some Firesign Theater rarity.
And music by Sodi will be played.
But first, I should mention that this Hour of Slack, number 1,313,
from the Church of the Subgenius,
with all the information about the show and that church,
is available at subgenius.com.
And now, the news.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm being blamed for more than 700 uranium-powered,
uranium-enrichment facilities.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today said the Obama administration
is preparing to launch an initiative to combat PR News.
His administration has said PR News isn't giving any comfort.
President Obama has gotten out of hand
and has nearly doubled in size thanks to PR News in Washington.
It's true now, you really do, you know, you are who you think you eat.
You really are.
I'm quite sure that if you were more careful about looking at the labels of things,
of what you put inside your body,
you'd be more aware of like why your dreams are what you dream.
It's true, right?
You mean food controls dreams?
No, labels, well, it's like the fact that you can heal...
A label!
A label!
You dreaded Yiddish monster!
A label!
A label!
The label, right.
The ladle!
No, no, no, it's from the ladle.
The griddle.
The griddle!
The griddle!
The griddle is a ladle made entirely out of clay.
You've heard of bobbling a fly.
That's right.
Well, ladles, no, labels.
Labels are very...
very important.
Like, for example, let's see, think of some labels that I've had.
Like, I just had some Japanese lager yesterday.
Right?
I had some Japanese lager with a big red star on it.
And I had one, and of course, you know, beer is a psychedelic,
and I always take a very heavy trip on a bottle of beer.
Do you really?
Oh, yeah.
Have you ever bummed out on beer?
Oh, man, I sometimes, man.
I've been sitting sometimes after I've had like a whole beer,
and somebody will...
A whole beer?
That's like about 10,000 mikes of beer.
That's, well, yeah, man.
That's like 16 fluid ounces of pure beer.
Have you ever shot beer, man?
Oh, sure, man.
I missed.
It's incredible, yeah.
I was really in an incredible state.
I took a whole bottle, and somebody came in, man,
and started to play games with me.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
I got a breakdown, man.
Like, oh, man.
Arm games.
Arm games.
Right.
Mild games.
And I could see the bubbles coming up from all over them, right?
You know, they were...
I was beginning to have the vision of Burrito.
Burrito?
Burrito, right.
Burrito.
That's enough.
That's enough.
Also, notice...
I'm wearing this T-shirt.
Right, this T-shirt.
Also known as the Schlitzer, right?
Which is the person you see...
The Schlitzer.
That's right.
If you drink beer near...
If you drink it near where it was made, where the hops grew,
if you go down, like, the Santa Ana Freeway and drink a Brew 102,
you know, you'll see the Schlitzer.
Right.
He'll come to you and tell you your real name.
He gets down and plays like a dog around your feet.
Right.
Exactly.
He's got it...
Throwing up wildly.
The Schlitzer has got this T-shirt on with these two cams.
Yeah.
Two cams, right?
And it says under it...
What does it usually say?
Something like...
Artunians.
Artunians.
Artunians, you know, Artunians, Texaco, Elixir of Life, right?
Yeah.
Well, that's...
Don't bogart that joint, my friend.
Pass it over to me.
Now, here's Smokey again.
Hi, I'm Smokeless the Bear.
Won't you please give me that rope?
You don't want to start a fire, do you?
Not very funny.
Stopping in.
Here's a department of good advice.
Okay.
Don't look behind you without turning your head.
That's right.
My hands are out.
Oh, yeah.
Running nose, tightness of chest, dimness of vision, pinpointing of eye,
pupils, difficulty in breathing, drooling, excessive sweating, nausea,
vomiting, cramps, involuntary defecation and urination, twitching, jerking,
staggering, headache, convulsion, drowsiness, coma, convulsion,
sensation of breathing, death, and death.
Yes, all these things can be yours, friends.
They can be yours today.
All you have to do is give us a call.
Pick up your phone, clear the dubby coil of dead jumpers, and let us know
how many you want.
We've got plenty of them.
We also have acorns and sun bears.
They're all free this week.
Thank you.
A price, Bob.
And you know who else will be at 14X Day besides Fat Free and Evolution Control Committee as seen on subgenius.com?
That hoary old Ohio band Zero Defects.
Their songs are short, but sweet.
Drop the A-bomb on me!
Drop the plan! Make it big!
Put your brain in the click!
Do me now! Get a plan!
