1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
This is London.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Sink into the abyss of a new dark age,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,420
made more sinister and perhaps more protracted

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,240
by the likes of perverted science.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,440
The subgenius power of flesh!

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,680
This was their finest hour.

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,080
Master of

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:53,980
I turn our heads into sin,

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,760
and I pray.

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,980
Tears slip into my eyes,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,060
I remember the spring days so that they don't spill out

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,640
Like a lonely night

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,420
I look up and walk

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,340
I count the stars that have blurred

15
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,020
I remember the summer days

16
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,660
Like a lonely night

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,160
Happiness is on the clouds

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Happiness is on the clouds

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:00,960
I look up and walk

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,820
I count the stars that have blurred

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,720
Like a lonely night

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,600
Like a lonely night

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,740
I remember the spring days

24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,900
Like a lonely night

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Happiness is on the clouds

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,600


27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,600


28
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,600


29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I remember the spring days

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,260
Like a lonely night

31
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,720
Like a lonely night

32
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,840
Happiness is on the clouds

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,220
Happiness is on the clouds

34
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:06,660
I look up and walk

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,320
I count the stars that have blurred

36
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,540
Like a lonely night

37
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:17,560
Like a lonely night

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,560
I walk, crying, so that they don't spill out

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,200
Like a lonely night

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,280
Like a lonely night

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,840
Like a lonely night

42
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,980
Oh, that was the Martian National Anthem as the audio file was titled,

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,380
also known as Sukiyaki, by Kyou Sakamoto.

44
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,420
On this hour of Slack number 1754 we'll continue with

45
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,500
last week's conversation with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

46
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,840
recorded by phone from Ohio,

47
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,880
here in Tarzan's radio station at Stang Ranch,

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:19,060
Texas. But we'll be alternating it with all manner of weird music plus unheard subgenius radio and

49
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:26,620
podcast ranting from both X Day with Dr. Howland, Dr. Philodrum and also from Overlord Animal and

50
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,360
Dr. Brouhaha of Austin. But first, Dave explains the problem with utilitarianism.

51
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,340
You know what will happen if you support a utilitarian? You'd have to be reduced to your

52
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,840
lowest common denominator. And I guess that's two thirds or something like that. And then you

53
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,860
have to, once again, you have to report to the police station every month or two.

54
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:58,720
Now who wants to go on living like that? Not I. Hey, speaking of living like that, Dave, we found

55
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:08,900
a place where if you became homeless and didn't have any place else to go, we found a place that

56
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,960
was a little bit more than just a place to live. And it's a little bit more than just a place to live.

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:11,980
And it's a little bit more than just a place to live. And it's a little bit more than just a place to live.

58
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,880
Princess, we remember we were exploring around my sister's deserted house.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,320
No.

60
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:27,560
Which she's going to be back in. But there was a camper top from like the top that you put onto a

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,940
pickup to turn your pickup into a camper. Well, just that part was laying an ancient one, like 50

62
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,000
years old, sitting on the ground back in the woods.

63
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,180
Oh, I love 50 year old.

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,320
I love 50 year old.

65
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,720
I love 50 year old.

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:39,940
I love 50 year old.

67
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:39,940


68
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:39,940


69
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:39,940


70
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:39,940


71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:39,940


72
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,000
I was thinking that was just like the perfect bedroom for Dave.

73
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,840
Yeah.

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,540
That's where Dave would stay.

75
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,540
Reverend Stang is always scoping out a place for you, Dave.

76
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,920
He's always looking for a good place for you.

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,700
A place where it wouldn't be too much of a firehouse.

78
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,820
You see, I don't think that's a good place for Dave because it doesn't have toilet facilities

79
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,120
or any place for him to wash his hands.

80
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,580
Yeah.

81
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,540
I've had to go to the toilet every once in a while.

82
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,720
I know what that's like.

83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,260
It happened once.

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,140
Well, yeah.

85
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,660
It's not like he's got any goods.

86
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
He could, you know, he could just kind of let go of anything.

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,300
But I wouldn't want a rattlesnake to snap on my scrotum, if you know what I'm saying.

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,720
Thank you very much, Dave.

89
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,780
That's a good point.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,560
That's an ouchy point, too.

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,780
The ouchy point, yep.

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,660
Well, this camper top still has a window part that falls down, so you could lock it up at

93
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,860
night once you snuggled in there.

94
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,580
Yeah.

95
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,020
You'd only have about eight inches clearance.

96
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,500
In your bedroom.

97
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,800
But there is enough room to lay down out of the rain, you know.

98
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,900
And if he had a little, had enough hot peppers in there, rubbed all over his body, he'd stay warm.

99
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,480
Reverend Stang, you have a very great imagination.

100
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,240
Oh, I imagine all kinds of things.

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,040
Oh, yeah.

102
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,580
I imagine all kinds of things.

103
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,040
Isn't it true that you live?

104
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,320
Are you part of the time in an imaginary, entirely world?

105
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,160
No, I wish.

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,940
That's been my goal for my whole life.

107
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:25,240
I've come about as close as a fella can in the real world to live in an imaginary world

108
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,460
because all my friends, they don't have names like David or Mike or Trevor.

109
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,660
They have names like Pope Sternodocs, Dr. Philodromus.

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm all about the

111
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,300
old.

112
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm about the old.

113
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm about the old.

114
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,940


115
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,940


116
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,940


117
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,940


118
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,560
And lonesome.

119
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,860
See, lonesome has an O.

120
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Lonesome.

121
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,640
Lonesome.

122
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920
It's always got an O and an N sound, isn't it?

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,060
Are you saying you're isolated?

124
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,900
some data, some cruelty from this information?

125
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,340
Yeah, it's the big O.

126
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,440
The big O, it represents the zero,

127
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,820
the nothing in Buddhism.

128
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,140
The goal.

129
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,420
It also represents the big O, the orange juice.

130
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,800
If you ever had a big O that rolls up to Lawson's in 40 hours,

131
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
you roll on, big O.

132
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,020
Get the juice down to Lawson's in 40 hours.

133
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,580
It's an orange juice story from Ohio many years ago.

134
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,260
I was going to say, that must be an Ohio thing.

135
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,140
That one's not, draws a blank for me.

136
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,100
They guaranteed that that juice for sale,

137
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,460
that orange juice you would get at Lawson's,

138
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,760
which no longer exists.

139
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,400
It was a series of chain stores like 7-Elevens and stuff.

140
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,780
The orange juice was guaranteed from Melrose, Florida, 40 hours.

141
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,620
If it was one second over 40 hours,

142
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,560
you could return your orange juice.

143
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,780
That's right.

144
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,280
From so-called PR News in so-called Washington,

145
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,740
I'm in so-called Washington.

146
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,400
Orders for so-called terrible goods fell in so-called October

147
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
for a third consecutive so-called month,

148
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,580
more than most so-called economists predicted,

149
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,580
but less than most so-called economists predicted

150
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,240
in so-called September and so-called August.

151
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,620
On so-called Wall Street, so-called 2, so-called 6, so-called 9.

152
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,180
On so-called morning television shows today,

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,780
so-called Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said,

154
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,080
I don't want to make peace.

155
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,200
The so-called U.S. Army has notified so-called top officers

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,780
at so-called bases across the so-called country

157
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,340
to draw up so-called plans for massive so-called layoffs

158
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,900
if the so-called White House and so-called Congress

159
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,600
don't break their so-called deadlock over a so-called spending bill.

160
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,420
So-called President Bush is due to begin in earnest

161
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,340
December so-called 12th.

162
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,420
So-called NBC says this is so-called PR News

163
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,560
in so-called Washington.

164
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:08,900
Washington.

165
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,120
I'll collect some grease.

166
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,340
The deep appreciation of the natural world.

167
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,520
You know, as an assistant cameraman,

168
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,060
I learned the value of nose grease,

169
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,180
which we would use to lubricate the film gate.

170
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,220
Are you kidding?

171
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
No, I'm not kidding.

172
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
But it gets on the film, doesn't it?

173
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,800
Just lubricate.

174
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,240
It lets it slide through better.

175
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,880
It can get hung up in there.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,740
But the emulsion, you don't want to...

177
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,980
Oh, well.

178
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,080
Well, hey, you know, for a buttercrust bread commercial,

179
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,480
nothing's too good.

180
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,280
We used only the finest nose grease.

181
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,200
Bring home the butternut bread.

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,900
Yeah, I was taught that by a professional cameraman.

183
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,680
He learned his trade in the British Navy.

184
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,020
So how can you question that?

185
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,060
It's great for removing scratches.

186
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
He says it's great for removing scratches.

187
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,120
Scratches?

188
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,940
Scratches.

189
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,200
From Kodachrome film.

190
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah, there you go.

191
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,020
Scratch removal.

192
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
We used to pay extra for that.

193
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,400
Some of us used to clean our film obsessively

194
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,360
with the film cleaner to keep those little specks.

195
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,420
I'm going to have to go look for that thing.

196
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,280
What, the check?

197
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
Yeah, I don't know where it is.

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,560
Well, you just want another one.

199
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,400
You hadn't endorsed it, had you, son?

200
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,280
It was for me.

201
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,280
He says it's right there on the table.

202
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,740
Right over there.

203
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,280
Anybody could have picked that up.

204
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,740
And taken it off and made hay with it.

205
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,220
At any rate, now that mystery is solved.

206
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,220
That trifling problem is dispensed with, disposed of.

207
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,840
Anybody need their film gate cleaned with some nose grease?

208
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,040
I've got plenty of forehead grease works, too.

209
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,200
But you don't want to get the emulsion of the film

210
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,440
a compromise.

211
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,500
Are you questioning the British Navy film production?

212
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,480
Well, they probably cleaned it, too.

213
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,700
No, you even spelled my name right.

214
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,720
I-V-A-N.

215
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,060
Okay, pop her in your secret pocket there.

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,620
Right.

217
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,680
Shafid.

218
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,480
My name, my real name is Shafid.

219
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,100
Right.

220
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,840
Your name?

221
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:38,940
Ole.

222
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,140
Aswipe.

223
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,520
Aswipe.

224
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Yes, that's the way it's pronounced.

225
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,140
Aswipe.

226
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,160
Okay.

227
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
Right in Shafid here.

228
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,520
Aswipe Shafid.

229
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,520
Aswipe Shafid.

230
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,260
Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,520
The Bollywood star.

232
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,940
Probably Aswipe Shafid III.

233
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:03,820
Yeah.

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,600
It's always the third or something.

235
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,360
Yeah.

236
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
And his co-star.

237
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,880
His co-star, Lemangelo Arangelo.

238
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,640
Boy, we already did that horrible chunk of history.

239
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,220
With the singing and dancing talents of Medula Oblongata.

240
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,560
Hey, now I remember what I was going to say when I turned on the recorder

241
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,840
trying to record what I thought that I had.

242
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:36,140
But it had to do with the fact that this little town and whole area is so Christian

243
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
that you can't find me anywhere else.

244
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:38,760
Yeah.

245
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


246
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


247
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


248
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


249
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


250
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


251
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,760


252
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:48,740
I've been to Mazzaballs or any kind of Jewish-type food, even at H-E-B in the big city of Granbury.

253
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,860
And you'd think it because it's pretty...

254
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,600
H-E-B, Hebe.

255
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,540
Ha-ha.

256
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,260
Very funny.

257
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,680
Ha-ha.

258
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,900
The fact is, H-E-B actually stands for the name of the founder of that chain of southwestern

259
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
supermarkets, Herbert E. Butts.

260
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,420
But they couldn't...

261
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,860
really name their supermarket butts i'm gonna go over to butts for some fresh milk and eggs honey

262
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:21,000

264
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:36,160
and butts you know piggly willy piggly wiggly was founded by a man named uh butthurt and so

265
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,900
they couldn't call it butthurts so they called it piggly wiggly for just about as bad it's many

266
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,180
places in the south to piggly wiggly win dixie i don't know if they still have oh yeah they sure

268
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,360
poor some guy named skags started a business and actually kept the name so it was called skags and

269
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,660
skags albertson but uh

270
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:14,060
butthurt e butts wisely decided not to call his store butts my name was skags i changed to smucker

271
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,920
um and then there were stuckies and you know duckies where i have very fine pecan rolls at

272
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,480
stuckies or pecan logs i guess i guess they call them because they're shaped like a log and they

273
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,240
have tree branches growing out of them sometimes they even have like these weird

274
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,140
subspecies of them and they're like they're like they're like they're like they're like

275
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:53,480
a гол ghost like you know thatachts right a dead Force hugrife or something like that

276
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,480


277
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,380
color in music and they know um they were made from people and they are like having an

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,360
spaces have changed in a zoom are just made like graphics you can do stuff on Vancouver

281
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,360


282
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,580
PCD CS인지 Savage offers Clark SEO services and really I do because I have information

283
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,660
about that as well right now and I later had the campeon toward the end of last term and i've

284
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,140
seen this in LinkedIn about 2 million times in now and i want some answers and and i want to tell syrup

285
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,940
That's what we pay you for, or we would were you paid.

286
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,340
Yes, if we could afford to pay you, that's what you would be being paid for.

287
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,920
That's not what I'd ask for if I was reported being paid.

288
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,020
I'd ask for twice as much in a 10-year contract.

289
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,860
Well, we're working on it.

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
I've decided I'm going to sell it.

291
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,860
Old Bessie could live without, well, I don't want to say,

292
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
but there's a certain part of her body.

293
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,420
That she could technically live without.

294
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,280
And I'm thinking about selling that.

295
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,940
But really, you know, it's getting down to where there ain't going to be much Old Bessie left.

296
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,260
I know.

297
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,140
I hate to, I mean, I hate to even look at her.

298
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,640
Yeah.

299
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,480
The way it is.

300
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,760
And, you know, when we walk out to the pen, she just gets this look like,

301
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,900
oh, no, they're going to take another part.

302
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,140
I know how she feels.

303
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,260
I feel that way every time the mailman brings a new bill.

304
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,260
An industrial horse?

305
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,160
Another part of myself or her.

306
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,400
Pig.

307
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,180
Is it like an industrial horse?

308
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,200
He asked if Bessie was a horse, and I said Bessie was a pig.

309
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,860
Well, that's what we tell people.

310
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,060
Oh, a machine pig.

311
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,180
That was one of my first bands was the Machine Pigs.

312
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,900
Yeah, yeah, that's right, a pig.

313
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,840
Yeah.

314
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,100
Yeah, you know, it's just an animal.

315
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,760
One, two, three, four, oink, oink, oink, oink.

316
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,820
Yeah, this is not some Texas Chainsaw Massacre thing.

317
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,900
You know, Princess Wee thinks that movie is just fictional.

318
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,620
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

319
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,540
So do I think that anything about Cannibal Rednecks is also fiction.

320
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,080
Yeah, she thinks there was no Ed Gein in her world.

321
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,360
It's all fabricated.

322
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
There was no Tom Landry.

323
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,900
Somebody made it up so people could have bad nightmares.

324
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,480
None of those pedophile serial killers ever existed.

325
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,000
No.

326
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,640
No John Wayne.

327
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,040
No.

328
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,720
They don't exist.

329
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,700
They're just fictitious.

330
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,900
Then why do they have all those movie trailers for them all the time?

331
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,360
There's...

332
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,420
There's...

333
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


334
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


335
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


336
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


337
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


338
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


339
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


340
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


341
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


342
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


343
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,120


344
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,680
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

345
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,840
Well, they're movies, but they're based on real life stuff that happens a lot.

346
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,860
A hell of a lot.

347
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,780
Yeah.

348
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,200
These people are definitely inbred.

349
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,260
There are very many of them.

350
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,360
The consequences have not been positive at all.

351
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,680
I don't think so.

352
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,040
They only do it to Yankees for the most part.

353
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,800
Yankee tourists.

354
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,020
What, grow a third eye on their forehead?

355
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,560
Chop them up and turn them into barbecue.

356
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,060
And serve them to the next...

357
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,060


358
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,440
Sell them to the next Yankee tourists that come by who are doomed to become the next

359
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,300
bunch of barbecue.

360
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,680
Yeah.

361
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,240
Duh.

362
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,900
Duh.

363
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:56,980
I mean, haven't you ever walked into certain roadside cafes or bars, convenience stores

364
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,180
where you'd stop just to get gas or ask somebody directions and you'd walk in and you'd just

365
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,880
go, holy...

366
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,100
Holy...

367
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,940
Holy moly.

368
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah.

369
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,060
This is a hotbed of cannibal rednecks and I better get out of here.

370
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,800
No.

371
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,700
I never have.

372
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,980
Well, I went to get butter one time.

373
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,500
You have.

374
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,660
In fact, Princess Wee, you just didn't recognize it.

375
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,880
I want to hear Dave's story about going to get butter.

376
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,800
I don't want to hear about me not recognizing cannibal rednecks.

377
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,700
I had to drag you out of that last place.

378
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,880
Especially after I saw it was written on the bathroom walls.

379
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,820
Come on now.

380
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,500
Dave's going to tell us about getting butter.

381
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:33,960
Come on.

382
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,360
Okay.

383
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,760
All right.

384
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,180
Okay.

385
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:36,740
Dave.

386
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,700
Uh, I heard that you went shopping to get butter.

387
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Dave.

388
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,460
Have I stopped ovulating yet?

389
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,640
Have you stopped ovulating?

390
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,260
I don't know.

391
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,720
Have you?

392
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,920
That's what I was asking you.

393
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,380
You should...

394
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,840
You're a woman.

395
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,360
You should know.

396
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,760
But what about...

397
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,460
What about the butter?

398
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,160
What about the 12?

399
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,320
What about the butter, man?

400
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,000
The butter?

401
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,720
The butter.

402
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,740
You went to get butter.

403
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,300
Remember you went to the store to get butter?

404
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Remember?

405
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,320
Couldn't find the butter, man.

406
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,440
I found the butter, man.

407
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,640
I forgot to come back.

408
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,220
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,100
You got that right on the head.

410
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,020
You nailed it.

411
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,720
Dave forgot what he was going to say.

412
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,260
Oh, man.

413
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,580
That's okay.

414
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,140
I forgot I was going to get butter.

415
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,720
Well, next time, just go get the butter.

416
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,040
If I could only congeal it massively like some sort of outer space pilot.

417
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,560
Speak up, Dave.

418
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,180
Speak up.

419
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,520
If I could only congeal it dramatically like some kind of space pirate.

420
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,660
Or pilot.

421
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,040
Or, you know, one of those types.

422
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,840
You're talking about the butter still, right?

423
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,060
Right.

424
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,360
Space pirate congealing the butter.

425
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,860
Is that the name of your next Bulldada album or something, Dave?

426
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,840
I mean, is this some kind of surrealist metaphor that nobody's supposed to get?

427
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,140
Or are you seriously talking about...

428
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,140


429
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,440
They're supposed to take a life.

430
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,860
I mean, the thing is, just when you think Dave's just spewing...

431
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,640
Spewing a bunch of nonsense, you find out, oh, that was in the paper in Ashtabula that day.

432
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,120
Right.

433
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
That actually happened.

434
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,320
Pirates congealed butter in Ashtabula just offshore.

435
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,060
Mm-hmm.

436
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,440
Farm fresh.

437
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah.

438
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,100
Farmed a table, right?

439
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,720
And they take it right out of the river sometimes, too.

440
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,000
Pirate congealed?

441
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,180
It was very, very sad with that tiny little log.

442
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,660
There was no...

443
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,840
See, that's how I like to express myself.

444
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm displeased.

445
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,960
Well, I don't like it that you're displeased, Dave.

446
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,640
You should not be displeased.

447
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,340
Well, then thank you very much.

448
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,120
I agree with you.

449
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,440
Really?

450
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,540
Take your hand and walk slowly down the land until everyone is free.

451
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,040
Of what, I don't know, but it sounds good.

452
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,080
It sounds great.

453
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,380
And now this.

454
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,120
Thank you.

455
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,400
Thank you.

456
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,260
Thank you.

457
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,480
Thank you.

458
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,720
Thank you.

459
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,360
Thank you.

460
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,760
Thank you.

461
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,820
Thank you.

462
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,540
Thank you.

463
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


464
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,540


465
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,280
Frank Krumit did that epic song.

466
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,980
Next, we relive a terrible crisis at 22X Day in the summer of so-called 2019.

467
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,240
What jackanapes knocked the screen out of this pipe?

I don't know.

469
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,360
It's useless without the screen.

470
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,700
Oh, see, that's terrible.

471
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,760

bicentennial blossoms and buds with macro earthworms each in its own earthenware urn.

498
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,820
It'll help my allergies. Unless that's what's making me allergic.

499
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,700
So it's allergies, is it? And there's no little hole? Oh, there is a little hole.

500
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,200
That's what he said.

501
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,840
Lens whites. Is that what they're calling them now?

502
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,080
Yeah.

503
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,720
She's never drawn a passive breath and you'll rot your teeth on the nape of her neck.

504
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,000
She combs her hair with gasoline. She's got blue and yellow, oughta make some green.

505
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:56,060
She's got a sugar daddy's fortune buried in the city don'ts and she's got the map written on the wall.

506
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,180
She's got a diamond on the bottom of her bum. And if you get down on your knees to read the twat,

507
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,700
she's got a 20-pound ember stringing at your head.

508
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:22,060
She burns me down in ecstasy till I'm in love with destiny.

509
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,780
She threw away my satisfied mind.

510
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,780
Slung her teeth into my spine.

511
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,580
Stay tuned for a special presentation. She's back in the helm, back, back in the station.

512
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,060
Don't change the channel if the screen gets fuzzy. Can't change the channel if the screen gets fuzzy.

513
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,280
She burns me down in ecstasy till I'm in love with destiny.

514
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,100
She threw away my satisfied mind.

515
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,800
Slung her teeth into my spine.

516
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,680
She's a high-heeled emergency.

517
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,640
Still I'm in love with destiny.

518
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,560
She threw away my satisfied mind.

519
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,420
Slung her teeth into my spine.

520
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:25,840
Slung her teeth into my spine.

521
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,780
Keeps me in love with destiny.

522
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,020
A heartless day will resume.

523
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,460
Spotted an earlier tattoo from love that makes me feel like I belong to a good boy's heart.

524
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,140
I always thought bargaining was telling.

525
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,400
MR SLUNGFIED

526
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,400


527
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,400


528
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,900
Baugh did that song, Destiny Detroit, with his band Massive Hot Dog Recall, and yes,

529
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:09,300
he is related to those mothers, Baugh's, and lives in northern Ohio, like I did for 20

530
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,640
years.

531
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,580
Where Princess Wee and I did the show at radio station WCSB Cleveland, and it's still on

532
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,620
there, but they're playing CDs that we record in our living room underneath the preserved

533
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,440
decapitated head of a large bear heard screaming in the background.

534
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,580
During these sessions, if I sense that we've been blabbering randomly for way too long,

535
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,040
I can try the cut point for later editing by saying things like, and now this.

536
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,360
That was a cut point.

537
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:48,040
Now we're back to talking to Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the Hour of Slack number 1,753.

538
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,100
Wow.

539
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,800
53.

540
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,140
53.

541
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,640
53.

542
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,060
Something like that.

543
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,860
Something like that.

544
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,020
Somewhere around there.

545
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,520
And that's a lot of show, you know what I'm saying?

546
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,420
Oh, God.

547
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,680
It is a lot of show.

548
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,600
It's weighing me down.

549
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,620
Every time I do one of these shows, I'm thinking, you know, in that day I spent on that show,

550
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,680
day and a half, with all the copies and the putting online and censoring and everything,

551
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:21,380
it's like, I could have spent that time producing an entire new subgenius 10-volume

552
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,600
subgenius.

553
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,800
It's a set of hilarious art and written words.

554
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,100
But instead, I just blither away on this stupid show.

555
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,480
It's not stupid.

556
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,880
How much longer am I going to keep telling myself this ridiculous...

557
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,200
You need to be marched in the right direction like the Soviet Georgian choir, like the Soviet

558
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,980
Army chorus.

559
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,640
You need to be marched in one direction.

560
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,460
Yeah, backwards.

561
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,520
Let's just start doing reruns from now on.

562
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,060
There's nothing wrong with that.

563
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,180
And pretend they're new.

564
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:58,840
And everybody will think, wow, Dave and Stang sound so much healthier and more alert and

565
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,040
bright and funny and loud.

566
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,000
What's their secret?

567
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,560
Yeah, and clear.

568
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,680
Yeah, and you could play them all backwards, too.

569
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,280
So it would be like, yip, ship, bloop, boop, boop, boop, and stuff like that.

570
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,940
And that could add another extraterrestrial dimension to our congealments.

571
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,040
Actually, I used to do that before we even got on.

572
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,500
I used to do that on the radio.

573
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,960
And I realized it didn't really work, and it's stupid and boring.

574
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,780
Unless you're on LSD, then it's great.

575
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,640
Oh, wow, it's brilliant genius.

576
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,200
Woo!

577
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,920
Those were the days.

578
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,600
The 60s were fun, but now I'm paying the price.

579
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,760
That's a Stan Lee quote, I think, from Ant-Man and the Wasp.

580
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,360
Yeah, that's his cameo in Ant-Man and the Wasp.

581
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,680
There's a chase scene, and the Wasp and Ant-Man are shrinking, or they're sidekick, they're

582
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,540
humorous sidekick, are shrinking things right and left.

583
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:16,620
And this old man, Stan Lee, the Marvel editor and writer, walks out to his car, and it suddenly

584
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,240
shrinks, disappears.

585
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,240
And he mutters to himself.

586
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,980
The 60s were fun, but now I'm paying the price.

587
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,000
And the audience laughs.

588
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,280
Nowadays, they have to do a digital Stan Lee to get the cameo in, because he's dead.

589
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,360
But they still have to have him.

590
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,980
Have you heard of the Roy Orbison tour that's going on right now, the hologram tour?

591
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,840
I have heard that there's hologram tours of Elvis and Frank Zappa.

592
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,080
I just heard that today.

593
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
But I don't know anything about it.

594
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,180
You guys are putting me on.

595
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,660
No, I'm not.

596
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,120
I actually heard there was a hologram tour of Elvis and a hologram Frank Zappa.

597
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,540
No way.

598
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,160
No.

599
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,980
Oh, yeah.

600
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,560
No.

601
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,060
Uh-uh.

602
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,740
No.

603
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,980
I saw a play about this was going to happen, but this is actually happening now?

604
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,220
Oh, yeah.

605
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,080
Anything that there was a play about.

606
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,920
Dead Roy Orbison's on trail.

607
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,220
James Dean is starring in a big Hollywood movie that's coming out.

608
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:20,220


609
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,480
Yeah.

610
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,360
Yeah.

611
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,920
I mean, seriously, that's not a joke.

612
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,320
They're going to do an all-digital James Dean.

613
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,720
Good Lord.

614
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,000
See how it is when there's a dearth of ideas, when there's not enough ideas.

615
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,260
They'll jump on one idea, which may or may not be a good idea and should be developed,

616
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,400
and they'll just keep on just killing the thing until it's dead.

617
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,900
No, they jump on the ideas that have been market-tested to be sellable.

618
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,200
Right.

619
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,220
Always, you know, good ideas that will make a story.

620
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
That people will go and see.

621
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,920
There's a formula for that now.

622
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,060
At least they have to interpret the data, you know, but still, it doesn't matter.

623
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,160
Those Marvel movies are perfect examples of those, and they're really good movies, if you like that sort of thing.

624
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,340
I do.

625
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,660
What?

626
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,540
I like both sorts of things.

627
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:14,860
I like arty-farty dramas and black-and-white dubbed in English with Italian subtitles,

628
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,060
and I like big Hollywood blockbusters with The Rock.

629
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,240
And all those tough guys.

630
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,940
Well, are they worse than Neighbor World?

631
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,440
I mean, are they—what's the quality of the hologram, the holo-zig?

632
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,840
I have no idea.

633
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,660
I don't know.

634
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,600
I just—I'm old.

635
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,720
I don't see this.

636
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,460
I still imagine a 1980s hologram that looks like it's semi-translucent, and you can stick your hand through it, but it's like dim.

637
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,340
I can't imagine it.

638
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,220
I thought that would be so weird, you know, if you had one really look like people, maybe small, little, teeny, tiny people, but—

639
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,220


640
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,220


641
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,220


642
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,700
you know, just as they is.

643
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,920
I don't know.

644
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,520
Boy, things are—

645
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,160
I don't know.

646
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,560
Everything's kind of like a lie, you know what I mean?

647
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,020
Because Roy Orbison is quite dead.

648
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,500
Well, yeah, so is Elvis and Frank.

649
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,140
But his hologram is alive.

650
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:20,100
And James Dean, but you can still make him seem to be—I mean, the Star Wars movies had Princess Leia and Peter Cushing come back to life.

651
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,360
But digital doubles.

652
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,860
Fairly convincing.

653
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,280
Yeah.

654
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,580
There's a little bit of Uncanny Valley in there.

655
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,760
They look realer than Bob looks, and Bob's real.

656
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,520
So—

657
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,320
Yeah, I guess you got a point there on the top of your head, anyway.

658
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:34,920
Yeah.

659
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:36,920
Yep.

660
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,880
Yep.

661
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,180
Yep.

662
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,200
Yep.

663
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,700
Yep.

664
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,060


665
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,100


666
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,460
Yep.

667
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:40,520
Yep.

668
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:40,820
Yep.

669
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:40,920
Yep.

670
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,000
Yep.

671
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000


672
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000


673
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,600
Yep.

674
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,580
It's fair.

675
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
Okay.

676
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:06,780


677
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,980
Up next we haveça antibodies.

678
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:10,980


679
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:10,980


680
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:10,980


681
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm there.

682
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,060
Defense Secretary Robert Gates is bad today.

683
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:45,120
Gates quotes senior Pentagon officials as saying Gates concluded the two women who alleged that they were sexually assaulted by Gates remain too volatile in civilian courts.

684
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,960
The court heard arguments.

685
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,300
Gates acknowledged that Gates pushed out of the south and west of the country and moved for his country.

686
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,900
She also remains dangerous and problematic.

687
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,420
The Supreme Court heard PR News in Washington.

688
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,100
Thank you, Mr. Lee Murr.

689
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,140
His works are all on archive.com, you know.

690
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,140
And I think this is Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Avery Larry of the next day in the background.

691
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,920
And now we finally get to hear some female subgenius interjected into this pathetic sausage fest.

692
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,960
Yes, vagina, there are female subgeniuses.

693
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
And I...

694
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,980
I have had a crush on pretty much all of the ones I've met.

695
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:47,620
I especially love the spoutings of these two particular wacky rant partners down in Austin.

696
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,920
Overlord Anna Mall and Dr. Brouhaha.

697
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,220
So, well, the moon was in Aries, so...

698
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,440
The full moon.

699
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,680
It's gonna awaken the fires inside.

700
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm feeling it.

701
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,100
Yeah.

702
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,180
Oh.

703
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,840
Yeah.

704
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,040
Just...

705
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,540
Don't eat too much spicy food.

706
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,280
I did.

707
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,220
Actually, no, I ate too many grapes.

708
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,860
Yeah.

709
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,420
Which is my equivalent of spiciness.

710
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,620
That's like the level of spice that I can handle.

711
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,420
I can handle the spice of grapes.

712
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,500
The spicy grapes.

713
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,580
It was hard to do.

714
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,160
I didn't know that that many grapes would do what it did to my body, to my body.

715
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:28,900
Yeah.

716
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,700
I feel so clean.

717
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,220
They're pretty, yeah.

718
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,380
It was horrible.

719
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,340
You were renewed in the fire of grapes.

720
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,720
Yeah.

721
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,040
It was horrible.

722
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,100
The freshness of the grapes.

723
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,900
The crisp tartness of grapes.

724
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,560
No longer drinking them, just letting them stomp me from the inside out.

725
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,000
That sounds like a good time.

726
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,460
It was painful, though, for a second there.

727
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,560
I was like, oh, I've got to suddenly find this place that I like to spend quiet time alone

728
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,320
with possibly some excrementatory meditation materials.

729
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,900
I need a book.

730
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,760
I can't grab one fast enough.

731
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,060
And luckily I have church pamphlets on the bathroom wall.

732
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,820
There you go.

733
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,100
Yeah.

734
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,460
Church of...

735
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,780
Church of all that good stuff.

736
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,680
Man, I tell you what.

737
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,040
I got my pleasure saucer diagram on the wall there.

738
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,480
That's good to go over that, so, you know.

739
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,520
Oh, yes.

740
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,400
Good thing in time.

741
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,740
Maybe I don't need, like, two hamster cages and a gerbil pit.

742
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,540
Maybe what I really need is a butterfly enclosure.

743
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,840
Well, you know, you could have the hamster's wheels helping power the, like,

744
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,820
gentle breezes in the butterfly enclosure.

745
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,680
Ooh.

746
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,660
So.

747
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,280
That sounds excessive, though.

748
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,780
What are the sugar gliders going to do?

749
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,540
They'll just glide on the gentle breezes.

750
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,400
That's not really what they do, though.

751
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,520
Well, I mean, they're, like, bonus, aren't they?

752
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,040
Are they?

753
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,280
I thought they would be.

754
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,700
They're going to, like, they're obviously going to...

755
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,520
I think you're thinking of lemurs.

756
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,480
Shout out to lemurs, yo!

757
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,220
What?

758
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,380
Anyway, just saying.

759
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Yeah, I could be.

760
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,700
They got...

761
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,020
They got...

762
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,640
They're pale sugar gliders, don't they?

763
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,700
Aren't they little?

764
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,560
And they're, like...

765
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,820
They just smell like piss.

766
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,820
They smell like sugar glider piss.

767
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,680
Well, that's exactly what the hamster wheel powers the gentle breeze.

768
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,980
It all seems very, you know...

769
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,680
There's not enough breeze on the saucer.

770
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,720
So I really...

771
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,100
I'm just saying, maybe leaving rodents behind.

772
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,920
If you have to.

773
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,440
They can catch their own pleasure saucer if they were meant to go.

774
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,580
I don't think they paid their $35.

775
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,820
I will pay $35.

776
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,940
On behalf of rodents.

777
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,060
Because I can't handle people being too happy.

778
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,880
Okay.

779
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,960
Your pleasure saucer is not my pleasure saucer.

780
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,620
You're going to have to get your own pleasure saucer.

781
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,740
Speaking of which, how are you going to keep...

782
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,060
If you're taking your raptor friends...

783
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,780
If you're, like, up on the...

784
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,880
Well, that's why I need rodents, obviously.

785
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,560
How are my raptors going to eat?

786
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,220
So it's not because you want them there.

787
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,700
It's because you need them there for a food source for your raptors.

788
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,640
Well, yeah.

789
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,240
Yeah, and entertainment.

790
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,080
They don't want to just, like, be fed, like, you know, like, replicator meat.

791
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,300
You're going to sew them tiny outfits so they have a fine dining experience.

792
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,460
The raptor's going to swoop down and it's like,

793
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,600
Ooh, look at those sequins.

794
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm going to go after that one in the long gown with the tail.

795
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:20,980
Maybe.

796
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,380
I will definitely give them a gilded, like, perches to sit on at the dinner table if they want.

797
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,840
You know, they can have all they want, those raptors.

798
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,340
And the mice can have, like, furniture.

799
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,620
Which raptors will wear the monocles?

800
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:35,640


801
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,900
Because I'm just imagining at this point, somebody's going to have an opera glass.

802
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,180
Somebody's going to have a monocle.

803
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,980
How are you going to be divvying that up amongst the raptors?

804
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,260
I mean, it's kind of like a first-come, first-served thing, really.

805
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,440
But I'm definitely going to save, like...

806
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,340
Well, yeah, if you only have a couple of hamsters and a gerbil bit.

807
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm going to save, right?

808
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,020
I'm going to save, like, a cummerbund for, like, the falcon, maybe.

809
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:57,740
Ooh.

810
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:58,860
Yeah.

811
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,080
That's some highfalutin.

812
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,680
Yeah.

813
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,440
Wow.

814
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,820
It's a fancy falcon.

815
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,280
Yeah.

816
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,720
I was, like, I was going to, like, have my...

817
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,740
I am keeping the tiger.

818
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,720
I, yeah.

819
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,580
I mean, why would you ever leave your tiger behind?

820
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,400
I thought you all were tight.

821
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah.

822
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,760
We hang.

823
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,400
We hang.

824
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,500
We hang in Tiger Town.

825
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:25,860
So I was thinking, though, it's, like, you know, not necessarily, like, a suit for,

826
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,460
like, not like a dinner suit kind of thing, but maybe just going with, like, a leopard onesie.

827
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,400
For the tiger?

828
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:33,860
Yeah.

829
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,140
Yeah.

830
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,360
You think it would?

831
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,240
Maybe.

832
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,560
Urban camouflage, you know?

833
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:37,940
I don't know.

834
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,300
Maybe just switch it up a bit.

835
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,520
Maybe he just wants to be, like, a leopard sometimes and, like, just live his life.

836
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,680
I mean, I would ask the tiger, but I'm sure that maybe...

837
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,580
No judgment.

838
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,480
No judgment.

839
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,240
I mean, I'm into it.

840
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,900
Oh, Tigger, he picked it out.

841
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,040
I'm going to pick...

842
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,800
I'm going to paint tiger stripes on myself.

843
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,400
That is offensive.

844
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,260
Just because I can't.

845
00:45:59,260 --> 00:45:59,660
That's offensive.

846
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,020
Hey, I'll be in my own pleasure, Soster.

847
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,320
Your tiger won't be there to be offended.

848
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,860
I'm offended, knowing that you would do that.

849
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,380
I don't think that we...

850
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,120
I don't think that we can hang out anymore.

851
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:09,820
This is...

852
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,780
No, no.

853
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,360
It's Siberian tiger stripes.

854
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:12,880
Oh.

855
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,900
You know, like, white and black.

856
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,640
Fluffy white.

857
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,820
So, like, a zebra.

858
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,600
So, my tiger would think you're food.

859
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,640
Yeah.

860
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:21,920
Cool.

861
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,640
Come over.

862
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,940
See what happens.

863
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,640
I got raptors, though.

864
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,260
Just saying.

865
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,760
Raptor tiger fight!

866
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,740
Raptor tiger fight!

867
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,100
Wait, I've had that dish at the restaurant before.

868
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,200
Oh, that is such a good one.

869
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,640
It's like...

870
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,360
It's like...

871
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:35,520
It's like...

872
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,620
It's like...

873
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


874
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


875
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


876
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


877
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


878
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


879
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:35,620


880
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,120
It's like shark shrimp.

881
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,200
Eagle tiger fight?

882
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,820
Scrimp.

883
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,420
Yeah.

884
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Phoenix and dragon.

885
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:40,980
Oh, yeah.

886
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,620
I think it's what it was.

887
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,520
But I think what it was is really shrimp and sturgeon.

888
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,480
And not to disappoint any Pokemon Go fans out there that might be living in the same fantasy

889
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,400
world that I once did, but apparently Gyarados is a sturgeon.

890
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,680
Which, in real life, looks just like a Gyarados in my fantasy world.

891
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,280
But it's like...

892
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,840
It's terrifying.

893
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,240
A sturgeon?

894
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,620
There's terrifying beasts.

895
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,880
They're like...

896
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,620
They're like...

897
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:05,620


898
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,900
They're scaly and have teeth.

899
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,480
Monsters!

900
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,560
Monsters!

901
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,560
With fins on them somewhere.

902
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,340
That is many fish you just described.

903
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,960
Every fish.

904
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,200
Every fish is scaly.

905
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,240
But extra scaly.

906
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,940
Extra...

907
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,340
No, like planks.

908
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:21,940
Yeah.

909
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,900
Like platelets.

910
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,700
Yeah, like...

911
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,320
Giant...

912
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,400
Godzilla-like scales.

913
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,660
No, Gyarados.

914
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,560
It's a Pokemon.

915
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,580
Anyway, so like...

916
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:28,780
Sorry.

917
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,760
Basically...

918
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,000
Confusing my genres here.

919
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,320
Horrible monsters of the...

920
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,500
Not ocean.

921
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:34,700
Not ocean.

922
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,600
Not that deep.

923
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,220
And there's more than one kind of them.

924
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,800
Now, in Pokemon, we can get lucky ones.

925
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,700
In Hawaii, Aloha ones or whatever it was.

926
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,220
Or there's also shiny ones now as well as the regular ones.

927
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,500
But I don't think there are that many types of sturgeons available for fishing.

928
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,340
In the real world.

929
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,040
But I do know that Primus wrote a song about them.

930
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,080
Which one was that?

931
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,580
It's about a sturgeon.

932
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,220
I thought that was weird.

933
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,480
Weird Al.

934
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,580
No, no.

935
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,040
No, that's like a sturgeon.

936
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,240
And that is...

937
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,780
Spawning for the very first time.

938
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,920
Like a sturgeon.

939
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,180
I got stuck on your 20 test line.

940
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,680
Like a sturgeon.

941
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,360
There you go.

942
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:20,640
Ooh.

943
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,220
Yeah, that's actually...

944
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,420
Because I've heard that one.

945
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

946
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,120
Actually, the part of the...

947
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,880
It was like I pulled in a 60-pound sturgeon on a 20-pound test.

948
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,820
You know, kind of thing.

949
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,020
Oh, there you go.

950
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,980
It was actually a very beautiful song that...

951
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,960
The Fish On song.

952
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,860
Yeah.

953
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,560
Yeah, there you go.

954
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,720
I got that tape.

955
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,120
Yeah.

956
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,180
As opposed to Float On by the...

957
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,460
No, not that one.

958
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,760
The Sad Mice, which we talked about earlier.

959
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,980
They get eaten by the raptors.

960
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,880
The Mice of Humility.

961
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,920
The Mice of Humility.

962
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,200
So modest they were.

963
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,440
Yeah, they didn't want to...

964
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,640
They didn't want to wear the sequined gowns.

965
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,180
Not bragging at all.

966
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,200
At the dinner party.

967
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,340
They wanted to just wear their demure...

968
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,680
Rodents.

969
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,080
Yeah.

970
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,700
That band.

971
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,760
The demure...

972
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,120
The demure...

973
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,640
Can we do like a cover band?

974
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,060
A modest mouse cover band?

975
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,100
All women.

976
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,460
Like the demure rodents.

977
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,160
We'd have to give it maybe a slightly better name.

978
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,260
Like some kind of rodent in particular, maybe.

979
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,480
Maybe it doesn't even have to be a rodent, but rodent-like.

980
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:26,700
Maybe.

981
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,880
Demure lemurs.

982
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah.

983
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,520
Rodent-like.

984
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,280
I don't know.

985
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,160
Demure lemur.

986
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,640
Yes.

987
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,640
I like it.

988
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,740
It's ladyfied.

989
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,380
It could be mopey.

990
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,520
Mopey lemur.

991
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,160
Yeah, let's go rock out to some mopey music.

992
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:40,460
You ready?

993
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,160
Mm-hmm.

994
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:41,880
All right, cool.

995
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,280
That's great.

996
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,320
Oh, just wanted to shout out to the rest of the subgeni out there from the women of Austin.

997
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,120
Kudos to everybody that's doing their bit, not doing a thing.

998
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,520
And we'll check with you next time.

999
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,380
Thank you so much for stopping by the revered Overlord Animal.

1000
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,260
Oh, anytime.

1001
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,080
Anytime, Dr. Brujaha, you know, that I feel like imposing myself, I will.

1002
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:07,840
Thank you.

1003
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,900
Yeah, no problem.

1004
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,860
You'll like it.

1005
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,860
I remember back when I was almost a terrorist.

1006
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,120
I think it was 1950, 60, 70.

1007
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,860
You were like 9 or 10 years old, Dave?

1008
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,460
I was like 9 or 10 years old.

1009
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,260
That's what it was.

1010
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,040
And I had made up my mind that I was going to conquer the world in my own name.

1011
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,200
You know what I mean?

1012
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,920
Like Charlemagne, Dave the Great, something like that.

1013
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,000
Well, we all did that one.

1014
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,480
When we were 10.

1015
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,060
You get your sister to bring all her friends over,

1016
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,220
and then you have to teach them all kinds of weird stuff.

1017
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,440
And then they get bored and beat you up.

1018
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,460
Yeah.

1019
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,760
Yeah, we've all been through it.

1020
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,740
Until our drunken parents come home, pull down their underpants and say,

1021
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,160
Hey, kids, take a look at this.

1022
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,380
Oh, God, man, you're bringing back real horrible memories, Dave.

1023
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,020
Don't go there.

1024
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,220
That's what I'm trying to do.

1025
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,800
Oh, man, you're triggering me.

1026
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,740
I'm triggered.

1027
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,520
I'm trying to try.

1028
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:02,980
Freaking out.

1029
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,260
I'm trying to trigger you.

1030
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,080
I'm having flashbacks.

1031
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,360
I'm trying to trigger you.

1032
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,800
I'm doing it on purpose.

1033
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:16,820
These are the first letters that I was forced to recreate over and over in the sandwich.

1034
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:21,380
Number four, number three, number eight, number two.

1035
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah.

1036
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,160
See, I know all those numbers.

1037
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,720
I don't know what they mean, but...

1038
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,420
But they're lucky.

1039
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,460
Yeah, they're lucky.

1040
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,200
You can tell they're lucky.

1041
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,760
Yeah.

1042
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,440
They're lucky.

1043
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1044
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1045
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1046
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1047
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1048
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1049
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1050
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1051
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1052
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,440


1053
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,620
Unfortunately, not for me, but...

1054
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,680
I was trying to figure whose breath I was hearing.

1055
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,340
It wasn't mine.

1056
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,540
It could have been mine because it...

1057
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,320
Sounds like bellows in the background.

1058
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,240
Huge bellows.

1059
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,440
I think it was Dave's nose.

1060
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,520
Does it sound like my nose now?

1061
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,740
Here's what mine sounds like.

1062
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,500
Oh, what a little dainty, girly nose.

1063
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:14,820
Well, Dave, I had my nose up against the radio microphone, not my phone phone.

1064
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,720
Here, I'll do it with my phone.

1065
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,300
All the pretenders to the throne say that.

1066
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,020
That sounds like the...

1067
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,900
The EvacuGen ward in the hospital.

1068
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,880
That was a stereo breathing.

1069
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,380
Well, when the doctor had me do that, he said,

1070
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,100
Oh, you're fine.

1071
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,740
Then he got in the bed with you and pulled up the nighties, pulled up the blankies, right?

1072
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,840
No.

1073
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,520
Then he told me how much my co-pay was.

1074
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,760
Well, it's the same thing as what he was trying to do before, only in a different way.

1075
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,280
Same difference.

1076
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:51,740
Yep.

1077
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,520
The rape.

1078
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,420
It's rape.

1079
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,780
The co-pay was rape.

1080
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,580
But not his fault.

1081
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,800
It's the insurance company.

1082
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,360
That's my fault for getting a cheap insurance.

1083
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,020
Yeah, but he...

1084
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,480
He wanted the electronic hoard.

1085
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:14,300
If I wanted to avoid paying that $30 co-pay, I should have paid the $1,300 a month insurance bill.

1086
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,640
Then I would have avoided paying that $30 co-pay.

1087
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,300
Wouldn't that be a smart thing to do?

1088
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,240
What a great idea.

1089
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,300
But who wants anything smart to happen?

1090
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,680
Not a subgenius, apparently.

1091
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,960
And not a human normal, either.

1092
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,000
Apparently, nobody wants anything.

1093
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,360
It's like anything that ticks off the smart people, oh, that's what they want to do.

1094
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,540
Just show those smarty pants what for.

1095
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:52,340
Even if it destroys your own town and environment, at least as long as it sends a signal to Hillary or Obama,

1096
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,400
because they're still president, and that's all that counts.

1097
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,500
Yeah.

1098
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,720
Because they're evil.

1099
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:01,960
I don't want.

1100
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,880
I heard that on the radio.

1101
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,940
They're the...

1102
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,120
They're the...

1103
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,440
What do you call it?

1104
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,620
The secret state?

1105
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,060
The deep state.

1106
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,040
They're the deep state that actually won the election while losing it.

1107
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,700
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1108
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,680
They actually won.

1109
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,200
They're in charge.

1110
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah, they made it look like they lost it, but they really just dug in even deeper.

1111
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,320
They're that deep.

1112
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,260
They're so deep.

1113
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,160
They're right underneath China.

1114
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:31,940
Yeah.

1115
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,040
Yeah.

1116
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,360
Yeah.

1117
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,360


1118
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,360


1119
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,360


1120
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,360


1121
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,360


1122
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:32,760
They're so deep.

1123
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,680
If they go much further, they'll be on the surface.

1124
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,360
They won't be deep at all.

1125
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,420
They'll be right up front, but they'll be in China, and the Chinese will kill them.

1126
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,340
Yep.

1127
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,020
That's what they're doing in Hong Kong now.

1128
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,620
They're beating up all the testicles.

1129
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:46,460
Yeah.

1130
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:51,540
And telling them, you know, you're not allowed to flambé the equipment around here, buddy

1131
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:51,920
boy.

1132
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,540
Remember the great leap forward.

1133
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,860
If you can barely vaguely walk backwards, you've got to remember the great leap forward.

1134
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,520
Yeah.

1135
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:01,960
Oh, God.

1136
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:02,760
Oh, man.

1137
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,240
Over the days.

1138
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,680
You know, I had personal friends in China who lived through the Cultural Revolution.

1139
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,040
It wasn't fun, and they barely survived.

1140
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,300
Yeah, I know.

1141
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,360
I guess I shouldn't joke about it, but I can't help it.

1142
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,480
I will joke about all kinds of narcotic things.

1143
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,120
Braunschweiger, old goats, anything that's taboo.

1144
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,900
We're willing to take on them.

1145
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,180
There's one good thing about it.

1146
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,840
Don't you think so?

1147
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,700
He's fading.

1148
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,340
You know, I think I'm fading.

1149
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:48,280
My machine here says that we've been on the air for 108.

1150
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,100
I believe that it has been.

1151
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,200
I was looking at that as well to see about how long it had been.

1152
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:00,980
Well, the first eight minutes was actually me futzing around trying to remember what

1153
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,100
I was doing.

1154
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,700
I was going to say.

1155
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,580
Oh.

1156
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:02,980
Yeah.

1157
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,480
Then I got a hold of Dave.

1158
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,640
Good.

1159
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,700
And we had to call him back twice.

1160
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:08,760
Oh.

1161
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,320
But it was okay.

1162
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:09,800
Okay.

1163
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,460
Everything's okay.

1164
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,240
Good.

1165
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,220
So we can take the buzzer now?

1166
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:20,500
It must have been a crappy show because Buddy and Claudia slept through the whole thing

1167
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,660
and never applauded or barked or made any noises or anything.

1168
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,580
Buddy is yawning right now.

1169
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,460
Put them both to sleep.

1170
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:31,260
Oh, he's yawning.

1171
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,480
Oh, he's yawning.

1172
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,820
So that's a slackful show.

1173
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,460
Yes.

1174
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,740
It doesn't get people all aggravated.

1175
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,000
It just puts them to sleep.

1176
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,540
Yep.

1177
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:46,980
Put some cartoon bubbles over their heads saying, man, that's old and stuff like that.

1178
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,480
Actually, the Dave call has only been going on for 59 seconds or minutes.

1179
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,240
So if I quit it right now, if this is the end of the show, then we're done.

1180
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,080
Post office box, 8-9-1.

1181
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1182
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1183
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1184
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1185
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1186
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1187
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080


1188
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:10,780
07 Glen Rose, Texas 76043 or subgenius.com.

1189
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,640
Well, I'm going to go right now.

1190
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,360
Is there something I must attend to?

1191
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,340
Yeah.

1192
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,720
Yeah.

1193
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,940
Is that what they're calling it now?

1194
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,420
Okay, Dave.

1195
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,140
Well, Dave, be careful.

1196
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,200
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us.

1197
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,540
I am a wise person.

1198
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,060
He's a wise person.

1199
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,060


1200
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,060


1201
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,060


1202
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,060


1203
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,060


1204
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,700
He's got his wisdom and his humours.

1205
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,460
He shared his humours with us, too.

1206
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,260
Some people can't recognize sarcasm.

1207
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,100
No, but seriously.

1208
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,280
You mocking my wisdoms?

1209
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:44,900
No, man.

1210
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,220
Man, I'm the occultist's guide to better history.

1211
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,980
I think you just ...

1212
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,900
It's true, Dave.

1213
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,580
We love you, man.

1214
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,380
We love you.

1215
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,780
Sure.

1216
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,300
Sure, man.

1217
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,040
I've heard that before.

1218
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,640
Price Bob.

1219
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,060
Okay.

1220
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,520
Okay.

1221
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:01,460
Have a happy birthday.

1222
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,100
Praise Bob if you can.

1223
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:02,440
Hail Cotton.

1224
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,400
.

1225
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,660
.

1226
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:05,660


1227
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:05,720
Hey, Dan.

1228
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:05,720


1229
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:05,720


1230
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:31,720
When I'm calling you

1231
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,220
Will you answer too?

1232
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,160
That means I offer my love to you

1233
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,900
To be your own

1234
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,700
If you're asking me

1235
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:05,700


1236
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,760
If you refuse me

1237
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,840
I will be blue

1238
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,160
And waiting all along

1239
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,020
But if when you hear

1240
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,880
My love call ringing clear

1241
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:43,020
And I hear your answering echo so dear

1242
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,820
Then I will know

1243
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,140
Our love will come true

1244
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,040
You'll belong to me

1245
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,900
I'll belong to you

1246
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,300
guitar solo

1247
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,160
guitar solo

1248
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,160
guitar solo

1249
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,460
guitar solo

1250
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,020
guitar solo

1251
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,120
guitar solo

1252
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,580
guitar solo

1253
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,660
You'll belong to me

1254
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:05,440
I'll belong to you

1255
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,720
You

1256
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,520
Hey listeners

1257
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,760
Don't you want to live in a historic

1258
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,060
Previously

1259
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,780
Stang and We Are Doe

1260
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,560
Owned house

1261
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,720
This is like the birthplace of

1262
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,980
Church of the Subgenius and Starwood

1263
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,720
Not actually but

1264
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,580
Those two things did live there

1265
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,240
For a long time

1266
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,120
And it's a wonderful

1267
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,020
Nice

1268
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,940
Solid old house

1269
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,160
Beautiful hardwood

1270
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,100
Details

1271
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,720
In a beautiful wonderful neighborhood

1272
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,660
With high taxes

1273
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,660
That means

1274
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,780
You know it's not low

1275
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,900
Lives they don't they run you out

1276
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:57,860
If you're a low life

1277
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,020
We had to work real hard not to get run out of there

1278
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,840
And we left it

1279
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,140
Just like we found it

1280
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,340
It is a beautiful home

1281
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,600
In a wonderful neighborhood

1282
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,300
Close to fine schools

1283
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,340
And a shopping market

1284
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,480
Within a shopping center

1285
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,800
Within a walking distance

1286
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,280
Two blocks away

1287
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,540
With a bank, post office, grocery store

1288
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,160
And Dave's

1289
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,240
Dave's

1290
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:25,540
Yes

1291
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,220
You gotta wear a snorkel

1292
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,600
What are you waiting for

1293
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,580
Buy that house

1294
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:33,880
Today

1295
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,320
Well if you like it

1296
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,660
Like built in cabinetry

1297
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,740
And faceted leaded glass windows

1298
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,900
Yeah

1299
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,160
You'll be in luck

1300
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,940
Yeah the Bob Museum used to be in there

1301
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,500
Spectacularly beautiful

1302
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,400
Many people find that one of the most desirous places

1303
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,860
To live in the Cleveland area

1304
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,820
Is in the Heights there

1305
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,060
Yes

1306
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:58,960
Yeah it's a nice middle class neighborhood

1307
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,480
It's very park like

1308
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:00,860
Big trees

1309
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,020
The next street over looks like

1310
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,140
Beaver Cleaver Street

1311
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,540
Looks like a leave it to beaver title scene

1312
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,820
Castle like houses

1313
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,320
Yeah

1314
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,920
Not our block

1315
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,980
But the next one

1316
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,860
But the next block over

1317
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,480
Yes

1318
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,860
Yeah

1319
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,860
Oh it's mixed

1320
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,700
Like a New York neighborhood

1321
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,600
There's Hasidic Jews

1322
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,800
There's artists of every stripe

1323
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:28,100
Queers and weirdos of every possible kind

1324
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,660
All colors

1325
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,560
All getting along and going to block parties together

1326
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,000
Mmhmm

1327
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:34,820
You know

1328
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,400
Ethnics of every kind

1329
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,120
It's like a Jehovah's Witness pamphlet picture of heaven

1330
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:41,760
Mmhmm

1331
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,220
And you can have this

1332
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,260
By buying our house

1333
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,140
And freeing us from this onerous and terrible burden

1334
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,580
That's just about wiped us out man really

1335
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,220
Come on

1336
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:55,480
Yep

1337
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:01,140
Houses in Cleveland are incredibly cheap compared to say this area

1338
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,540
Or North Texas

1339
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,000
Or Cleveland

1340
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,500
Or Califip

1341
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,860
I mean our house would sell for a million bucks

1342
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:09,820
Easy easy

1343
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,800
In San Francisco

1344
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,400
And the yard would sell for another two million

1345
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:13,940
Mmhmm

1346
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:14,920
Yep

1347
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,000
But it's in Cleveland

1348
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,600
Right

1349
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,100
Yeah

1350
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:17,980
So people may be like

1351
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,280
Yeah it might as well be Detroit

1352
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:19,980
It's cold there

1353
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,920
Yeah it's a hell hole

1354
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,680
I've heard all the jokes about Cleveland

1355
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,300
It's a hell hole

1356
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,260
All over it's just trash

1357
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,140
It's a dump

1358
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,980
Actually that only describes parts of Cleveland

1359
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:33,980


1360
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,340
Much of it has come back

1361
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,580
Has bounced back from the dire ancient days

1362
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,880
When the river was so toxic it was flammable

1363
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,720
Yep

1364
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,860
There's one or two live fish in that river now

1365
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,220
Yep

1366
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,880
And you can rent a kayak and go out in the poodle

1367
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,860
I mean the pond

1368
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,940
And take a long long trip

1369
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,420
And hope the Coast Guard didn't come by and arrest you for

1370
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,020
Terrorism

1371
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,600
Yeah terrorism

1372
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,320
Yeah

1373
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:03,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that

1374
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:03,960


1375
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:03,960


1376
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:03,960


1377
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,860
You're the boss

1378
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,620
You're the boss

1379
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:08,640
You're the boss

1380
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,580
Thanks for the frog

1381
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:10,540
Can't do this

1382
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:10,540


1383
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:10,540


1384
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,400
Frog

1385
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,460
How much was that triceratops?

1386
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,700
Cause whatever it was I gotta send Dave that much

1387
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,700
14 dollars

1388
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,440
Okay

1389
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,380
That's it

1390
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,700
That's an incredible deal for 14 bucks

1391
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:33,940
I know

1392
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,620
Well, one guy was charging, there were three different guys working there.

1393
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,580
One was charging $14 and another one was charging $16.

1394
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:43,160
I got it from the one that was charging $14.

1395
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,540
Some son of a bitch.

1396
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,880
Wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.

1397
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,780
This thing's handmade.

1398
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:51,340
I know.

1399
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,040
It's been hammered into shape.

1400
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:53,640
Yes.

1401
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,940
I know.

1402
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:59,740
And all those welds, you know, every one of those welds.

1403
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,860
It's welded and screwed together and painted.

1404
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,540
It's painted.

1405
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:02,720
It's painted.

1406
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,900
Yeah, and it's got all kinds of detailing on it and $14.

1407
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:08,800
Yep.

1408
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,240
These are desperate damn times.

1409
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,960
If an artist is selling that, that means he sold it to the dealer.

1410
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,240
Well, this was the tiniest one.

1411
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,700
Right, but that means he sold it to the dealer for $5.

1412
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,900
There was a bigger one that was $24 and an even bigger one that was $34.

1413
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,160
And they had the same thing in.

1414
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,520
There were Tyrannosaurus.

1415
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:32,680
There were Tyrannosaurus.

1416
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,600
There were Brontosaurus.

1417
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:41,020
But I got us the Triceratops because we kind of have a collection.

1418
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,060
Yeah, we kind of do.

1419
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,400
We sure as hell do.

1420
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,340
Triceratops crossing.

1421
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,940
They're meant to be outside.

1422
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:48,760
Yeah.

1423
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,560
Oh, we're doctors.

1424
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,800
Holy hit.

1425
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,540
Don't worry.
