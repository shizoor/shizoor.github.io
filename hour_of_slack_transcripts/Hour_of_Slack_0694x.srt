1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Where's the bathroom?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,540
Oh, oh, right next to the radio, completely modulated with dual left and right stereo speakers and two compatible frequencies.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,940
Your AM...

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,360
Beep, beep, beep, beep...

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,820
Wow, what great AM.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,780
Superbox number time in the 15...

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,940
That sounds just great.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:22,640
...43 dollars, 70 dollars and 84 cents, 3 dollars and 62 cents, 7 days a week, 7 days a year...

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,740
By the way, we also have FM right here. FM over here? Let me try it.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,520
...749...

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,440
The Genius Hour of Swag.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,460
Thanks for being a selection, and now back to our morning concert of afternoon showtime favorites.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,420
The Magic Bowl Movement from Symphony in C- by Johann Amadeus Matetzky.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,360
Hey Ralph, that's great fidelity on that FM. Nice tone.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,780
Well listen, you haven't heard nothing yet.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,720
I've got right here in this car for your time.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,400
It's a transatlantic driving pleasure, this fully-halocrafted Seamaster shortwave radio in this non-returnable, non-disposable zinc-lined carrying case.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,080
Can I get Duluth on it?

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,820
Not Duluth, bucko. You can get Tierra del Fuego.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:20,760
Hola, amigos latinos. Aquí a Ralph's Used Motors, 300 North Hoover, a la esquina de Portis-Severplace. Tenemos millones de automóviles...

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,820
743 dollars, 70 dollars and 84 cents, 3 dollars and 62 cents...

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,700
I like literature. I like it.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What?

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,160
I like it.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,180
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,180
I like the car.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,940
Let me turn some of this off. We'll get back to business. Turn this FM off.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,980
Here.

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,220
This radio over here.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,740
Otherwise, okay.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,060
I'll get the TV.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,540
Odysseus.

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,180
No, no, leave it on for a minute.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,460
Odysseus.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,600
Body with body with body flowing out of the tenth dimension.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,720
That's right. Materializing out of the tenth dimension.

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,260
It is midnight here at WCSB Cleveland. And, uh, well...

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,960
Your tenth dimension will have lovely body and bounce.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm body Bonnie Dimension with Helpline for the active woman.

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:22,200
So think of it three ways. I'm Bonnie Dimension, and it's the Reverend Ivan Stang with a different dimension, and Chaz with an entirely...

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
Dances with rockets.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,880
Do you take pills to make your voice do that, Dave?

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:35,620
Yes, as a matter of fact, I take a collagen tablet, which breaks down in my lower colon and snaps off my testes and makes ovaries.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,000
I noticed that you had lovely breasts dangling from your buttocks and the sides of your legs.

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,160
Well, all the snags aren't worked out yet, but I still have a beautiful body if you think of it the right way.

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,780
I love those snags. Don't do anything to the...

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,060
Oh, oh, oh, but doc, doc.

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,700
They keep coming back again.

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,400
I hate it when they do that.

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,020
I hate it.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,560
I hate that.

52
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,280
Ugh.

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Did they spray any?

54
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,540
Why are they pestering us?

55
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,180
I don't know. They...

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,520
I heard they spray some people.

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,680
That old church tune.

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,780
Will you wander through wilderness above?

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,120
Will you climb the mountain top and run off into the frown?

60
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,580
Will you wander through wilderness above?

61
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,860
I know the wound is coming.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,180
There's an ocean coming.

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,600
Morning is coming.

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,560
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,220
A stone in her car.

66
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,500
Universal far.

67
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,320
Galaxy's the number in the billions.

68
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,020
They're all there for you.

69
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,800
Ten dimensions above the sea.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,420
That's right, doc.

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,920
Over ten, actually.

72
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,500
How many dimensions are there in 26?

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,340
26.

74
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,600
26.

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,480
It has to be 26.

76
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,280
26 dimensions you could have.

77
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:49,920
Oh, true.

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
Of conceivable sexual things.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,100
Of conceivable sexual things.

80
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,320
So, the end of the world.

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,860
Well, of course, you know, the great thing about religion is the end of the world is

83
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,120
that you always get out.

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,960
You know, you get this special kingdom in heaven and so forth.

85
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,580
And that's so superstitious.

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,120
We're talking about believable kingdoms on spaceships, not in heaven.

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,660
Not in the clouds.

88
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,300
Clouds that fall right through.

89
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,140
Unless you have K4 or something.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,140


91
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,140


92
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,140


93
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,720
So, what's your trade-off?

94
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,580
Like you saw the taller on red?

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,260
That has some poi.

96
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,260


97
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,940
The point in life that'sDRVN ke t between white and white man should be, you're

98
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,840
never gonna

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,560
And I put my keys in play

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
And you hold me in your arms

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,280
And I'm singing once again

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,820
So come on, come on, come on

103
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,220
Come on and take it

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,660
Take it from the little things in my heart

105
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,700
And I'll be there

106
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,640
Ah, yes, dear friends, believe it or not, I recorded all that stuff

107
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:25,120
And everything you'll hear on this show last week at Starwood, the big Starwood Festival

108
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,960
And yes, that is Big Brother and the Holding Company in the background playing

109
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,820
And yes, we do have a time machine, dear friends

110
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:44,220
Because while the conspiracy was holding Woodstock 99, we went to Woodstar 99

111
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,200
Or actually Starwood

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,100
Festival at Brushwood, Sherman, New York, sponsored by Ace in Cleveland

113
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:59,760
Where we got these great recordings thanks to Stang Cam, WeCam, and Regis Sedlock of Sounds Good Productions in Cleveland

114
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,060
And friends, the conspiracy Woodstock gave you $16 sips of water and crappy bands

115
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,940
At Starwood, we got Grand Frappy and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janice Joplin

116
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,180
And we got The Firefighter

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,980
Sign Theater clones

118
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,480
And the conspiracy Woodstock, Constock gave you cops

119
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,280
At Starwood, we got Einstein's Secret Orchestra

120
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,320
At Constock, the kids burned things in anger

121
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,500
At Starwood, they burned the sacrifices for Bob

122
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,940
And at Starwood, there were devivals, friends, several devivals in fact

123
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,880
And though we still have tons of live and recorded X-Day material

124
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,180
Like the trial of Papa Joe Mastro

125
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,360
And Mama

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,220
I just have to share these new old demonic discoveries

127
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,220
This potpourri, friends, of mostly music this show

128
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,380
It was a bunch of bands, great bands at Starwood

129
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,360
Including this singer Hallie DeVestern

130
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,040
Who is heard in the background as Janice Joplin

131
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,260
Let's listen to that a little bit more, shall we?

132
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,420
I know you're keepin' your heart down, baby

133
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,100
You know you got it

134
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,040
And it makes you feel good, yeah

135
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,460
Alright friends, that was Woodstar 99

136
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,420
That's where the subgeniuses went for in New York State for Woodstock

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,400
It was the same weekend, it was the same weekend

138
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,380
It was Woodstock apparently

139
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,820
Anyway, that gal that we just heard, Hallie DeVestern

140
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,980
Also, but she doesn't just play with Big Brother

141
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,800
She's not just a Janice Joplin sound alike

142
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,080
In fact, she has her own album CD out called Sugar Free

143
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,520
And boy is it, just listen to this dear friends

144
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,880
My imagination runs

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,400
Like dirty water

146
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,360
Never knew that I was

147
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,400
Somebody's baby daughter

148
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Murder thrillin' through my bones

149
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,780
And through my head

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,480
I got a bloody screamin' jungle

151
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,420
Just wanna love you until you're dead

152
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,880
I feel like an animal

153
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,560
I can't control my head

154
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm small like an animal

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,940
That's how an animal understands

156
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,120
I got the brains of an animal

157
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,820
Anything feels right

158
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,280
I got the teeth of an animal

159
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,480
And I don't know not to bite

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,360
I dig a moment out

161
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,540
I dig a hole in my head

162
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,220
How evil hangs around

163
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,640
Nobody knows

164
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,860
I got a memory

165
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,500
Blood in my mouth

166
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,820
I can tell you what goes again

167
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,040
I can tell you what comes out

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,220
I feel like an animal

169
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,920
Can't control my head

170
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
I smile like an animal

171
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,520
That's how an animal understands

172
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,220
How an animal understands

173
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,460
I got the brains of an animal

174
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,460
And it keeps being drank at

175
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,660
I got the teeth of an animal

176
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,840
And I don't know not to bite

177
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,040
I feel like running all the time

178
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,220
I feel like dying all the time

179
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,660
I feel like drinking your blood

180
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Baby I love you

181
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,400
I feel like running all the time

182
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,520
I feel like dying all the time

183
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,220
I feel like drinking your blood

184
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,820
I feel like dying all the time

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,680
My imagination runs

186
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,320
Like dirty water

187
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,120
Never know why that I was

188
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,540
Somebody's baby daughter

189
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,800
You might have thrown him through my bones

190
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,380
And through my head

191
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,220
I got a bloody screaming jaws

192
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,380
I wanna love you until you're dead

193
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,740
I feel like an animal

194
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
He can't control my head

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,880
I smile like an animal

196
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,760
That's how an animal understands

197
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,020
I got the brains of an animal

198
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,900
And it keeps being drank at

199
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,780
I got the teeth of an animal

200
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,540
And I don't know not to bite

201
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,780
I don't know

202
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
I feel like drinking your blood

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,500
And it keeps being drunk at

204
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:13,980
I feel like an animal

205
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,680
That keeps being drunk at

206
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,620
I feel like jam might kill me

207
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:15,960
I feel like alive in my shadows

208
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,540
Likehhhhh

209
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,540


210
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,540


211
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,580
Aesates

212
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,440
Isates

213
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:24,660
I see

214
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,680
Its all your-

215
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,960
criteria

216
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,320
genius that you're planning to have come to your event.

217
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,880
You know, just because they probably didn't inform you of this,

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,860
you know, they're a religion that makes fun of all the

219
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,600
other religions, which is true. Although they left out the

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,940
one that we make the most fun of, which is our own. And this person

221
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,800
was, I didn't actually see the letter, but apparently she said,

222
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,520
and you know, us pagans, whatever that means, I mean, give me a break.

223
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,480
Us pagans have enough trouble as it is with persecution

224
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,660
by the normals at large, and so you really

225
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,800
shouldn't allow anyone to make fun of pagans

226
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,540
because then somebody might get the wrong idea.

227
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,320
Friends, that is exactly why the Church of the Subgenus

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,540
has to be here!

229
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Because I would think somebody was getting the wrong idea. I'm from

230
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,460
Dallas, Texas.

231
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,920
Usually when we get censored by people, it's the Southern Baptists,

232
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,900
not the pagans, saying, no, you're not allowed

233
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,580
to make fun of us because that's negative.

234
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,560
And in fact, we get that complaint a lot. Apparently, there's something

235
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,720
terribly negative in a lot of Saturnian energy or something about

236
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,840
a big room full of people laughing cathartically at shit

237
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,240
that had them crippled up until that time.

238
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,120
So,

239
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,800
to the painfully politically correct,

240
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,900
can't take a joke, pagans. We just have to say,

241
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,400
oh, okay, we won't praise Bob. We'll just hail Connie. How's that?

242
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,940
And we'll make fun of everybody except the religions

243
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,480
that are really right.

244
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,680
There we go.

245
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,800
So, that means we can still make fun of the Church of the Subgenus

246
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,140
because,

247
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
well, every now and then we get proved wrong.

248
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,140
I had said this last year, but I'll say it again, I wasn't supposed to be here today.

249
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,940
We, well,

250
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,120
I don't know if I want to, what is this about pagan?

251
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,220
We're not allowed to make fun of pagans. Look at the schedule for this Starwood.

252
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,380
Now, I'm not putting any of these down specifically.

253
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,020
I wasn't at it, but magic,

254
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,520


255
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,520


256
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,520


257
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,260
I went to a church for potheads.

258
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,060
I wanted to go to that one, actually.

259
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,180
I thought that was the Church of the Subgenus.

260
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,620
Uh,

261
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,460
God, um,

262
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,480
well,

263
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,420
partnered therapeutic massage.

264
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,900
I notice that probably sounds a little better than nude yoga, partner yoga,

265
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,940
but I want to go to the nude partner yoga.

266
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,940
Not the therapy, not the therapeutic massage.

267
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,700
Stalking the wild druid.

268
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,380
That,

269
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,120
That's easy, that's like a snide pun.

270
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,120
Teen swim is always interesting.

271
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,720
I am a clone, I am not alone.

272
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,780
I live in a home where the other clones roam.

273
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,880
We just sit around and get stoned.

274
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,720
I am a clone, why don't you leave me alone?

275
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,560
In my plastic world in a made-away zone.

276
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,160
It's the only place I call home.

277
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,720
I wonder as I wander.

278
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,360
What is it?

279
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,000
What ever happened to the time?

280
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,800
When paper mills would sing with their minds.

281
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,380
I wonder as I wander down the line.

282
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,120
I wonder as I wander down the line.

283
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,280
How this town has to be again.

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,920
I am a clone, I whisper IN THOSE.

285
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,540
I was born an all caught monely drone.

286
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,560
Not a Ż ascendant drone.

287
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,240
But at home.

288
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,360
I enjoy.

289
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,360


290
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,360


291
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,100
I am a crone, I am not a rogue

292
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,440
I live in a land of silicon and chrome

293
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,520
There's never a one or a bone

294
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,100
I wonder as I wander

295
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,420
Whatever happened to the time

296
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,100
When people could see with their minds

297
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,700
I wonder as I wander down the line

298
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,440
I wonder as I wander down the line

299
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,160
I, I, I, I

300
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I am a crone but I won't be for long

301
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,740
From inside I planned a little bomb

302
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,100
To turn everything off once and for all

303
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,020
I am a crone now I'm on the run

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,960
From my plastic world in a fadeaway zone

305
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,440
And I'm never ever going home

306
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,920
I wonder as I wander

307
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Whatever happened to the time

308
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,920
When people could see with their minds

309
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,580
I wonder as I wander down the line

310
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,180
I wonder as I wander down the line

311
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,240
I wonder as I wander down the line

312
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,840
And I see things in disgusting trickle

313
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:38,840


314
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,900
And keep people on the run

315
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,600
If that's what my love taught me

316
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,840
That I could never stop

317
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,500
Don't need another charm

318
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,140
I just want one to keep me on the run

319
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,880
I will run instead, run

320
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,180
I won't run in the bullpen I don't know how to do it

321
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:04,240
I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone, I'm a clone.

322
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,900
The year 2020.

323
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,900
We'll never know what the conspiracy was.

324
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,720
They will have grown up without humans on the earth, or on earth.

325
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,880
Well, I guess this is what we were supposed to do.

326
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,360
Now, we got the music started up.

327
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,320
The cult leader in the kimono.

328
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,420
This guy got all the people in the weird little dome room.

329
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
And, uh...

330
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,360
I...

331
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,700
I...

332
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:46,700


333
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,900
That's right.

334
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,580
We have switched on the artificial gravity.

335
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,860
If it goes off, the power fails, and the ceiling starts to collapse, and we start floating up, don't panic.

336
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,980
Just don't open the airlock.

337
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:16,700
Whatever you do, if the power goes off and we're floating, don't try to open it.

338
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,460
If it goes off, we can get out.

339
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,560
We'll get sucked out of there like a little toothpaste out of a toothpaste can.

340
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,940
So we won't be there.

341
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah.

342
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,200
You thought it was gonna be a real funny joke, making fun of that Christian religion, right?

343
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,260
Yeah!

344
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,880
It was just that funny, satirical, fake cult president.

345
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,760
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

346
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,680
You thought it was gonna be a real funny joke, making fun of that Christian religion, right?

347
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:46,680


348
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,440
You thought, oh, I'll drop acid for that Einstein's Secret.

349
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,300
Oh.

350
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,240
Hell is a funny joke, isn't it?

351
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,860
Oh.

352
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Yeah, hell is a joke!

353
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,520
And whenever those demons tried to tell you about it, you thought you were at some kind

354
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,760
of an experimental comedy show or something!

355
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,660
They were trying to tell you...

356
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:16,660


357
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:16,660


358
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,700
They tell you you're in hell now, you've been here forever,

359
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,140
it's never gonna change.

360
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,340
And you laughed and laughed and laughed.

361
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,380
But it's not laughing now, are you?

362
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Oh, hell, now they are.

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,280

Wonderful singer and songwriter.

422
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,820
Doesn't have anything at all to do with Church of the Subgenius.

423
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,380
Poor thing.

424
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,360
If she ever hears this show, she'll probably be horribly confused.

425
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,460
I certainly am myself.

426
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,840
Friends, we've also heard Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing I Am a Clone.

427
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,240
They played at Starwood.

428
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,320
Just absolutely unbelievable.

429
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,160
The CD is called E equals S-O squared.

430
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,140
And it's not yet available.

431
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,280
But they're at P.O. Box 81555 Cleveland, Ohio 44101.

432
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,760
I think.

433
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,100
I think that's.

434
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,820
I'm not at my usual studio, friends.

435
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm hiding.

436
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,600
And what did we do at Starwood in that strange little dome, that puffer dome?

437
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,320
This weird environment.

438
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,760
Oh, strange.

439
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,840
Here we are.

440
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,500
I used up all my fancy talk.

441
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,860
There's no fancy talk left.

442
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,020
All we can do is be real here now that we're in the dome.

443
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,140
And the earth is so far, far, far away.

444
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,580
Oh, no!

445
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,980
Oh, no!

446
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,780
He's got the oxygen.

447
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,800
Oh, man.

448
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,400
If you hadn't let that oxygen in, I'd make a tie.

449
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,120
Cowboy Dave entered the dome just in time.

450
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,620
He ran out of coolies.

451
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,940
We were just going to stop him.

452
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,860
The whole thing started to collapse.

453
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,220
He got the oxygen with nitrous oxide or something.

454
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,080
Oh, they'd love that.

455
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,180
Don't ever do that, kids.

456
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,900
If you ever steal the big tank of laughing gas from behind the hospital,

457
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,880
don't take it in the closet and turn it on.

458
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't drive out to Lover's Leap and close the car window.

459
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,940
Turn it off.

460
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,180
You should always have a grown-up like Bob Dobbs there.

461
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,600
And his little balloons.

462
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,500
Oh, yeah.

463
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,160
Wow.

464
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,400
Coming up next, Mr. Ivan Stang, the very reverent doctor, super dental magic magician,

465
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,180
Ivan Stang.

466
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,120
I heard that he's just coming off a tour with Kiss Psycho Circus, and that he's managed

467
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,040
to come here and play with us.

468
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
So we're going to do a Q&A.

469
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,800
And the biggest song is going to be our tribute to a psycho circus, Ivan Stang.

470
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
Let's do this.

471
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,040
This really took me by surprise, dear friends.

472
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,700
This is a band called Peachy Neachy playing at Starwood.

473
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,220
And I had no idea that I had been on tour with Kiss.

474
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,340
And I don't know a damn thing about them.

475
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,760
I don't know a damn thing about the band called Kiss.

476
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,740
So this song they're doing in the background doesn't make...

477
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,980
You got me.

478
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:21,280
It's a world of mysteries out there in subgenius land in our strange travels.

479
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,360
But let's listen to this.

480
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,560
Peachy Neachy, by the way, never spells the name of the band the same way twice.

481
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,120
And I've seen a pretty astounding number of ways to spell it so far.

482
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm good.

483
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,020
This is the tune we're writing.

484
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,780
You come when I'm gone

485
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,240
It's a bold new school

486
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,060
What a cool time

487
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,000
You're all fired up

488
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,280
You think you have said it all

489
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,280


490
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,280


491
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:58,140
Yeah, thatvicano expert

492
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,880
Master of the� Lyft

493
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,060
I am a cool mess, heavy metal cool mess

494
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,700
Either heavy metal, shoot me dead

495
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,540
I am a wanker, heavy metal wanker

496
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,000
Go every week, see the same fans

497
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,580
They're the coolest, heavy metal rulers

498
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,820
They all sound the same, but call each other shacks

499
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah

500
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,140
Our band did it first, your band is the worst

501
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,840
Form your tricks while up on stage

502
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,020
Heavy metal action, head-bagging action

503
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,260
Done 20 years ago, band, twice that age

504
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,460
Gotta be a wanker, heavy metal wanker

505
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:08,840
All we got is this thug law

506
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,040
Those guys call me Miche

507
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,040


508
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,220
Some call me Zach

509
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,280
Hang the straw out, my blood looked well

510
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,580

512
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,040
Sleep all day, drink all night

513
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,580
You're a loser,icano

514
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:27,580


515
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:27,800
Yeah I'm trying to tell you

516
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


517
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


518
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


519
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,020
I wear my leather jacket and my jeans real tight

520
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,940
Like Rocky

521
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,320
I am a poser, 90's version poser

522
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,560
I gotta fly and be all the best gear

523
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,020
Live with my parents, say it's lots of cabbage

524
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,820
G in the studio and all the year

525
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,600
You gotta be a wanker, heavy metal wanker

526
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,160
I'm a wanker, heavy metal wanker

527
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,500
I'm a wanker, heavy metal wanker

528
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,040
I'm a wanker, heavy metal wanker

529
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,900
Well, that's it. Here's your keys.

530
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,300
Goodbye friends and happy motoring back on the freeway which is already in progress.

531
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,360
Whoa. Well, here goes.

532
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
Oh, nice feel.

533
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,060
Oh, hmm. Let's see.

534
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:42,700
Oh, how can you be in two places at once when you're not anywhere at all?

535
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,900
I think I'll give this old baby a spin on the freeway.

536
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,740
Wrong way.

537
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,020
Here we go.

538
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,180
Entering freeway.

539
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,840
Emergency parking only.

540
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
Emerging buses ahead.

541
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,180
Giant slide. 19 holes. Underground parking.

542
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,760
Mitten Hills retirement paradise.

543
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,000
Swingers only.

544
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,800
Oh, too bad.

545
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,220
Easy access.

546
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,160
Goldoni Avenue, half mile.

547
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,480
Spidometer check. Zero.

548
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,640
Oh, Strasburg Lane.

549
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,940
Strasburg's only got half a mile on it.

550
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,160
Antelope Freeway, five and a shield.

551
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,520
North all two miles.

552
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,240
Antelope Freeway North.

553
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:24,060
Do I want to go north or do I want to take the, let's see, the Gomorrah Expressway West?

554
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,060
Cheryl Valley Condoms if you lived here.

555
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,560
You'd be home by now.

556
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,020
Antelope Hills. Selected living. Comfortable.

557
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,760
Antelope Freeway. This lane. Exit only.

558
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,680
I think I'll take the old Antelope.

559
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,440
Less traffic.

560
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,320
Street overpass.

561
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,020
Antelope Freeway. One mile.

562
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,340
Clean up Armenia.

563
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,940
Get a hair lift.

564
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,680
Antelope Freeway. One half mile.

565
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,660
Chili Avenue overpass.

566
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,360
Let's see what they've got in this car.

567
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,540
Antelope Freeway. One quarter mile.

568
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,820
Let's see. We've got lights.

569
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,880
Antelope Freeway. One A5.

570
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,500
Wipers. Defrost.

571
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,060
Antelope Freeway. One A5.

572
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,580
16th mile.

573
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,220
Climate control. Hmm.

574
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,300
Antelope Freeway. One 32nd mile.

575
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,420
Let's see what kind of climate I can get.

576
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,720
Antelope Freeway. One 64th mile.

577
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:03,860


578
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,480
Spring Fever.

579
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,580
Antelope Freeway. One 128th mile.

580
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:07,960
Indian Summer.

581
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,740
Antelope Freeway. One 256th mile.

582
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,320
Tropical Paradise. Tropical Paradise.

583
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,660
Antelope Freeway. One 515th mile.

584
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,200
I think I'll give it a try.

585
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,120
What a groove.

586
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,780
A tropical paradise.

587
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,380
All right. All right.

588
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,020
This way. This way now.

589
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,320
What a wonderful clearing in the jungle.

590
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,600
Just the place to build our camp.

591
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,960
All right, you men. Get cracking now.

592
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,140
The pump tent's right over there, I think.

593
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,060
Right. The foundation should go right about here.

594
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,860
The stockade. The stockade.

595
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,820
Captain, excuse me, sir. May I speak to you alone, sir?

596
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,840
Why, of course you can.

597
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,800
Daddy, I've lost the Lincoln rods.

598
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,080
That's all right. I've got an erector set.

599
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,160
Show off.

600
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,460
Throw a towel over it.

601
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,380
Do some push-ups, Pablo. It'll go away.

602
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,400
Hey, hey, hey. What are you guys doing in my car?

603
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,160
The fox trot. You can have the next dance.

604
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,440
Herbert, throw him the fox.

605
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,420
This animal is sick.

606
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,040
Yes, it is a catchy little number, isn't it?

607
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,040


608
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,720
Uh-oh. I think he's caught it. Doctor giving something for his car.

609
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,540
All right, all right. Here's a quarter.

610
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,960
Oh, that's not much.

611
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,960
It's not much of a cost.

612
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,020
I need a gas station. Did I pass one?

613
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,860
No, no. But the fox did. Squeeze him right there. Maybe he'll pass another one.

614
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,800
Oh, no. Gasoline.

615
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,900
Oh, my boy. If it's drugs you want, the old doctor can help you out.

616
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,780
Right this way.

617
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,180
Get your hands off me. I don't want to leave.

618
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,460
Then roll up your arm and bend over. Do you want regular or premium?

619
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,720
Oh, this is ridiculous. You guys are nothing but a pack of cars.

620
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,680
Drink me.

621
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,780
Eat me.

622
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,620
Smoke me.

623
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,160
Dream to me only with fine farts.

624
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,500
There must be some way out of this. I'll change the air. That's what I'll do.

625
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,080
What if I got left on climate control?

626
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,780
Dust storm?

627
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,740
No, no. Hurt your lungs.

628
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,580
Tibetan wilderness?

629
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,600
No, no. You'll get lost.

630
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,320
Land of the Pharaohs?

631
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
No, don't do it.

632
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
Land of the Pharaohs.

633
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,280
Don't do it.

634
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,460
That sounds...

635
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,440
Don't do it. Don't do it.

636
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,600
Hey, this isn't the Land of the Pharaohs.

637
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,740
And that wasn't the Firesign Theater, dear friends.

638
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,720
That was...

639
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,640
You ever hear of cover bands?

640
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,900
Well, that was the Firesign Clones.

641
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,220
It's actually the...

642
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,960
Mostly it's the organizers of Starwood,

643
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,240
which is a group called the Chameleon Club.

644
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,320
In Cleveland.

645
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,500
Where they live on DNA level C.

646
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,020
And back in the day,

647
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,140
while we were weaned on them old Firesign Theater albums,

648
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,440
that one was from how can you be in two places at once

649
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,400
when you're not anywhere at all.

650
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,100
And boy, it's fun.

651
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,280
And yet, the...

652
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,480
You know the accents.

653
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,280
I don't know.

654
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,160
It'll never, ever be quite the same.

655
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
And nobody is ever the same

656
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,280
after they've been to that Starwood place.

657
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,200
So, let's go back there, shall we?

658
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,700
In this brief excerpt.

659
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,260
Uh, heard...

660
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,940
Here!

661
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,000
Sexuals, you know?

662
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,840
It's not like we're putting down the Y0K bug itself.

663
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,660
And...

664
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,660
And besides, it...

665
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,180
All of that stuff has just gotten so old and tiresome.

666
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,360
I mean, we've got six months to the end of the world

667
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,940
and it's already an old gag.

668
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,960
It did...

669
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,720
I did misread...

670
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,340
I saw the phrase Y2K,

671
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,020
which is almost as obnoxious as alien heads now.

672
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,600
And I misread it as Y2 cool.

673
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,920
And I thought,

674
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,520
that's what they really are gonna have to worry about.

675
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,820
Not the Y2...

676
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,080
Not...

677
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,200
It's not gonna...

678
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,280
It's gonna be more like...

679
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,000
Suddenly everything that was cool

680
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,940
won't be cool anymore.

681
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,140
It's like, my computer still works,

682
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,440
but my tattoo doesn't.

683
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,880
Anyway, this is called Y2K.

684
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,680
You guys should turn that on.

685
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,560
Duh.

686
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,100
It's coming closer,

687
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,100
that beast at the end of my hall.

688
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,580
They call it Y2K,

689
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,440
it's going to devour us all.

690
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,860
They're running specials,

691
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,720
tracing back to ancient history.

692
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,920
Then tracing forward day by day.

693
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,780
Day by day.

694
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,200
Recounting all the things accomplished in this century.

695
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,400
Now a little glitch is gonna make us pay.

696
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:37,360
Well, I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

697
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,620
Don't want to watch the world cave in tonight

698
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,680
and see my century disappear overnight.

699
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,700
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

700
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,320
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

701
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,940
You say at midnight,

702
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,860
no airplanes will fall from the sky.

703
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,820
Come on a trip to some exotic locale.

704
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,560
That the phones will work

705
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,480
and modems most likely won't fry.

706
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,760
And God's hand in a surprising hotel.

707
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,880
You swear there ain't no chance

708
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,440
of big financial slaughter.

709
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,220
No depression.

710
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,540
You swear by everything it's true.

711
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,060
But I see you storing spam

712
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,840
and gallons of good water.

713
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,100
So I'm no longer sure of you.

714
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,900
Well, I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

715
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,140
Don't want to watch the world cave in tonight

716
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,240
and see my century disappear overnight.

717
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,680
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

718
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,460
Don't want to give away

719
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,520
my memories and moments in time.

720
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,920
It's the millennium and I don't want to enter.

721
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,360
Faces and names I know of.

722
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,820
Songs that occasionally rhyme.

723
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,080
I still can operate my entertainment center.

724
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,260
I am so comfortable with ones and nines as heroes.

725
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,920
I love their steady attitude.

726
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,520
Now you want me on my knees in front of all those zeros.

727
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,280
And I'm pretty sure I'm getting screwed.

728
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,840
No!

729
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,700
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

730
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,160
Don't want to watch the world cave in tonight.

731
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,240
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

732
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,240


733
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,480
And see my century disappear overnight.

734
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,060
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

735
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,120
I don't want to go Y2K-ing.

736
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,300
I don't want to go Y2K-ing.

737
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,100
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

738
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,540
I'm gonna huddle in a corner and take cover.

739
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,540
Undercover.

740
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:17,540


741
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,940
Say a prayer and close my eyes.

742
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,580
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

743
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,680
So when the moment comes we vanish and it's over.

744
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,940
Going down now.

745
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,940
At least it won't be no surprise.

746
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,680
Please.

747
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,340
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

748
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,620
Don't want to watch the world cave in tonight.

749
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,820
And see my century disappear overnight.

750
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,520
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

751
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,820
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

752
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,100
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

753
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,860
I don't want to go Y2K-ing tonight.

754
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,900
I don't want it.

755
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,220
Ooh, I'm not ready.

756
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,220
I'm not compliant.

757
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,200
Y2K-ing.

758
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,080
I don't want to go.

759
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,140
Y2K-ing.

760
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,460
I don't want to go.

761
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,640
Y2K-ing.

762
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,940
I don't want to go.

763
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,340
Y2K-ing.

764
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,600
I don't want it, y'all.

765
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,880
Y2K-ing, tonight.

766
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,840
No!

767
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:53,880
Reboot.

768
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,540
Wow, dear friends.

769
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,900
Amazing.

770
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,320
Thank you, Victoria

771
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,180
Ganger and

772
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,100
Revelry, which is

773
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,980
M.A. Tummins and Princess

774
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,300
We Are Doe.

775
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,280
Recorded there live at Starwood.

776
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,920
Victoria Ganger and Revelry.

777
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,240
It's a

778
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,060
Vicky does wonderful

779
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,580
computer songs and

780
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,140
has done the

781
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,640
famous Bob song,

782
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,340
My Wallet Belongs to Bob, as well as

783
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,540
many others, but now it sounds

784
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,200
like we're going deeper into

785
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,440
Einstein's secret

786
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,320
orchestra, or possibly

787
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,720
the

788
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,780
well, I

789
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,440
there's absolutely

790
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,020
two of these creatures

791
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,440
that are really, really

792
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:42,920
hard.

793
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,720
I don't know.

794
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,440
I don't know.

795
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,320
I don't know.

796
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,320


797
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,440
I don't know.

798
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:49,440


799
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,400
Bob pays real good, but every

800
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,880
now and then he takes something

801
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,260
and he took my sense of balance.

802
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,480
Sometimes in an environment like

803
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,680
this where you can't see the

804
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,400
ground, things start to spin.

805
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,160
Sometimes things really do start

806
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,700
to spin.

807
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,700
And you just think it's the

808
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,120
disease.

809
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,220
That's just the way it is.

810
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,220


811
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,420
It's not just a

812
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:13,800
body effect.

813
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,440
It's your teeth, you know.

814
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,660
That's where the microphones are.

815
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,580
My eyes

816
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,680
pull them in.

817
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,600
I have them.

818
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,240
That's what I'm saying.

819
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,780
Yes, we fooled them, didn't we, friends?

820
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,820
I forgot to give the contact address for Vicky Ganger and Revelry.

821
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,440
Are you ready?

822
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,220
I'm ready.

823
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


824
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


825
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


826
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


827
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


828
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


829
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


830
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


831
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


832
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


833
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


834
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


835
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


836
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


837
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


838
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


839
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,220


840
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,520
It's an email address.

841
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,220
RevelryPro at AOL.com.

842
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,780
That's RevelryPro at AOL.com.

843
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,960
I suppose I could give a phone number.

844
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,880
I don't think I'd better do that here.

845
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:11,540
Or you can just write to Bob, friends, if you have any question about anything at all.

846
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,200
Just write to Bob.

847
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:27,340
Just write to good old J.R. Bob Dobbs here at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas,

848
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
75214.

849
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,980
The www. is a genius.

850
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,100
The website is subgenius.com.

851
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:54,920
Creepy.

852
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:55,860
Creepy.

853
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah.

854
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,880
You signed up with that subgenius church.

855
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,360
Oh, yeah, that's real funny.

856
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,480
It'd be like that heavy metal band I was into, making fun of the devil and God.

857
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,720
Hey, hey, let's go down to the graveyard, kids.

858
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,500
Hey.

859
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:11,960
Hey.

860
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,420
Hey.

861
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,420


862
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,420


863
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,420


864
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,420


865
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,420


866
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,420


867
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,800
I did not do blasphemous things.

868
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,540
Yeah.

869
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:21,300
And then you thought, oh, those pagans, they take their clothes off.

870
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:21,780
They're...

871
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,780
It's more fun.

872
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,300
Big party.

873
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:25,780
Yeah.

874
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,460
No responsibility.

875
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,440
God's not look at.

876
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,300
We got to keep on.

877
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:31,400
And guess what?

878
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,420
That's right.

879
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,500
Praise Bob.

880
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,940
Actually, God was looking the whole time.

881
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,800
Going right on.

882
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,680
OK.

883
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:41,940
Well, that's the truth, grab the х carbonator and talk aboutcjon.

884
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:41,940


885
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:41,940


886
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:41,940


887
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:41,940


888
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,580
Go at it.

889
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,500
I cut those strings thousands, millions and millions of years ago.

890
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,080
You've got free will.

891
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,540
That's the way it's been done for billions and billions of years.

892
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,460
I've been through it all.

893
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,220
I've been through it all.

894
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,680
And it's free.

895
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,140
No, no, really.

896
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,780
And it's free.

897
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,640
And it's free.

898
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,400
And it's free to go to you.

899
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,500
When I broke my heart, baby.

900
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,940
Oh, honey.

901
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,940
Did not belong in tears.

902
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,860
Did not belong in tears.

903
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:41,920
Did not belong in tears.

904
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:41,920


905
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,840
Did not belong in tears.

906
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,900
Did not belong in tears.

907
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,360
Did not belong in tears.

908
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,620
Oh, sorry, friends.

909
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:55,820
That's from my videotape of Big Brother and the Holding Company from Starwood a couple of weeks ago.

910
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,540
Strange, huh?

911
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,480
Well, let's go back to Subgenius at Starwood.

912
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,620
Sorry.

913
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,380
The shop will be open tomorrow.

914
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,900
There really is an ESO and Subgenius shop down the road there.

915
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,760
Tranquility.

916
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,040
Tranquility base.

917
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,880
Where you can land and wear your moon pants freely.

918
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,380
Among other moon pants aficionados.

919
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:34,260
Sure, others laugh at us for our moon pants and our fixation on moon pants.

920
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:41,220
And the relentless irrelevance of the moon pants.

921
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:41,740
Yeah.

922
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,460
But we already launched the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer into near Earth orbit.

923
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,360
And what less relevant thing is there next than the moon pants?

924
00:50:52,540 --> 00:51:02,900
Have you ever noticed how religions seem to really fixate on the most trivial, random, seemingly random, nonsensical objects?

925
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,160
Those are the best kind.

926
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,480
.

927
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,940
.

928
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,480
Officer, have you ever read Mad Magazine?

929
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,540
Let's pray that none of us have to say that line this year.

930
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,380
I've had to say that every year to some.

931
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,800
Officer, have you ever heard of Mad Magazine?

932
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:33,800
.

933
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,360
Well, that's all we're doing, really.

934
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,380
.

935
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,720
It's just a funny joke.

936
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,920
Just a satire.

937
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,840
Because look what they did to all our predecessors who tried to act too serious.

938
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:52,960
Yeah.

939
00:51:53,660 --> 00:52:02,180
Wouldn't it have to come back as a joke just to survive like a rat in the walls, like a cockroach immune to the poison?

940
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:11,480
Just to be ignorant.

941
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:11,600
Not sure if they

942
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,000
were being sincere or your style or just some random bad

943
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:30,400
piece of crap that isn't a joke or more terrible.

944
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,400


945
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:38,340
Will the weight of the conspiracy day job drag us down into acts of random petty vindictiveness

946
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:44,680
and snobbishness and bad deed doing?

947
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:52,520
No! We all want to do good deeds and be positive, like Bob, and be cool, and get laid, and get rich!

948
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:59,160
Rich without working! That's it! We're not communists! We want everything now!

949
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,020
We want our cake and to be able to eat it too!

950
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,480
Wasn't that what the damn cake was for in the first place?

951
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:23,540
They complain all the time about the whore of Babylon, but they never told you how good looking she was now, did they?

952
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,400
No, they always leave that part out.

953
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:39,540
Man, it's 1-5-20. There's probably great fireworks going down there, and you guys are sitting here staring at some asshole in a kimono.

954
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,580
Good night!

955
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,280
Good night!

956
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:51,120
Hey, what happens if they...

957
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,540
I'm going home!

958
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,380
Let's just open the airlock and let it collapse!

959
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,880
No, don't do that!

960
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,080
End of the world trip!

961
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:58,360
Don't do that!

962
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,420
Don't turn off the artificial gravity yet!

963
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,120
I have to do it, but it's bad.

964
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,800
Bob has left the building.

965
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,900
Close the damn door!

966
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:17,800
I'm sorry!

967
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,560
Okay, close it! Give me the clothes!

968
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,600
I got a little bit of trouble coming in.

969
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,000
What's Bob's name again?

970
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,280
Come on, let it get up! Let it get up!

971
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,680
Going down now!

972
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,400
Beautiful!

973
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,040
Let it get up! Give it a nice up!

974
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,800
Ah, that's how I felt last night.

975
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,160
Yeah.

976
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
Let it get up!

977
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,860
Just give it a minute, it'll get back up!

978
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,500
Wait a minute, think about baseball!

979
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:41,920
Ha ha ha!

980
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,400
Ha ha ha!

981
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,420
Ha ha ha!

982
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:47,420


983
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,820
Think about baseball!

984
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,920
Ha ha ha!

985
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,200
All right, you're all right, really.

986
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:52,680
Let's run.

987
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,360
Bunch it, get ready, go! Go! Go!

988
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,860
Go! Go!

989
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,680
Yeah!

990
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,000
All right!

991
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,600
juego

992
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,720
Starwood, dear friends, is a real interesting festival.

993
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:43,960
It started about a million years ago by a very interesting group in Cleveland called ACE, or the Association for Consciousness Exploration.

994
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:58,320
And the best way to get a grip on that would be to check out their website at www.rosencomet.com.

995
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,700
That's www.rosencomet.com.

996
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,480
That's www.rosencomet.com.

997
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:13,280
Rosencomet being spelled R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T.

998
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,480
Uh, yeah.

999
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,720
Dear friends.

1000
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:28,740
And actually, oh, if only you could see the great bonfire at the end of Starwood, which is...

1001
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:29,680
It has...

1002
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,600
It's sort of become a pagan event, you might say.

1003
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:41,440
It's a spectacular scene on Saturday nights when the giants come out and light the giant bonfire.

1004
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:49,940
And all the tiny ant-like pagan midgets, like Ewoks, dance naked around the great fire.

1005
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,820
It's the fire and the flames.

1006
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,860
It looks like a scene out of hell itself.

1007
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,360
And they look like they're having about as much fun as they would be in subgenius hell.

1008
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,420
In fact, they are.

1009
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,480
In fact, I built it.

1010
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,100
Brain.

1011
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,100
It's a story about the shrinking intellect.

1012
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,080
It's about a whole town full of people whose brains got smaller at one time.

1013
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,420
Well, it actually took about five years.

1014
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,980
I don't know what started it.

1015
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,060
I don't know where it began.

1016
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:19,140
But it reached such a sorry state that people would walk up and down from one edge of the town to the other,

1017
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,900
burbling inanities to each other and sniveling off people they didn't quite dig.

1018
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,680
And then, pretty soon, big hunks there.

1019
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,140
They fell out.

1020
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,180
And because the decay had seeped down...

1021
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,680
Uh-oh.

1022
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:29,680


1023
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:29,680


1024
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:29,680


1025
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,500
...the brain area all the way into their mouths.

1026
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,320
And next thing you know, the tongues was a-wiggling, and they were in pain.

1027
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,060
That's right.

1028
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,980
They were in some heavy, dark pain.

1029
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,240
But the tongues to wagon.

1030
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,360
The brain was dead.

1031
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,400
The brain had actually atrophied into a piece of lumpage.

1032
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:45,840
Say what?

1033
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,120
Another prophetic vision brought to you by...

1034
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,000
You'll thank us for it later.

1035
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,860
Or now.

1036
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
He said, well, that may be.

1037
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,660
But I doubt it.

1038
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,280
But I doubt it.

1039
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,240
We must be ID'd now.

1040
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,480
We must be bona fide.

1041
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,880
Consider yourself ID'd.

1042
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,640
Yes.

1043
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,760
So that means that we know where they know where to come and get us, so to speak.

1044
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,480
They always did.

1045
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,780
They're rounding us up lately.

1046
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,620
They gave us the room to do it in.

1047
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,940
They listen through your teeth.

1048
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:11,720
Yep.

1049
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,560
All this equipment belongs to them.

1050
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,640
So they don't need to watch us as long as we're watching TV,

1051
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:24,080
and they don't need to put mics on us as long as we're running around doing these stupid radio shows.

1052
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,560
Really?

1053
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,460
We just, you know, we're pretty much saying what we think it is and so forth,

1054
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,460
and then we're having our...

1055
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,900
We're having our teeth drilled while we're watching television.

1056
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:36,180
What other group of people could be slandered in such a nice and sumptuous way?

1057
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,380
God bless America.

1058
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,300
God bless America.

1059
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,240
God bless America.

1060
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:39,640
Really?

1061
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,520
We're on more stations than Howard Stern is.

1062
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,480
And we get much less money than him, which is a refractory illness,

1063
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,640
which we have to correct somehow, I think.

1064
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,520
We're real proud of that fact, though.

1065
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,580
Because we're not in it for the money.

1066
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,980
We never...

1067
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,020
This is integrity.

1068
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,540
We didn't want money or the world to end.

1069
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,180
What are we in?

1070
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,600
We meant to do this.

1071
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,500
What are we in?

1072
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,120
As a medium?

1073
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:14,100
I mean, regardless of what we're in it for, what is it?

1074
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,120
That's right.

1075
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,700
Are we in a spatial medium?

1076
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,920
Are we in a dimensional medium?

1077
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,600
What are we?

1078
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,180
This is like metaphysics now.

1079
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,000
What are you?

1080
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
I am a misogynistic beast.

1081
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,080
I think we took a wrong turn at that universe next door.

1082
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,980
I told...

1083
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,600
Well, that's what happens when you have parallel worlds.

1084
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,020
You can see them spinning around in for that one second.

1085
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,240
See?

1086
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,320
A woman came into my store today wanting me to take ads out in this,

1087
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,840
and I told her I thought this magazine was ruining people's lives.

1088
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:43,680
What?

1089
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,020
The Shifty-Eyed Times?

1090
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,200
The Shifty-Eyed Times.

1091
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,900
You know, Deepak Chopra...

1092
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,160
That's a typical New Age advertisement for Deepak Chopra.

1093
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,380
He is the head of an evil empire, which we don't even suspect.

1094
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,060
And while he's telling us that we can conceivably live to be 130,

1095
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,000
it will be a world on a slave planet where we literally have to

1096
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,020
shift the uranium sand off of our food, off of our peanut butter and jam sandwiches.

1097
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,460
That's right. Copper top.

1098
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,920
That's right, copper top.

1099
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,300
That's the word to describe it, too.

1100
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,240
A metallic overture.

1101
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:12,800
What does that mean?

1102
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:13,960
Copper top.

1103
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,260
What kind of an insult is that?

1104
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,000
That means we're human batteries, baby.

1105
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,940
We're all, you know...

1106
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,240
Can't you hear it?

1107
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,320
Did you hear that drilling?

1108
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:20,740
Yeah.
