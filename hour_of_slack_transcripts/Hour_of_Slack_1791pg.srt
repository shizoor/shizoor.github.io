1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
You know, outside organizations are wonderful,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,000
but they can only supplement the example and inspiration children should first receive from their...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,440
Some genius, powerful, smart.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,620
Within a year, most of the juveniles that exist today would disappear

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,160
because the family that prays together stays together.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
I sure hope it's Dave.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,840
Schweinholder.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Dave.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,200
It must be Dave.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Dave.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,860
Yes.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,360
It is Dave.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm the devil hiding in your swimming pool.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,080
God, I don't have a swimming pool.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Me too, because that's an actual real thing that happened up around here or down there.

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,320
What?

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,560
A devil in a swimming pool?

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,440
No, the devil went for a swim in a human body,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,700
and it wasn't a real...

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,020
He made a mistake, because even the devil can make a few mistakes,

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,800
because he's not perfect.

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,040
Only,

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,680
Bob is an imperfect sailor.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,400
And so, he said, I'm going to take maybe 50 laps.

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,340
He started drinking his swimming pool of water.

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,780
He couldn't get out of his body, back to being a devil.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
So, they put him, I guess, somewhere down the hall in room 329 or something.

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,560
Oh, he's in the country club nursing home with you?

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,140
Yeah.

30
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,060
Well, we call it a nursing home.

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,680
We know what kind of a home it is.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,260
Yeah, it's a real homey home.

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,980
Yeah, right.

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,760
Yeah.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,880
Home for homies.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
Friends, Dave's been sick for a month or two.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,620
And he's always been sick, and he always will be sick,

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,580
because it's a sick, sick, sick, sick world that we live in,

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,240
that Dave grew up in, and us too.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,940
Yes.

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,040
And it's getting sicker by the minute.

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,560
It certainly is.

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,420
I mean, just think of all these many viruses,

44
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,980
and now we're like, he used to be like,

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,420
oh, well, Korova's going to be over, or Kofet.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
What's the other one called?

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,260
Kofef.

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,380
Kofef 19.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Kofet.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,240
Yeah.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Kofet's going to be over.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,780
And there'll be another one starting with a K and a vowel sound.

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,660
Yeah.

54
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,780
Kaka.

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,600
Caused by hamburgers?

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,840
Hamburgers.

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Hamburgers.

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,320
No, hamburgers.

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,920
Hamburgers.

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,480
Hamburgers.

61
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,960
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,960
Anyway.

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,400
Okay.

64
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:26,880
Okay.

65
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,840
So, Dave, that's good.

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,340
It's good to hear you on the show again.

67
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,760
It sure is.

68
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,460
Well.

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,580
It's good to hear you on the show again.

70
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,400
The lads and laddies and lattices and lad things out there

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,680
had all been kind of going, where's Dave?

72
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,940
Yeah.

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Where's Lone Cow Dave?

74
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,100
Yeah.

75
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,080
Yeah, there's like a Lone Cow Dave-shaped hole in the show.

76
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,040
Buddy agrees.

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,880
Yeah, Buddy really agrees.

78
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
And it sounds like a dog.

79
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,780
Partially agrees.

80
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,960
He can't hear you.

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,080
He can't hear you.

82
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,220
Well, it's very, very moist and humid down, or very hot down in Tejas.

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,140
And I was just wondering if Buddy was a hot dog.

84
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,000
He's a hot dog and a cool cat.

85
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,020
Yes, we decided that just today.

86
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,520
That's his favorite thing is to go out in the yard and get baked and then come in the

87
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,020
house and put his belly on the ice cold floor and then go back out and get baked.

88
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,180
Back in and get cold.

89
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,060
He really likes getting baked.

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,640
He likes to go back and forth.

91
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,500
I used to like getting baked.

92
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,980
I haven't gotten baked in quite a few years now.

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,440
It was some of the best days of my life.

94
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Well, I didn't mean being baked on marijuana or anything.

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,640
Last time Buddy did that, he had to go to the hospital.

96
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh, yeah.

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,220
He decided to eat the whole snack.

98
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,380
The entire bag that had just been mailed to me.

99
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,540
Not that I would have anything like that around here normally.

100
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,700
But Buddy knew it was there.

101
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,720
He had butter in it.

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
He staggered around for quite a bit.

103
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,280
And then he ate it all.

104
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,580
And then I noticed he was sick.

105
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,980
Then he threw up.

106
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,400
And when I went to get a mop, the other dog ate the puke.

107
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,780
And then she staggered around and then threw up.

108
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,800
And, of course, I swept up the puke then and froze it.

109
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,120
And swallowed and then ate it.

110
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,180
We've still got it for later if we get desperate.

111
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,660
No, no.

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,480
Yeah, the next day, they slept it off.

113
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,920
And the next day, they were okay.

114
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,280
Although, at first, they got a fight.

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,040
They had painful vagina itch, right?

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,940
And then Buddy burned his draft card and Claudia burned her bra.

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,260
And they started a garage band.

118
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,040
Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Wow.

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,820
It did affect him.

121
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,640
It did.

122
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,860
Sounds like punk rock days.

123
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,500
Yeah.

124
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,160
I thought dogs were more like into Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky.

125
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,120
Tchaikovsky.

126
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,460
Tchaikovsky.

127
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:58,840
Tchaikovsky.

128
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:58,960
Tchaikovsky.

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


132
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


134
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


135
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,380
Tchaikovsky.

136
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,740
They are until they get into your medical cookies.

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,360
Yeah.

138
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,220
I guess, yeah.

139
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,980
Mm-hmm.

140
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,960
Yeah.

141
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,560
So, kids, you know, make sure those things are...

142
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,200
Actually, I was going to say, up high on a shelf, locked in a box, a wooden box with

143
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,180
a latch, and inside a freezer bag inside the wooden box, way up high where they can't get

144
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,380
it.

145
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,660
But that's where they...

146
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,940
They were when Buddy got them.

147
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,420
And little Buddy's industrial self.

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,820
The monster.

149
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,040
The monster is coming.

150
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,840
Well, what will prevent the monstrosity of the carboidolis virus from achieving any, you

151
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,280
know, can it slow down somehow?

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,620
Or do we all have to watch our dogs go nuts?

153
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:58,740
We have to all wear diving suits and the dogs have to wear scuba gear if we go out of our

154
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:58,960
room.

155
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,500
Can't just carry, like, a linkage bag of eggs?

156
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,260
Well, you can.

157
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,760
But they won't reach out of your room.

158
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,640
That's a special thing.

159
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,700
Yeah, I know how people feel when they feel incarcerated.

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
Because I've been incarcerated.

161
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,940
They wouldn't let you leave, right?

162
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,880
But it wasn't because you had the COVFEF-19.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,080
It was because you...

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,520
They were...

165
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,480
I think they were afraid that you'd fall down.

166
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,680
I tested negatory on Cora.

167
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,140
Cora alone.

168
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,940
One of our friends, the only other for real subgenius in Glen Rose, Texas.

169
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,220
There's more than one?

170
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,860
I'm trying to think which of her names I should use, if any.

171
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,460
I'll just skip it.

172
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,160
She had to be quarantined for...

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,360
For...

174
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,960
For...

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,740
Nine days just for flu.

176
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Regular, ordinary flu.

177
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,660
They wouldn't...

178
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,540
Her job made her stay home.

179
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,180
Yep.

180
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
She had to be...

181
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
They won't let her go to school, either.

182
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,440
She had to be clear of a fever for, I think, 14 days before they let her come back.

183
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,780
Princess, will you choice lean a little closer to the line?

184
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,280
Okay.

185
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,500
Remember, this is a radio show, not...

186
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,320
Okay.

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Did she have painful vaginal itch?

188
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,120
Like some of the rest of us?

189
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,520
Dave!

190
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,100
Dave!

191
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,840
That's...

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,580
No, I'm just wondering.

193
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm just wondering.

194
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,240
No, you...

195
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,980
That's not flu or cough theft.

196
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,380
That's...

197
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,420
That's Spanish fly.

198
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,740
Spanish fly flu.

199
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,540
Yeah, mixing pudding with tripe.

200
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,740
Spanish...

201
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,720
Spinach flu.

202
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Yeah.

203
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,880
Spinach flu.

204
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:54,540
We locked the kitty cats up so they wouldn't climb around on Tarzan's radio station while we're doing the show.

205
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,740
Because they do climb around on it.

206
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, they love to rollick around.

207
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,260
They love to rollick around in these fancy pieces of equipment.

208
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,420
Well, there's big plastic dinosaurs to knock over and all kinds of things to knock over.

209
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,020
A moon.

210
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,460
Well, I wish I could visit it just to get the hell out of here.

211
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,240
I bet you...

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
I bet you...

213
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:23,060
But, you know, Dave, even if you did get out of there, if Nurse Ratched would let you out and you were back at home, you'd just be...

214
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,260
It'd be the same.

215
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,640
You're still not supposed to leave or go anywhere.

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
No, he wants to come down here.

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:28,560


218
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,980
Visit us.

219
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,340
You have to...

220
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:43,160
Is it true that you are kind of implemented to not buy groceries, to only buy certain bags of Friendship and other toiletries?

221
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,400
I mean, don't they not want you to go outside too much?

222
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,780
Right.

223
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,180
For all citizens?

224
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,280
No one's supposed to go outside and they don't.

225
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,940
They stay home.

226
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,180
It's just like your novel, Dave, Neighbor World now.

227
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,380
Everything is a whole lot like Neighbor World.

228
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,620
See, listen to Buddy.

229
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,200
Buddy knows.

230
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,780
Yeah.

231
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,640
Everybody's looming, you know, getting real high off the light waves from their screen, only they don't call it looming.

232
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,700
They call it zooming.

233
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,600
Mm-hmm.

234
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
Well, there's zoom to loom.

235
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,480
The whole world is zooming now.

236
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,420
The phrase used that...

237
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,180
We went to a Zoom hangout of subgeniuses every Saturday at 3.20.

238
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,250
Central time.

239
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,270
There's a Zoom chat.

240
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:44,910
It's funny because it's a whole separate group of people that did the Zoom chat that are different from the Hour of Slack listeners, different from the forum readers, different from the Facebook people.

241
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:53,670
It's the Zoomers are a whole different looming crew of looners and Zoomers.

242
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,630
Loom crew.

243
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,070
Just as soon...

244
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,350
Yeah.

245
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,830
Zoom the looms and the loons into the moon.

246
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,710
Yeah.

247
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,370
After a while.

248
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,670
After a while, you get tired of it.

249
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:21,870
In fact, tonight, get this, Dave, tonight is the first Ask Dr. Hal virtual Zoom teleconference show where Dr. Hal will do his nightclub show from his room, his quarantine station.

250
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,350
And there'll be musicians that are going to be there.

251
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,730
Brian Allman will work with them.

252
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,410
And a lot of people are waiting to unfortunately pass out because they would like to go to billboard.

253
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,270
Yeah, it's very, very helpful.

254
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,270


255
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,350


256
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,870
Have a good day, everybody.

257
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:43,870


258
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,010
Bye, guys.

259
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,610
Talk to you soon.

260
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:54,870
Until then, gooodnight, everybody.

261
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,690
Yeah, bye, everybody.

262
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,330
Talk to you soon.

263
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,350
ah

264
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,090
to like play the blues and be in time with each other it would just sound like a subgenius band

265
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:12,890
so you know yeah i know what that quote sounds like unquote yeah yeah and so but yeah dr howell's

266
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:21,050
gonna be on and he'll i guess people can text their question to ask dr howell any well that

267
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,750
would be like right now wouldn't it no no no no that's uh that doesn't happen at all 10 p.m

268
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:35,790
eastern eastern time uh 7 p.m pacific time and blah blah blah in between and we have to check

269
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:43,710
it out at nine but that'll happen every second sunday of every month wow yeah every second sunday

270
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:51,030
of every month and maybe every other second sunday or second and fourth sunday something like that

271
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:58,010
every two weeks they'll be asked dr how cool online that's great he'll have to dress up like

272
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:05,490
charlie chaplin as a communist there was an old movie and charlie chaplin got run down the street

273
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,690
and he grabbed a danger flag which was red and the police thought he was a communist and he put him

274
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:19,030
in jail but he got out because of the the uh the minister's wife like eating cheese and carrying

275
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,030
the dog around with her actually

276
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,730
so i thought that worked out pretty well for everyone well except for the fact that charlie

277
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,150
chaplin movies were all in black and white so how do you get the red flag well yeah somebody has to

278
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:40,370
say hey look at that red flag not gray but red that he's carrying i think i think it was contextual

279
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:46,410
of the days that a certain type of construction flag was red because that's what he grabbed he

280
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,910
wasn't a communist he was a he was a neo um

281
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,830
neo neo light or something like that uh the story in europe

282
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,550
fast rule i don't know the subgenius historian reverend susie the floozy was

283
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:11,950
uh uh recently pointed out that she didn't she always thought that the commie red scare was a

284
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:18,890
50s thing but actually it's it started in the 20s yes yeah both in the united states and england

285
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,030
and in fact it's

286
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,310
uh peaky blinders they're after chasing after commies all the time or bedding down with commies

287
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,470
or buying dope from commies or whatever you know selling guns to commies that's and nothing's

288
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:40,510
changed that was a hundred years ago on television and nothing's changed you're absolutely right if

289
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:49,610
you listen to mr mr dr president presidential e.x trump you would know for certainly that uh it's

290
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:09,650
so of course his use of word art is silly and hard to do actually in other areas as well

291
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,110
he thinks it's still the most popular mode of the manhunt in the

292
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,190
i think sure you've got prime minister net gore he likes your work but personally for the past few

293
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,650
are cool. They're all white people.

294
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,030
Give me a break!

295
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,690
And they're run by an authoritarian

296
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,050
bunch of oligarchs, so they've

297
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,970
got to be perfect.

298
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,090
Right. Especially the oligarch part.

299
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,530
Sure. Yeah.

300
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,910
If only we could make America

301
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,110
just like Russia. That is

302
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,130
in fact what I think a lot of people in the

303
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,490
backs of their minds are thinking,

304
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,070
only they're confusing Russia with

305
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,190
the fictitious good old days

306
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,150
of America in the

307
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,230
fictitious 1950s.

308
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,070
Yeah. When everybody was

309
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,050
quote, happy, unquote, which is

310
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,310
also a complete lie.

311
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,510
Yeah.

312
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,590
I know that because I was there

313
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,050
and I didn't get

314
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,370
the plastic battleship

315
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,130
that I wanted. So I tell

316
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,170
you, the 50s were not that great.

317
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,150
Even for a little white boy.

318
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,010
There were also

319
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,610
little scuba divers you could

320
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,670
put up your nose

321
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,590
if you wanted to try.

322
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,290
Oh, you had those too, huh?

323
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,050
Yeah.

324
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,610
There were some little plastic scuba divers

325
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,610
if you put baking soda

326
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,690
in their back and then

327
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,790
stuck them in your nose, they'd actually swim

328
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,330
up to your brain and start eating.

329
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,810
Yeah, somebody might know what we're talking

330
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,890
about, perhaps, maybe.

331
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,550
I sure don't. You guys have me lost

332
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,450
as heck and be. Your brother would know.

333
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,470
Your brother had the little scuba diver.

334
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,290
I forget if it was...

335
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,630
It must have been baking soda.

336
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,870
Yeah, it was baking soda.

337
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,130
And then you drop it in a glass.

338
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,710
A glass of vinegar?

339
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,010
No, in the bathtub. And he'd kind of

340
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,750
poot his way around in

341
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,910
random circles. But at least he

342
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,950
moved, you know. He didn't just float there.

343
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,970
He moved. Because he had this

344
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,410
you know,

345
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,990
air coming out of his

346
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,830
whatever, his back.

347
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,450
His groin. Yeah, coming out of his

348
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,450
back, actually.

349
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,390
That was the orifice.

350
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,290
Well, things

351
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,510
certainly not only have changed, they've gotten

352
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:14,910
worse.

353
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,890
Most

354
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,110
things.

355
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,450
Oh, yeah.

356
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,130
Now the kids scuba divers are all run by

357
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,950
remote control and have, you know, legs and arms

358
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,030
that move and they actually swim through the water.

359
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,170
And in fact, they have AI free will.

360
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,810
But if you turn that part on, they'll swim

361
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,730
wherever they want to and maybe even attack you.

362
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,790
Yeah, but they're just a little dangerous.

363
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,930
But here's the thing.

364
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,250
They cost about 750 bucks a piece.

365
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,630
So, you know, whereas I think in our day, the little

366
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,950
baking soda scuba divers were

367
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,250
about three cents or something.

368
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,330
Maybe a dollar for the whole kit.

369
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,630
A dime per soldier.

370
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,270
For each Eastern Bloc soldier.

371
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,270
Well, you could for a dollar, you could you could get a hundred

372
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,430
green plastic army men.

373
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,750
And then I did.

374
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,750
Melt them.

375
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,570
You could melt them all if you had a sun gun movie lamp.

376
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:13,930
Yep.

377
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,710
You could do anti-war artworks using

378
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,070
piles of army men and melt them,

379
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,450
belt them into a partial slag.

380
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,810
So it looks like a tortured hill of fighting, struggling men.

381
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,010
Yep.

382
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,850
All green.

383
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,250
You could also get a chemistry kit.

384
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,470
You know, a team got to blow up and mix all the chemicals

385
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,710
in a vain effort to blow them up.

386
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,210
Speak up Dave, speak up.

387
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,730
Speak up Dave.

388
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,290
What about the chemistry set?

389
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,070
The Gilbert's chemistry set lab?

390
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,630
The Gilbert's chemistry set that he used to buy.

391
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,190
Yeah.

392
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,550
Thinking.

393
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,690
There's a lot of stuff.

394
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,450
He said, don't worry, just chemistry set will never blow up.

395
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,470
So you could save and you would try any way possible.

396
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,610
And if anything you could think of to make the chemistry set blow up in

397
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,390
someone's face.

398
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:57,870
Right.

399
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,970
We all do make a, make a smoky smelling thing come out.

400
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:02,790
Yeah.

401
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,170
Oh, I invented a, an invisibility potion just by randomly mixing chemicals

402
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,570
and painting them onto grasshoppers.

403
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,570
And one of the grasshoppers literally vanished.

404
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,510
And, uh, I realized I.

405
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,150
I had invented an invisibility potion, but I couldn't remember which chemicals.

406
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,330
I wasn't using the scientific method.

407
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,530
I wasn't being disciplined.

408
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,310
I wasn't keeping a list of each, you know, potion that I made.

409
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,590
And you were wearing ladies underwear too.

410
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,470
I believe you anyway.

411
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:30,990
No, no.

412
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,870
I didn't even know what ladies underwear were.

413
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,610
I didn't even know what ladies were then.

414
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,570
I was only like 10 years old.

415
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,250
I remember this was the fifties.

416
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,050
Right.

417
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,630
You were raised by wild wolves.

418
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,290
Well, I was raised by 1950s Americans and they didn't like to explain,

419
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,750
embarrassing details like how ladies were different from men.

420
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,470
Dad always wore a hat and a suit and a tie and mom always wore those Betty

421
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,310
Furness, uh, underpants and globe things.

422
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,690
You know, I have no idea what my mother wore under her dress.

423
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,310
No idea.

424
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,510
Why not?

425
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,030
I never, I was.

426
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,250
Is that such an uncommon desire or want?

427
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,070
I wanted to see what my mom was wearing under her underwear.

428
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,270
Yeah.

429
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,430
All right.

430
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,210
I shouldn't have said, I didn't mean that dad.

431
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,470
Well, you were braver than me then, man.

432
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,270
Well, I've always been braver than you.

433
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,910
I gotta admit, I, there were times when I w we would sneak into our parents' bathroom

434
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:35,750
and open the drawers and marvel at these odd things in there, these rubber tubes and

435
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,750
narrow things and short, thick things that had no real use that we could discern.

436
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,950
They had a machine.

437
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,210
That would, if you plugged it in and turned it on, it, it shook.

438
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,390
It just shook violently.

439
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,050
And, uh, we would like, it had straps.

440
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,790
You could put it on your hand and we would rub each other's heads with it.

441
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,210
And my brother would rub, rub each other's heads with it.

442
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,830
And it would kind of hurt, feel kind of weird and give us visions.

443
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,150
I, we never did figure out what my parents used that stuff for.

444
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,710
Any of that.

445
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,210
Well, he's.

446
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,790
At least they weren't celibate.

447
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,510
There were a lot of people in their fifties who were.

448
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,850
Oh, my parents absolutely were completely celibate the whole time.

449
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,550
I'm certain of it.

450
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,290
Oh, they were?

451
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,070
What about the time that you walked in and found the squirrel on your dad's belly?

452
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,350
Well, they weren't, they were both asleep, so it didn't, you know.

453
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:31,690
Oh.

454
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,250
Yeah, no, they told us about the birds and the bees, but they weren't birds or bees.

455
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,270
They were Mammy and Pappy.

456
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,790
Squirrels and yogurt jack.

457
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,470
Mammy and Pappy.

458
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:44,950
Yeah.

459
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,030
The stork brought my brother and me.

460
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,950
I think my sister happened after some disease made my mom's belly real huge.

461
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,130
And then my sister appeared.

462
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,410
But that was a long, long time ago.

463
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,030
By the way, Dave, I told you my sister had the COVID and survived it.

464
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,210
In a Texas prison.

465
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,030
Where she's serving two and a half to five years for a good deed.

466
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,790
Yeah.

467
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,690
In Texas, no good deed goes unpunished.

468
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,050
No.

469
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,490
Yeah.

470
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,730
But it could be worse.

471
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,490
It could be Louisiana.

472
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,170
What do they do in Louisiana?

473
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,150
Do they take you out in the swamp somewhere or something?

474
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,870
They give you life for stealing a blender.

475
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,110
Did somebody get life recently for stealing a blender?

476
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,810
No, somebody got life about a lifetime ago for that.

477
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,430
I read that they just freed a guy after 40 years.

478
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,470
From prison.

479
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,930
He'd been in prison because he sold $30 worth of pot.

480
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,850
Yeah.

481
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:58,150
And he probably committed another crime that involved pigmentation.

482
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,870
Yeah.

483
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,730
Crimes of pigmentation are big nowadays.

484
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,870
Well, they always have been.

485
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,610
They've been that way for a long time.

486
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,370
400 some years.

487
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,450
It's back in the news again for a while.

488
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,330
Wow.

489
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,150
Oh.

490
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:16,850
Yeah.

491
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,810
It's awful.

492
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:24,670
I have friends in Portland where if you were watching the news, you'd think, oh, my God,

493
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,750
every street.

494
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,810
Portland is exploded.

495
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,570
Yeah.

496
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,210
Oh, every single street is just full of screaming, yelling, black-clad monsters throwing bombs

497
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,930
and setting everything on fire.

498
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:45,270
And cops, noble, noble, unmarked federal policemen, nobly spraying gas into the faces of those cops.

499
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,270


500
00:22:45,290 --> 00:23:03,470
Is as notices implemented shouldn't be on 1% of 69, un Cooper County Homeland Security Administishing Services at any cost.

501
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,430
So angry, that it's an annoyance.

502
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,490
Hi, who is this?

503
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,490


504
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,630
T春.

505
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,850
Well, the president is close.

506
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:06,850


507
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:06,850


508
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,170


509
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,910
To be found?

510
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:10,910


511
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,670
This yeah,

512
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,110
recently saw or heard one of the... Don't make those libtards cry.

513
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,450
What's his name? Giuliani.

514
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,890
Called the people in Black Lives Matter and

515
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,470
Antifa called them killers. That sounds like a

516
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,450
lawsuit to me. You can't just accuse somebody on the air of being a killer if they're not.

517
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,690
Well, the problem with Antifa is that there's nobody to sue

518
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,590
him because there's not actually an Antifa PO Boxer. Oh, yes,

519
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,070
there is. Oh, I saw an ad today on Facebook. Join Antifa.

520
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,370
I actually guess. Big Facebook ad going around. Join Antifa.

521
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,590
200 bucks a day to invade the suburbs and throw bricks through windows.

522
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,310
Of course, it was totally fake, but every Republican

523
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,330
in the United States has read it this morning and only about

524
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,430
10 of them instantly recognized it as an

525
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,510
obvious damn satire or

526
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,910
deliberate fake.

527
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,750
Made by Russians or Chinese or rednecks.

528
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,990
Or Iranians, too.

529
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,950
I shouldn't say rednecks either because there's liberal and progressive.

530
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,190
There's even smart rednecks that aren't liberal

531
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,610
or conservative. They're smart. Rednecks

532
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,610
with necks that are red because they work outdoors a lot

533
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,290
their whole lives. It does make your neck red unless you're

534
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,310
kind of red already.

535
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,350
Yes.

536
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:38,610
Yes.

537
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,570
Where the dog comes from.

538
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,430
All those signs, too.

539
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,410
Right. And the dog whistles.

540
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,330
Oh, I was trained like a dog growing up in the 50s.

541
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,570
So I hear the dog whistles.

542
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,310
I know what the dog whistles mean when they use those polite

543
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,530
ways of saying all them people is subhuman.

544
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,290
Let the South shall rise again.

545
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,770
I know what all I can translate the whistles into those sentences.

546
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,990
I don't know what they call them, but I'm not sure I got it right.

547
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:10,990


548
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:10,990


549
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,250
It's a good thing you can because those are standard earmuffs nowadays.

550
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:21,090
It takes a lot of Peloponnesian pleasure to make it work right.

551
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,830
Well, everybody's got some kind of earmuff on.

552
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,130
What kind of pleasure?

553
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,730
To not hear what they don't want to hear.

554
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,170
What kind of pleasure?

555
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,150
Peloponnesian? What kind of pleasure?

556
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,850
Peloponnesia.

557
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:38,050
You know, Peloponnesian's in ancient Greece mixed with Polynesian.

558
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,630
Oh, okay.

559
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,570
He equals Peloponnesian.

560
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:39,570


561
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:39,570


562
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:39,570


563
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,610
polypenesian meaning many many people you know i mean got it yeah yeah polyphemus

564
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:56,550
yeah one-eyed ninny yeah what i did here i just heard a burping sound in the background could

565
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:02,810
that be the industrial police force i heard i felt it i didn't hear it i felt a kind of a buzz run

566
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:09,630
through my fingers well my mine was fell all the way down to the bottom of my scrotum so there mr

567
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:15,490
stang dave black helicopters are probably listening to this broadcast even though it's not being

568
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:21,290
broadcast now seriously it's just being recorded on this little olympus recorder here well it's

569
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,950
going through the phone you know they can hear it right right they don't know you can hear them

570
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,710
listening the black helicopters will come for you first dave because you're easier to find

571
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:43,170
yeah i guess that's right actually i don't know i don't know how to find i guess but uh but i have

572
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:48,970
more escape routes it would take him at least five minutes to catch up with me you know if the black

573
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:55,270
helicopters showed up and there were guys kind of you know rappelling down into our yard we would

574
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:00,930
shoot out that door i'm not going to say which door and out that gate to say which gate on the air

575
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,730
and down

576
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:10,670
that trail i think you know which trail it is and we'd be down on the ranch road in about 10 seconds

577
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,510
and they wouldn't they wouldn't know where we went except for their their heat vision goggles and

578
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:24,410
their hound dogs so it's taking at least five minutes to actually catch us and shoot us yeah but

579
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:30,170
we'd give them a little bit of a run for their money i hear voices there are voices in my head

580
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,650
yeah that's what

581
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,170
is that whatador dr rolls

582
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,730
i don't know

583
00:27:46,490 --> 00:28:00,770
yeah i'd let you decorate it sometimes they charge you

584
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,290
i get scared also

585
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:02,290


586
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:02,790
yeah but but you can still be cushioned whether it be skydiving or somewhere else

587
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:02,790


588
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:02,790


589
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:02,790


590
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:02,790


591
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:02,790


592
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:02,790


593
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,590
all right

594
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,710
You get to pick which of the three throw pillows you can have in your cage.

595
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,230
And they give you snacks.

596
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,030
We have snacks here at Trump Stop.

597
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,530
We're off work for like eight hours a day.

598
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,490
Sometimes you can sleep.

599
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,250
Sometimes if you try all day, eight hours of trying to sleep.

600
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,250
And then you put a cigar in your nose and everybody expects it to go away.

601
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,210
Like, that's what they did to me, too.

602
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,630
They stuck a cigar up my nose.

603
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,450
It still pinched a little bit.

604
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,350
They're pinchy people.

605
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,830
Frog fighters, you know.

606
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,230
Deluxo grabs.

607
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,970
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,110
That's just what I was thinking, too.

609
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,550
Yeah.

610
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:55,990
Deluxo grabs.

611
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,150
You and your blasted Hanami grip.

612
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,910
It's full of cripes.

613
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,230
Our Harmony grips are pretty good.

614
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:05,950
Yeah.

615
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,470
I like Harmony grips.

616
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:08,750
They're in tune.

617
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,150
They're gritty, but they're in tune, you know.

618
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,670
Yeah, they have to be.

619
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,410
If you want to make them creamy, you have to add too much cheese and cream.

620
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,130
Dave, my Victory Garden is going great.

621
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:28,470
You know, I started a garden this year because we were going to be in prison in the same place.

622
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,230
This is the first time.

623
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,230


624
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,630
This is the first time in years that we've been in prison in the same place.

625
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,510
I thought, well, I'll start a little Victory Garden to celebrate.

626
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,210
And I got carried away.

627
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:47,110
And now we have one okra and 100 million hot peppers.

628
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,070
And 200 million cucumbers.

629
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,050
Well, yeah, the cucumbers are good.

630
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,890
But I said that I'd never.

631
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,770
I'd never really monkeyed with.

632
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,490
Tabasco peppers, per se.

633
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,590
I ended up growing some.

634
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,330
They grew well.

635
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,770
Big old bush of them in 100 degree weather.

636
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,070
They're good for making sauce out of, too.

637
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:16,090
Well, but I have several mystery peppers.

638
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,570
And I cut one of each.

639
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,750
And I was going to go through and try them.

640
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,770
And I started with the smallest one, which was the Tabasco.

641
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:28,470
And I was really pretty shocked.

642
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,930
I couldn't do much of anything for about an hour after that.

643
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:45,030
I guess when they make Tabasco sauce, it's 99% vinegar and 1% actual molecule from the Tabasco pepper.

644
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:56,150
Because I've had, like, literally a nibble the size of an 8mm film sprocket hole.

645
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,290
Okay?

646
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,430
Okay.

647
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:57,590
Okay.

648
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,290
Okay.

649
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:58,870
Okay.

650
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,210
Okay.

651
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


652
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


653
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


654
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


655
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


656
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


657
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


658
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


659
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


660
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


661
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


662
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


663
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


664
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


665
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


666
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


667
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


668
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


669
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


670
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


671
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


672
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


673
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


674
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


675
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


676
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,210


677
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,010
Okay.

678
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,030
Okay.

679
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,190
Okay.

680
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,230
Okay.

681
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:15,650
Okay.

682
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,970
Okay.

683
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


684
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


685
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,090


686
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:19,270
Okay.

687
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:19,610
Okay.

688
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,090
Okay.

689
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:20,510
Okay.

690
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,470
Okay.

691
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,730
Okay.

692
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,350
Okay.

693
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:35,550
No, no, no. I mean you can't. It's a hundred degrees and it hasn't, by the way I'm not

694
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:40,970
exaggerating, it's a hundred degrees. It has been for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't

695
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:50,650
rained for six weeks at least. So the grass is glass. It just, it's brittle. It shatters.

696
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:55,150
I don't have to mow. All I have to do is walk on it and it's flat.

697
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,590
It's been rather droughty up here too.

698
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:06,750
Well, you guys still get moisture out of the sky sometimes. We haven't had that in a long,

699
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:16,170
long time. Long, long, long time. I was reading a post from a Norwegian friend of ours and

700
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:24,270
he was real sad because the blue, the blue mussels.

701
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:24,910
Yeah.

702
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,770
Of Norway where it might as well be extinct.

703
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,970
Oh, what a great band that was.

704
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,510
And they couldn't catch even cod. He said it used to be when you, when you didn't have

705
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,770
anything for dinner, you just walked down to the harbor and throw in a hook and catch some cod.

706
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,390
Well, now you couldn't even catch cod. And I was going, oh, boo hoo hoo. They're so sad

707
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:49,030
because they can't eat their favorite seafood. We don't even have water, much less a harbor.

708
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,370
Good God.

709
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,950
So there's a drought in Norway too?

710
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:53,970
Yeah.

711
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,170
Norway is droughted too?

712
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:07,450
No, it's not that. It's that the, the global coronavirus, you know, the cool warming thing

713
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:16,890
that they love so much has extinctified the fish or drove them north where they can barely

714
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:22,010
cling to life. Of course, pretty soon the polar bears are going to be coming south and

715
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,770
eat all of them. Then the polar bears will starve to death.

716
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,150
And that's if they have to go further south.

717
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,670
Or start their own extinct function. Yeah.

718
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,670
Everything's pretty, eventually everything will eat everything else up out of desperation.

719
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,230
And there won't be anybody there left except for you, me and Bob Dobbs and we.

720
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,030
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

721
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,430
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

722
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,450
I told you there was a snake living in fear.

723
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,790
That's what it is to be a snake.

724
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,070
Sounds like, like Peter Sellers in it. Yeah.

725
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:59,250
Discarnate voices. Colombian discarnate voices.

726
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,070
Dave shouldn't be able to hear that.

727
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,150
That's the Danish National Orchestra doing the soundtrack of Blade Runner and they threw

728
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,810
in some soundtrack clips.

729
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:21,830
I play, at the beginning of the show, I think, what we had on was a band called Thrust playing

730
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:37,070
saucers, I think. I'm not, I'm confused. Maybe it was, I just don't know. I don't

731
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:43,390
know if I'm real or a skin job or, I mean, skin jobs are people too. I mean, you can't

732
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,850
say a skin job isn't real. They're real as hell.

733
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,810
Yeah, foreskins can be very painful and luxurious too and such.

734
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:51,810


735
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:57,270
Well, you could say they're not human, although they look human, you could say they're not

736
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,050
human, but you people wouldn't believe.

737
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,230
You could say they're as human as a hume door.

738
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,550
Quiet.

739
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,730
Attacked ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.

740
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,370
Oh, wow. Is that the new Hungarian orchestra?

741
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:17,930
I watched sea beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.

742
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,410
Did you guys see that?

743
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,810
Old Hungarian orchestra.

744
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,970
Old people taught us well.

745
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,170
I know J.R. Bob Dobbs for who he was.

746
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,890
I know the subgeniuses for what they were.

747
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,030
Well, they didn't know what he was and he didn't know what he was either. So it makes

748
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,610
all the difference the same.

749
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:45,410
Hey, speaking of quotes from Little Big Man, Onan pointed out that Dustin Hoffman turned

750
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:51,770
83 this week. They could re-film Little Big Man and he wouldn't need makeup. They could

751
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,770
do the old man scenes and he wouldn't need the makeup.

752
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,630
Yeah.

753
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:03,710
My name is Jack Crabb. I'm the sole living survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn,

754
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,090
commonly known as Custer's Last Stained.

755
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,270
Last Stained.

756
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,510
Wonderful that he lived so long that he could actually do that.

757
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:20,090
It's wonderful that I can do that. It was wonderful that he could do that when he was only 30 or so.

758
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,510
Yeah.

759
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,590
Thanks to the great makeup artist Dick Smith.

760
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,830
Aha, a Smith.

761
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,530
Dick Smith before he dicks you.

762
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,890
Right, Dick Sniffer they call him sometimes. Sorry.

763
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,430
That's not...

764
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,250
I thought that was funny.

765
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:48,910
There really was a great makeup artist named Dick Smith. And the reason I know about him is because he wrote this wonderful publication called The Monster Makeup Handbook.

766
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:49,890
And it was for kids.

767
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,630
And I got it when I was 12 years old.

768
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,110
I remember that.

769
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:07,750
And Dick Smith used his son as a model for a lot of the makeups because it was makeup for kids. And his son was named Douglas Smith, age 12.

770
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,750
Wow.

771
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,670
Well, I was Douglas Smith, age 12 then. But that was long before I was Ivan Stang, age 7,100.

772
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,170
And so that made me pretty excited.

773
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:26,710
But don't you think Dick Sniffer is a funny name? I mean...

774
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,610
Well, yeah.

775
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,570
There are funnier names, but...

776
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,010
There are funnier names. I had a buddy in high school named Richard Titley.

777
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,290
Oh, no, it was Robert Titley. Bob Titley was his name. But his dad's name was Dick Titley.

778
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,090
Goodness. Poor guy.

779
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:47,390
Bob Titley is a well-respected figure in country western music management now.

780
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,910
I knew girls...

781
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,510
He won't speak to me.

782
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,310
His name was Fonda Dix.

783
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:55,830
Like a lot of my old high school buddies who made it good, they are not my Facebook friends.

784
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:03,910
And I've heard third hand that when somebody mentioned, didn't you know Doug... Ivan Stang back when he was Doug Smith?

785
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,530
The less said about that, the better.

786
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:07,790
Hmm.

787
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,530
It's sad, isn't it?

788
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,170
It is.

789
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,970
Yeah. What do you think about that I knew a girl whose name was Fonda Dix?

790
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,310
No way.

791
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,710
Oh, yeah.

792
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,850
D-I-X, right?

793
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,490
Yeah.

794
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,890
Yeah.

795
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,790
Yeah, that's a common last name. And Fonda, like Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Fonda Peter.

796
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,290
But that's a last name.

797
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:35,710
But, like Peter Fonda probably had to say the same thing in reverse. Fonda Peter. Say your last name first, then your name. Fonda Peter.

798
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,930
Yeah.

799
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,190
We asked your name, not your proclivities.

800
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,330
Yes.

801
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,110
Oh.

802
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:47,810
We don't all have... For the faint of, we don't all have the same proclivities, it would be a hell of a rush to the steam wagon, you know what I mean?

803
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,490
Mm.

804
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:54,010
We'd all be hand over, hand over hand, trying to get in those old festival gates.

805
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,910
That'd probably be really fun.

806
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,310
No face, no festival gates this year, except for Sturgis.

807
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:00,790
Right.

808
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,070
Which is also a dirty name to many people.

809
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:10,470
Oh, you know what else is also open for festivals? It's Renaissance Fair.

810
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:11,650
Oh, they're having it?

811
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:18,470
The Renaissance Fair in Texas cared more about money than the safety of, than having another Renaissance Fair with quite as many people.

812
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,330
Mm-mm-mm.

813
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:31,730
I'll have to check that out. They have Renaissance Fairs around here in August too, so I'll have to check that out. But I think it's very, very selfish of them because somebody might get converse.

814
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:44,930
Can't they do it on Zoom? I understand, it's not the same. It's not the same at all. And it is mostly outdoors, which is fine. But then the shops, you know, when you go into the shops, there are these tiny little tents.

815
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,330
Yeah.

816
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,130
Like Starwood, you know?

817
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,610
Yeah.

818
00:39:47,610 --> 00:40:04,610
You walk into a little tent and everybody's hacking and coughing. They're so glad to get their mask off for a minute. And they're hacking and coughing into each other's eyes. And then they go home and give Grandma a big kiss on her head. Wait a minute, I do that every day.

819
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,130
Yeah, but you're not in little tents with people hacking and coughing, dear.

820
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:15,750
No, I've only, the worst I've been in is the supermarket in the tiny little town. And there's no, it's not crowded.

821
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,590
And you keep your distance from the people.

822
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:17,590


823
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:25,130
I've been keeping my distance from people my whole life. See, none of this is new for me.

824
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,590
You've got to be careful.

825
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:31,470
I've been wearing a mask my whole life. The mask of normality.

826
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,470
The mask of Norway and the codfish. The deadly hot codfish.

827
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:47,310
I forgot to tell you about the nice little old lady the other day when I was walking into the grocery store. She smiled and kind of laughed and looked at me and said, it's just like Halloween.

828
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,050
It's Halloween, isn't it?

829
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,110
Oh, because everybody had masks on.

830
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:51,730
Yeah, yeah.

831
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,490
I'm going to try a big smile on.

832
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,670
She just said, I'm trick or treating and robbing a bank.

833
00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:01,830
Were you wearing one of your Dobbs head bandanas where the lower half of your face was Bob's lower half?

834
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,810
Yes, yes I was.

835
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,970
Yeah, those are, then it is like Halloween.

836
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,830
You could rob banks with those Dobb masks. And you should too, probably.

837
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,530
Well, that's true.

838
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,310
At least.

839
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:24,290
I would confuse the video replay and facial recognition thing and Bob would get it. They'd go after Bob.

840
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:38,850
In many lights, people with masks on look like cartoon faces. And you look at them and like a beautiful woman's face suddenly becomes an ogre face. And you want to laugh out loud, but you can't because you want to be quiet.

841
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,090
It works the opposite way for some people, Dave.

842
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,110
Some of us have observed that.

843
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:58,050
Now that the ladies are wearing masks, maybe they put more work into their eye makeup or something. I don't know what it is, but for some reason, they all look beautiful.

844
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:12,530
All the women's magazines are telling women to do that. They're all saying, look, you've got to cover half your face, so work that stuff.

845
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,710
Remember, ladies.

846
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:13,970
What?

847
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,570
You don't have your teeth anymore.

848
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,430
Right. So work the eyes. Yes.

849
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:38,090
They can't tell that you lost most of your nose to cocaine use. They don't know that you really look like the Phantom of the Opera from the bridge of the nose down. So work it. Do your hair. Do their eyes.

850
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:45,290
I've noticed that every gentleman's quarterly man has a three-day stir, four-day stir.

851
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


852
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


853
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


854
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


855
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


856
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


857
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


858
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


859
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


860
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


861
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:45,290


862
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,390
Four-day stubble? It's like a half beard. What's up with that?

863
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,910
Well, it's like you're a little light assed. I seem to remember that being a big fad in the 80s.

864
00:42:53,910 --> 00:43:02,830
Well, yes. The first that was the Miami device that they made because Miami Vice guys had the half grown beards and that's where it got popular.

865
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,690
That's what started it.

866
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:10,390
But then it fell out of favor and then recently again it has fallen back into favor.

867
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,290
Over the last year, I would say.

868
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,670
What do you mean? Like right now I'm accidentally fashionable?

869
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:20,370
No. No. That's only if it's evenly all over your face and it's black.

870
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,470
And there has to be a big chunk of it on your throat too, on your neck.

871
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,370
I don't know that the wide stubble really does anything for anyone.

872
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:29,930
It's softer.

873
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,530
Oh, your beard is so soft. I love it.

874
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:42,470
It makes you look like Kill Bill or some other redneck.

875
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,650
I'm sorry.

876
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,410
I didn't mean to take my shoes off.

877
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,270
Yeah, put your shoes back on.

878
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,650
Boy, oh boy, are my feet smelly right now.

879
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,810
Boy, you'd never be able to tell that Dave was in an iron lung right now, would you?

880
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:56,830
No. No, you can never tell.

881
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,750
He sounds like the same old Dave. In fact, he sounds better than he did the last time we did a show.

882
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,030
This is a great connection we've got right now.

883
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,410
Yeah.

884
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,430
This phone is great.

885
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:12,010
Especially the gurgling sound and the mad professor in the background screaming, this is mine. This is mine.

886
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:12,850
It's alive.

887
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,470
There's no buzz.

888
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,350
There's no buzz?

889
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:26,250
Well, Dave's buzz phone was his home line, that ancient hard-line phone.

890
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:26,750
Ah.

891
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,590
It's gone now.

892
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,410
Oh.

893
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,810
He only has the magic little, you know, pay-as-you-go phone.

894
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:41,250
The cello phone, as Bill Cates calls it. The cello phone.

895
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,010
Uh-oh.

896
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,650
The guy who goes, hop, hop, hop, is sounding on the phone.

897
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:44,950
He's off now.

898
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,210
Bleepo, I mean.

899
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,010
The tracker phone.

900
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,790
The tracker phone.

901
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,110
Yeah, that's the way the conspiracy can track Dave. He has a track phone.

902
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,350
Oh, I see.

903
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,590
You know, I have to recharge the dog's trackers every day.

904
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:58,250
I know.

905
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:58,970
Do you really?

906
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,450
Which is Monday, see? We can't take him today.

907
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,330
Yeah.

908
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,490
Because this is the Lord's Day. There's nothing open except beer.

909
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,050
The Lord's Day.

910
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,850
Except places where you can buy beer.

911
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:14,630
Honestly, you think about it. In this town, on Sunday, only places where you can get beer are open.

912
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,870
What else is open?

913
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,650
The dollar store. Dollar store, you can get beer. Tractor supply, you can't get beer there.

914
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,670
So that's the only store that's open on Sundays.

915
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,430
I don't think you can get beer at the dollar store.

916
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,730
Hell yeah, you can. Dollar General? Hell yeah.

917
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:30,970
Oh, yeah.

918
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,490
Not good beer. It's all American, you know.

919
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,710
I didn't know you can get beer there.

920
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:35,410
Of course.

921
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:36,170
Yes, you can.

922
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,250
Conspiracy beer. Yeah, dollar store, yes.

923
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:38,430
I had no idea.

924
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,290
That's because you're not an alcoholic, dear.

925
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:41,690
Oh, okay.

926
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,450
Or not a very good alcoholic.

927
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,050
Okay, gotcha.

928
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:45,530
I should say.

929
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,730
But no, you go in there, they've got all that Coors and Miller crap.

930
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,030
I didn't know.

931
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,090
They don't have anything I would drink.

932
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,010
I didn't know.

933
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,990
I'm a snob. I'm a hipster snob, man.

934
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,230
Spell backwards, that's Bonds.

935
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,350
Yeah, Rignacisnaca.

936
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,710
Bonds. My dad had to say everything backwards.

937
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,710
Hey, Dave, you remember the Fireside Theater? They inspired us to become what we are today, right?

938
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,550
Yeah.

939
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:22,570
David Osman of the Fireside Theater is still alive and kicking, and he's on Facebook, and he's cooped up in the woods, sort of like I am.

940
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:39,030
And he's been posting memorabilia like crazy, all kinds of old photos and old jobs, radio jobs he did, and times when he met his heroes, who were people I'd never even heard of, mostly.

941
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,530
And that's all I can say.

942
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:41,530


943
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:55,130
It's kind of fun to watch a guy 20 years ahead of you that you copied and imitated and was your hero, and now he's just your Facebook buddy going, hey, look at this old picture I found.

944
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,290
Well, that kind of makes sense.

945
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,990
I met him once, and he seemed to be that kind of guy that would do that.

946
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:05,150
He'd live a reclusive life and sell things on I-Bean.

947
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,910
David Osman was actually the first celebrity—to me, he was a celebrity.

948
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:11,530
Yeah.

949
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:31,510
First celebrity I ever met, and he was so nice that I vowed that I would, if I ever became a slight bit of a celebrity, like he is, that I would try to be nice to fans and not be haughty or any of that kind of—you know, I'd be encouraging.

950
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,130
And I've really tried hard.

951
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:41,530
And about a week ago, I wrote him a fan letter saying, thank you for being here.

952
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:48,150
And he was being so nice to me 40 years ago because I've been nice to my fans ever since then as much as I could.

953
00:47:48,910 --> 00:48:01,350
If they weren't, you know, insane, obnoxious, crazy, you know, boring, talk-too-much ninnies on speed without offering me any.

954
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:08,650
Al Pacino walked up the steps of the Guggenheim, and he kept on pointing at me going, you, you.

955
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,190
Every step he would take, you.

956
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,350
And it was like he knew me, and he was waiting to come and embrace me or something.

957
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,170
He got right in my face, and he went, nah.

958
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,010
He thought you were another Italian that he recognized.

959
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,910
I suppose that was it, but I was like, why is he doing that?

960
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:32,650
And by the time he got right up to me, I was kind of chuckling but a little nervous about meeting Al Pacino, and I didn't.

961
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,590
He's, nah.

962
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,550
He said David Carradine.

963
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,990
No, he said Al Pacino.

964
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,170
Oh.

965
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,290
He's another Italian-y kind of guy.

966
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,330
My brain is glitching.

967
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,950
David, I had a weird surprise.

968
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:57,690
Princess Wee and I did one of those DNA tests finally, and we got the results back, and there was a bit of a shock in there.

969
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:03,070
It turns out I have like 13% Italian in me.

970
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:03,790
Everything else is British.

971
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,750
If he was Tanguy.

972
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,410
If he was Tanguy.

973
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,790
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:12,690
And I went, I'm not sure where, how, what.

975
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:24,450
I talked to my cousin who does genealogy and has really been following the Stang side of the family, and she said that would come from the Swiss.

976
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:29,870
We had some Swiss and a major Swiss ancestor.

977
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,330
Switzerland is right north of Italy.

978
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:34,870
Mm-hmm.

979
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,050
So that's where there's a little bit of the old pizza brush.

980
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,830
He's divided up into a French sector, an Italian sector, and a German sector.

981
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,170
They have Oing and Romance.

982
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:50,250
So there's four distinct languages, and one is like an Italian dialect, and the other one is actually Italian.

983
00:49:51,790 --> 00:50:04,750
Well, one of them Italians sneaked in and nailed one of those English or British or Irish or Scot gals, or something happened.

984
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,270
The old Italian double cross.

985
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:25,450
Of course, you know, if you're, everybody from the British Isles is basically part Scandinavian and part German and part French and part Roman because they were invented by all of those.

986
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:25,750
Just because.

987
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:33,930
You know, and there was a certain amount of rapey, rapey stuff going on, and probably some, oh, handsome centurion.

988
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:34,730
Yeah.

989
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:42,110
Well, well, I bet the old witch woman won't mind if I impregnate myself with something new here.

990
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,270
Impregnate yourself?

991
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,310
A man can't impregnate.

992
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:59,650
I like to think that it was somewhere in my British Isles background, one of my Yeti woman ancestresses, you know, that Roman guy had been away from Rome for a long time.

993
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,450
My sister did the ancestry thing.

994
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:12,710
The English part of my, of ours also had Roman in it, or what would be considered nowadays Italian.

995
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,410
Well, now there's a difference.

996
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,930
Roman is not the same as every other kind of Italian.

997
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,790
Well, they survived the Saxon plunder.

998
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,690
The Saxons actually tried to wipe them out, but they couldn't.

999
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,070
They just.

1000
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:27,870
Damn.

1001
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,710
Do asconced.

1002
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,410
Remember St. Patrick was, huh?

1003
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,370
When, when.

1004
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:49,990
When I, I was in Rome when I was very young, like 19, and on a bus, and this priest sat down next to me and softly put his hand on my leg, and he said, you know, young man, you look Roman.

1005
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:50,990
I went, what?

1006
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,110
I don't think so.

1007
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,550
As far as I know, I'm mostly just, I don't know.

1008
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,970
I don't know if, I don't think I've got any Italian.

1009
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,350
He goes, no, not Italian, Roman.

1010
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,050
He goes, you've got a Roman nose.

1011
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,730
Classic Roman nose.

1012
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,510
You look at our coins and stuff, you'll see what I mean.

1013
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:07,370
I was like, what?

1014
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:13,710
And then he moved his hand a little further up me, and I went, that's very interesting, Father.

1015
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,030
Oh, this is where we get off.

1016
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,390
You guys went and had dinner then.

1017
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,390
Could hardly wait to get back to the hotel room.

1018
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,210
I know.

1019
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,890
That happened to me too, twice.

1020
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:32,030
No, all I ever learned was that I had a Roman nose, which I don't really get or know.

1021
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:39,190
I've had people tell me they thought I must be part Chinese too, including Chinese have said that.

1022
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:46,930
But maybe it's just that wherever you go, they want to make you feel good, so they go, you know, you look like you're part human like us.

1023
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:57,710
I don't look as ugly as regular Americans because your nose isn't quite as huge, and your eyes aren't as retarded looking or stupid looking or something looking.

1024
00:52:58,290 --> 00:52:59,190
I've been hip to that.

1025
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,770
You must be part Chinese.

1026
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,150
You must be part African.

1027
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,810
You must be wherever you are, you know.

1028
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,670
Yep, that happened to me also.

1029
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:13,490
And my grandfather was actually from Rome, so his claim to fame as being Roman was kind of true.

1030
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,050
He's from Roma Saini.

1031
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,410
But my grandmother was from the south.

1032
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:19,710
Uh-oh.

1033
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,970
Way down yonder.

1034
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,110
Yeah, the hairy ones.

1035
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,670
Napoli.

1036
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,410
The ones with big naples.

1037
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:27,610
Napoli.

1038
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,350
Yeah, big, big Napolis.

1039
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:36,830
Which I always thought was part of France or Indian subcontinent, Napolis.

1040
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:41,410
But I guess it's more a fruit flavor you can get once in a while.

1041
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,270
Well, you'll have that.

1042
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,390
Well, heck.

1043
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,570
Well, heck.

1044
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,370
I wonder how much Neanderthal you have, Dave.

1045
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,770
Oh, many, many, many tons of it.

1046
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,970
My brother got a fancier DNA test than me.

1047
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:07,670
And it said that he had more Neanderthal than 70% of the people who'd taken that test.

1048
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,810
I don't know if that's what I'm saying that much.

1049
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,410
But in theory, my brother and me would be almost identical.

1050
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:16,890
They can actually check for Neanderthal bees?

1051
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:17,670
Oh, heck yeah.

1052
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:23,330
The one that we and I took was the cheap one, and they don't tell you much about it.

1053
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,950
Ancestry.com, that one?

1054
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,010
Which one did we use?

1055
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,850
Ours is 23andMe.

1056
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:34,350
But the one we got for our mom was more expensive.

1057
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:35,310
Yeah.

1058
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:44,790
And she turned out to be mostly pure.

1059
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,410
Trapezoid.

1060
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,130
Pure inbred British type, British Isles.

1061
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:58,790
Which means, you know, part everything.

1062
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:59,170
Everything else.

1063
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,870
Because everybody invaded England.

1064
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,030
It's just like my grandfather used to say.

1065
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,170
He'd say, I'm a Duke's mixture.

1066
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,350
A Duke's mixture.

1067
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:07,870
Mm-hmm.

1068
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,730
Dookie.

1069
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,010
Welsh, Irish, English.

1070
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:14,670
Scott.

1071
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,230
Scott, all those.

1072
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,210
Cornwalls.

1073
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,690
Cornholish.

1074
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:25,170
And you turned out to be one half inbred British Isles.

1075
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:29,490
And one half, what is it, Ashkenazi?

1076
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,550
Ashkenazi Jew.

1077
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:31,430
Yeah.

1078
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,290
That's like being from outer space.

1079
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,710
No, it's like being from Russia.

1080
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:41,930
Well, my father is 100% Austria-Hungarian.

1081
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,490
Right.

1082
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,530
But that originally was from somewhere near Russia.

1083
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,270
Because that's near the Ashkenazic Republic, which they named for it.

1084
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,210
Because they wanted to have their own Israel place.

1085
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:56,650
Oh.

1086
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,310
The Russians did, anyway.

1087
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,130
Hmm.

1088
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:05,610
Well, I guess we have to read up on that and figure out which planet you're from, Princess

1089
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:06,030
Wade.

1090
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,650
I guess so.

1091
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,230
If at all.

1092
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,290
If you are-

1093
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,230
If you're from any planet-

1094
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,670
Any planet.

1095
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,510
And not some gas giant in deep outer space.

1096
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,450
A gas cloud.

1097
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,590
Larger than 20 solar systems.

1098
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:26,410
Well, that's about it.

1099
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,550
The cranes are made of gas.

1100
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,410
Yeah, that is about it, actually, Dave.

1101
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,550
We've been talking almost a full hour.

1102
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,550
Okay, well, I'm going to go lay down now.

1103
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,110
I thought you were laying down the whole time.

1104
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,370
I thought you were laying down this whole time, Dave.

1105
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,730
I was laying down for much of it, but then that got too uncomfortable.

1106
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,010
I have to stand on my feet for a while.

1107
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:50,310
Well, I'm glad you can still stand on your feet for a while.

1108
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,730
Me too.

1109
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,250
You wouldn't have to walk with a walker, so.

1110
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,850
Well, we have walkers around here.

1111
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:01,590
You have to shoot them in the head or bust their brains in.

1112
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,330
That's about the only way to deal with walkers.

1113
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,550
Yeah, redeem them.

1114
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:08,010
Yeah, Wee Ma Ma has a walker.

1115
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,070
She calls him Fred.

1116
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,070
We don't know what his name is.

1117
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,890
She rides around on him.

1118
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:20,210
He doesn't have any arms and his jaw's been removed, you know, so he's helpless.

1119
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,710
He's-

1120
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,570
He's a useful ride for the old gal.

1121
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:24,990
She needs help.

1122
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:25,470
Ugh.

1123
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:32,490
Princess, we, nor you, were ever big fans of that Walking Dead show.

1124
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,450
I refused to watch it for a long time.

1125
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,430
I was like, I don't know, zombie, that stuff's a-

1126
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,850
That's actually a beautifully written show, really, really good.

1127
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:44,870
I quit watching it only because I couldn't handle it anymore.

1128
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,270
It got too intense for me around season seven

1129
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,710
when they introduced the evil Hector.

1130
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:55,590
The evil human who was a thousand times worse than all the living dead put together.

1131
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,030
And I just couldn't handle it.

1132
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,270
Tugging at your compassion strings too hard?

1133
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:00,750
Oh, no.

1134
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:01,890
It just grossed me out.

1135
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:02,630
It was too horrible.

1136
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:03,830
Gross.

1137
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:04,650
My hero-

1138
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:08,350
All my friends that had survived so long were having-

1139
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,190
Were being tortured.

1140
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,270
It was so vivid.

1141
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,350
It was just, ugh.

1142
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:15,270
I had to switch to something light, like Game of Thrones.

1143
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,990
It was so much less violent.

1144
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:20,690
It had more nape-

1145
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:21,430
It had police in it.

1146
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,790
It still had walkers.

1147
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:27,730
White walkers.

1148
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,510
It was kind of a Nazi Walking Dead thing.

1149
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,170
Night stalkers, night walkers, huh?

1150
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,070
White walkers.

1151
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,730
Because they came from the far, far north and they were kind of frozen looking.

1152
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,050
And they controlled an army of the dead.

1153
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,850
It was a show, you know.

1154
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,870
Okay, well, Dave, our necks hurt, so we have to go now.

1155
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:50,950
Okay.

1156
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:54,610
But at least your fans got to hear a good show for a change.

1157
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,970
Yeah.

1158
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:03,270
Because your fans have had to listen to Zoom recordings and reruns and me reading and all

1159
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,250
kinds of stupid crap.

1160
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,850
Horrid, Dave-less shows.

1161
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:06,890
Yeah, Dave-less shows.

1162
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,610
Anyway, we're going to go now.

1163
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:09,390
Okay.

1164
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:10,370
Going to the show.

1165
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,430
Okay, well, enjoy your laying down, Dave.

1166
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1167
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:17,850
He always hangs up real fast.

1168
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,990
Yeah, he hangs, he, yeah.

1169
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:20,670
It's like a little, you know, like a little, you know, like a little, you know, like a little,

1170
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:20,670


1171
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,870
like he wants to get out of here, man.

1172
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:34,910
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack at number 1792, maybe 91 or both, and everything's

1173
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,710
okay at subgenius.com.

1174
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:44,530
You can learn everything at subgenius.com, including stuff about Dave's book Neighbor

1175
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,870
World and other Dave-related things.

1176
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,570
The end.
