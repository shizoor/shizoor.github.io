1
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:28,200
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,900
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,060
The subgenius hour of SWAT!

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,860
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

5
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,040
Right, Bob?

6
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,780
Bob?

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,800
Bob?

8
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,440
I want...

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,200
What?

10
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,320
If God were to come to Earth, would they find him so strange?

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,360
That they would be afraid? And would they shoot him?

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,860
Did not his son come once, Pedro?

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,360
And they kneeled him to a cross.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,360
And then spent two thousand years learning to believe in him.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,060
All things take time, Pedro.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,560
We will certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
This is Jason.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,340
All right, now how did he get back on here?

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,820
Magic.

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,680
Turn him off right now.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,460
See?

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,040
It's just...

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,240
There's another setup here.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Is he the kid that says he's Jeremy?

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,780
See? It's just a demonic setup.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,820
Tamara, I can't read those cards there on top. I don't know what the last word is. I don't know who's to what.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,700
Let's stop here and pray again here, okay? We got kids calling in, lying.

28
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,320
We have him breaking in in the air, over the air.

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,500
And I will not argue with a kid that heavily involved in demonic activity.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,660
I will not, I will not, in the name of Jesus, turn this show into a Marilyn Manson Satan praise show.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,940
I ain't into that.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,400
And I have no idea how that happened.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,600
Lord, we just really ask you tonight, Lord, we just want this show to be so in your will.

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,680
And Lord, you know, I'll wrestle with Marilyn Manson.

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll wrestle with Marilyn Manson fans all night, in the name of Jesus, for you.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
Go toe-to-toe all night long.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,920
But Lord, you know, this show was never designed to praise Marilyn Manson.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,180
And all of those hostile, demonic kids who...

39
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,580
That's right, dear friends. This show was made to praise...

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,860
Lord, I just pray that you would...

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,660
Ah!

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,660
Oh, she...

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,380
The one that just called in was at the same phone number and she was setting me up like she was a Christian and all that.

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,100
Well, who the hell is this guy?

45
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,780
Back at this point?

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:00,780


47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:00,840
Now, this is about having a program where I can have the whole season of derpy- 송

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
This crap's getting baconActivated.

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,200


50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,200


51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,660
Hey, you want actionắc

52
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,080
Back!

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,780
Won't you come So you think I need to go to bed?

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,620
Well, I think I just need to lie down over here for some time at night to calm myself down...

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,720
and so you may have gotten a cheap laugh tonight

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,060
but there'll be many tears in hell

57
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,580
unless you repent

58
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,560
unless there is no hell buddy

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
unless there is no hell

60
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,200
well

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,080
what's next

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,960
oh the show that's right we have to do our own show

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,720

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,640

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,340
oh friends have I got some wonderful tapes

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,480
of crazy

67
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,220
lunatic street preacher

68
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,400
Christians going toe to toe

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,140
against Jesus himself

70
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
amazing but true

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,540
hey you better start bird

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:00,860
domination

73
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,460
this isn't going out of the

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,720
air no we are

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,240
wink wink

76
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,720
right there so are we real damn funny

77
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,860
yeah we are

78
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,360
we are

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,920
I mean what I'm saying right now

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
because this is stupid

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,460
I mean this isn't

82
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,380
I mean I had to prepare

83
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,680
something that's going out over the air

84
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,340
and we just want to start doing this

85
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,540
do the funny stuff right

86
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,360
this sentence right here

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,120
okay here we go

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,840
funny music

89
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,660
okay

90
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,240
I mean that last sentence wasn't funny

91
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,860
but do you think this sentence is funny

92
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,440
the next sentence

93
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,300
if I thought it was going over the air

94
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,760
wait for the funny music

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,520
okay

96
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,640
okay now

97
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,760
I mean if I thought it was going over the air

98
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,880
I would have said something funnier

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
than that last part we were saying earlier

100
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,300
but you could say something funny right now

101
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,500
but that's not very funny

102
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,640
if you could say something funny

103
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,560
it would be funny

104
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,960
yeah

105
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,300
if it was going out over the air

106
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,200
I mean that's probably just a tape deck

107
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,320
we were just talking to a tape deck

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,580
I mean

109
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,400
because now I'm nervous all of a sudden

110
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,080
I mean

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,180
because it was funny until we found out

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,200
we were going out over the air

113
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,620
we were driving up here it was funny

114
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,000
but now

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,460
going out over the air

116
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,180
it was funny

117
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,820
I don't think what I said

118
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,840
was very funny

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,720
but this is kind of funny

120
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
this one's working on it

121
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
if I could come up with a punchline for this one

122
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,920
I mean going out over the air

123
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,420
is that funny

124
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,140
but then you can see

125
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,380
what he did

126
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,980
you can't imagine

127
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,120
talking shit about your Natürlich

128
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,720
thego

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,540
crappy

130
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,540


131
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,540


132
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,120
I don't care about your shit

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
oh man

134
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,360


135
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,360


136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,360


137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
Yes, dear friends.

138
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,260
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 613.

139
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,280
The I'm stepping on Ivan Stang's neck so he can't do the show show.

140
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,940
Oh, yes.

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,560
We just come back from Austin, Texas, where we had a wonderful revival down there

142
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,200
with Dr. Dinosaur and Reverend Nicky and Reverend Stang and myself

143
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,800
and some other people who will be awful POs when I don't mention their name.

144
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Oh, yeah.

145
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,720
The show itself went pretty well down there,

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,720
but the real highlight had to be the nuts out in the street out front.

147
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,120
You pervert, you big hoo-ha.

148
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,860
You big subgenius whore.

149
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,060
You wicked, wicked man dressed like woman pervert.

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Hoo-ha.

151
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,240
You're lucky you not get raped.

152
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,560
You subgenius whore, you get raped by big Christian man.

153
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
Well, as you can see, I...

154
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,780
Let me make a fire.

155
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,000
As you can see, I relented and took my foot off Reverend Stang's neck so he could talk.

156
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,140
Yeah, we just got back.

157
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,700
It was great.

158
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,300
The fundamentalist idiots actually showed up for once.

159
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,780
They really did.

160
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,900
Yeah, I thought they were fake protesters.

161
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
Because they were just too stupid to be Christians.

162
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,860
I mean, what...

163
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,280
Imagine.

164
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,580
Dr. Legume and I have both had a lot of experience with dumbass Christians.

165
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,400
You know, of course.

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
But I swear to God, I...

167
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,440
Well, partly Paco of Fringeware, our sponsors,

168
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,020
had said that he was going to try to get fake protesters.

169
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,420
And I walked out of the club, and here was this guy in the street.

170
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,860
We'll play the tapes, but he was essentially saying things like,

171
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,400
Avert your eyes.

172
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,400
Don't look upon these girls.

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
They're inappropriately dressed.

174
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,400
They'll corrupt your virtue.

175
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,060
You...

176
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,560
You...

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
Read the Bible.

178
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,940
I thought to myself,

179
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,100
Man, fake protesters never are any good.

180
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,520
You can always tell they're fake.

181
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,960
No Christian is this stupid.

182
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,580
But we were fooled, weren't we?

183
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,700
Yeah, they were that dumb.

184
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,460
They were that dumb.

185
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,940
And, uh...

186
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,440
And luckily, we had, uh...

187
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,300
What...

188
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,600
The scene around the Bob Popular Club,

189
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
and the subgenius revival,

190
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,460
looked a little bit like their idea of hell.

191
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,900
In other words, a real good party

192
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,720
with some gorgeous babes dressed in slinky, lascivious outfits,

193
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,820
and lustful-looking, sleazeball, pimp-like men in cheesy suits

194
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,640
that were also false prophet-type preachers.

195
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,020
Just happened to be true preachers.

196
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,500
But you can imagine, friends, it was a beautiful...

197
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,580
It was way, way more intense than any of the other preachers I've seen.

198
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,340
It was like the, uh...

199
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,520
The Bible preaching to the choir that was going on inside.

200
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,300
It was...

201
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,980
That was...

202
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,940
It was a beautiful, beautiful moment.

203
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,280
Oh, yeah.

204
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,260
I...

205
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,540
I've met lots of Christians before who...

206
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,100
When you meet them, they'll come up and they'll put their hands on you,

207
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
and they'll tell you that you're following a wrong path,

208
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,060
and they want to pray with you, and they want to pray for you,

209
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,520
and they'll put their hands around you,

210
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,100
and they'll come snuggle up and rub their soft breasts,

211
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,560
you know, and they'll come up and rub their soft breasts,

212
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
and they'll come up against your arm,

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
and they'll look up at you with those little puppy dog eyes.

214
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,880
Well, I digress.

215
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,680
But they put their hands on you, and they'll pray with you,

216
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,080
and they'll try to be nice to you.

217
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
Even if you're a total jerk, they'll try to be nice to you.

218
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,240
But these people were the complete opposite of that.

219
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,780
I don't know how they expect to win people over to Jesus

220
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,840
by standing on the corner calling people homosexuals and fornicators.

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,440
Yes!

222
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
I said fornicators if fornication was bad!

223
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,400
They're standing on 6th Street in Austin, Texas.

224
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,180
This is like drunk frat boy party land, okay?

225
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Austin Gamora.

226
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,300
Yeah, and they're trying to get recruits by telling them that fornication is bad.

227
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,720
That's the whole reason everybody's down there is to find somebody to fornicate with

228
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,620
or to get fired up for later fornication.

229
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,580
Praise Bob.

230
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,620
Praise Bob.

231
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,020
I've been fornicating for years and years and years,

232
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,440
and never has it crossed my mind while doing it,

233
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,800
am I doing something bad here?

234
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,060
Well, I've only been fornicating for a few weeks myself,

235
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,900
but I've never had any problem,

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,520
and I just don't understand how these people can expect to bring believers around to Jesus,

237
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,400
who, after all, is the Prince of Peace and the embodiment of love.

238
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,940
By being more hate-filled than subgeniuses?

239
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
I mean, give me...

240
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,340
I...

241
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:52,040
I kind of was abashed and felt a little ashamed before them,

242
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,740
not for the reasons they would have thought.

243
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,460
I thought they were better...

244
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,500
They were more hate-filled than I was.

245
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,920
I was thinking, my hate's been sullied.

246
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,880
It's been half-assed.

247
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,560
It's been corrupted hate.

248
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,160
Theirs is pure and uncorrupted.

249
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,800
Theirs is the hate of the true believer.

250
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Yes.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,740
For the true unbeliever.

252
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,520
We've taken the wrong path, Reverend Stagg.

253
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,900
We've taken the wrong path.

254
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,800
They're right.

255
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,840
If we really want to hate, we've got to get down on our knees and beg Jesus for the power to hate.

256
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,820
Jesus, come on, get down on your knees.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,700
Come on, get down on your knees.

258
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:24,940
Come on, Jesus.

259
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,020
Jesus, I'm getting down on my knees, too.

260
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Jesus, Jesus, in your name, I open up my heart to you.

261
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,360
Open up our hearts.

262
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,500
And I want you to fill me with the kind of hate that I've seen you put into your servants.

263
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,760
And, Jesus, if you'll let me hate like those servants will,

264
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,860
come on.

265
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,740
Come on.

266
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,340
Jesus, I love you so much.

267
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,400
And, Jesus, please bless all the people of the world.

268
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,220
All the people of the world, except for the homosexuals, the fornicators, the Democrats,

269
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:13,460
and the butcher shop store clerk, and people who hurt animals, especially people who hurt animals.

270
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,920
Yes.

271
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,840
Yes.

272
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


273
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


274
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


275
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


276
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


277
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


278
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


279
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


280
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


281
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


282
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


283
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


284
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


285
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:14,840


286
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,620
And Disney.

287
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,220
And Disney, yeah.

288
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,480
And, uh, and, and.

289
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm getting off my knees.

290
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm getting tired.

291
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,540
Yeah, me too.

292
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,220
You know.

293
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,260
I just can't build up that kind of hate.

294
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,480
That's the wrong kind of hate.

295
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,640
It just doesn't feel right.

296
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,300
Yeah, it doesn't.

297
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,520
It's self-righteous hate.

298
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,420
It's not, it's not true Bob-filled hate.

299
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,640
It's not Bob-powered.

300
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,000
It's ego-powered.

301
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,660
It's egocentric, self-centered, silly, limited human hate.

302
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,920
Pathetic, silly, frustrated, impotent hate.

303
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,320
Not the ground.

304
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,640
And glorious military-style hate of the true subgenius brothers and sisters.

305
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,480
We hate them too.

306
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,140
Yes.

307
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,220
I'd sure like to be hating some of you subgenius gals some more.

308
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,060
Huh.

309
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,080
Oh, yeah.

310
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,060
I hate him.

311
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,120
I guess.

312
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,600
All kinds of hate you've been bottling up inside you.

313
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,300
I've got a hate on, baby.

314
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,380
Oh, yeah.

315
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,980
And the time's coming to release that hate.

316
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,520
It mighty spurts upon the very visage of Mother Earth.

317
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,540
And all of her.

318
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,340
Earth first.

319
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,040
Earth first.

320
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,960
The rest of the universe.

321
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,720
Then Mars.

322
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,360
Then Venus.

323
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,200
Mercury.

324
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,700
And finally.

325
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,780
Finally Uranus.

326
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,860
Uranus.

327
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,800
Uranus is mine.

328
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,660
Uranus is mine.

329
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,020
No, it isn't mine.

330
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,840
No, no, no.

331
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,680
Evangelicals shall lay first hand on Uranus.

332
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,700
No, no, it must be a holocaustal.

333
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,640
All right, you holocaustals.

334
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,440
A holocaustal who puts his hands on Uranus first.

335
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,900
All right, all right.

336
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
You holocaustals can have Uranus.

337
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,580
You holocaustals may have Uranus, doctor, like you.

338
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,820
It's all you, then.

339
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:44,840
It's all you, then.

340
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:44,840


341
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:44,840


342
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,380
That's all, then.

343
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,820
Have at it, boys.

344
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,080
It is the great holocaustal dream.

345
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:59,620
The dream that one day you'll be able to join Legume for a nice journey across Uranus.

346
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,800
The great battle of Uranus, where all shall fight and battle over the future of Uranus.

347
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,940
And the winner will be able to pack Uranus with broken glass.

348
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,900
The planet of broken glass will be Uranus.

349
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
Okay, friends.

350
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:21,020
We're at Bob Poplar's nightclub disco type place in Austin, Texas on 6th Street.

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,200
Big, popular, thousands of pinks outside milling about.

352
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,800
Lots of pinks disco dancing downstairs.

353
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,100
We're following-

354
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm gonna offer my soul in exchange for his.

355
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,580
Sir, I have a proposition for you.

356
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,920
Okay, friends.

357
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,100
This is, um, that was the voice of one of Satan's cheerleaders.

358
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:52,140
There are, uh, three of them out there dressed in lovely cheerleaders' uniforms, uh, of a dark red and black color.

359
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,940
And a big 666 across the front.

360
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,280
And they've got sort of goth-looking makeup.

361
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,120
And, you know, they're modern-day looking, uh, but lovely, lovely young ladies.

362
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,340
Um, and so sweet.

363
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,200
You'll hear them, uh, they're all this sweet.

364
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,160
They're the kind of, if you're an old dad type like me, you know, gosh.

365
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,980
You know, she sounds like she'd make you proud.

366
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,080
If she was your daughter.

367
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,760
Well, um, they're out there just being as sweet as they can be.

368
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,460
And you'll hear the, um, there are two main fanatical, uh, Christian street preachers.

369
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,240
The Gomer-pile-well, actually three.

370
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,400
There's, uh, uh, the-a couple of Gomer-pile guys.

371
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,760
And then, uh, an-an Asian woman who you can tell by her voice.

372
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,960
And she is, uh, she gets into it with, uh, Reverend Nikki Deathchick at one point.

373
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,460
And, um, another, uh, sister, Sarah, a subgenius who had come up from Dallas who we didn't even know.

374
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,680
And this is a pretty amazing sequence.

375
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,540
I hope I don't have to edit too many cuss words out.

376
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,200
Uh, praise Bob.

377
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,700
We are taking a soul check tonight.

378
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,480
It is one dollar tonight to sell your soul to Satan's cheerleaders.

379
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,740
And we are so much fun, let me tell you.

380
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,760
I also want to offer you, if you sell your soul...

381
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,540
There's rest in a poker.

382
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,880
...Sell Hellbagnos.

383
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,240
This is worth so much!

384
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,420
And you're getting a pair of Satan's Cheerleaders underwear.

385
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,140
If you join, you get to wear Satan's Cheerleaders underwear and have 10,000 Hellbagnos dollars.

386
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,740
Right here.

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Your underwear is really cool.

388
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,120
It's gonna cost you a dollar.

389
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,520
Cover your eyes!

390
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,920
They're unappropriately grand.

391
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,560
Cover your eyes with our panties, definitely.

392
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,060
Yes!

393
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,220
I-I see a dollar right there, sir!

394
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,280
You can sell your soul.

395
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,960
You can sell your soul.

396
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,540
Right here.

397
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,520
We have a pair of pants.

398
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,780
A pair of pants.

399
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,500
It's a bargain.

400
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,160
Oh, here.

401
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,200
Okay, fill in your name and keep this in your wallet, okay?

402
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,660
Here you go, sir.

403
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,440
These girls might steal your virginity.

404
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,900
Thank you so much!

405
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,600
Be careful!

406
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,500
How many people out here are virgins?

407
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,060
They may take away your virtues.

408
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,400
These women...

409
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,420
Jesus!

410
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,700
They're probably fornicating.

411
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,060
One dollar?

412
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,500
You sold me!

413
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,360
Stay away!

414
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,520
One dollar?

415
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,840
Come on!

416
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,900
Oh, what?

417
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,620
Did you guys pay?

418
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,540
Read the Bible.

419
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh, no!

420
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,720
We paid him the whole thing.

421
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,520
We paid him the whole thing.

422
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,520


423
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,520


424
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,520


425
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,520


426
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,520


427
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,180
This sound is off of my video camera.

428
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,760
People are giving her dollars.

429
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,920
She has a roll of dollars stuck in her bosom.

430
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,240
I was selling a couple of souls in the world, generally.

431
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,500
I didn't really want them, but it's okay.

432
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,260
Do you know the one you serve?

433
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,740
We're gonna burn!

434
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,740
You don't know the one you serve?

435
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,500
I serve bees, and I am selling souls tonight, let me tell you.

436
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,340
You sold yourself to the devil, obviously, and you think you can stay in the world.

437
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,560
They'd have a lot more money if they sold their soul to the devil, honey.

438
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,060
I wouldn't live in an apartment if I sold my soul to the devil.

439
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,400
You are gonna have problems on Judgment Day, because you, all of you, will have to give

440
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,420
an account on the Judgment Day.

441
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,240
You're gonna stand by yourself and stand before the almighty God and give an account

442
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
of what you've done in your life.

443
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,480
And you're gonna have to say, I've sold my soul to the devil.

444
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,480


445
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,040
and all this other stuff and what you're doing.

446
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,840
And I have a diary!

447
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,980
And you can find my diary in one year and you can see.

448
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,400
You can do that now, sir.

449
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,800
You can cheer and you can clap.

450
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,420
But God is not going to cheer.

451
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,480
God is not going to clap.

452
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,720
He is going to cast you into a lake of fire for eternity.

453
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,460
Woo! Right at the beach.

454
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,740
Down in Mexico, maybe.

455
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,260
Here's 10,000 health factors.

456
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,840
God! God!

457
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,460
Well, this is Pope Angus.

458
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,960
Kill me!

459
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,580
You know, when the Christians came to Alaska,

460
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,580
I told the Eskimos about the hellfire.

461
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,600
They were like, where can we go?

462
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,360
It's fucking cold out here!

463
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,340
Woo!

464
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,460
Woo!

465
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,300
Thank you.

466
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,620
Lady, you're wicked.

467
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,180
You're way to hell.

468
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,900
You better fear God.

469
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,260
You know, I want for Jesus Christ himself.

470
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,820
You're a good man.

471
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,880
You're a good, good day.

472
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,060
He's a devil!

473
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,020
He's a devil!

474
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,420
You're a devil!

475
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:14,960
You're a devil!

476
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,800
You're a devil!

477
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,120
You're a devil!

478
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,600
You wicked woman!

479
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,020
You oppress yourself like a whore!

480
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,120
You know what?

481
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,720
When you get raped, it's not going to be that funny.

482
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,520
It's not going to be so funny when you get raped, lady.

483
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,460
Because of the way you dress.

484
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,940
You dress like a whore!

485
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,580
You're a woman.

486
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,220
You're a woman.

487
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,260
I have seen you.

488
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,320
I am like a whore.

489
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,620
Okay, now Reverend Sarah runs up and gets in the creature's face.

490
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,320
I am a whore.

491
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,220
I am a whore.

492
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,600
Oh, definitely a whore.

493
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,580
Oh, definitely a whore.

494
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,920
Oh, men should control themselves.

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,860
If women can dress however they want.

496
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Oh, women should dress modestly.

497
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,520
I am not a whore.

498
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,880
You are a whore.

499
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,560
And now suddenly some Austin cops, two big Austin cops run in and grab Sister Sarah,

500
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,340
shove her.

501
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,880
I guess she touched the creature.

502
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,080
She was talking about controlling themselves.

503
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,300
She was talking about controlling people.

504
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,300


505
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,300


506
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,040
They should have self-control.

507
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,540
And she was the one that did not have self-control.

508
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,720
She was the one that offered her.

509
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,900
And the cops are hauling Reverend Sarah off and really roughly shoving her away.

510
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,520
Away comes the righteousness.

511
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,560
Away comes the righteousness.

512
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,360
They are putting her in the paddy wagon.

513
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,180
This judge, not a best to be judged, is nothing but just a whole bunch of hoo-hahs.

514
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,380
You need to understand.

515
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,700
You need to understand the concept.

516
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,900
The concept is hypocrisy.

517
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,280
The mean whore is hypocrisy.

518
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


519
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


520
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


521
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


522
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


523
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


524
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


525
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,280


526
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,560
Meanwhile the cop, I'm filming the cop pushing his mother away.

527
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,560
Do you see this? I'm being pushed by a cop.

528
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,840
They then haul her off to the paddy wagon again and stick her in there.

529
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,180
Do not judge somebody else.

530
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,300
Don't ask me.

531
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,280
Who did they take away?

532
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,440
I don't know.

533
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,760
She, um, killed herself.

534
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,240
You're not going to leave your kids.

535
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,220
You're being a child molester.

536
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,920
That's making a judgment.

537
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,820
And that's making a righteous judgment.

538
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,540
It's good that you don't want to let your children be the child molester.

539
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,120
People, you need to have some brain.

540
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,960
Use your brain.

541
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,620
Does anybody have any questions?

542
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,800
If I don't masturbate, is it okay if I have a wet dream?

543
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,580
Listen.

544
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,840
God will hold your camel for the love of your heart.

545
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,220
God will hold your camel for the love of your heart.

546
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,620
If you have lust in your heart, you are already committing adultery on the side of God.

547
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,260
Uh-oh.

548
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,820
Oh, well, in that case, if I'm already gay, I'm sure I'm rescuing her.

549
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,440
I don't think she has the means to do anything.

550
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,000
She managed to do something.

551
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,500
She did.

552
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah.

553
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
Well, friends.

554
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,100
Anybody else have any questions?

555
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
Anybody else have any questions?

556
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,220
Yeah, you can hear the paddy wagon backing up to take the dangerous subgenius out.

557
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,420
Yeah.

558
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,420
Anybody else have any questions?

559
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,980
Yeah.

560
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,020
Anybody else have any questions?

561
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,140


562
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,700
Anybody else have any questions?

563
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,120
Oh, I have a question.

564
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


565
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


566
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


567
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


568
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


569
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


570
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


571
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


572
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


573
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


574
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


575
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


576
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,160


577
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


578
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


579
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


580
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


581
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


582
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


583
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


584
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,200


585
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,240
The law being upheld in this place.

586
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,040
They only uphold the law due to the fact of what you just said.

587
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,260
That person needs to be put in jail because that person will be dangerous.

588
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,880
You're not getting drunk.

589
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,760
Good Muslims don't get drunk or fornicate.

590
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,880
No, we do not.

591
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,140
You're submitted to God keeping his commandments.

592
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,500
You're no good Muslim.

593
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,100
Are you married to her?

594
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,020
Yes, I am.

595
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,240
Let me ask you something.

596
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,360
She was indicating a fight.

597
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,300
And what the girl was saying, they bumped.

598
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,320
She bumped her.

599
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,120
But still, but still.

600
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,580
But what is the book about turning over teeth?

601
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,460
It's also about choosing.

602
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,880
Friends, it was an amazing.

603
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,120
It's the kind of thing that the Church of the Subgenius is really good for.

604
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:24,160
It's like when you see the contrast between those people and the lascivious looking,

605
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,940
but obviously fun loving and I don't want to give away too much.

606
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,700
I'm not going to stop here.

607
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,000
They might.

608
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,500
I decided to go in there and let people know that the real action.

609
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,500
Oh, man.

610
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,660
Oh, it was amazing.

611
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,380
Okay, friends.

612
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,020
Well, onto something else.

613
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,700
My thoughts are illegal.

614
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,040
This isn't this song.

615
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,440
Stop me before I compose myself.

616
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,340
Don't make me use this.

617
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,380
I can't turn it off.

618
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,840
Stop me before I compose myself.

619
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,300
I know I can't.

620
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,300


621
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,700
I mean, no one can be both himself and little.

622
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,880
Stop me before I compose myself.

623
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,040
I'm thinking.

624
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,880
I'm thinking as blank as I can.

625
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,680
Or am I just saying that?

626
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,180
Who is it who's saying that?

627
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,300
Can you really tend to forget what's true or was I just thinking that?

628
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,220
Or was I just thinking what?

629
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,540
Why race to a future that's missing a now?

630
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,340
Or did I just answer that?

631
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,620
We're all faster than we can catch up to anyway.

632
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,720
Stop me, stop me, stop me before I compose myself.

633
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
So you can't get a real cure, they cost too much.

634
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,400
Stop me before I compose myself.

635
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,380
They're just gonna train you to build a dumber you.

636
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,600
Stop me before I compose myself.

637
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,580
Are you sure of who you're thanking for letting you live?

638
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,920
Stop me before I compose myself.

639
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,420
Am I allowed to treat myself at all anymore?

640
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,360
Or can the doctors tell me that?

641
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,060
Are they allowed to tell me that?

642
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,520
Am I stupid, stooped to turpitude and torpor?

643
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,180
Or is that just a Prozac?

644
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,100
Make mine on the rocks with a twist.

645
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,440
Is it still prosaic, just with no more eye?

646
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,100
Is that why they call it that?

647
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,540
They can't determine if it's a boil or a jewel.

648
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,140
Stop me, stop me, stop me.

649
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,540
Stop me before I compose myself.

650
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,900
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

651
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,240
Stop me before I compose myself.

652
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,060
Are you ever gonna let me out of Kansas again?

653
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,480
Stop me before I compose myself.

654
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,580
Is your lollipop blood breath or cabala?

655
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,820
Stop me before I compose myself.

656
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,640
Could you whiz me home in that balloon of yours?

657
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,660
Or is that just a bump on your head?

658
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,520
Do you think you should sell me a heart?

659
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,460
Is that the tornado that's talking up there?

660
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,220
Or should I be paying attention?

661
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,260
Whatcha doing behind that curtain?

662
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,540
Is it ritual throwing yellow bricks on your feet?

663
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,380
Can you hear me asking you that?

664
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,640
I don't think I want to be in your magic shoes.

665
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,180
Stop me, stop me, stop me.

666
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,260
Before I compose myself.

667
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,980
Just a little time.

668
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,000
A-ha.

669
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,640
Ludwig Sears, friends.

670
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,760
The music of Ludwig Sears.

671
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,460
From his tape.

672
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,740
Stop me before I...

673
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,940
Well, what is the tape?

674
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,660
The tape is hand labeled.

675
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,640
And it is from our old friend...

676
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,600
In Minneapolis.

677
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,580
Who disappeared for a long time.

678
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,480
Then came back with that.

679
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,540
Amazing.

680
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,780
And earlier in the show...

681
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,680
The business about...

682
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,080
You're gonna have nothing to handle.

683
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,120
Reality sport.

684
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,460
from Ludwig Sears,

685
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,920
End of the Bhagwan Rag.

686
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,940
We heard a little bit of tape.

687
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,560
I think Ugly Shayla sent us of that show,

688
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,780
Let's Talk Jesus.

689
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,620
We heard some Jane or Hypercleans

690
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,780
on the KPFA show in San Francisco

691
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,580
from Phineas Narco's tape, 1997,

692
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,880
the Are We on the Air business.

693
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,440
Of course, Dr. Legume

694
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,220
and the street preachers.

695
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,100
The foulness of the blueness of a wound, friends,

696
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,820
cleanses away the evil.

697
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,020
I don't suppose anybody has a big jug of coffee here, do they?

698
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,460
Have you ever noticed that in places like this,

699
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,380
they only sell drugs

700
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,480
that are central nervous depressants?

701
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,200
You cannot buy a cup of coffee,

702
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,640
and yet you can buy a drug

703
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,420
that if the leaders weren't all addicted to it,

704
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,700
they'd talk about it just like they're talking

705
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:55,800
about the world.

706
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,540
I guess that bad-mouthed alcohol

707
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,400
is kind of a dumb thing to do in a bar.

708
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,040
Well, false slack is better than no slack at all.

709
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
That's for damn sure.

710
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,500
But really, think.

711
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,040
Imagine how absurd it would be

712
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,940
if you lived on some crazy planet

713
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,720
where they made an ordinary plant

714
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,640
like coffee beans, say,

715
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,780
that grows on the ground,

716
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,140
where they'd make that something

717
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,900
if you had even just a bean of coffee,

718
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,040
not even a cup of brewed coffee,

719
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,500
just for having some beans,

720
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,240
they'd throw you in jail for a year or two,

721
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,700
maybe for your whole life.

722
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,980
And yeah, imagine such a world

723
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,520
where heroin,

724
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,620
which makes you want to, like,

725
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,540
drive real fast and get in fights,

726
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,240
was not only legal,

727
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,640
but advertised on billboards, television,

728
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,240
and you could buy it,

729
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,080
not only at every 7-Eleven,

730
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,640
but right here in this room,

731
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,500
and you could buy it for $2.50.

732
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,720
Fuck, fuck!

733
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,040
Fuck!

734
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,180


735
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,940
My face is...

736
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,080
Thank God we don't live in a world like that!

737
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,920
Help!

738
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,100
Help!

739
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,100


740
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,120
Help!

741
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,080
Help!

742
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,300


743
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,160
Help!

744
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


745
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


746
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


747
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


748
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


749
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


750
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


751
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


752
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


753
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,260


754
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,420
Help!

755
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,420


756
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,420


757
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,720
Help!

758
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,900
Help!

759
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,160
Help!

760
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


761
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


762
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


763
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


764
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


765
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


766
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


767
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


768
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,160


769
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,620
You know, you opened yourself up to demonic activity.

770
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,120
You know what I'm saying?

771
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,500
Well, you saw, you thought you saw Satan,

772
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,720
you saw something pretty awful.

773
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,520
Probably was a demon.

774
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,360
.

775
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,360


776
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,120
.

777
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,460
.

778
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,880
It's a beautiful world we live in.

779
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,440
It's a beautiful world we live in.

780
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,840
A sweet romantic place.

781
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,100
Beautiful people everywhere.

782
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,780
The way they comb their hair makes me want to say it's a beautiful world.

783
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,860
Welcome brothers and sisters.

784
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,260
Prozac Free Radio is not on the air tonight.

785
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,380
Tonight we're here to bring you Up With Jesus.

786
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,220
That's right brothers and sisters.

787
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,560
We have taken that sinful show off the air by popular requests.

788
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,540
And we have decided to put on instead a show which serves the Lord Jesus.

789
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,300
Praise the Lord Jesus.

790
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,860
Jesus loves you all.

791
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,240
Jesus loves WMUH.

792
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,820
And Jesus loves me.

793
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,500
Oh yes.

794
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,120
Jesus loves me.

795
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,060
This I know.

796
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,200
Because the Bible tells me this.

797
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,720
Oh so.

798
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,120
Oh brothers and sisters.

799
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,420
Can you feel the Spirit of the Lord coming through your radio?

800
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,960
Flying around your room.

801
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,320
Flying into your brain.

802
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,980
Flying into your ears.

803
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,040
Flying into your heart.

804
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,100
Oh yes brothers and sisters.

805
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,800
Jesus is here tonight.

806
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,540
He's here tonight to share with you his words of love.

807
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:38,860
Um.

808
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,180
This is the Bible.

809
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,720
This thing could be um.

810
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,100
You know it's never going to appeal to everyone.

811
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,520
We don't want it to appeal to everyone.

812
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,520
But we'd like a chance to it to reach the people that it should reach.

813
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,340
Um.

814
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,120
And so you know it's part of our policy of selling out.

815
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,560
And we've come up with these slogans.

816
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,400
And this is what I'll end with.

817
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,100
Just in case you're from any of these companies who've already started the ad campaign.

818
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,280
We'll design your own ad campaign.

819
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,500
We'll design banners for you.

820
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,240
Um.

821
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,680
This one's for Levi Jean.

822
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,560
The subgenius must have slacks.

823
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,300
What?

824
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,700
What's that?

825
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,160
What's that?

826
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


827
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


828
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


829
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


830
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


831
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


832
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


833
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,160


834
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,000
Repent.

835
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,800
Quit your job.

836
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,440
Slack off.

837
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,020
But.

838
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,520
Don't squeeze the Charmin.

839
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,580
No one can sell off quite like us.

840
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:19,840
Alright.

841
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
Trojan condoms.

842
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,120
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

843
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,120
Burger King.

844
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,520
Don't just eat that hamburger.

845
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,880
Eat the hell out of it.

846
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,240
Oh yes.

847
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,920
It's a beautiful world.

848
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,140
Because it's the Lord's world.

849
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,140
God created earth and all of it.

850
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


851
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


852
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


853
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


854
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


855
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


856
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


857
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


858
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


859
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


860
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


861
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,140


862
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,740
And it has all of the beautiful things in it.

863
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,260
Ah yes.

864
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,460
He created baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet's.

865
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,660
Oh yes.

866
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,160
The Lord created everything on this beautiful world.

867
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,640
He created me.

868
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,140
He created you.

869
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,860
He created all of this wonderful broadcasting equipment.

870
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,700
And all of your wonderful receiving equipment.

871
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,780
For one simple purpose.

872
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
To do his mighty work.

873
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,980
For earth's spirit.

874
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,380
He drove us to create great weapons which we once turned against each other.

875
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,820
Now to turn against the alien threat.

876
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,540
Against all other planets.

877
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,340
Except ours.

878
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,420
Until only mother earth we may.

879
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,260
We declare war against the planets.

880
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,180
War against the universe.

881
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,100
War against God.

882
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,980
Earth burn.

883
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,920
Earth burn.

884
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,900
We will destroy all of the planets.

885
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
But earth first.

886
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,980
If we cannot conquer a planet.

887
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,340
We will destroy it.

888
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,960
If Bob cannot have it all.

889
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,200
He will destroy it all.

890
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,840
If Bob cannot have all planets.

891
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,680
No one may have any of it.

892
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,600
All worlds.

893
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,120
No one could have any of it.

894
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,120


895
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,120


896
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,120


897
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,500
All worlds or none.

898
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,920
All worlds or none.

899
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,160
Play spot.

900
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,520
One house, one goal, one soul, one toilet bowl, Bob Dobbs.

901
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,320
Bob Dobbs.

902
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,960
One house, one goal, one soul, one toilet bowl, and you're in control.

903
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,140
Said you're in control.

904
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:47,980
Control.

905
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,740
Said you're in control.

906
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,020
Well ever since I was a young boy I played all eighteen holes.

907
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,300
Well ever since I was a young boy I played all eighteen holes.

908
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,880
From Catahoula down to Dobbs Town, Tadahassee up to Muscle Shoals.

909
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,240
I ain't never seen nothing like it when I was flipping the remote control.

910
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,120
That bleeding head of our Palmer sent fear into my soul.

911
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,780
Well it flies on a volition, don't need no rocket fuel.

912
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,880
It has its own incision from which the red blood spews.

913
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,740
It always gets the playback, I ain't never seen it drop.

914
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,340
That bleeding head of our Palmer is a force that can't be stopped.

915
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:31,680
Ow!

916
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,380
That bleeding head of our Palmer is a force that can't be stopped.

917
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,380


918
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,380


919
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,480
You other golfers think your day in day you better run like scally dogs.

920
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,980
Take your big red strap and down into Mobile and truck it down to Omaha.

921
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,180
You better keep your faces up to the light in the air where it is clean.

922
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,960
The severed head of Palmer will meet us on the green.

923
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,800
With Bob inviting Jesus.

924
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,640
After the war is won.

925
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,560
There won't be nobody left to kill and we can throw away the guns.

926
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,820
Yes dear friends, an amazing piece of music.

927
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,620
And obviously there's another one coming up here.

928
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,880
Which we will bypass.

929
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,360
Okay, here we are.

930
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,660
It's a Cardinal Synapsis.

931
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,920
And the In Control Gang.

932
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,300
Oh yes dear friends.

933
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,320
I don't know anything about them.

934
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,340
But I like their accent.

935
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,320
And I guess they sound like they're from Mobile.

936
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,860
Some place in Bob's country.

937
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,620
It ain't quite the same as God's country.

938
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,520
But friends, you know what we're getting at.

939
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,780
Do we have to spell it out?

940
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,460
You know, those who know don't say.

941
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,320
And those who say don't know nothing.

942
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,540
I've got some more street fighting coming up.

943
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,500
But I wanted to read you a little bit.

944
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,180
Oh, this is Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

945
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,980
I wanted to read to you though this bit of news.

946
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,180
This is something that would qualify for the Darwin Awards.

947
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,180
Pardon me, I think I have Ebola.

948
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,560
Michigan, USA.

949
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:38,160
A guy buys a brand new Grand Cherokee for thirty-some thousand dollars and has four hundred plus dollar monthly payments.

950
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,640
He immediately gets a hold of his friend and they go to do some mail bonding.

951
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,060
They go duck hunting and of course in Michigan all the lakes are frozen.

952
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,480
These two atomic brains go to the lake with the guns, the dog, the beer and of course the new vehicle.

953
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,760
They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready.

954
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,440
Now they want to make some kind of natural landing.

955
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,280
Something for the duck, something for the decoys to float on.

956
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,500
Remember, it's all ice.

957
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,100
And in order to make a hole large enough to look like something a wandering duck wants to fly down and land on,

958
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,200
it's going to take a little more effort than an ice drill.

959
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,960
An ice hole drill.

960
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:21,440
Out of the back of the new Grand Cherokee comes a stick of dynamite and a short forty-second fuse.

961
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,600
Now these two rocket scientists do take into consideration that if they place this stick of dynamite on the ice

962
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:34,120
at a location far from where they're standing, them and the new Grand Cherokee,

963
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,900
they take the risk of slipping on the ice when they run from the burning fuse

964
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,820
and possibly going up in smoke with the resultant blast.

965
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,040
So they decide to light this forty-second fuse and throw the dynamite, which is what they end up doing.

966
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,640
Now remember a couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the vehicle, the beer, the guns and the dog?

967
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,980
Yes, the dog.

968
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,760
A highly trained black Labrador used for retrieving, especially things thrown by the owner.

969
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:11,920
You guessed it, the dog takes off at a high rate of speed on the ice and gets the stick of dynamite with the burning forty-second fuse

970
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,720
about the time it hits the ice, all to the woe of the two idiots yelling, stomping, waving arms and wondering what the hell to do now.

971
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:27,720
The dog, well, it is happy and heads back from where it came from moments before with the stick of dynamite,

972
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:35,080
only to the mounting woes of the two bozos now really waving their arms, yelling even louder and jumping to new and higher heights than ever before.

973
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:43,220
Now one of the guys decides to think, something he's never done before this moment, grabs a shotgun and shoots the dog.

974
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,960
The shotgun is loaded with number eight buckshot, hardly big enough to stop a black Lab in its appointed round.

975
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,500
Dog stops for a moment, slightly confused, and continues on.

976
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,740
Another shot!

977
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,700
Then this time the dog still stops.

978
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,660
The dog, standing, becomes really confused and scared, thinking these two Nobel Prize winners have gone insane,

979
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,540
and takes off to find cover, with the now really short, short fuse burning on the stick of dynamite.

980
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,720
The cover the dog finds?

981
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:18,720
Underneath the brand new Grand Cherokee thirty-some-thousand-dollar, four-hundred-plus monthly payment vehicle sitting on the lake ice.

982
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,300
Boom!

983
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:27,700
The dog dies, and it and the brand new Grand Cherokee thirty-some-thousand-dollar, four-hundred-plus monthly payment vehicle

984
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,980
sinks to the bottom of the lake, leaving the two candidates for co-leaders of the known universe standing there with this

985
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,640
I-can't-believe-this-happened look on their faces.

986
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,760
Later, the owner of the vehicle calls his insurance company, which tells him that sinking a vehicle in a lake by illegal use of explosives is not covered.

987
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,240
He had yet to make the first of those four-hundred-dollar-plus-a-month payments.

988
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,120
And, um, friends, I'm not sure where exactly that came from.

989
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,700
It may just simply be, um, well, Reverend Augustine, Sybil Augustine there, uh, sent it to us.

990
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,520
Praise, praise, rev-sister-ish Sybil.

991
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,280
It could be an urban myth, but friends, who cares?

992
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,220
You can tell your friends, and it'll be just as so true to them.

993
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,820
And, uh, here's some Einstein secret orchestra as we figure out what next.

994
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,600
You don't have the Christ nature. You don't have the human nature.

995
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,460
You're not here. Let's get those phones ringing. Good night, Abel.

996
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,100
Now don't you go until I come, he said, and don't you make any noise.

997
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,500
He said it, he said it, he said it, he said it.

998
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,720
He's talking to the guy, he went up to the third guy, he went up to the Jewish guy, and the Italian guy, he goes in and he's talking to the prostitute.

999
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,040
A devil's puncher.

1000
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,400
That's January Boyd.

1001
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,880
Well, I can't remember the punchline,

1002
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,260
but I've got another one that's funny.

1003
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,980
The years are long, but the little toy Bob stands true.

1004
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,920
I want one of those toy Bob's, too, I think.

1005
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,160
Yes, Church of the Sob Genius, you

1006
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,140
need to quit your job for Bob.

1007
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:18,620
Yes.

1008
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,220
Yes.

1009
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,420
For only $5, find out about the world's fastest growing cult.

1010
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,640
Yeah, I'm slowly gaining control of my life,

1011
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,240
and it's scary because I've never been this close to God

1012
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,720
in my whole life, and I feel his presence everywhere I go now.

1013
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,300
That's cool, man.

1014
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,960
We need as many people to be missionaries back

1015
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,860
into the heavy metal crowd as we can get.

1016
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,940
When you're done looking at the fire,

1017
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:50,500
come on down to Bob Populer for sex, alcohol, and slack.

1018
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,400
If you thought those spots were

1019
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,960
fires were sensationalistic, you'll love the fires of hell.

1020
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,940
The fire that's burning down that building

1021
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,560
is nothing compared to the fires that you will burn in if you do

1022
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,060
not give your money to JR Bob Dobbs.

1023
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,260
Yes, you, too, can learn the path of slack

1024
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,980
and become rich, famous, and good looking.

1025
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,580
Amen.

1026
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,260
I can feel the Lord tonight.

1027
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,720
He's here in my heart.

1028
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,880
We're all part of a great big puzzle, and you and I are part.

1029
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,500
Will you be on the saucers July 5th, 1998, 7 AM,

1030
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,260
or will you die like a pig boy?

1031
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,980
For only $5, you can step right in through these doors

1032
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,460
and see Reverend Ivan Tsang.

1033
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,180
He is here and in person, and he is alive.

1034
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,420
Alive, alive, alive.

1035
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,000
Right behind these doors, right behind this curtain,

1036
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,080
come see the weirdest, the sickest, the most twisted.

1037
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,800
Uh-oh, I ran out of words.

1038
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,900
Sex odyssey.

1039
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,120
Sex odyssey.

1040
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,500
On the earth.

1041
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,280
What the hell?

1042
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,040
What the hell?

1043
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,400
What the hell?

1044
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,060
We are the Jews who are thrown into the lake of Christ.

1045
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,320
That's right.

1046
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,600
And all true devils, by the sense of God,

1047
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,620
would not go into those wicked lakes.

1048
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,400
Wicked, wicked, wicked.

1049
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,400
OK, not the church.

1050
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:41,900
Shut up.

1051
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,740
What?

1052
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,660
Things.

1053
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:49,200
I am the Lord, Jesus Christ, of the church of the soft genius.

1054
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,600
Oh, my goodness.

1055
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,880
Me not deceive all you homosexuals.

1056
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,780
You shall not be.

1057
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,280
Oh, you're a coward.

1058
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,460
My God.

1059
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,400
The only thing you're gonna get is sleeping, wailing, and

1060
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,820
That's what you're gonna get from me.

1061
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,700
We love homosexuals.

1062
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,960
We welcome everyone.

1063
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,780
We just need to keep the ground on.

1064
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,860
I'm not the dad of all you drunkards.

1065
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,220
I'm not all you fornicators.

1066
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,800
What is he upset about, fornicators?

1067
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,220
Wait a minute, what's this about fornicators?

1068
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,260
He has no fire.

1069
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,640
Wait, wait.

1070
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,880
God's back, we love God.

1071
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,580
What's he got a problem with fornicators?

1072
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,920
He's doing that job for us.

1073
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,560
You're decadent.

1074
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,660
You're just crazy.

1075
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,360
We are bad.

1076
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,400
We are decadent.

1077
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,200
We love God.

1078
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:41,820
We love God.

1079
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,040
We love God.

1080
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,140


1081
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:44,640
We love God.

1082
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,620
We love God.

1083
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,620
We love God.

1084
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:47,760
We love God.

1085
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,620
We love God.

1086
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,900
Yeah, you know, sometimes when I get hard on Marilyn Manson, people like that last girl

1087
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,760
that set us up.

1088
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,480
It's not that I'm mad at her.

1089
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,700
She's gonna pay, but it's the demons behind her.

1090
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,880
I mean, I don't see no, no sense in a man that goes on stage and cuts himself.

1091
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,260
That's just...

1092
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,120
Well, we'll get into him.

1093
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
We're doing some pretty heavy research on him now.

1094
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,560
This guy gets hard on Marilyn Manson.

1095
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,560
He's gonna get into him, too.

1096
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,220
No, no, no.

1097
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,200
We don't, you know.

1098
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,480
And of course, the collection.

1099
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,760
Oh, yes.

1100
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,600
Because Jesus is a little light this week.

1101
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,380
And in order to do his great and holy works,

1102
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,600
he needs your cash.

1103
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,880
You know, it cost a token

1104
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,200
to go through that great turnstile into heaven.

1105
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,940
And somewhere up there

1106
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,360
is a little child who cannot afford that token.

1107
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,100
For we're not born with the privileges

1108
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,840
of being an American Christian.

1109
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,520
And we are going to burn in subgenius hell.

1110
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,520
Woo-hoo!

1111
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,180
And Bob has always fornicated.

1112
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,120
And Bob will always fornicate.

1113
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,820
And he will take you to a new heaven.

1114
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,400
And he will take you to a new place.

1115
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:13,900
Yes.

1116
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,960
Yes.

1117
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,040
Yes.

1118
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,500
For only $5,

1119
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,580
you can listen,

1120
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,160
you can come into this place

1121
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,560
and show the Christians

1122
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,360
what they can do with their God.

1123
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:27,860
Yes.

1124
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,040
Tonight, we declare war on God.

1125
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,820
Why worship an alien?

1126
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,920
When you can worship Bob.

1127
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,400
If God is so powerful,

1128
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,940
why does he need guys like that to defend him?

1129
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,880
This and more questions will be answered tonight.

1130
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
I am Jesus Christ.

1131
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,960
I'm not the church.

1132
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,340
I'm not the church.

1133
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:49,780
I'm not the church.

1134
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:49,860
I'm not the church.

1135
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,060
I don't know anybody that says that.

1136
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,840
Jesus Christ is the Bible.

1137
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,160
Your Bible's so old.

1138
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
It's so dusty.

1139
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,780
I could write damnation on the front cover.

1140
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,340
Most of you,

1141
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,000
you've probably not even read the Bible.

1142
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,340
You're so arrogant.

1143
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,420
You make judgments about the Bible

1144
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,200
before you even tell us.

1145
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,180
Before you point out the splinter in my eye,

1146
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,520
take the log out of your own.

1147
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,780
Before you judge us and criticize our religion,

1148
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,160
why not find out something about it?

1149
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,520
I've read the Bible.

1150
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,260
Why don't you read the book of the subgenius?

1151
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,060
Find out about the spaceships of the alien sex goddesses

1152
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,080
and the fornicators and the homosexuals.

1153
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,460
Right here tonight.

1154
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,000
Be not deceived.

1155
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,860
God will not be mocked.

1156
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,780
God will not be mocked.

1157
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,240
God will not be mocked.

1158
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,680
You know you are buried in the soul of the conspiracy

1159
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,220
when you see your own face before you

1160
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,660
and you realize it's a reflection in a mirror

1161
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,340
and that the mirror is on a coffin

1162
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:33,120
and that it's on the inside of the lid of the coffin

1163
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,460
and the lid is down.

1164
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,720
Now you've caught yourself using your own ass,

1165
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:44,940
Mr. Duchess.

1166
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,540
Goodbye, bon voyage.

1167
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,660
Have a nice trip.

1168
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,040
You are such a damn fool.

1169
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,400
You lost your grip.

1170
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,680
What the hell does it take to get you to awaken?

1171
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:10,960
No matter what you say, A equals A equals A equals A equals A.

1172
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,620
Black is black.

1173
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,060
White is white.

1174
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,220
Day is day.

1175
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,520
Night is night.

1176
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,620
Nature is what it is.

1177
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,120
Regardless of what you would like.

1178
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,260
Man of sicker nonsense.

1179
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,480
Go take a hike.

1180
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,900
Have a nice trip.

1181
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,040
This builds a battler.

1182
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,200
You're a robot.

1183
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,560
I am a little להיות

1184
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,900
Mm-hmm.

1185
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:40,720
Adíváњa ho.

1186
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,120
You know I love theitarz?

1187
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,200
That's a fair quote.

1188
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:42,220
area

1189
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:42,700
You want to see theatarz?

1190
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,220
Uh, yes, friends, when you hear that feedback coming on,

1191
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,980
you know that old Reverend Stang is confused,

1192
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,400
but trying real hard to get the mic up to give credits.

1193
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,380
You're listening to Zeus Rift from his promo pack special tape

1194
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,940
although this is also on CDs.

1195
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,680
I'm going to give you Zeus Rift's address.

1196
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,300
Write for a catalog from Zeus Rift.

1197
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,080
I'm sure a self-dressed stamped envelope would help a whole lot.

1198
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,080
And that address is King of the Pacific,

1199
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:31,640
Post Office Box 18765.

1200
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:38,580
That's Post Office Box 18765 Encino, California.

1201
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,520
Encino, California.

1202
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:49,740
California, 91416-8765.

1203
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:58,700
That's a zip code of Zeus Rift, 91416-8765.

1204
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,600
And, you know, when you get confused about things like that,

1205
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,760
you can always write to us.

1206
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,880
You can ask me, stang at subgenius.com,

1207
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,760
or,

1208
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,320
you can possibly write Jesus,

1209
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:19,180
but you'll probably just get the robot at slack at subgenius.com.

1210
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,520
And, friends,

1211
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,180
you see,

1212
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,500
you can get all of the information about everything

1213
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,940
from old Bob.

1214
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:30,900
By mail.

1215
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,760
Here's where to write.

1216
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,520
Got that pencil ready?

1217
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,680
That's Bob at Box 147.

1218
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,920
4-0-3-0-6.

1219
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,020
That's 1-4-0-3-0-6.

1220
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:54,340
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1221
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,420
Should we be at that old box for nine,

1222
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,320
I don't know, time,

1223
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,220
double eight, 19 years?

1224
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,460
19 years.

1225
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,500
I know J.R. Bob Knox for what he was.

1226
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:11,500


1227
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:11,500


1228
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,540
I know him for what he was.

1229
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:15,960
I know him for what I was.

1230
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,380
He has given you one hand?

1231
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,540
His emaculation, his divine emaculation happened when he was a young man.

1232
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:23,920
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

1233
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:29,700
And it was, I think, personally, as far as I can tell,

1234
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,920
it seemed to have been about 1940.

1235
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:37,100
And Bob's contract with Earth was, wasn't he responsible for the puffer fish?

1236
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,480
He was, well, I think the puffer fish is what he was responsible for.

1237
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:41,480


1238
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,040
That's where it started.

1239
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,180
When the aliens abducted him, he, I hate to put it this crudely,

1240
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,520
but he more or less got them high on puffer fish.

1241
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,640
Not that people should do that.

1242
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,540
This was Bob we're talking about and a bunch of aliens.

1243
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,520
Bob was a, was a who-who?

1244
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,800
I wouldn't want any, any, any humans to try to do that.

1245
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,300
By the way.

1246
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,100
Very few subgeniuses and no humans at all can deal with a puffer fish.

1247
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,380
But the main point of X-Day is that the aliens liked the puffer fish,

1248
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,960
so much, they said, what do you have that's even better?

1249
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,740
And Bob said, well, human soul.

1250
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:23,680
And that's what he's trading to the X-S in 190 days,

1251
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,280
or however many it is now.

1252
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,640
The countdown has begun.

1253
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,120
Oh, my gosh, I was so dry.

1254
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,680
190-something days to X-Day, July 5th, 1990.

1255
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:37,740
Have y'all heard about the other end of the world saucer cult here in Dallas?

1256
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,460
No.

1257
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,800
Yeah, we know, I actually have.

1258
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,020
I heard that there's like a couple of other saucer cults in Dallas,

1259
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,060
and they're calling it saucer cult capital of the world, Dallas, Texas.

1260
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:53,800
And this nice, pleasant-looking Chinese fellow with a pyramid hat says that on March 18th,

1261
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:04,560
no, on March 25th of 1998, God will appear on Channel 18 all over the contiguous United States.

1262
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,220
Oh, go to the roots of the lie, Dave.

1263
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,140
No matter whether you have a Channel 18 or not, turn to Channel 18.

1264
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,700
It's not that serious, by the way.

1265
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,700
18, 18, 18, and I like it.

1266
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,540
God will appear and will announce, as this man has already announced,

1267
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,720
that God will come to Earth in Dallas, Texas at 10 a.m.

1268
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,560
In a parrot diaper.

1269
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,140
March 31st.

1270
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,600
God will appear.

1271
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,360
And if he doesn't, this preacher, this Chinese preacher, will kill himself.

1272
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:37,220
Then he's saying the appearance of God will take time at the appearance of the sign of the Ramseys.

1273
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,080
And I'm surprised.

1274
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,120
I'm surprised.

1275
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,600
I'm surprised this hasn't made national news.

1276
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,780
I first heard of it on the Internet.

1277
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,820
And then the local news people pounced on it.

1278
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,880
Oh, great.

1279
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
Another saucer call.

1280
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,700
Lots of bodies right here in Dallas.

1281
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,500
Man, we'll be in the news again.

1282
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,240
Well, you'll be able to manipulate it once again.

1283
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,060
At least if you want to think of it that way.

1284
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,640
It's kind of a demonic ploy.

1285
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,800
I kind of feel like we've been upstaged one more time.

1286
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,660
I think that it's fine.

1287
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,240
I think it's fine.

1288
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,560
Yeah, you know, Dallasites have never gotten over that one big landing in 1963.

1289
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,320
I was there.

1290
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,720
I was only 11 years old.

1291
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,040
But man, that was the high point of my life.

1292
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,920
Watching that tiny flying saucer land inside the skull of the president inside his face.

1293
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,440
They said, take me to your leader.

1294
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,740
And went straight to it, to the core of the president himself.

1295
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,360
That was a, you know, what a colossal screw.

1296
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:42,140
Being microneon neutron people, they travel at nearly the speed of sound.

1297
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,660
To them, it's a slow pace.

1298
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,360
They slammed into our leader.

1299
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,120
And then they exhume his brain.

1300
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,240
They steal his brain for all this conspiracy stuff.

1301
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:51,900
And where's his brain?

1302
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,620
That's where the brain went.

1303
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,360
Stuck in the damn brain trying, hey, let us out of here.

1304
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,700
And they're still giving commands to that brain.

1305
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,360
And it's decomposed.

1306
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,700
And where the hell are they?

1307
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,100
Yeah.

1308
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,600
I mean, you know the answers to that question.

1309
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,340
Well, I think that the Onassis thing is a little bit more complicated.

1310
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:05,340


1311
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,640
I think the Onassis family could probably tell you more about those aliens than any other group on Earth.

1312
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,220
Oh, I guess the fridge is full of them.

1313
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:13,000
The fridge is full over there of the little tiny glimmer.

1314
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,240
Actually, Princess We should probably be able to tell us a bit.

1315
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,320
She's the queen of all the UFOs.

1316
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,120
But she has so many subjects that I know it's hard for her to keep track of.

1317
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,440
Well, she's wearing pantyhose right now, so I don't know.

1318
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,380
Red ones, Christmas red ones.

1319
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,040
Princess We, are you all Christmassy looking?

1320
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,380
Well, I guess I really don't know.

1321
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,340
She doesn't even know that she's hovering.

1322
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,180
Talk about the mistletoe.

1323
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,380
She's wearing a whole damn mistletoe over her head.

1324
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,660
And it's ready to take off, buddy.

1325
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,500
Oh, man.

1326
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,880
She's wearing one of them psychic ICBMs that's headed right for Dallas right now.

1327
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,960
And she's also wearing them long, long sticky fishnet stockings.

1328
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,700
The ones with the one of them pump heels and stuff like that.

1329
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,480
And I guess, what do you call that little Santa Claus number thing?

1330
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,900
What is that?

1331
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,220
Well, it's...

1332
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:01,660
Popcote.

1333
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,260
The space goddess saved.

1334
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,320
I'm telling you.

1335
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:05,960
It's fluffy.

1336
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,260
Boys, if you haven't signed up for your Church of the Subgenius membership, you don't know what you're missing.

1337
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,040
Really?

1338
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,540
Because when Santa comes, I mean, he really comes.

1339
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,200
Or she comes.

1340
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,720
You know what I mean?

1341
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,680
He holds his big red sack up down your chimney.

1342
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,880
You better be ready.
