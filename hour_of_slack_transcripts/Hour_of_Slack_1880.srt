1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,300
Hey!

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,980
The Self Genius Power of Squash!

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,160
Oh no!

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,800
Good?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,600
Oh, the poor dying.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,500
You make me sick.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,780
All of you.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,120
What are you trying to do?

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,940
I like the frax calls.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
Oh no.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,220
Anyone else want his head bashed in?

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,180
Oh no!

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,120
From PR News in Washington, I'm Schist.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,460
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with French leaders in Paris today where she spread avian influenza.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,900
We believe firmly that the world should be caught by a very dangerous avian flu.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,740
Schist.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,260
European Union experts held a dead turkey.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,620
Social Schist.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,280
Social Schist.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,200
Social Schist.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,820
Social Schist.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:11,640
PR's banned.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,160
PR's bad.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,880
PR's bad.

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,900
On Wall Street, 110-247-926.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,880
You're listening to PR News.

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,120
Today, the Federal Reserve was the largest in more than 23 years.

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,740
U.S. consumer prices jumped by soaring slightly.

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,860
There are few people.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
People are living in the streets as a massive security presence deploys ahead

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,960
of tomorrow's PR News in Washington.

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,460
We have two completely different things for you tonight, friends.

33
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:51,920
One is mostly me talking in a recent interview on a video podcast called My Family Thinks I'm Crazy.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,600
It was a lot of fun.

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,980
It's just the first half hour of a very recent two-hour interview show.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,220
but mostly talking about the old days.

37
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,100
The other thing has none of me talking,

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,960
but it has Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Rusty Rebar,

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,920
Bubba Free M. Ho Pep, Michael Pepe,

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,320
the late Peter Goldie, Dr. Philodrummon,

41
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,460
and the good Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh,

42
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,520
also known as Ed Holmes, and callers.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,920
And that half hour is from an Ask Dr. Howell show on Radio Valencia,

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,160
I think from around 2013 or before,

45
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,340
because it was the pre-recorded first half of the Puzzling Evidence show of October 2013,

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,780
of which I played the last half just with Philo last week.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,340
Is that clear?

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,020
So even though it's old, it's not about the old days like the newer show with me is.

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,500
So anyway, thanks to Time Conductor,

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,260
Controlled Techniques, it's all new to Hour of Slack,

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,040
and I didn't have to spend too much time editing.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm busy with other archival projects.

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,500
In fact, I got a gizmo called The Wolverine

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,360
that copies one's old 8mm and Super 8 films to digital at two frames a second,

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:24,560
and I can finally see all those unlabeled reels of film from 1965 to 1970.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Or 81.

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,160
It includes the one shot that Sandy Boone would have killed for for her documentary.

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,160
But more on that once us morons are done yapping, yakking, and yattering.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,620
See, what's the error?

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,480
Because in those days, the conspiracy wasn't in the church.

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,220
And that's what I'm talking about tonight.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,400
The conspiracy in the church.

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:05,820
Yeah!

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,580
Oh!

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,280
Oh!

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,500
I've been caught up in the conspiracy.

67
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,120
With the conspiracy.

68
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,000
And I'm not an artist.

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm a preacher.

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,700
I don't make my living at this.

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,280
I have to make my living doing other things.

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,820
See, horrible thing for them.

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,560
Oh!

74
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,040
Oh!

75
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,240
Oh!

76
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,460
Oh!

77
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,360
The church is filling up with pink balls.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,120
Woo!

79
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:27,920
Yeah!

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:27,920


81
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,900
Yeah!

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,220
Woo!

83
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,240
Woo!

84
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,260
Woo!

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,340
Woo!

86
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,800
Yeah!

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:29,800


88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:29,800


89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
You can't play stuff genius!

90
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,120
They're the ones who go, oh, Reverend Stein, I think Bucky's real funny, and doctors

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,580
for Bob are real funny, but Reverend Stein, he talked about all that serious stuff, and

92
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,480
it didn't make me depressed.

93
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,040
And I say, little Bobby, you shouldn't be depressed, because you're going to burn in hell!

94
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,460
Yeah!

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes!

96
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,500
Wow!

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,100
We true apostles of God are in that mother ship waving to those poor people...

98
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,300
Yeah.

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,080
get started i don't know if if you've been on a podcast before but you're certainly a veteran

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:08,740
in the broadcasting game you have over 19 000 radio episodes according to you you also told me

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,760
that you're going to mix it up so who knows if that's the truth or not but welcome to illuminati

102
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,520
confirm where everything you say can and will be used for humorous and satirical purposes by the

103
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:29,680
court of we three unruly degenerates i'm your host mystic mark tuning in our audience of

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:38,460

00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,880
it's a vape oh he's he's he's smoking we'll be we'll definitely be smoking on this episode

108
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,120
because i think we're in for an interesting conversation you've been in the realms of

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:14,080
alternative culture for much longer than i've been alive juan juan and i have been studying as

110
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,380
much as we can about the church of the subgenius but we are i was hoping you didn't know you said

111
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,500
you didn't know anything about it

112
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,360
and didn't need to know the jargon we're trying we don't want to get blindsided but you know i'd

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,320
love to learn a little bit about more more about who you are sir and where this all started for you

114
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:43,440
can you take us back to maybe what first woke you up to the fact that our world our society our

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,300
reality is consistently lying to us is something that we like to talk about on the show often you

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,500
know the reality reality is that we're kind of moving in the wrong direction and the reality is

117
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


118
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,420
is stranger than fiction, and I think the Church of the Subgenius exemplifies that.

119
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,780
But when did this weirdness really start for you, sir?

120
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,920
Well, it's hard to say, because the last thing I remember, I was trying weed for the first time in seventh grade.

121
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,440
And I just sort of woke up here.

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
So I was hoping you guys could explain it to me.

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Where are you in time?

124
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,220
Well, actually, some of it has come back to me.

125
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:36,960
Around 1975, I was struggling to support a family with my job of doing offensive animated underground cartoons that didn't make any money.

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:47,020
And this Yellow Pages salesman showed up, Philo Drummond, and trying to sell me a Yellow Page ad.

127
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,800
And I said, well, I can't.

128
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,060
I can't buy an ad because I'm not.

129
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,540
I don't.

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
My business doesn't make any money.

131
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:03,240
And he said, well, well, if you like working for nothing, maybe I have a job for you.

132
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,700
And but then he said, but but first, do you want to get high?

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,480
And I was real surprised because I didn't look at that time.

134
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,480
I didn't look like somebody that would smoke pot.

135
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,700
I was real, real.

136
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,420
I kind of looked like Elvis Costello, if you remember.

137
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:28,340
So now now I now when people offer me pot, I can say, do I look like somebody who'd smoke pot?

138
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,500
That's that's kid stuff for me.

140
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,760
I we subgeniuses smoke.

141
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I have a prop.

142
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,600
So if you lost.

143
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
Wait, wait, wait.

144
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,140
Can we can we go into the words, though?

145
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,500
Sometimes you keep using these.

146
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,300
Have her have her for up.

147
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,240
If you love to.

148
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,320
But we just say frock for short.

149
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,000
But it's a Tibetan word on a lot of this stuff.

150
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,540
It's Tibetan.

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,520
OK, that's what's in the pipe, right?

152
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,320
I don't know why.

153
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,720
I'm not sure why.

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:02,220
But but nonetheless, at one point there there was some stuff going on in Tibet.

155
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,180
This is shortly after Philo.

156
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,040
Got me high and this is right at my house.

157
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,700
Luckily, the kids were gone.

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:19,380
The next thing I knew I was in a cave somewhere and I was being pounded and abused from behind.

159
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,220
And I was just being sodomized savagely.

160
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,980
And I couldn't really turn around to see, but I could just hear this horrible low chuckling that scared me.

161
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,480
And there was this monster with a huge swollen head in front of me kind of holding me down.

162
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,760
And he was also laughing.

163
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,160
But you're about to laugh.

164
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,340
I'm then then I kind of passed out again.

165
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,680
And when I woke up there, there was.

166
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,580
The creature with the giant head.

167
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,340
Like the head was there.

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,400
He was there, but the head deflated and slowly and it was Philo.

169
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,840
And he said, say, now that you're here in Tibet.

170
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,840
I'm like, what?

171
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Yes, I'd like you to meet Bob.

172
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,580
My friend, J.R.

173
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Bob Dobbs.

174
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,020
Me.

175
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,980
I mean, I.

176
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,040
Hail Bob.

177
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,660
I turned around and there was there was Bob standing there and he stood there.

178
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:18,660


179
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:18,660


180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:18,660


181
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,760
He stuck his hand out and said, hey, would you like a job?

182
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
And I was going, no, I need a painkiller for my butt.

183
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,940
And he goes, I hear you like to work for nothing.

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,800
How much do you pay me for a job?

185
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,260
And I just went for some reason, this guy just I would do anything I wanted to give him money.

186
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,780
And so I did.

187
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,120
I gave him all the money I had on me, which was only about thirty five cents.

188
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,080
But he was real impressed by that.

189
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,580
He said, you're hired.

190
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,520
And.

191
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,460
And the next thing I knew, I was back in Dallas again in my little hovel.

192
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,120
And Philo told me, started telling me about Bob's teachings.

193
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,440
It turns out this guy was a salesman like Philo, but he was like the saint of sales.

194
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,500
He was the greatest.

195
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:14,060
He had supernatural sales power and he could sell, for instance, religion to an atheist.

196
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,620
Which.

197
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,100
Uh.

198
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:15,700
Uh.

199
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,440
I guess I wasn't then.

200
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,340
I believed in almost everything.

201
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,460
I was really gullible, but I believed in Bob more than anything.

202
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:37,860
And Philo basically said, Bob wants us to start a little publishing company and sell pornography and drugs and and and his teachings as a religion.

203
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,520
I was like, I don't know anything about religion.

204
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,100
He goes, Oh, sure you do.

205
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,040
Let's get, you know, all we need.

206
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,420
We just we need an enemy.

207
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,320
That's the conspiracy.

208
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,760
We need a special name to make us be different from everybody else.

209
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,820
That's subgenius.

210
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,460
Because, you know, if you were a genius, staying, you'd be rich by now.

211
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,880
But you're just a subgenius.

212
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,920
Well, that explains it.

213
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:10,380
And he a long story short, he ended up getting me to do all the work and put together these little pamphlets.

214
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,860
I got some right here.

215
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,920
Pamphlet.

216
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,260
Pamphlet number one.

217
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,780
This thing was published in January.

218
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,300
Nineteen.

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,780
Eighty.

220
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,360
So it's really easy to date.

221
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,580
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

222
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,820
You won't die if you join the Church of the subgenius.

223
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,700
At that time, it was only ten bucks and we didn't know what we were going to send people for ten bucks.

224
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,140
So we studied the Masons.

225
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,580
We said the direct mail ads of all the cults that were very.

226
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,360
But successful, the Masons, the Scientologists and a lot of obscure ones.

227
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,740
And we had a bunch of weird ads like the Church of Beaver Cleaver and stuff like that.

228
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:58,380
I didn't even know who the discordians were, except that I had read Illuminatus by Bob Wilson and Bob Shea.

229
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,040
And that mentioned the discordian had a bunch of funny stuff in this discordian religion.

230
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,080
But I thought it was something Shea and Wilson had made up.

231
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:15,040
It turned out it had been it had been made up by a completely different bunch of weird.

232
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,200
I mean, it was Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley.

233
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,320
I'm going to I'm going to pause for a second.

234
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,760
This is our next book.

235
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:31,780
It's it's Kerry Thornley's autobiography of how he got sucked into the JFK assassination.

236
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh, wow.

237
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
What does that come out?

238
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,560
Yeah, he ended up being a sort of a friend of ours.

239
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,720
He's been dead for a long time now.

240
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,640
When's that book coming out, sir?

241
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,680
As soon as I finish the foreword.

242
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,020
I think.

243
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,700
OK.

244
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,520
My friend, O'Neill, really assembled it.

245
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,820
I didn't I didn't really know that much about Thornley, except that he was crazy and paranoid.

246
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,800
But now his book is quite clearly written and he doesn't.

247
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,140
His main concern is that he sounds crazy and paranoid.

248
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,660
He was really worried about becoming crazy and paranoid.

249
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
And he really did.

250
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,500
He actually did become crazy and truly paranoid, which is kind of sad.

251
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,180
But but he did.

252
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,560
He did.

253
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,460
He did write that.

254
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,800
But anyway, the next thing I knew, we did this little pamphlets.

255
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,740
We were just going to leave them in laundromats, you know, like chick comics or Jehovah's Witness watchtower magazines.

256
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,140
That was kind of what we were aspiring to.

257
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,020
We were going we hope to someday do.

258
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,000
Pamphlets as richly illustrated as the Jehovah's Witnesses.

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,280
And we had all we had was clip.

260
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,320
Art that came from the yellow pages.

261
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,220
Yellow page clip art.

262
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,540
Remember, Philo was a yellow page salesman.

263
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,600
That's where we found the picture of Bob.

264
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,100
He Bob had been posing for ads and magazines and TV for decades already.

265
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,220
Just to sort of plant hints of this presence.

266
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,660
And we had found all these pictures of him in old magazines.

267
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:14,160
You know, he'd be selling Dobbs hats or pipes or he'd always be in a hand.

268
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,820
And his wife or somebody would be mowing the lawn or he'd be fishing.

269
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,740
He obviously had slack in all these ads.

270
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,560
That was the other element of the religion.

271
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,120
What do you have to offer the believers?

272
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,500
And that was slack.

273
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:35,080
The conspiracy, which is all people who are not subgeniuses are are trying to rob away your slack.

274
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,200
That's obvious.

275
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,820
You know, you can't argue with that.

276
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,760
The duh.

277
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,720
It just that explains everything.

278
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,080
So but there was a kind of a time limit on all.

279
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:51,320
This Bob said the world was going to end July 5th, 1998 at seven o'clock in the morning.

280
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,900
It would end for everybody who wasn't going to do is paying subgenius.

281
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,660
Like I said back then, it only cost ten bucks.

282
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,600
Now it's forty four ninety nine.

283
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,660
Price just went up for the first time after ten years.

284
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,820
You get a lot of stuff for that, by the way.

285
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
It's a big package.

286
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,800
Sign me up.

287
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,920
The listeners can't see this.

288
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Huge package full of eight by ten.

289
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,780
Bob Bennett bursting at the seams.

290
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,600
Wow.

291
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,580
It's got a little decoder pin, a minister's card.

292
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,320
You'll be a real minister.

293
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,800
You actually can perform weddings and I perform.

294
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,020
I perform more more than I can count.

295
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,300
I mean, really, what dozens of weddings?

296
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,920
The money is in divorces, though, guys.

297
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Of course, you lawyers do a lot better than preachers.

298
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,860
What's the website?

299
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
So I can buy one right now.

300
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,860
Yes.

301
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,360
So genius dot com.

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,540
So genius dot com.

303
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,560
And if you can spell subgenius.

304
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,540
You may just be one.

305
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Well, even if you spell it wrong, you'll probably get there.

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,580
So genius doesn't have an O in it, but dot and calm.

307
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,560
So geniuses, right?

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,160
Dot com.

309
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,940
Or is that fake?

310
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,560
So genius dot com.

311
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,540
I've been.

312
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,680
Can I do a recap the story here real quick?

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,160
Sure.

314
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,240
Okay.

315
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,840
So you go small.

316
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,280
Smoke weed.

317
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,720
Next thing you know, in Tibet.

318
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,420
Being sodomized by the spirit of Bob.

319
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Well, we're not sure, but but that's a guess.

320
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,440
Okay.

321
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
So you smoke weed.

322
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,880
Bada bing, bada boom.

323
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,260
You're in a cave in Tibet getting fucked by a spirit.

324
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,880
Bada bing, bada boom.

325
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,500
That spirit tells you to start a religion.

326
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,980
Bada bing, bada boom.

327
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,560
You got pamphlets.

328
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,400
And we are where we are today in this time.

329
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,260
Right.

330
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,340
Wow.

331
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,660
Man, what a story, bro.

332
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,420
That's incredible.

333
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,460
So what's that was just the beginning.

334
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,200
So give me before people started believing it.

335
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,640
Chris, we haven't even people start joining up and clamoring.

336
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,760
We haven't even hit our stride yet.

337
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,740
Chris respectfully Reverend staying.

338
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,620
Please continue.

339
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,180
My wife was really ticked off about this whole non-paying job thing.

340
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,080
I was working my ass off understandably.

341
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,640
So and she said you need to send me.

342
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,960
That stupid pamphlet to publishers and see if they'll pay you to make a book and I want

343
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,620
what never occurred to us.

344
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,280
Well, I'm at that time in the United States alone.

345
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,520
There were like a hundred and fifty publishers.

346
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:34,880
There's now about three we sent the pamphlet and a like a fake agent letter as if phyla

347
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,000
was my agent for the agent for subgenius Foundation.

348
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,640
But it's final a real human being or is this?

349
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:42,960
Yes.

350
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,060
Is phyla actual human being like flesh and blood that you have?

351
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah.

352
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,960
Yeah, you can photograph of this person.

353
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,180
Well, well, not that I need it.

354
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,960
I'm just you know, it was but I just want to see the glory.

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,280
Correct.

356
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,420
That's his counterpart.

357
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,580
The only one you know, nobody worships me or phyla.

358
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,820
They were trying to off.

359
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,300
Yeah.

360
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,600
Yeah.

361
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,900
That's just a pictures button.

362
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,820
Don't see the past behind me.

363
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,340
Reverend Reverend staying.

364
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,500
Don't don't don't mind our resident skeptic here.

365
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,300
He's a little bit.

366
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,580
Behind.

367
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,320
No, no, no, not skeptic.

368
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,900
Not skeptic.

369
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,880
I want to understand the story correctly.

370
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,340
Understandably.

371
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,860
So I've made me send the pamphlet all these publishers all of whom either rejected it

372
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,340
or just threw it in the trash.

373
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:26,960
Cool.

374
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,440
But the first place we'd send them were the underground comics publishers because phyla

375
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,900
and I were both big comic book fans, especially undergrounds like Robert crumbs things at

376
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,340
SAP Comics fabulous furry free brothers.

377
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,640
Those guys were our heroes.

378
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:48,200
Those artists were and we send those publishers and all three of the main publishers just

379
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,920
threw them in the trash and said, why do these kooks send us this crap?

380
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,060
But the artists in each in each of those places rip off press and last gasp.

381
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,000
They the art an artist or two would fish it out of the trash and go this stuff's great.

382
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,980
They're using clip art just like we are because everybody suddenly started doing it all punk

383
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,800
posters were all made of clip art all of a sudden.

384
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,640
It was like we're cool.

385
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,720
We were just doing it because we were cheap.

386
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,600
Well, next thing we knew we had these famous underground artists helping us, you know,

387
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,880
descended it to each other and they reviewed it.

388
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,600
They Robert Crumb printed our pamphlet in his first issue of weirdo magazine.

389
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,980
Paul Mavridis at ripoff press ended up being our partner and doing a whole lot of the best

390
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,300
art and his roommate Hal Robbins started those guys could draw like clip art.

391
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,420
So at that point.

392
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:48,560
And I would give them like stick figure drawings and that we designed and then they would turn

393
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,040
them into really nice drawings one drawing cause the Secret Service to show up at my door.

394
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,540
They didn't even have my name, right?

395
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:05,680
The and they they they they only had my first and middle name or sort of I could have said no,

396
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm not here but they it basically somebody in the airport had been waving our pamphlet.

397
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
It's around to people going.

398
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,040
Have you heard the good news?

399
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:24,580
Bob is dead or something, you know, whatever and it it freaks somebody out and especially this this picture right here.

400
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,860
It shows Bob and Jesus and Elvis and JFK and Buddha.

401
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,940
That's incredible.

402
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:41,200
Fighting Hydra and one the Hydra is like the the arms are labeled anti-bob rival cults pink boys and normals.

403
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,700
And one was labeled Reagan or any president and that's what the Secret Service didn't find funny.

404
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,920
They said please don't publish that again.

405
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, it was already in our book.

406
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,660
I said, okay, we won't publish it again.

407
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,240
People magazine published it millions of people saw it in a believe it or not a glowing review of book of the subgenius.

408
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,340
Which ended up being published by one of the publishers had thrown it in the trash first, but

409
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:24,520
or Secretary of Trash, but this guy was on a picnic in New York with my sister-in-law and found a pamphlet crumpled up on the backseat of her car and went where this come from.

410
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,260
This is hilarious.

411
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,560
They thought he they thought it was a joke.

412
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:34,280
See, I mean a lot of people think Bob's not real but point my my bottle tell you Bob's real.

413
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,800
All too real large to large and in charge big old.

414
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,820
I think Bob.

415
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,560
He doesn't he doesn't he doesn't show off how many inches he has.

416
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,500
Is he circumcised?

417
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,340
It's about numbers of so he's got that thing on him son.

419
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,980
He's got a bunch of things.

420
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,180
You got more than one.

421
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,600
That's that's Bob.

422
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:06,840
The next thing we know we were partying with rock stars and we of course immediately got got hooked on drugs.

423
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,440
We couldn't afford went off the deep end and had to go to rehab.

424
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:21,080
Then we switched to just to just frop alone and frop derivatives, you know, from all and from that's what's in his pipe.

425
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:32,800
Right Ivan and Bob's well, actually Bob's pipe what he usually smokes from what we can tell is this cheap Borkham Riff cherry blend.

426
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,160
It's just some crap.

427
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,580
You get it.

428
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,920
The cheapest crap at the pipe store.

429
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,820
Yeah, but the thing is he never no one has ever seen him either.

430
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,120
Refill it or light it or for that matter remove it from his mouth.

431
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:53,000
In fact, if you look at the picture, it's almost like the pipe is glued up against his teeth.

432
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,500
He didn't have his mouth open to hold the pipe.

433
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,580
It's up against these clothes.

434
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,380
It's the weirdest thing a great teeth though, don't he?

435
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,260
Oh God.

436
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,180
Well, he's he's the perfect Caucasian in a way.

437
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,440
I.

438
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,560
You know, I don't know.

439
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:25,100
That's where I wore a Bob t-shirt around Beijing China in the 80s working on a documentary film on my side job and Chinese just would look at that picture crack up.

440
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,040
They thought it was hilarious.

441
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,800
I guess to them.

442
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:37,640
It was an exaggerated white man, you know, like a caricature and they thought little white man knows how ugly they are.

443
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,580
Oh something, you know.

444
00:24:40,820 --> 00:25:04,520
That was I actually handed I gave a copy of Book of the subgenius to the only Chinese subgenius a guy named Li Li Jing at Tiananmen Square because when it's the day before we were going to leave and they wanted us to see Tiananmen Square and it was I swear to God three years to the day before the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

445
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,960
Wow, a book of the subgenius was left in China there.

446
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,020
And exactly.

447
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,300
Exactly.

448
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,040
Three years later.

449
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:19,120
They they sent a bunch of army guys from the boonies hopped up on meth to go kill those bad students.

450
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,820
City kids.

451
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,840
So I've been real quick Bob's message.

452
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,420
Can you give him a synopsis of the message?

453
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,680
Yes, the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

454
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,200
The subgenius must have slack.

455
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:39,380
You can gain slack by pulling the wool over your own eyes relax in the safety of your own delusions.

456
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,060
Too much.

457
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,600
He said is always better than not enough.

458
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,260
Which are actually words more like words to die by them to live by but it sounds good.

459
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,100
That's the thing about all Bob's aphorisms and sayings and quotes and quips.

460
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,440
They all sound really good.

461
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:06,740
But the main thing is the subgenius must have slack and but what that also means is that.

462
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,840
If a person is a subgenius.

463
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,040
It has slack that you're born with original slack, but the conspiracy starts trying to take it away from you.

464
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:30,060
They whack your behind and make you cry as soon as you're born start taking away your slack right then you're just fine sitting there suffocating but they whack your butt and suddenly after breathe and that's it all begins.

465
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,680
It's where the wall the eventually you end up with a job.

466
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,380
In fact, even I.

467
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,180
I'm still stuck with this job.

468
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,180
I'm I'm I should be retired by now.

469
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm 68 years old.

470
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,140
Why am I still working for Bob?

471
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,980
Need a little slack by me to give you a little slack.

472
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,320
Yeah.

473
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,440
He owed actually he didn't finally pay off.

474
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,340
I went for sir.

475
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,840
The 80s were really really fun.

476
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,580
We met all of our heroes and they slapped us on the back and said we were cool.

477
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,100
And so my whole life goal was achieved.

478
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,360
But.

479
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:13,840
Time I was about 30 years old and then then then we just it never got big.

480
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:21,900
We got sort of famous among weirdos, but it never got big.

481
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,140
I finally around 2000.

482
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,940
I realized if I did all the work myself I could and didn't do anything else.

483
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,000
I could actually afford half of the house and half the utilities.

484
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,460
And so I got remarried.

485
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,920
And now everything's fine.

486
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,480
I haven't had to work for anybody else or 22 years or something now.

487
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,300
So blessings Bob's blessing.

488
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,960
So I use I mean a one for a couple hours a day.

489
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,560
I have to sit here and fill orders.

490
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,740
I mean, you'd think that I'd have minions what this being a cult and everything.

491
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,540
There should be minions everywhere, but none of us can stand minion types.

492
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:14,840
In fact, when we've gotten people who were volunteers that really wanted to help.

493
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,680
The reason they had so much spare time to volunteer was that they were incompetent at everything.

494
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,940
Now you can be a subgenius and be completely incompetent at all.

495
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,960
But one thing that's that that describes a lot of subgeniuses.

496
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:37,360
And then there's there's the kind who can do a little bit of everything but nothing quite well enough to make it.

497
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,900
Like a buck.

498
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,940
That's the other kind of set to you.

499
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,780
Anyway, we

500
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,860
heck somebody made a really good movie about us a couple of years ago.

501
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,680
2019.

502
00:28:47,820 --> 00:29:02,580
They are Bob Dobson's a church of the subgenius directed by Sandy Boone who actually was she was a widow of an early contributor who film another filmmaker guy in Texas of David Boone.

503
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,580
But he died young.

504
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,880
And she ended up.

505
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,240
Becoming a filmmaker herself and she wanted to kind of she wanted to finish his movie.

506
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,240
But first to get her directors chops.

507
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,440
She decided to do a documentary about subgenius.

508
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,680
She figured that'd be easy.

509
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,940
Well, two years and half a million bucks later.

510
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,720
She actually got the movie done and it was showing in film festivals and getting the loss of good attention because it's real funny.

511
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,600
It's very good movie moves fast and but then covid hit.

512
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,640
No theater sales.

513
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,360
No distribution to speak of.

514
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,940
So sounds very reminiscent of that Tiananmen Square nonsense.

515
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,600
Sounds like the three years.

516
00:29:47,680 --> 00:30:04,920
Yeah, you guys maybe are tapping into the collective consciousness like an acupuncture needle with this type of work, but I wanted to ask a question that comes to mind because it's a little bit relevant to how I first came across the church of the subgenius being a

517
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,500
cannabis.

518
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,520
Smoker since the age of 16.

519
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:35,580
I found the church of the subgenius on the internet looking at various alternative religions that I could maybe try on like a hat and I never quite understood fully maybe until today what the church of the subgenius really comprised of but it definitely mystified me and gave me sort of a look into a fringe alternative culture that sadly I was too young to participate in.

520
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:44,280
But can you tell us more about how the internet played a role in the earlier days of the church of the subgenius after the 80s?

521
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,720
Well, that wasn't the earlier days anymore.

522
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,000
We were about to I was about to throw in the towel.

523
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,360
Really?

524
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,520
We were we were doing everything by mail order and checks.

525
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,660
We didn't even run credit cards.

526
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,700
It's very primitive and and yet I was busting ass.

527
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,500
We did.

528
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,900
A lot of live shows there.

529
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,020
We hooked up with different bands and we do these devivals in bars.

530
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:22,920
I know I've never actually set foot in a comedy club, believe it or not, but we but yet I would find myself, you know, or at least every month.

531
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:35,000
It's some town standing up on a stage in between bands ranting my ass off and not and never making quite enough money breaking my back hauling stuff.

532
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,660
And but and then Philo knew he knew what the internet was before.

533
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Most people did because of his by that time.

534
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,680
He was he was like a systems analysis for the phone company.

535
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,560
It's like 80 people working under him.

536
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,240
He was the conspiracy and but he said, look, you've got you got to do this internet thing.

537
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,020
You have one of those those America online coasters laying around the house.

538
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,180
It's about back in around 1993.

539
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:04,980
Yeah.

540
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,080
America online would mail you a new disc every day in a little can trying to get people to sign up.

541
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:23,160
Of course, they were charging $3 a minute and he put it in my little computer and got hooked up computer up a phone.

542
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,620
And finally, I saw what the internet was and I saw how much America online was charging.

543
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,320
So I immediately learned how to work under the hood and join the Cleveland.

544
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,440
Even though I was in Dallas, those people already knew who we were at MIT.

545
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,700
There was a big news group of Usenet or what they used to call bulletin boards.

546
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,080
There's been a subgenius bulletin board there since 1983.

547
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,960
So they welcome the internet welcomed us with open arms and about that time.

548
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:03,780
I got a young partner Jesus not Jesus from the Bible, but he looks like and that was part one.

549
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,980
Of the podcast.

550
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,880
My family thinks I'm crazy with me being interviewed.

551
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,940
Now the Ask Dr.

552
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,000
Howell show from Radio Valencia sometime before October 2013.

553
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:40,920
When The

554
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:40,960
At

555
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:40,980
等

556
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,000
And

557
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,080
in

558
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,320
on

559
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,560
If I catch Kong, he'll always have some central point.

560
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,340
Point?

561
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,260
That would trigger everything. Central.

562
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,460
Trigger message. The sleeper must fight influence.

563
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,740
Must fight influence.

564
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,940
Must fight influence.

565
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,420
Must continue showing.

566
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,740
I'm getting hard to...

567
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,680
Okay, I turned it down for a... Wait, let me...

568
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,380
Does it matter much to me?

569
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,380
Well, I think now we have matters...

570
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,420
We're starting to get off now.

571
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,640
Ladies and germs, this is the Ask Dr. Hal show,

572
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,680
live on Puzzling Evidence Radio,

573
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,580
and I'm your boastful host,

574
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,400
Dr. Hal.

575
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:57,400


576
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,200
Dr. Hal Lindahl.

577
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,180
He's actually the living embodiment of humility.

578
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,460
In the cruel, gray city of love,

579
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,120
high above the pulsating heart of San Francisco's mission district.

580
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,240
You might notice the Pope himself has named himself after us.

581
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,380
Well, that's just because someone must follow where bold innovation leads.

582
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,680
Well, we are both named after the same man,

583
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,520
so I would expect the Pope to visit.

584
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,220
That may happen.

585
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,360
I remember when a previous Pope arrived,

586
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,000
I saw his Popemobile going down Gary Street

587
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,900
at a high rate of speed,

588
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,100
with him standing up inside the bulletproof square.

589
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,720
But at least I got to see that.

590
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,560
Why was he speeding?

591
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,760
That's the question.

592
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,260
You'd think he'd go slow,

593
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,840
but he's really zipping along,

594
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,400
and yet he's standing up.

595
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,420
Well, it's all part of...

596
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,020
It must have been kind of scary to be Pope,

597
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,780
to have to go riding around like that.

598
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,260
I'd love to have him.

599
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,980
Truly, if you were a favorite of God,

600
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,160
no mere auto accident could...

601
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,420
Well, no, he got shot riding around in that thing.

602
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,080
Well, the bulletproof glass is to prevent that from happening.

603
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,480
Of course, today, the Republicans have made it legal

604
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,200
to own bullets as large as bananas.

605
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,180
And you can fire those through the papal enclosure.

606
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,600
We're not recommending this, though.

607
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,380
Not at all.

608
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,620
We've got a saintly pontiff in the Vatican now,

609
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,400
and so it would be pointless to remove him.

610
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,400


611
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,400


612
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,320
Doesn't it?

613
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,280
These days.

614
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,140
Oh, there we go.

615
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,540
Yes.

616
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,100
No, I thought it just takes gravity

617
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,120
in a horrible, mistaken space.

618
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,980
And comedy.

619
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,360
And 3D glasses.

620
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,440
What's the deal with gravity?

621
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,720
Everyone loves gravity.

622
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,420
I offer them a ride home, and they...

623
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,040
In 3D.

624
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,840
In 3D.

625
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,220
We have quite a quorum here on the Ask Dr. Hal show at this point.

626
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,780
We've got puzzling evidence.

627
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,660
We've got Michael Pepe.

628
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
Bubba Free Imho Pepe.

629
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,380
Yes, yes.

630
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


631
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


632
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


633
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


634
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


635
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


636
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


637
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,380


638
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,500
We have Rusty Rebar.

639
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,840
And we have Astronomer Royal to the Ask Dr. Hal show,

640
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,740
Pete Goldie.

641
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
Let's give ourselves a big hand.

642
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,380
It's a veritable five fingers of fate.

643
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,580
Let's give each other half of a reach around.

644
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,940
That's the sound of one hand clapping.

645
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,720
Then I'd rather not...

646
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
I'm trying to think of...

647
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
Five things that I could...

648
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,240
Well, there's no point in that.

649
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,700
Obviously, nothing could be more fascinating than the conversation which we are capable of having.

650
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,500
So, thinking of something is a pointless exercise.

651
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,020
Well, yes. In fact, so frighteningly interesting that we better not even attempt it.

652
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:46,220
Also, there's the problem of whatever we mention on the radio comes into being, which has caused us trouble in the past.

653
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,420
That's right. Well, that's a problem.

654
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,120
What, like Lathe of Heaven?

655
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,380
Yes, or Nuclear Holocaust.

656
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,380
Or everything ever opined by Glenn Beck.

657
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,100
Is that where all the Glenn Beck...

658
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,380
That's what...

659
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,280
What he talks about?

660
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,240
That's what we're done with.

661
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,720
No, the...

662
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,020
What...

663
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,380
We talk about...

664
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,380


665
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,380


666
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,220
It's money that causes Glenn Beck to come into being.

667
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,040
...earthquake.

668
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,040
However, we can cause an earthquake into...

669
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Yeah, but let's not...

670
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,220
...be nearly disgusting.

671
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,660
...do that or use the E word in any context, lest we be blamed should one occur.

672
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,480
...approach October 17th.

673
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,240
And what's so all-fired significant about...

674
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,500
...that it'll flash the day of the earthquake.

675
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,220
Oh.

676
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,580
Let me get out of your way.

677
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,940
And then I laugh.

678
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm gonna get out of your way.

679
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,080


680
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,080


681
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,080


682
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,080


683
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,660
Oh, well, um...

684
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:32,940
What?

685
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,320
Do radio play...

686
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,000
Perform on radio?

687
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,520
...missing an important...

688
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,860
...in the world.

689
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,340
What's on your mind?

690
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,920
You're letting everything fall by the wayside.

691
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,680
Check your program.

692
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,900
Stay the alphabet.

693
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,840
The operator will be back...

694
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,360
...when you're ready.

695
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:57,900
Roll time.

696
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,700
You've got your problems.

697
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,280
Well, I've got mine.

698
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,760
Lost transmission inside your mind.

699
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,680
What's on your radio?

700
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,540
What's on your radio?

701
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,380
What's on your radio?

702
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,920
Where do you wanna go?

703
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
What do you wanna know?

704
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,420
What's on your radio?

705
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,140
Radio.

706
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,760
What's on your radio?

707
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,340
And you get as a souvenir...

708
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,100
...a special...

709
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,360
...e-card.

710
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,360


711
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,460

00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:50,200
worry yeah you will before long so there's no point in uh whining and nagging under this intense level

732
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,100
of bombardment

733
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,500
it's difficult to keep the show going volcanoes the earthquakes

734
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,040
if the government shut down thank you very much we're going to soldier through this crisis you

735
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,600
see the program the 10 different the 10 most important ways humanity will extinct itself

736
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,320
all at the same time entertaining pbs sounds hilarious using radio you know using computer

737
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,900
cgi and so on yes cgi is how humanity will exterminate myself years ago

738
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:28,020
so over that now the nuclear uh the holocaust was a third i think uh you know thank you ladies and

739
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,580
gentlemen yes nuclear holocausts can be habit forming this is why we don't want to have them

740
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,600
uh and made all the policy you know and now of course our uh the fact that pakistan is developing

741
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:49,980
its long range uh rockets yes certainly be an ember in every thoughtful personalized pipe and

742
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,940
man also great

743
00:41:51,120 --> 00:42:00,640
and try that the number five uh five dangerous uh threat of mass extinction uh is uh physics

744
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,520
experiments which are they declared accelerating particles they might they might get the wrong two

745
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:13,140
particles exactly well it's this idea that small black holes every day small black holes are

746
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,200
created and they create tremendous thousands of these uh high energy experiments every day

747
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,840
and they may create these microscopic not every day they have downtime during the winter just

748
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,800
right twice on sunday obnoxious i was surprised they made number five though they were ahead of

749
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,740
global warming i think in the killer whales i think someone's downstairs did

750
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,620
anyone ever close the gates i think we left them wide open what shambling crowds of zombies

751
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,900
down there walking in yeah they can come bumbling and stumbling up but there's nothing to stop them

752
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,600
The gates are wide open.

753
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,840
They're slow moving.

754
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,440
You can avoid them for a while, and they just always get you in the end.

755
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,560
All right, enough time's gone by.

756
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,180
I'm going to share a little wine with Hal.

757
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,000
No one else.

758
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,540
Careful.

759
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,860
We might need that thing to fight for our lives.

760
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,980
You don't need to lift it.

761
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,260
Just move the hose around.

762
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,180
Hoser, there you go.

763
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,360
This is some wine, I must say, very strongly flavored.

764
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:18,680
Flavored?

765
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,980
Delicious.

766
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,440
Yeah, it's from Safeway.

767
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,700
Oh, that's what I thought you were talking about.

768
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,380
Hey, speaking of meat, since Rusty's here, we bought some fried, some...

769
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,780
Wow.

770
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,380
Wine is a mother.

771
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,180
Strong drink is raging.

772
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,340
None for anyone else.

773
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,680
None.

774
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:47,120
Some signature cafe deli, hot deli, fried chicken wings from last Friday.

775
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,980
Psycho deli.

776
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,180
And we cut into it before, like, biting into it.

777
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,060
It was like bloody raw chicken inside.

778
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,200
Inside the beautifully browned, deep-fried skin.

779
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,280
That's a famous burnt raw recipe.

780
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,320
Just cut them up like regular chicken.

781
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,040
That's right.

782
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,900
You know, these chickens, they're probably not all frozen.

783
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,120
Let's throw them in the fryer.

784
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,480
It's a serious crime.

785
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,720
Frozen in the Arctic ice cap for, I guess, millions of years.

786
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,120
I reported them to their ethics department.

787
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,800
These archaeopteryxes found themselves, through a bizarre chain of circumstances,

788
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,840
to a local grocery store.

789
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,340
Were you thanked for your good citizenhood of pointing out that they were selling...

790
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,200
Oh, no, I didn't put it on Facebook or anything.

791
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm only spreading the word now that poison is chicken.

792
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,740
Was it Foster Farms?

793
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,900
You should put it on Facebook.

794
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,040
Because they're the ones in trouble, you know, for the salmonella thing.

795
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,580
Good question.

796
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:41,900
Don't know.

797
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,960
But the...

798
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,340
It was scary in a sense.

799
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,000
At Salmonella's mom-and-pop market.

800
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,120
Bloody chicken.

801
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,240
That's good.

802
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,960
Well, if you'd ever been anywhere near while chickens are raised...

803
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,360
Bloody chicken flourished over us.

804
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,060
Have you ever done that?

805
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,560
Yeah, I worked at a chicken ranch.

806
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,840
You've done them chickens wrong.

807
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,840
Were they mistreated?

808
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,300
Yes, they were mistreated.

809
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,640
So were the workers.

810
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,340
Ah.

811
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,640
So, chicken workers of the world...

812
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,800
In other words, it was a typical chicken ranch.

813
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,440
It was a chicken ranch in Novato.

814
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,520
Yeah, it was a...

815
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,060
It was a holocaust.

816
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,820
That's not the Mustang Ranch, folks.

817
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,460
No.

818
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,120
Oh, that's different.

819
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,080
They are very well treated, I'm sure.

820
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,660
No, this was a chicken ranch.

821
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,780
They have a lot of well-butrin, oxycontin.

822
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,940
Yes, they have all that.

823
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,300
And a pension.

824
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,520
Here we are only reflecting the hideous face of life and the universe itself

825
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,040
by ensuring unfairness to all those chickens.

826
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,140
But why look at it entirely negatively?

827
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,780
Because you may be aware of a recent news story

828
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,420
where philanthropists allowed aging chickens

829
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,720
to be flown out of California to a chicken paradise

830
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,500
in the East Coast near Albany, New York.

831
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,400
Oh, yes, I did hear about that.

832
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,360
On Earth.

833
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,300
I heard about that.

834
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:56,620
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,020
So there are some chickens that actually managed

836
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,660
to gain the system and retire in comfort.

837
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,900
Many people wrote in outrage, you know,

838
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,280
how dare they not broil all those chickens

839
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,600
and feed them to the homeless.

840
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,700
No, but...

841
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,680
Those chickens are probably on the Today Show.

842
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,200
Celebrity, celebrity retired chickens.

843
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,000
They've settled in.

844
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,400
They've settled in.

845
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,400


846
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,400


847
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,400


848
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:17,560
They've settled in.

849
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,460
They've settled in.

850
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:18,460


851
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:18,460


852
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:18,460


853
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,960
Chicken Elysium near Albany, New York,

854
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,960
in the New York State Capital Region.

855
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,100
At some point, they must become too old to be eaten.

856
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,200
Each chicken is given a daily massage

857
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,700
and a choice of special, lucrative meals

858
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,880
prepared by an avian chef.

859
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,100
No, that's only if they're going to kill them.

860
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,980
Then they give them the massage.

861
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,460
No, they're too old.

862
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,860
They're too scraggly.

863
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,640
That's why they were going to be destroyed

864
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,400
originally before the philanthropists

865
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,300
saved them.

866
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,160
They were scraggly, scrawny,

867
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,740
and their feathers were falling out.

868
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,480
They were non-commercial.

869
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,520
They laid many eggs.

870
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,580
Many, many eggs.

871
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,960
And it does something to you, you know,

872
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,540
laying all those eggs over the years.

873
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,680
I love eggs so much.

874
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,900
Well, I'm sure they appreciate that.

875
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,920
But these chickens were taken off the assembly line

876
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,640
and allowed to do their egg laying

877
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,780
in their own way for their own purposes.

878
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,320
Although their eggs aren't that big or good anymore

879
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,460
after all these years.

880
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,000
Still, it's the principle,

881
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,160
the thing, and...

882
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,120
What do they make out of?

883
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,400
Really little omelets?

884
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,080
This is where chickens get to live

885
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,820
the end of their days

886
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,900
in happiness and pure delight.

887
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,580
I've been nice.

888
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,840
Does Chicken John know he has that ahead for him?

889
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,660
And when they die,

890
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,740
can we eat them then?

891
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,980
Not every chicken gets into chicken paradise.

892
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,420
Oh, I'm not sure that eggs will fit.

893
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,880
Is that a fee or a penalty?

894
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,400
Have you ever had really good deviled eggs?

895
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:44,940
No.

896
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,800
I don't think so.

897
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,240
You're here.

898
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,740
You're here with one of the biggest fans of deviled eggs.

899
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,520
That would be puzzling evidence.

900
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,380
He's quite fond of them.

901
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:53,740
Well...

902
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,360
When I say gnome saying,

903
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,300
you say note you're saying.

904
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,620
Yeah, I know what you're saying, too.

905
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,420
But I'm trying to transliterate it

906
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,560
into an appreciation of a vanished series of...

907
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,400
It's like, I won't go.

908
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,780
I remember the gnome king.

909
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,200
I remember his many sayings.

910
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,100
The thing about him was...

911
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,520
And somebody else says, note you're saying.

912
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,300
He was...

913
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,560
Terrified of eggs.

914
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,800
The gnome king.

915
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,680
Note you're saying.

916
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,300
I never used to like...

917
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,400
Being translated into Japanese.

918
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,520
I like the deviled egg society of Japan.

919
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,840
I never used to like corned beef hash.

920
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,540
But Doug turned me on to them.

921
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,880
That was a comfort.

922
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,580
Corned beef hash, that's a good thing.

923
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,580
Like boiled cabbage.

924
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,560
You can't get enough of it.

925
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,860
Your mom didn't make that?

926
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,120
You should give him a technical advisor fee.

927
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,320
Oh, I see.

928
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,300
You know what I think?

929
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,940
I think you should give him a technical...

930
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,960
Let's give him deviled eggs.

931
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,540
Many are called, but few are chosen.

932
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,920
And the trick of picking chicken

933
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,680
is picking what chicken to pick.

934
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,240
Hauser took his last extended trip in August.

935
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,040
His destination was the Grand Canyon,

936
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,040
one of the few places he had yet to visit.

937
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,540
Really?

938
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,200
He was late getting to the Grand Canyon.

939
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,940
He got as far as the Hoover Dam.

940
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,060
And he was overcome with emotion.

941
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,020
Obama, you mean?

942
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,380
No, Hill Hauser never went to the Grand Canyon.

943
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,700
He only went to the Hoover Dam.

944
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,580
He drew his last breath at the dam.

945
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,460
Oh, on the show.

946
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,480
But I'm sure he probably visited it prior.

947
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:23,680
No, he wasn't.

948
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,640
The work of man.

949
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,540
No, he'd never been to the Grand Canyon.

950
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,880
He never made that.

951
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,880
It's right on California.

952
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,380
His show is all about California.

953
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,440
The work of God.

954
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,140
I want the Grand Canyon.

955
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,740
It's the greatest thing in the world.

956
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,760
I didn't see him doing shows outside of California.

957
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,240
Back to the starting gun.

958
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,540
The Grand Canyon is the most beautiful place in the world.

959
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,800
With flowers and cherries.

960
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,260
And the holiest, most sacred place.

961
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,180
What, are you from Arizona?

962
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:47,700
Or something?

963
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,060
No.

964
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,280
I just know that.

965
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,100
Arizona, here I come.

966
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,520
What's their song?

967
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,920
We would give you all the facts.

968
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,560
But we're just recalling what we know.

969
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:54,940
But you know what?

970
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,640
Suddenly I have this horrible desire to ask a question.

971
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,360
Why isn't there a K-Rob moment on the Ask Dr. Hal show anymore?

972
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,500
Well, you know, that's up to K-Rob.

973
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,520
And we might have to do it.

974
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,580
I think K-Rob is the only one that owns crack.

975
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,660
He doesn't want to share it.

976
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,520
Well, I love crack.

977
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,580
So he should bring it in and we'll do it.

978
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,280
Yep.

979
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,380
Do you have a dollar for that question?

980
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:16,680
Yeah.

981
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,200
Someone has to.

982
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,080
We have to pay for it.

983
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:18,820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

984
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,620
Five dollars.

985
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,900
No, someone has to pay if we want crack.

986
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,580
Oh.

987
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,900
Somebody has to buy it.

988
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,720
Oh, dear.

989
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,480
Forget it.

990
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,220
And also, you're right.

991
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,280
Let's charge five dollars for the show for our crack.

992
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,760
Okay?

993
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:28,980
Yeah.

994
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,340
I thought they'd pay us to...

995
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,040
The break is only going to be four or five seconds.

996
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,040
So it's just a...

997
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,780
Prepare for subliminal puzzling and information burst squirt.

998
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,560
Thank you.

999
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,780
Now return to your scheduled program.

1000
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,620
Uh...

1001
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,080
Signs.

1002
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,660
Too fast to even read.

1003
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,340
Horrible.

1004
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,060
Horrible.

1005
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,800
Most horrible.

1006
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,440
Aside from which, all the German shows are always about either technological things or just cars.

1007
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:06,920
And now we return you to our afternoon snoozer movie, Face of the Screaming Werewolf.

1008
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,460
The gun talks.

1009
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm usually delivered by people with American accents who don't...

1010
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,140
That's one I used to watch in Tucson, Arizona.

1011
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,600
They know what they're doing.

1012
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,380
They know what they're doing.

1013
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,380


1014
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,380


1015
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,380


1016
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,380


1017
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,380


1018
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,640
They used to show packages of Mexican monster movies in Tucson, Arizona back in the 60s.

1019
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,840
And the thing about them is not that they have the greatest production values,

1020
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:36,780
but they seem permeated by a sense that the people who made the movies actually believe that these monsters do exist.

1021
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.

1022
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:45,860
And an air of superstitious dread hangs over their poorly made sets, costumes, and acting.

1023
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,120
I wonder if...

1024
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,340
And you also, at that time, you'd watch it in the middle of the night at 2 a.m.

1025
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,420
So that would add to...

1026
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:54,440
It's really scary.

1027
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,180
Oh, yeah.

1028
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,540
Well, it's nothing like late night movies would be scary.

1029
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:05,020
Let me mention just one of these to you, which you probably remember, called Baba Free Imho Pep.

1030
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,060
Perhaps greatest of all.

1031
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,020
That's enough.

1032
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:08,280
Yeah.

1033
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,060
It's the only one they haven't done yet.

1034
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,040
Well, where are you getting your information?

1035
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:12,860
Except from Sergeant Fury.

1036
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,760
Is there a Michael Pepe movie?

1037
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,060
I don't think so.

1038
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,000
Not that I know of.

1039
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,320
Okay.

1040
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,340
I think they aren't going to do that.

1041
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:19,540
Yeah.

1042
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:19,860
No.

1043
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,760
Well, but...

1044
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
Baba Free Imho Pep.

1045
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,700
...is the most amazing and mysterious...

1046
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,400
Yes, and that's why they're not going to do it.

1047
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,320
...and remarkable of all.

1048
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,100
Is he a bad guy?

1049
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,600
He's a magician.

1050
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,460
He's a wizard who is like a stoner, actually, who travels through other dimensions and...

1051
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,340
It's ecumenical, you say.

1052
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,220
He's a great guy, but they're never going to make a movie about him.

1053
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,400
He's a magician, a sorcerer who can cast spells...

1054
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,960
He's burlesque.

1055
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,240
...puzzling evidence.

1056
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,780
...shows they have a hilarious caricature.

1057
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,000
I think he might be the last one to appear.

1058
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,680
Unless you appear, otherwise, there's gold to be made from mining these characters.

1059
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,520
We're done with the Burning Man music, right?

1060
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,200
We're done with it?

1061
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,940
Yes, absolutely.

1062
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,600
No more Burning Man.

1063
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,120
I was already...

1064
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,260
But I don't know why they wouldn't, because this is a very mystical era.

1065
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,120
It is after the New Age.

1066
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,100
There's plenty and plenty of people who will go in for spells, channeling, witchcraft.

1067
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,040
Yes, having their palm read.

1068
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,660
Aleister Crowley, et cetera, et cetera.

1069
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,440
And they would...

1070
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,400
And Edward Casey at the bat.

1071
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,980
Yes, and they would believe in Dr.

1072
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,900
Rayleigh Armour.

1073
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,560
Live on puzzling evidence.

1074
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,600
Yes, they would, because they are too feeble-minded to exercise the power of imagination.

1075
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,260
That's right.

1076
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:42,800
But, you know, they believe in Spider-Man and Avengers and everything else.

1077
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,380
A certain portion of the credulous public do and always have...

1078
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:47,740
Yes.

1079
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:52,380
...like the owl hoots who used to fire their revolvers at the villain on the movie screen.

1080
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:58,620
But this is by no means what everybody thinks or the way everybody reacts.

1081
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,700
Most people are able to make the distinction there.

1082
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,220
Yes, it was a terrible thing.

1083
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,860
Frightful.

1084
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,400
Right.

1085
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,640
It's like in the...

1086
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,220
I wept for my country when I recollected that God is just.

1087
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,080
Yes.

1088
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,360
Yes.

1089
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,840
Yes.

1090
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:17,180


1091
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1092
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1093
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1094
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1095
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1096
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1097
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1098
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1099
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:17,360


1100
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,140
Female created he them.

1101
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,220
For are we anything more than dust motes floating in the cosmic beam?

1102
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,540
No, I'll tell you what we are.

1103
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,840
We are water to water.

1104
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:44,460
Because if how, if we could attach an isotope to that one molecule of water, so is to follow

1105
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,100
through any possible corner.

1106
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:47,520
Yes.

1107
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,840
Oh, I peanuts.

1108
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,580
And a taller, fine, lower arabic physicist would know that Mod modernize sand storms

1109
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,180
as a kind of science and additional Chill Potter issues.

1110
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:00,180


1111
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,500
a single biological class ...

1112
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,480
The only significant evolution even in first class is like the center of gravity.

1113
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,820
A big نہیں toi mister or facing round.

1114
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:16,260
What the hell are you, motherfucker?

1115
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,280
shortly after.

1116
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,980
It's not like those other radio stations.

1117
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,680
Other radio stations have delayed.

1118
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,180
Here, for the time being,

1119
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,180
we do not.

1120
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,840
It is straight.

1121
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,960
And so you're actually listening,

1122
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,260
if you're listening at the present time,

1123
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,320
in a congruent time frame,

1124
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,800
so rare for radio listeners.

1125
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,380
What a special privilege that our Etherettes

1126
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,760
and Rocket rookies have,

1127
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,940
who are fervent fans of the Ask Dr. Hal radio program.

1128
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,960
It's taken years for us to develop the technology

1129
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,040
just to get to you directly, live.

1130
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,240
Let's go into the dark room and see what develops.

1131
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,820
The air is electric with possibilities.

1132
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,900
Uh-huh. Wow.

1133
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,300
And if you think of the other people

1134
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,120
who might be listening and writing reports,

1135
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,560
it really charms my heart to think,

1136
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,200
oh, please don't write me up.

1137
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,860
I couldn't even find the logbook the last time.

1138
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,780
There's going to be so many reports written about

1139
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,860
just what's happening.

1140
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,060
Yes, I had another report.

1141
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,560
Moment of liveness.

1142
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,780
A loud report.

1143
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,980
Now they're saying,

1144
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,660
well, you know, it's all being stored,

1145
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,280
so if they want to play it back and listen to it,

1146
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,420
they can at any time.

1147
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,300
Everything is stored.

1148
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:40,880
A holy playback.

1149
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,300
Everything is stored.

1150
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:42,940
Everything is stored.

1151
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,040
Most of it is.

1152
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,240
At Wellman's house, in his computer.

1153
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,040
Yes, you've seen all those.

1154
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,560
He has stored almost everything in the universe.

1155
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,980
There's a little bit left.

1156
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,680
One electromagnetic pulse ought to take care of that.

1157
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,200
Such as the platforms that are being created.

1158
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,560
Anyway, someone has to keep the threads in hand.

1159
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,240
The threads of life, yes.

1160
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,240
You mean the seven systems?

1161
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:14,640
The seven sisters.

1162
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,040
Well, you just don't want to snarl them all up.

1163
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:17,800
That's what I'm saying.

1164
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,620
Yeah, but what do they call?

1165
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,340
You want to keep the seven sisters.

1166
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,940
I know of three sisters.

1167
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm sorry, the three.

1168
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,520
The three sisters known as the Norns.

1169
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,540
We weave the fate of humanity in thread.

1170
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,480
Seven sisters is a series of peaks in Colorado.

1171
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,260
But the fate, you know.

1172
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,060
How about this?

1173
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,580
A John Le Carre character called Memory.

1174
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,940
It's like, well, Memory heard about that.

1175
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,740
Johnny Mabnonic.

1176
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,440
Yes.

1177
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,140
Memory.

1178
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,440
Memory.

1179
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,940
A character called Memory.

1180
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,560
No, it's a person, a character.

1181
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,320
A character called Memory.

1182
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,900
Read me Doctor Memory.

1183
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,820
Doctor Memory.

1184
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,800
I don't know.

1185
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,720
Are you Doctor Memory?

1186
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,760
He forgets.

1187
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,100
Doctor Magnetic.

1188
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,400
Well, there's so many doctors.

1189
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,300
Yeah, I'm getting sick of that too.

1190
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,080
Only real doctors can use it from now on.

1191
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:11,680
The rule.

1192
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,340
Doctors of science.

1193
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,380
At least you have to have some sort of doctorate.

1194
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,600
Tesla, the guy that did the Tesla coil.

1195
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,700
What did he call himself?

1196
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,360
Tesla.

1197
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,160
No, then there's someone else called the idea.

1198
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:28,820
Thank you, Dr. Hal, Puzzling Evidence, Rusty Rebar, Bubba Free, Imho Pep, Michael Pepe,

1199
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:37,580
the late Peter Goldie, Dr. Philo Drummond, and Bishop Joey, founder of the St. Stupid's Day Parade and the Callers.

1200
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,660
And it's www.subtitles.com.

1201
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,820
That leads to everything.

1202
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,560
Thank y'all and praise the dogs.

1203
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,120
Free your radio and your mind will follow.

1204
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:09,660
Free Think Radio is your one-stop source for all the subgenius shows, including the Hour of Slack.

1205

Every Thursday at 11 a.m.

1207
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,720
Eastern Time, we think.

Yes, friends, freethinkradio.com.

1211
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,300
Praise Bob and praise Free Think Radio.

1212
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,500
Gee, I want to try Triology.

1213
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,160
All the kids are doing it, Mom.

1214
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,860
There's a Dobbs head in every bar.

1215
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:59,080
Yes, an embedded Dobbs head of soap inside a bar of translucent soap.

1216
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,300
You can see Bob lurking inside, and it tells fortunes.

1217
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:09,300
As you rotate it swiftly under the water, lathering away, the conspiracy smudges.

1218
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:19,560
If the Dobbs head comes up at the end in the true perfect pipe placement position, you'll have good luck all day.

1219
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,500
If it comes up the other way, 20 more years of winter.

1220
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,940
That's triologiesoaps.com.

1221
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,160
It comes in every flavor and scent.

1222
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,520
That's not nonsense.

1223
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:36,900
It's almost every scent you can think of, and they all have funny names.

1224
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,720
Praise Bob and praise triologiesoaps.com.

1225
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,720
Tri is spelled with an I.

1226
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,520
Squadron I
