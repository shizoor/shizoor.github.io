1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:22,360
1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

2
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:59,880
1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0.

3
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,640
Imagine there's no garbage

4
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,540
It's easy if you

5
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,760
Don't have no one

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,540
Above us only

7
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,640
Imagine all the people

8
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,960
Living for

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,600
Bob

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,400
Peter Lorre

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,920
Careful now

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,200
Don't be so sure of yourself

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Because

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,640
You are listening to Peter Lorre

15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,120
You don't believe it?

16
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,200
Neither do I

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,500
They gone?

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,600
Yeah

19
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,580
They're gone

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,340
Huh?

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,920
Huh?

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,520
Huh?

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,920
Hmm?

24
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,520
Oh, no

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Hmm?

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,340
Trapped

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,900
Trapped

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,540
In a living nightmare

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,800
Don't shut up

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,280
Put me through to Dickson Bainbridge

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know how to dial

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,220
Thank you

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Hello, my Bainbridge

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
It's Bobby Bob Bob

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,340
Bob

36
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,760
Bob

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,120
Bob

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,340
Bob

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,700
Bob

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,040
Bob

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,320
Bob

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,600
Bob

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:20,940
Bob

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,240
Bob

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,520
Bob

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,680
Bob

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:21,940
Bob

48
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,120
Bob

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,060
Bob

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,660
I'm outrageous

51
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,500
How dare he say such blasphemy

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,420
I've got to do something

53
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:28,800
Bob

54
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,580
There's nothing you can do.

55
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
I like.

56
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,700
Guess I'll just have to develop a sense of humor.

57
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,460
My baby was talking in her sleep.

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,520
She said, bye.

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,780
I said, what?

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,880
She said, bye.

61
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,520
I said, I'm bye.

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,220
She said, no.

63
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,880
I mean a different bye.

64
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,380
So I asked her the next day.

65
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
I said, Jane.

66
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
She said, what?

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,300
I said, who's bye?

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,180
She said, you're bye.

69
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,120
I said, no.

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
I mean a different bye.

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
She said, go.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:35,960


73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Frig.

74
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:42,640


75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,040
Frig.

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,040


77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,220
Frig.

78
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,420
Frig.

79
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,440
Frig.

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,280
Frig.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,880
Frig.

82
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
Frig.

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:45,600


84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,720
Frig.

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:46,740
Frig.

86
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:46,740


87
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:46,740


88
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,440
Frig.

89
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,440


90
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,820
Jig.

91
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,120
Jig.

92
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,120


93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,120


94
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,120


95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,120


96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
Jig.

97
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,260
My baby was run over by a truck

98
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,620
It was a dodge

99
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,780
As she lay dying

100
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,800
She called for Bob

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,860
I touched her hand and said I'm here

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,140
She said no

103
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,640
I mean a different Bob

104
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:58,940
I mean a different Bob

105
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,520
My baby was dark and in a sleep

106
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,640
A different Bob

107
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,940
Their friends

108
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
And their friends

109
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,720
That was by

110
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,480
The Colorblind James Experience

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,120
That's the actual name

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,460
Of that actual band

113
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,120
That did that actual song

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
A different Bob

115
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,060
By the Colorblind James Experience

116
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,500
Before that collage is

117
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,980
Thanks to

118
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Lemur mostly

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,040
Fernand and Andy Lemur

120
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,200
The very beginning Stangolini ad

121
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,180
Was from I Dr. Mr. Sistar

122
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,580
And

123
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,720
Tom

124
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,020
Holm

125
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,920
And Throwback Soul

126
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,360
Contributed little tiny bits

127
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,340
Of the bits and pieces there

128
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,780
And probably any other bits and pieces

129
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,540
You hear later on will be from

130
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,960
Lemur

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,380
And where's my

132
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,740
Background

133
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,320
There's some background noise

134
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Yeah there is

135
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,500
A little bit

136
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,040
Frozen

137
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
Am I hearing

138
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,500
Am I hearing things?

139
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,460
Yeah okay

140
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,180
I'm hearing things

141
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,420
Friends

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,040
We have

143
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,080
We're all in the actual studio

144
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,780
Station right now

145
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,140
And there

146
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,160
We have a special guest

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,960
Tonight

148
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,880
Can I say that?

149
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,740
Is that a

150
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,720
Special

151
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,120
An excellent guest

152
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,140
A very differently

153
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,520
Ability guest

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,760
That being

155
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,460
Friends

The great

157
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,820
Bishop Joey

158
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,300
From the first

159
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,780
Church of the Last Laugh

160
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,000
He's right here

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,980
Among us

162
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,480
Today

163
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,000
What a

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,120
There we go

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,240
We must note

166
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,000
The complete differences

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,580
Between the one known as Bob

168
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,420
And the one known to my people

169
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,480
As his son

170
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,160
These two have been at each other's

171
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
Throats for a long time

172
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,340
And it is time not only to bury the hatchet

173
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,240
In each other's heads

174
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
But also to forget

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,140
Why we came here

176
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,680
Well I don't know about that man

177
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Cause I mean

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,920
No no no

179
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,700
Let me take it from here

180
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay the first church

181
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
The last laugh

182
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,720
Is pretty funny

183
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,940
And yeah they're gonna get

184
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,200
The last laugh

185
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,720
That's right

186
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,780
We're gonna have the last laugh

187
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,240
Cause we came all the way out

188
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,620
From the left coast

189
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,520
To help convert you people

190
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,640
Who don't know that

191
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,860
You already are

192
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,980
Members of the first church

193
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,640
Of the last laugh

194
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,920
For the fastest growing snack religion

195
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
150% less dogma

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,880
To light religion

197
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,820
One whole new day a year

198
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,880
And today is not it though

199
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,580
So April 1st is

200
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,740
So you gotta get ready for the parade

201
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,760
So what are you gonna do

202
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,740
You guys think you're so stupid

203

Come on out

210
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,840
Come on out

211
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,160
In the streets of San Francisco

212
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,880
In the financial district

213
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs is so much dumber

214
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,920
Than Saint Stupid

215
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,940
I can't even

216
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,500
He's like a hundred thousand

217
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,960
Million times dumber

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,180
I don't think so

219
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,160
Oh no he's a hundred thousand

220
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,540
Million plus one dumber

221
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,520
I don't think so

222
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,020
Bob is godzillion times dumber

223
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,640
Than Saint Stupid

224
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,780
Oh no

225
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,500
Bob's a baby Godzilla

226
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,360
Saint Stupid is the Godzilla

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,280
The Godzilla

228
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,260
No godzillion

229
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,720
No oh gazillion

230
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,300

231
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,200
Godzillion

232
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,260
No there is no

233
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,080
Godzillion is the last number

234
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,900
There is no godzillion

235
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,800
Get off the table

236
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:39,960
Stay

237
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,900
Okay

238
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,260
Oh

239
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,860
Okay

240
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,580
Well look

241
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,280
It's true that there has been

242
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,940
Long been

243
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,840
In fact since

244
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,580
What did we decide

245
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
1979

246
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,500
79 both church started

247
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
I started at Saint Stupid

248
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,540
In 1979

249
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,560
You started the

250
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,280
Whatever you do

251
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,620
No

252
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,900
I went to work

253
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,740
For J.R. Bob Dobbs

254
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,620
In 1979

255
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,640
You call that work

256
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,160
Bob started the church

257
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,020
Of the subgenius

258
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,760
In 1953

259
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,840
I'll have you know

260
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,440
Oh 53

261
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Oh really

262
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,200
You got some documentation

263
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,760
On that

264
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,140
Show it

265
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,740
Put it up on the wall

266
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:07,960
Now

267
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,420
Put it up buddy

268
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,540
Put the docus on the wall

269
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,280
I really want me to do that

270
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,840
Put it up

271
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,380
That would be like

272
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,740
Me showing off my tattoos

273
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,260
I don't think you want to see

274
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,880
Where my tattoos

275
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,780
I don't want to see

276
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,900

277
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,320
I want to show

And Euclid

280
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,720
I don't think we want to see

281
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,240
Either one of your tattoos

282
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,600
Friends

283
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Bishop Joe

284
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,700
Yes it says here

285
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,460
That was a slip

286
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,040
He actually did a show

287
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,980
Earlier today

288
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,720
He's an actual

289
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
It's a one man show

290
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,500
And get this

291
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,920
This is the actual title

292
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,540
Of the show

293
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,400
Subhuman

294
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
It was a one man show

295
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,440
At the Lake Erie College

296
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,140
A benefit for extended housing

297
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,800
True tales from beneath the sea

298
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
A salty tale

299
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,160
Of danger

300
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,680
Discovery

301
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,400
And destiny

302
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,000
Now with extra salt

303
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
Ed is a

304
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,380

305
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,720
Bigger than a

306
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:57,940
Bigger than a

307
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,680
Bishop Joey

308
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,140
Is a local boy

309
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,920

312
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,740
He's been performing

For 33 years

317
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,140
And that'll probably

318
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,900
Explain a lot

319
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,460
Way Bay

320
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,060
Way Bay

321
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,360

325
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,960

326
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,940
SFMT.org

327
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,600
They just

328
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
What was that?

329
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,880
SFMT

330
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
When you say the word

331
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,680
SF Mime Troop

332
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,540
You have to say

333
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,960
The thing

334
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,400
The tag

335
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,680
Right

336
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,480
SF Mime Troop

337
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,320
No it's

338
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
It's parenthetical

339
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,860
No not that kind of mime

340
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,540
And then the website

341
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,740
SFMT.org

342
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:33,840
That's true

343
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,260
Close parenthesis

344
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,380
That's a parenthetical

345
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,040
Mime Troop

346
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,960
And has performed

347
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,640
With these

348
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Minor two bit

349
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,920
Bunches

Six bits

357
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,900
Which probably is

358
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,660
That kind of mime

359
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,780
Movie credits include

360
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,600
The Right Stuff

361
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,220
Big deal

362
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,740
Tucker

363
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,140
Big deal

364
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,660
One of the greatest

365
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,420
Movies ever made

366
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,620
Howard the Duck

367
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,820
Duck

368
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,240
How many people

369
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,620
Do you know

370
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,240
Who were in

371
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Howard the Duck?

372
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,340
Yes

373
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,480
Yes

374
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,040
Cleveland

375
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,740
I blew away

376
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,440
From your shores

377
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,220
And bore fruit

378
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,840
On the far left

379
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,340
Of course

380
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,660
Right

381
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,760
It was Howard the Duck

382
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,160
I'm sorry

383
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,260
I have to apologize

384
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,900
For everybody

385
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,800
I was a duck hunter

386
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,620
On the TV screen

387
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,120
When Howard

388
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,020
Is up against

389
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,200
He hits the streets

390
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,700
And he's running

391
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,240
Down the street

392
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,900
And he's freaked out

393
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,440
And he turns around

394
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,620
And looks in this TV window

395
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
That was you?

396
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,420
There was a TV

397
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,660
A cook taking

398
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
A casserole dish

399
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,720
Off some duck

400
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,500
And scooping up

401
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,920
And then there's

402
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,000
Another shot of a TV

403
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
With me being interviewed

404
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
As a duck hunter

405
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,560
And I'm going

406
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm going to blast

407
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,360
Them feathered

408
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,440
Beep from the sky

409
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,900
That was me

410
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,080
I remember that part

411
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,520
I know

412
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,880
I know

413
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,160
I felt it

414
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,720
I felt it

415
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,360
Were you in the comic book?

416
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,720
No

417
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,900
I was not in the comic book

418
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,780
I take exception

419
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,640
To that movie

420
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,880
Because they actually

421
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,460
Shot that in Sacto

422
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
In Sacramento

423
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,980
I know

424
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,020
And in Lake Erie

425
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,480
Which is supposed

426
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,160
To be like this

427
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,620
I know

428
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,180
It was like

429
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,900
Lake Sacramento

430
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,800
Which you could actually

431
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,340
See across

432
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,040
And it's like

433
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,820
A huge pond

434
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,180
You know

435
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,540
So everybody

436
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,420
Was supposed to get it

437
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,920
But not

438
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,660
Teeters

439
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,420
So that's

440
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,000
That's why I argued

441
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,680
With the producer

442
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,700
And that's why

443
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,760
They shot me later

444
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
In a leg

445
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,020
And that's what

446
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,160
This wound is all about

447
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,940
It's a tough business

448
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,480
It's a tough

449
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,280
You're messing with

450
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,540
Hollywood

451
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,180
You're messing with

452
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,640
The families

453
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,160
And you mess with

454
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,580
The families

455
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:07,940
You're going to

456
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,760
Pay the price

457
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,540
You know what I mean?

458
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,220
But why do they

459
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,120
Put an antenna

460
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
In here like this?

461
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,740
Tracking

462
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,320
Just tracking

463
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,900
It's just

464
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,220
You know

465
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,660
Tracking

466
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,160
Couldn't they

467
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,060
Just you know

468
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,620
Let's move on

469
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,200
To the next segment

470
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,560
Of the show

471
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,920
Shall we?

472
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,500
Okay now

473
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,140
The first church

474
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,600
To last last

475
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,180
Sponsors the

476
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,020
St. Stupid's Day

477
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,940
Parade in San Francisco

478
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,560
That'll be this

479
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,280
April 1st

480
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,640
Noon in the

481
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,420
Embarcadero Plaza

482
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,400
It'll be the

483
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,280
Weekday route

484
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,960
Through the

485
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
Financial district

486
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,340
On the sidewalk

487
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,760
With the

488
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,780
Proverbial stations

489
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,720
Of Stupid

490
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,060
The Federal Reserve

491
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,840
Bank where we

492
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,420
Thank them for

493
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,160
Turning our economy

494
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
Into a casino economy

495
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,540
The leap of faith

496
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,640
The tomb of stupid

497
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,000
The sock exchange

498
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
And tossing pennies

499
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,460
At the banker's heart

500
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
So come prepared

501
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,580
Come dressed for it

502
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,060
Noon

503
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,880
Embarcadero Plaza

504
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,000
San Francisco

505
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
Now back to you

506
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,360
Be there for the stations

507
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,000
Those are better

508
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,620
Like when Jesus

509
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,320
Falls down

510
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,040
And can't get up

511
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,700
And then the crippled

512
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,060
Guy comes

513
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,480
Comes over and

514
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:53,940
Shoots him

515
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,380
And then the

516
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,360
Roman centurion

517
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,940
Asks him if he

518
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,500
Wants another

519
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,860
Drink of water

520
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,140
That's the second

521
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,280
That's been going on

522
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,880
For how many

523
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,800
Thousands of years

524
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
Now the St. Stupid's

525
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,560
Day Parade

526
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,060
It'll be the

527
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,000
31st this year

528
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
Man

529
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,360
79

530
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,340
And I thought

531
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,220
I was tired of

532
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,560
X days

533
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,120
You can't even

534
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,900
Walk upstairs

535
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,740
And every year

536
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,360
He makes the

537
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,560
Point

538
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:13,940
Embarcadero

539
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,780
Biker

540
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,380
How many you

541
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,520
Got

542
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
How many you

543
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Got

544
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,000
How many you're

545
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,000
We've drilled

546
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
For X day

547
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,440
For

548
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,160
13 times

549
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,260
We are going

550
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,920
To strike

551
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
Greece

552
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
This year

553
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,960
I have faith

554
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,280
That this

555
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,800
This year

556
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,340
X day

557
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,260
Will be X day

558
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,520
12

559
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,060
Although technically

560
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,780
There were two

561
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,820
Drills

562
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,880
That we considered

563
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,460
Drills

564
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:37,940
Before

565
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,460
What we thought

566
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,840
Was July 5th

567
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,320
1998

568
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,040
Church business

569
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,800
Is very complicated

570
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,280
Isn't it

571
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,140
Tomorrow might be

572
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,840
July 5th

573
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,220
1998

574
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,700
For all we know

575
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,480
Listener

576
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:47,740
Really

577
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,900
And that doesn't

578
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,600
Matter where you're

579
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Listening from

580
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,800
Or what day

581
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,860
Or time it is

582
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,120
Because

583
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,680
We are lost

584
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,540
In time

585
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,980
Yeah that was

586
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,100
A very important

587
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,620
Part of our

588
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,680
Doctrine at the time

589
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,140
Was that

590
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,300
X day

591
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,780
Had actually

592
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,480
Happened

593
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,160
And

594
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,540
Everybody was

595
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,660
Confused about it

596
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,700
And we're all now

597
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,320
On the ships

598
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
Speeding our way

599
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
Into wherever the hell

600
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,440
We're going and stuff

601
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,540
Planet X

602
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,400
Planet X

603
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,900
Having everything

604
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,280
We want along the way

605
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,980
But we don't know it

606
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,740
We think

607
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,580
It didn't happen

608
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,300
So we think

609
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,900
We're still here

610
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,980
Doing this radio show

611
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,160
I know

612
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,960
Yeah it's complicated

613
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,420
You create your own reality

614
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,140
And unfortunately

615
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,000
The reality most people create

616
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,300
Is their cheesy apartment

617
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,960
Yeah

618
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,540
You know

619
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,260
Their crappy old

620
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
Comic book collection

621
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
And so forth

622
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,060
Bishop Joey was in town

623
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,140
To

624
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,920
To tell manly stories

625
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,040
About his adventures

626
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,700
As a mechanic

627
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,440
Aboard a diesel submarine

628
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,360
In the Pacific Ocean

629
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,460
Thousands of years ago

630
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,940
So this is a sub

631
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,460
Submarine

632
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Subgenius show

633
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,660
That's right

634
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,400
And there have been

635
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,740
A lot of subs in the news

636
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,140
Genius

637
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,760
Piloted by geniuses

638
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,020
Yeah the FBMers

639
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,120
Are bumping into each other

640
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,660
In the ocean

641
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,260
The other ones

642
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,900
Are bumping into

643
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,660
The other surface vessels

644
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,060
And then the space junk

645
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,000
Is bumping into each other

646
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,880
It's getting very

647
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,040
Very crowded out there

648
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,300
Wait until the space junk

649
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,360
Bumps into the submarine

650
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,580
Then we'll have come

651
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,400
Full circle

652
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,720
Man

653
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,780
Are the poor voices

654
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,940
Made angry by the

655
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,400
FBJ

656
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,060
Suffering

657
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,780
We're working on

658
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,040
We gotta

659
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,120
Yeah we're looking at that

660
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,520
Right now

661
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,200
We have somebody

662
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,700
Who's thinking

663
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,220
They're tuna fish

664
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes tuna fish

665
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,340
Yeah we have a tuna fish

666
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,300
Research council

667
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,060
That is

668
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,800
Hopefully will have

669
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,700
A reading for us tomorrow

670
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,900
So there's no problem

671
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,380
With the fish

672
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,200
The fish are happy

673
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,820
And what we do here

674
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,060
Content

675
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,680
First church of the last left

676
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,340
Submariner

677
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,580
Exposition

678
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,600
The fish have gone

679
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,300
Where the fish

680
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,080
Are supposed to go

681
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,620
Staying

682
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,880
Been relocated

683
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,440
So to speak

684
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,240
But they'll enjoy

685
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,140
Their new homes

686
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,740
In another

687
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,180
Terraformed environment

688
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,880
Well we had

689
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,620
The ocean

690
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,360
Is a whole

691
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,240
Another planet

692
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,400
That's twice as big

693
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,720
As the one we're used to

694
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,380
There's smokestack cities

695
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,160
Down under there

696
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,340
And big big titties

697
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,720
And everything

698
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,320
Just like it is up here

699
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,280
Only it isn't up here

700
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,500
Come on let's get wet

701
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:01,880
Let's get wet

702
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,000
We were watching that movie

703
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Mysterious Island

704
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,460
Last night

705
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,520
That was based on

706
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,180
Jules Verne

707
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,740
Jules Verne

708
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah

709
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,900
And you were showing

710
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,240
On your show today

711
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,120
You were showing that

712
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,580
Who's the guy who does that

713
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah

714
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
Who is that guy

715
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,880
Who's that guy

716
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,540
It wasn't George

717
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:15,960
Yeah

718
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
You know that guy

719
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,080
But it was a second

720
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,900
Another French dude

721
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,500
That did

722
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,840
Yeah

723
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,760
Amazing Jules Verne movie

724
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,860
Which I've seen on YouTube

725
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,520
And never elsewhere

726
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,620
Until your show

727
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,120
Bishop Joey really was

728
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,640
A sub

729
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,540
A bubble head

730
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:33,900
Genius

731
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,160
A bubble head

732
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,600
Bubble head

733
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,280
And I was a smoke boat

734
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,000
Bubble head

735
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
As well as being

736
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,140
A tea kettle

737
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,800
Bubble head

738
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,140
Smoke boat

739
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,000
Was the old diesel boat

740
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,560
And the tea kettle

741
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,500
Were the nuclear powered

742
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,060
Steam boat

743
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,020
So you have to differentiate

744
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,220
Or I'll kill you

745
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,840
Right right

746
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,900
No I got that impression

747
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,860
During the show

748
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,320
It's tradition

749
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,940
And you know

750
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,220
We had to

751
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,780
To stick with it

752
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,140
So you was

753
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,140
You was a bubble head

754
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,820
I was a bubble head

755
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah I was in the Navy

756
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,580
For seven years

757
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,220
That's right

758
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,200
And I told my little play here

759
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,700
Subhuman

760
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,280
Which I did

761
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,920
Is the story of how you

762
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,320
Choose going into

763
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
Why you know

764
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,460
And then what you choose to do

765
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,200
While you're in there

766
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,820
And what happens

767
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,880
And I had a little sea story

768
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,060
About my one cruise

769
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,400
And you know

770
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,260
It's slapstick

771
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,460
Philosophizing basically

772
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,800
With some sea jokes

773
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,160
And tattoo jokes

774
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,660
Thrown in

775
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,380
And toys

776
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,100
Toys

777
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,660
I got toys

778
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,540
He's got a

779
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,380
More toy

780
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,000
Little model

781
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,640
Submarines

782
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
Than anybody I ever saw

783
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
And he had a

784
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,080
A fish tank

785
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,240
In front of a television

786
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,180
The television was showing

787
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,000
Submarine movie clips

788
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
Of all ages

789
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,140
From the very beginning of time

790
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,660
To now

791
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,700
Every submarine movie

792
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,160
Carving the first submarine

793
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,960
Out of Iraq

794
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,340
Yeah

795
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,820
Yeah

796
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,060
And then he would

797
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,120
Occasionally demonstrate

798
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,740
Submarine failures

799
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,080
By dropping models

800
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,900
Into the tank

801
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,720
Where they would just

802
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
Sink straight to the bottom

803
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,300
Oh those baking powder ones

804
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,980
Are the coolest things

805
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:50,980


806
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:50,980


807
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,820
I've ever seen

808
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,400
That's right

809
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,800
That's right

810
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,260
We were shown

811
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,220
The magic submarine

812
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,780
And yeah

813
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,940
I demonstrated them

814
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,860
And I asked the audience

815
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,440
And I hold up

816
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,640
And I said

817
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,020
Remember these

818
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,440
And I go

819
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,380
What is it powered by

820
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,800
And somebody goes

821
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,560
Baking soda

822
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,120
No no no

823
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,100
You blow up

824
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,000
If it's baking soda

825
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,740
It's baking powder

826
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,720
But one show

827
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,200
I go

828
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,960
Oh yeah

829
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
So when I ask

830
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,220
For the seven C's

831
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,900
There's also

832
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,300
I think

833
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,380
I'll buy a drink

834
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,140
For anybody

835
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,800
Who can name

836
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,620
The seven C's

837
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,560
So I asked

838
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,580
The crowd

839
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,360
I think it was in

840
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,100
Berkeley or something

841
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,180
Maybe San Francisco

842
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,340
And he says

843
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,020
Can you name

844
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,760
The seven C's

845
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,420
And somebody says

846
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,640
Yes

847
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,140
Salad dressing

848
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,980
High C

849
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,940
And he won

850
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,200
So it's

851
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,900
So it doesn't work

852
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,400
All the time

853
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,140
I mean you try

854
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,280
I mean I know

855
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,840
But I'm honing it

856
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,720
And I think I can get

857
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,740
This show up to speed

858
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,380
By next year

859
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,640
If I just get a grant

860
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,020
Ed St. Joey

861
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,960
What are the

862
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,700
Who and what

863
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,960
Are the seven C's

864
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,180
The North Pacific

865
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,900
The South Pacific

866
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
The North Atlantic

867
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,620
The South Atlantic

868
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,500
The Antarctic

869
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:44,900
The Arctic

870
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,780
And the Indian

871
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,440
Indian I mean

872
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,200
By Indian Ocean

873
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,760
I mean dots

874
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,500
Not feathers

875
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,360
Well and then there's

876
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,980
The sea at the center

877
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,180
Of the so called

878
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,300
Center of the earth

879
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,240
The internal

880
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,120
Underground sea

881
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,560
Which Jules Verne

882
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,500
Also talked about

883
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,620
The Spondyland

884
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,160
The Spondyland

885
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,200
Did you know

886
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,800
That if you were

887
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
Actually to drop

888
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
A large object

889
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,780
Through the earth

890
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,360
It would go

891
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,760
Speed

892
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,800
Because of gravity

893
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640
All the way

894
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
All the way down

895
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,260
To the core

896
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,320
Of the earth

897
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,220
And as it

898
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,480
Approaches the earth

899
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


900
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:20,800
The core

901
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,900
Would start to slow down

902
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,420
Because the

903
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,520
Gravitational activity

904
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,180
Would catch up

905
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,880
So by the time

906
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,820
It would get to the other side

907
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,640
It would actually break

908
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,140
Through the surface

909
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,720
Of the other side

910
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,880
And then the

911
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,760
Gravitational pull

912
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,380
Would go the other way

913
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,680
And it would go

914
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,380
All the way back

915
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,660
Like a pendulum forever

916
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,140
That's why I keep seeing

917
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,620
These Chinese coins

918
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,160
Pop up out of my backyard

919
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,760
And then fall

920
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,620
Straight back down

921
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,700
And the gold doubloons

922
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,060
Little kids

923
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,420
Little kids in China

924
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,280
Would drop them off

925
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,140
The Chinese Empire

926
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,920
State Building

927
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
And they'd bore through

928
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
And come up in my backyard

929
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,360
Go up about six feet

930
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,240
And then fall right back

931
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,780
Down the hole

932
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,740
That they burned

933
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,480
So bizarre

934
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,040
You know they heat up

935
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,520
Quite a bit

936
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,380
Going through the core

937
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,960
That's because of

938
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,600
The baking powder

939
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,220
No soda

940
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,080
Don't use the soda

941
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,280
That'll blow your ass off

942
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,800
Exploder

943
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah

944
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,920
Exploder

945
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,820
Remember the exploder

946
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,340
Powders

947
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,320
And only use

948
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,920
Clabber girl

949
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,860
Clabber girl

950
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,960
Baking powder

951
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
When you just need

952
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,520
To have that submarine

953
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,720
Go right to the bottom

954
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,040
Clabber

955
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
Is that what they're

956
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,540
Calling them now

957
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,380
Clabber girls

958
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,760
Yeah

959
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,040
Yeah

960
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,480
Yeah

961
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,480


962
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,480


963
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah

964
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,820
Yeah go ahead

965
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,140
Check your prostitutes

966
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,200
Clabber girls

967
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,080
Well that was

968
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,360
Yeah

969
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
The insinuation

970
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,880
But it was nudge nudge

971
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,840
A wink

972
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,240
A wink

973
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,740
But at least I found

974
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,380
We're only trying to help

975
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,400
His friends

976
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,820
This station is here

977
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,520
To help

978
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah right

979
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah

980
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,800
Somebody was saying

981
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,460
The other day

982
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,520
On alt.slack

983
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,400
The only thing worse

984
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,820
Than an internet kook

985
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,240
Is an internet hero

986
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,220
But who is

987
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,200
Who's trying to help

988
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,260
Everybody else

989
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,480
Everybody else

990
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,040
Are there many of these now

991
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh that's

992
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,860
That's all it is

993
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,520
That's what the internet is

994
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,920
It's just

995
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,380
It's like

996
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,040
I know

997
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,160
It's real big out there

998
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,480
It's the kook soap

999
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,440
Soapbox

1000
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,740
But they all want to be heroes

1001
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,560
But the thing is

1002
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,860
Where the money to be made is

1003
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,140
Is with their sidekicks

1004
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,460
Cause side

1005
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,260
Every hero has to have a sidekick

1006
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,160
And there's a lot of people

1007
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,260
Who can't be heroes

1008
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,800
So the

1009
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:11,820
Berkeley

1010
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,760
Sidekick Institute

1011
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,720
Well and the same is true

1012
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Of minions

1013
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,260
For villains

1014
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,880
You know

1015
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,940
Berkeley sidekick

1016
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,440
Well that's how you start

1017
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,760
You start out

1018
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,680
You start out as a minion

1019
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,780
And then you graduate

1020
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,480
Or henchman

1021
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,020
Or henchman

1022
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,120
Well go to henchman maybe

1023
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,040
And then you go to

1024
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,060
Sidekick

1025
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,440
And then that's it

1026
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,200
That's the top of the line

1027
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,540
Cause only

1028
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,960
Only people who are

1029
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,940
In touch with their

1030
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,540
Inner number two

1031
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,700
Get to be sidekicks

1032
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,960
Oh well I've been in touch

1033
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,940
With my inner number two

1034
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,700
For a long time

1035
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,400
There's no compatriots

1036
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,220
No colleagues

1037
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,720
No

1038
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,620
Well it starts out

1039
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,340
With getting a hat

1040
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,380
You have to find your

1041
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,340
Character hat first

1042
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,820
That's the first

1043
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,940
My inner number two

1044
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,880
Was wiped away

1045
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,860
Yeah and then

1046
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,940
You need to get to your

1047
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,020
Your buzz phrase

1048
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,660
You know like

1049
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,220
You know

1050
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
Gosh darn it

1051
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,300
Or

1052
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,560
Gee willikers

1053
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,260
Mine was corn sarnit

1054
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,420
Corn sarnit

1055
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,000
Corn sarnit

1056
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,780
So that's patented

1057
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,660
You can't use that

1058
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,180
You have to come up

1059
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,700
With your own

1060
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,080
Jeepers

1061
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,000
So if I was like

1062
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,020
Your sidekick or something

1063
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,440
I could make a million bucks

1064
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,860
I was just like

1065
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,560
Screw you Joey

1066
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,920
Joey

1067
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,020
Buzz phrase

1068
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,000
Each buzz phrase

1069
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,540
Is guaranteed

1070
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Guaranteed six figure

1071
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,060
Income for life

1072
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,500
Wow

1073
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,240
Mine was

1074
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Was Jeepers

1075
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,940
When I was working

1076
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,480
Under Bob

1077
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs

1078
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,740
He would

1079
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,300
He would

1080
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,080
Make some

1081
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,720
Pronounce

1082
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,120
Announcements

1083
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,380
You know

1084
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,760
Look the volcano

1085
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,020
Is exploding

1086
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,860
And my line would be

1087
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,900
Jeepers

1088
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,920
And that was it

1089
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,440
Yeah well

1090
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
That's what I was there for

1091
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
To say Jeepers Bob

1092
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,140
Holy smokes

1093
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,900
Cuts through the drama

1094
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,520
And delivers a little

1095
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,840
You know

1096
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,820
Oh Philo was the one

1097
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,480
Who always got to say

1098
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,020
Holy smokes

1099
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,680
Holy smokes

1100
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,920
That was the good one

1101
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Because Bob had the pipe

1102
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,360
You know

1103
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,040
So everybody remembered

1104
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh holy smokes

1105
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,180
Nobody remembered Jeepers

1106
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,800
How about this one

1107
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,380
As cripes as my witness

1108
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,460
Cripes

1109
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,240
Cripes

1110
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,460
Cripes

1111
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,440
That'll work

1112
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,180
Yeah that'll work

1113
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,820
But you know

1114
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,460
St. Stupid said

1115
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,100
I know I know

1116
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,000
But you know you never know

1117
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,160
He said so far so what

1118
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,880
He said if it's the truth

1119
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,320
It's funny

1120
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,660
He said the closer you get

1121
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,320
The nearer you are

1122
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,980
But more importantly

1123
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,780
St. Stupid said

1124
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,500
Remember

1125
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,940
Don't forget

1126
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,840
No no no

1127
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,200
He said don't forget

1128
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,040
Remember

1129
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,480
I said remember don't forget

1130
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,680
Or don't forget

1131
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,580
Remember

1132
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,400
No no

1133
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,320
It's not

1134
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,400
I don't think it was

1135
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,960
Even either of the two

1136
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
Those who nay

1137
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Cannot sow

1138
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,660
We'll

1139
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,120
We'll get back to you on that

1140
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,680
It's one of them

1141
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,020
Close

1142
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,920
Close enough

1143
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,100
Forget you not

1144
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,200
Those who nay

1145
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,100
Cannot sow

1146
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
Which had something to do

1147
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,040
With the horses

1148
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,960
And Amish sewing machines

1149
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,460
And something

1150
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:29,880
Something

1151
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,620
Aren't we supposed to do

1152
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,320
Our puzzling evidence

1153
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,500
Homage right now

1154
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:32,880
Or something

1155
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
Puzzling evidence

1156
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Homage

1157
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,220
Are you

1158
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,500
You're gonna

1159
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,940
Who's puzzling evidence

1160
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,860
He'll hear that

1161
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,380
He'll know

1162
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,180
He'll know who

1163
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,780
Friends actually

1164
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,340
Bishop

1165
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,700
Bishop

1166
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,700


1167
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,700


1168
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,060
He'll know who's

1169
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,320
A regular

1170
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,520
Special

1171
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,500
Oh there I went

1172
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,020
I said it again

1173
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,820
He's a regular

1174
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,860
Guest

1175
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,560
On

1176
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,760
The puzzling evidence show

1177
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,120
You don't hear him there

1178
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,660
Every time

1179
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,620
But he

1180
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,960
Yeah I dropped an

1181
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,320
Obama

1182
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,600
So yeah

1183
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,820
Sometimes on the hour of slack

1184
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,480
You will

1185
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,680
You have heard

1186
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,080
Bishop Joey

1187
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,620
But it's hard to hear him

1188
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,760
Over Philo

1189
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,840
But that's kind of true

1190
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,520
Of everything

1191
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,080
Yeah

1192
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,320
Yeah

1193
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,240
He's inquisitive

1194
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,720
Yes

1195
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Philo is

1196
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,660
No

1197
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,700
Philo is declarative

1198
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,380
Ah

1199
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
And extremist

1200
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,900
Yeah

1201
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,600
And loud

1202
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,100
Yeah

1203
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,180
It's Philo

1204
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,600
And

1205
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,740
Hal

1206
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,380
And

1207
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,960
Doug Wellman

1208
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,620
Doug Wellman

1209
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,780
Yeah cause Doug Wellman's got

1210
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,080
Like about five tape machines

1211
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,520
Four

1212
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:40,920
You know

1213
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,780
Record players

1214
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,240
You know

1215
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,080
Six CD players

1216
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,660
You know

1217
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,580
And five microphones

1218
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,700
Open to the outside world

1219
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,640
All on his side

1220
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,300
Which he pots up and down

1221
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,580
To slather

1222
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,260
Everybody else

1223
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,320
Across the asonics

1224
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,580
Of Warfield

1225
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,540
Well he usually waits

1226
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,660
Until somebody is about

1227
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,180
To get to a really good punchline

1228
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,980
And that's when he

1229
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,200
Jacks them all up

1230
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,600
At once

1231
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:58,920
Yeah

1232
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,900
Or Philo jumps in

1233
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,960
Over everything

1234
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,880
But it's worth

1235
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,220
Tracking him down online

1236
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,880
There's people who catalog

1237
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,440
All these

1238
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,120
Puzzling evidence shows

1239
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,840
And you can go there

1240
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,000
And download them

1241
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,640
To your iPod

1242
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,340
And yeah

1243
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,660
And walk through the streets

1244
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,640
With a smile on your face

1245
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,420
The easiest way

1246
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,140
To find him

1247
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,760
Is through

1248
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,920
What about us

1249
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,300
Philo's website

1250
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,560
Quibble

1251
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,680
Quiveringbrain.com

1252
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,140
Oh yeah

1253
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,620
Must see

1254
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,000
Quiveringbrain.com

1255
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
Leads to links

1256
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,440
To the puzzling evidence show

1257
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,860
So does subgenius.com

1258
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,960
Leads to

1259
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,740
If you look for the radio part

1260
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,880
You click on the big button

1261
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,820
On the first page

1262
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,780
That says radio

1263
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,520
I've actually had people go

1264
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,480
I never can find

1265
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,360
Where your show is

1266
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,140
On your website

1267
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,320
It's like the fourth word

1268
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,680
Down from the top

1269
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,000
The one that says radio

1270
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,600
HOS

1271
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
For our slack

1272
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:46,940
Anyway

1273
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,880
Yes they're all there

1274
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,280
And Reverend Susie

1275
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,560
The Philly

1276
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,100
Lousy's show

1277
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,860
On WREK in Atlanta

1278
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,360
And the

1279
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,800
The Ministry of Slack

1280
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,620
Which is now

1281
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,580
A podcast

1282
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,440
And Bob's Golden Stream

1283
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,980
That's another podcast

1284
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,800
Oh nice

1285
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,340
These are ones

1286
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,460
That have never been mentioned

1287
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,100
On this show before

1288
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,640
Let's get them out

1289
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,080
Let's get them out

1290
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,580
And I won't

1291
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,420
I don't make any

1292
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,260
I can advertise

1293
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,720
These other subgenius shows

1294
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,360
Because I don't make

1295
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,440
Any money off of them

1296
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,520
See the way

1297
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,700
These stations

1298
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,480
Are set up

1299
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,140
You're not allowed

1300
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,840
To talk about things

1301
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,360
That would make

1302
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,560
Money off of them

1303
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
Money like X-Day

1304
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,060
July 5th

1305
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,560
Extermination

1306
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Or Dragon Con

1307
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,420
Coming up

1308
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:25,980
We're going to be

1309
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,760
At Dragon Con

1310
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,900
Apparently in Atlanta

1311
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,520
Not apparently

1312
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,100
We're definitely

1313
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,920
There's going to be

1314
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,220
A big subgenius show

1315
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,460
At Dragon Con

1316
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,200
With Tesla Coil

1317
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,900
Concert

1318
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,220
There's this group

1319
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,060
What are they called

1320
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,900
Arc something

1321
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,300
They make music

1322
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,940
Using Tesla coils

1323
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,760
Have you ever seen

1324
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,660
The YouTube effect

1325
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,020
Yeah

1326
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,180
It's the one I saw

1327
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,660
They did the

1328
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,800
Super Mario Brothers

1329
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,180
Thing

1330
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,700
And it's

1331
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,540
There's no speech

1332
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,060
Speakers involved

1333
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,520
But they can tune

1334
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,000
The

1335
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
Of a Tesla coil

1336
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,040
To a high

1337
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,920
So run by a computer

1338
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,680
You can actually

1339
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,600
Do the Darth Vader theme

1340
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,340
Make your Tesla sing

1341
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,240
And they trust

1342
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,460
Those Tesla coils

1343
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,260
So that's going to be

1344
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,840
The band

1345
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,920
Interspersed

1346
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
With the subgenius

1347
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,400
Devival

1348
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,320
At Dragon Con

1349
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,020
In Atlanta

1350
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,140
In September

1351
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,480
Sounds like a tasteful night

1352
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,360
As a man

1353
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
You can imagine

1354
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,220
The comic book conventions

1355
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,520
Are very very tasty

1356
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:19,820
And very graceful

1357
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,000
When we first

1358
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Bumped into

1359
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,380
Gwar there

1360
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,120
In an elevator

1361
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Hey man

1362
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,560
I'm Nikolai Tesla

1363
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,000
I invented a lot of things

1364
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,980
A long time ago

1365
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,640
But nobody paid me no mind

1366
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,600
In fact that guy

1367
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,960
Edison

1368
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Well yeah

1369
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,460
You know what happened

1370
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,360
I was going to free

1371
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,700
The people with free energy

1372
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,740
I was going to bring it down

1373
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,340
Like rain

1374
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,440
Yeah

1375
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,620
There was going to be

1376
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,360
No more trouble

1377
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,500
And no more trouble

1378
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,020
No more pain

1379
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,300
But that time

1380
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,020
Good dish

1381
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,980
Was really

1382
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm sorry

1383
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,820
Yeah

1384
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,380
It was the first time

1385
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,220
We were playing

1386
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,700
With real anti-magnetics

1387
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,300
Who knew a whole forest

1388
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,060
Was going to blow

1389
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,160
Perhaps thousands

1390
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,420
Of Eskimos were lost

1391
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,520
But I didn't care

1392
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,140
At the time

1393
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,320
Maybe a weapon would sell

1394
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,940
Because you know

1395
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,680
She left me

1396
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,220
And I

1397
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,440
Been wandering around

1398
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,000
Romania

1399
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,840
Or was it

1400
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,640
Yugoslavia

1401
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,720
Man where was I from

1402
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,000
I

1403
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,860
Oh wait

1404
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,480
I'm an American

1405
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,980
No I

1406
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,500
Oh baby

1407
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,260
Why'd you do this

1408
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,680
Yeah I keep seeing her

1409
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,380
In my mind

1410
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,460
And free energy too

1411
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,220
The Nikola Tesla Blues

1412
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,500
And he could

1413
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,280
Make magicians

1414
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,540
Duplicate themselves

1415
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,800
Strange

1416
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,620
Strange

1417
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,020
Post-modernist

1418
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,760
Horror movies

1419
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,180
Yeah well

1420
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,200
I don't know

1421
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,720
That's what it takes

1422
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,580
Nikola Tesla

1423
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,380
Played by David Bowie

1424
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,080
He was played by David Bowie

1425
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,120
Yes

1426
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,180
In The Prestige

1427
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,100
Oh I thought it was

1428
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,740
The man who fell

1429
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,680
From the earth up

1430
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,060
Yeah that was

1431
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,840
The man who threw up

1432
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,320
On the earth

1433
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,180
Yeah the man who

1434
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,160
Threw up on the earth

1435
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,560
Yeah so we can turn down

1436
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,640
The porno music background

1437
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,500
You know that's the only

1438
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,780
Dependable background music

1439
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,360
For this show

1440
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Always works for everything

1441
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,100
The 70s porno music

1442
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,740
Porno movie music

1443
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,420
Yeah yeah

1444
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,500
Can't beat the classics

1445
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,980
Yeah

1446
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,120
Always works

1447
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,100
And everybody remembers it

1448
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,500
You know

1449
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,560
They've heard it a million times

1450
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,920
And sort of in the background

1451
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,600
Of their lives

1452
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,260
Well

1453
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,260
You could even have

1454
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,500
Dinosaur narratives

1455
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,780
Over the top of it

1456
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,700
It just works

1457
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,120
It's that kind of stuff

1458
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,840
But that's not what

1459
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,740
You two are about

1460
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,060
You two are about

1461
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,380
Illuminating

1462
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,340
Elucidating

1463
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,740
And then lubricating

1464
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,960
The minds of the

1465
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,520
I hate that man

1466
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,820
Who the hell are you trying to

1467
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,640
I thought

1468
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,120
I always thought

1469
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,560
You two

1470
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,340
I always thought

1471
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,220
Here's my

1472
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,820
Here's my

1473
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,940
My two word review of you two

1474
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,200
Them two

1475
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,700
How's that?

1476
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,060
Them are two

1477
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,760
That's what I think of you two

1478
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
And it's

1479
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,220
It's not

1480
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,080
It is personal

1481
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,520
It's personal

1482
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,120
They

1483
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,700
They squashed

1484
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,600
Negative land

1485
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Like a bug

1486
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,100
That's right

1487
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,700
They should be

1488
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,480
They really should be

1489
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,340
They proved they couldn't

1490
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,040
Take a joke

1491
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,260
Yeah

1492
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,200
They didn't listen

1493
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,100
To their lawyers

1494
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,000
Or no they did listen

1495
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,500
To their lawyers

1496
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,120
They did

1497
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,000
They didn't care

1498
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,520
What their lawyers were doing

1499
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:18,800
Like that's what they did

1500
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,760
That's what it amounted to

1501
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,380
They were too busy

1502
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,640
Saving the world

1503
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,220
Oh yes

1504
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,020
From people making fun

1505
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,720
Of you two

1506
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,600
That may be kind of

1507
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,260
An inside joke

1508
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,960
For some people

1509
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,880
Who don't remember

1510
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,040
A thousand years ago

1511
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,740
When you two

1512
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,660
Sued our friends

1513
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,460
At negative land

1514
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,040
For making an album

1515
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,760
That made fun of them

1516
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,780
Just because the album

1517
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,140
Looked exactly like

1518
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,500
It was the new you two album

1519
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,540
Which was also scheduled

1520
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,680
I can see why

1521
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,500
The record companies

1522
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,160
Got stirred up

1523
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,580
But still

1524
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,940
Now you can download it

1525
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,500
You can go and download

1526
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,520
That new

1527
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,100
That negative land album

1528
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,080
You can download it online

1529
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,920
And listen in the privacy

1530
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,280
Don't let Bono

1531
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,400
Know that you're listening

1532
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,860
Right

1533
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,260
Because Bono knows everything

1534
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,100
Bono cannot take a joke man

1535
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,000
And it's church scripture

1536
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
That you must be fornicating

1537
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,680
If you can't take one

1538
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,200
I have trouble

1539
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,640
Getting a Bono anymore

1540
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,020
But he won't answer

1541
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,900
Our phone calls

1542
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,660
We've tried to get him

1543
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,120
On the show

1544
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,720
But

1545
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,660
He's changed

1546
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,560
He's changed

1547
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:18,780
Yeah

1548
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,680
Lost his edge

1549
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
You know

1550
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,960
The funny thing is

1551
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
I probably would not recognize

1552
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,020
A you two song

1553
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,640
That's how

1554
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
How removed I am

1555
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,120
From pop culture

1556
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,480
There's a

1557
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,420
Oh the ones that

1558
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,960
The negative land made fun of

1559
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,580
It's like

1560
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,340
That's how I know

1561
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,000
That's all the pop culture I know

1562
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,520
It's from cartoons

1563
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,340
Mad magazine

1564
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,500
And nowadays

1565
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,060
The Onion

1566
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,420
The only way I keep up

1567
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,560
With what people are watching

1568
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,260
On TV is

1569
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,100
By The Onion

1570
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,340
That's how you get your news

1571
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,240
And take offs

1572
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,560
That's how you get your news

1573
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,140
Those idiotic comments

1574
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,920
You were making earlier

1575
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,780
About the economy

1576
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,600
Proves that

1577
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,460
All you'd read

1578
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,420
Are satire magazines

1579
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,800
There's not

1580
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,620
Like what was the one thing

1581
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:56,640
That was in The Onion

1582
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,980
You would go completely nuts

1583
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,500
If you

1584
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,540
That's not real

1585
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,680
What?

1586
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,980
The headline of The Onion

1587
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,780
That you were reading

1588
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,860
Earlier about the economy

1589
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,380
That's

1590
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,120
It's like a joke thing

1591
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,780
That's what I'm trying to tell you

1592
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,440
It's

1593
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,020
They're making a joke

1594
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,720
No it's a newspaper

1595
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,680
Yeah it is a newspaper

1596
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,820
It folds and everything

1597
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,900
And it has words on it

1598
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,460
But that is not a real newspaper

1599
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,200
It's not a real newspaper

1600
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,840
In that

1601
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,240
It transmits

1602
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,360
Some degree of truth

1603
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,380
Or what really happened

1604
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,980
How can they print it

1605
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,780
If it's not true?

1606
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,520
Because

1607
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,540
It's printed

1608
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,420
The machine that prints

1609
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,720
Works all the time

1610
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,140
Whether it's the truth or not

1611
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,980
Just like the church

1612
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,960
Of the subgenius

1613
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,440
I don't get it

1614
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,980
I don't understand

1615
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,300
What you're trying to get at

1616
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,540
I'm

1617
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm saying

1618
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,820
There's something here

1619
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,940
That I do not understand

1620
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,880
It's like Bob

1621
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,780
It's not real

1622
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,260
There's a pain

1623
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,280
Between my ears

1624
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,700
It's fake

1625
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,460
It's phony

1626
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,220
Oh that

1627
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,240
Oh oh oh

1628
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,900
Oh okay

1629
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,180
Oh oh oh

1630
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,960
I understand that

1631
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,020
I understand that part

1632
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,360
Sure

1633
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
Okay moving on

1634
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,320
The con

1635
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,400
The con

1636
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,160
The big con

1637
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,800
Yeah

1638
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,180
Yeah pledge allegiance

1639
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,260
To the illusion

1640
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,360
And to the pyramid scheme

1641
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,460
For which it stands

1642
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,140
One nation

1643
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,160
In denial

1644
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
One species in denial

1645
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,740
With error and excess

1646
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,620
By all

1647
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,520
Thank you

1648
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:10,980
Thank you

1649
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,440
Thank you

1650
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,900
Well

1651
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,320
I guess we're all

1652
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,040
In the same stew

1653
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,720
Thinking about

1654
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,780
Where America's heading

1655
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,680
And the global

1656
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,840
Globalism is too

1657
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,400
Is of it

1658
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,500
It's getting

1659
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,280
It's getting globular

1660
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,120
Globular

1661
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,520
It's globular man

1662
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:25,900
Yeah

1663
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,820
It's like

1664
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,720
It's like if your eye

1665
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,580
Act loco

1666
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,400
Think globular

1667
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,780
Whatever that was

1668
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,640
Act globular

1669
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,040
And think

1670
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,820
Loco

1671
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,160
Yeah

1672
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,120
Act globular

1673
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,860
Think loco

1674
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,040
Act globular

1675
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,820
Think loco

1676
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,940
No think globular

1677
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,660
Act loco

1678
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,660
That's what it was

1679
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,980
I think

1680
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,120
Or am I just acting

1681
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,720
God

1682
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,680
Stop

1683
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,400
It gets so confusing

1684
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,540
Stop

1685
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,160
You must think

1686
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,780
You must think

1687
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,400
You must think

1688
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,580
You must think

1689
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,600
You must think

1690
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,600


1691
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,600


1692
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,600


1693
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,400
We'll rewind it later

1694
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,940
Listen to it

1695
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,500
And figure it out

1696
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,140
Just keep moving

1697
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,880
How'd that turtle

1698
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,080
Get on top of that post

1699
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,600
How'd that turtle

1700
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,000
Get in my pants man

1701
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,980
What is that turtle

1702
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,240
Doing to that tennis shoe

1703
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,640
The turtle on the post

1704
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,020
Go ahead

1705
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,100
You finish that one

1706
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,380
Okay

1707
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,580
No there was

1708
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,440
Princess Weebs

1709
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,120
Recently

1710
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,820
Found on the internet

1711
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,900
There's an amusing

1712
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,900
Video of a

1713
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,820
Turtle attempting

1714
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,720
To have sex

1715
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,900
With a tennis shoe

1716
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,700
Many of the

1717
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:17,960
Of them

1718
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,540
Many

1719
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:18,820
What

1720
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,400
Many videos

1721
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,440
So it's a real common

1722
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,220
So the

1723
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,100
Masturbating chimpanzees

1724
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,440
Are out

1725
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
This decade

1726
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,880
Yes

1727
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,700
That's so

1728
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,140
So last year

1729
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,420
Yeah

1730
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,080
So 2001

1731
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,640
I've waited so long

1732
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,660
To be able to say that

1733
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,440
That is so 2001

1734
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,340
I mean

1735
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:37,640
You know

1736
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:37,760
I

1737
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,060
2001 came out

1738
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,660
The movie

1739
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,040
2001

1740
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,920
Came out in

1741
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,680
1969

1742
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,100
Or 68

1743
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,680
Imagine

1744
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,820
Imagine the mind

1745
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,260
Blown

1746
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,680
By a

1747
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:47,880
Yeah

1748
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,120
And my mom

1749
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,900
Took me

1750
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,760
And my brother

1751
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
To go see

1752
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,080
We got scared

1753
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,980
We got scared

1754
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,040
When the monkeys

1755
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,640
Started banging

1756
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,260
On the bones

1757
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,800
And stuff

1758
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,280
And there was

1759
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,460
That big scary thing

1760
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,100
That was like

1761
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,720
We were real scared

1762
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,240
And we thought

1763
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,140
It was on the moon

1764
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,940
And so were the monkeys

1765
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,740
Man we were confused

1766
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,540
At those days

1767
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,240
And now that music

1768
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,580
Is just instantly

1769
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,780
A laugh generator

1770
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,580
Yep

1771
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,240
What used to be

1772
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,080
The most moving

1773
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,300
Powerful

1774
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,420
Stretch of music

1775
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,620
Thus spake

1776
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,700
Zarathustra

1777
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,420
Is now a comedy

1778
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:19,860
King

1779
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,380
Thanks to that

1780
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,560
Thus spake

1781
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,620
20th century's

1782
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,100
PR department

1783
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,640
Or did we already

1784
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,260
Talk about this

1785
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,880
Last week

1786
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,960
I think it was

1787
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,620
Three weeks ago

1788
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,240
I saw another

1789
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,580
Medium

1790
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,240
Platform or

1791
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,820
Different medium

1792
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,820
An actual medium

1793
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,020
It was another

1794
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
Vehicle

1795
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,780
A vesicle

1796
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,900
This is like

1797
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,500
Deja news

1798
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,100
A tube

1799
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,620
It was another tube

1800
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,080
We got sucked

1801
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,920
Into it then

1802
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,280
Yeah

1803
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,600
And we're coming

1804
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,360
Out the other end

1805
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,700
What if the tube

1806
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:47,700


1807
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:47,700


1808
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,600
You tube

1809
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,880
Then there's red tube

1810
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,060
That's all porno

1811
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,820
Free porno

1812
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,020
Amateur porno stuff

1813
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,240
I couldn't understand

1814
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,860
The name

1815
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,760
Why would they call it

1816
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,340
Red tube

1817
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,420
I just don't get it

1818
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,620
I've thought about that

1819
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,260
Over and over again

1820
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,100
What would that have to do

1821
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,560
With porno

1822
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,980
Gosh

1823
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,200
They're giving away

1824
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,040
Free porno now

1825
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
Why don't I hear about this

1826
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,000
No it's true

1827
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,660
There's free porno

1828
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,120
On the internet

1829
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,500
You don't have to

1830
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,560
Give them your credit cards

1831
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,520
I just gave

1832
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,100
I just advertised them

1833
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,980
Red tube

1834
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,440
Wow

1835
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,260
Okay well

1836
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,500
Who's got a computer

1837
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,300
You know

1838
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,480
There's a whole string

1839
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,380
Of them in front of me

1840
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,260
I never use them

1841
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,960
In this station

1842
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,900
They don't need

1843
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,340
The real DJs

1844
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,240
Like Dr. Sinister

1845
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,020
He'll come in here

1846
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,760
And he can

1847
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,240
Actually look at

1848
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,940
All the listeners

1849
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,640
Through the different

1850
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,940
Monitors and so forth

1851
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,580
You guys can do that

1852
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,500
At KPFA too

1853
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:37,620
Yeah

1854
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,900
But I just

1855
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,080
I'm pure

1856
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,620
You know

1857
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm old school

1858
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,500
Yeah a lot of people

1859
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,000
Talk about you

1860
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,540
I'm from the days

1861
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,040
When radio was just noise

1862
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,100
Just sound

1863
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,440
Right

1864
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:47,880
Yeah

1865
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,920
And it was like

1866
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,820
Pedal powered too

1867
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,440
Yeah

1868
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,220
When you go

1869
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,860
Looking for porn

1870
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,080
We used

1871
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,460
We took turns

1872
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,900
We'd

1873
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,940
Like if it was

1874
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,340
The old days

1875
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,240
Dave would pedal

1876
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,760
For a while

1877
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,520
And I'd talk

1878
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,820
And then Dave would talk

1879
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,540
While I pedaled

1880
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,140
Because otherwise

1881
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,600
You were like

1882
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
And then

1883
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,720
Bob said

1884
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,000
It just didn't work

1885
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
I don't want to be

1886
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,900
The gerbil in a cage tonight

1887
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,660
If you listen to

1888
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,020
Some of those

1889
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,220
Old Bob and Ray routines

1890
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,940
You can tell

1891
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,900
They're having to trade off

1892
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,100
Oh yeah

1893
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,460
You got goon shows

1894
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,380
The old goon show

1895
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,800
Yes

1896
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,220
They all trade off

1897
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,640
And we all rip them off

1898
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,420
They sweat

1899
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,260
They swap spit

1900
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,880
They swap perspiration

1901
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
They collaborate more

1902
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,460
Than you can imagine

1903
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,400
In different special events

1904
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,180
In outer space

1905
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,240
Equality

1906
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,080
Eternity

1907
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,320
Liquidity

1908
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,920
Liquidity

1909
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,300
Yeah

1910
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,800
They're very lucrative

1911
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,820
In outer space

1912
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,960
They've gone on

1913
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,740
To the other side

1914
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,560
But the other side

1915
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,140
Has some things going for it

1916
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,160
Big butts

1917
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,340
Plenty of

1918
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:47,660
Dough

1919
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,600
That's right

1920
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,040
You can make a lot of money

1921
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,700
Being dead

1922
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,220
Just think of it

1923
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,320
Hendrix sure did

1924
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,700
Man he did so much better

1925
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,360
After he died

1926
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,060
A lot of those

1927
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,260
Rock stars

1928
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,040
They wouldn't even be

1929
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,760
In the rock and roll

1930
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,360
Hall of fame

1931
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,180
If they hadn't died

1932
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,880
No taxes

1933
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
They get their own room

1934
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,240
Now since they're dead

1935
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,100
No rent

1936
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,000
No utility bills

1937
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,940
No production costs

1938
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,020
Everything you did before

1939
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,160
Is mixed a thousand

1940
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,800
Different ways

1941
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,020
Just think of it

1942
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,980
You're immortal

1943
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,280
But you're not

1944
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,440
You're a mortal

1945
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:17,440


1946
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,940
You're a lump of slime

1947
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,880
But you're immortal

1948
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,820
You look the way you did

1949
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,040
When you were 24 man

1950
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,340
Those dimples are sticking out

1951
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,900
You know what's really sad

1952
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,060
Is that everything we say

1953
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,820
On these dumb shows

1954
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,100
Is immortal too

1955
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,800
Somebody will have a copy

1956
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,720
There'll be some copy

1957
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,080
Floating around on the internet

1958
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,200
And every day

1959
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,720
I thank the fates

1960
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,740
That the internet

1961
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,520
Wasn't invented

1962
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,420
When I was a young man

1963
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,260
Because then every stupid thing

1964
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,980
I ever said

1965
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,060
Would have been recorded

1966
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,700
It's bad enough

1967
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,100
You know

1968
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,120
When I'm 70

1969
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,140
I'm going to have to listen

1970
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,780
Back to myself

1971
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,860
At age 55

1972
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,100
Involuntarily

1973
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,480
Going

1974
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,100
God

1975
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,360
How could I have been

1976
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,900
So immature

1977
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,060
There's no end to it

1978
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,460
Apparently

1979
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,240
No

1980
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,600
Foolishness

1981
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,560
Just changes

1982
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,100
Its character

1983
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,820
And color

1984
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,440
A little bit

1985
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,340
As the years go on

1986
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,560
It begets more

1987
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,400
But you'll always

1988
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,180
Be doing something

1989
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,060
You'll be embarrassed

1990
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,720
About later

1991
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,340
Kids

1992
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,120
You hear that?

1993
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,780
Think you're cool now?

1994
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Wait until you're 40

1995
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,700
And play back a tape

1996
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,160
Of last night's party

1997
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,220
Wait until you're 80

1998
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,440
In the hospice there

1999
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:29,920
And you're walking

2000
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,860
Down the steps

2001
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,220
And you break your pelvis

2002
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,620
With your colostomy bag

2003
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,180
In at the same time

2004
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,020
And you'll be laughing

2005
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,960
Your socks off

2006
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,700
But those are those

2007
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,100
Little ridgy blue socks

2008
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,340
They make you wear

2009
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,060
And you'll be laughing

2010
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,100
Oh, that's all right

2011
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,420
We're just

2012
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,740
We're all reincarnated again

2013
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,540
So it doesn't matter

2014
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,140
We just

2015
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,220
I don't believe

2016
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,840
I don't believe

2017
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,960
In reincarnation

2018
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,920
Oh, you don't have to

2019
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,160
They just reincarnate you anyway

2020
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,820
I believe in reincarnality

2021
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,100
That's doctrinal

2022
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,860
You get to have

2023
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,820
The second helping of meat

2024
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,560
Yeah

2025
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,020
Yeah

2026
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,720
Going for more?

2027
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,440
Well, Pappy

2028
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,160
What was it

2029
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,940
Pappy would say

2030
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,640
My father

2031
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,000
Loves to get into

2032
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,900
Religious arguments

2033
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,720
With anybody

2034
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,020
And he'll

2035
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,620
He'll fight for any side

2036
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,800
Jesus or the devil

2037
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,400
Or Mohammed

2038
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,880
Or whatever

2039
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,500
He knows

2040
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,260
He knows them all

2041
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,060
And I don't even know

2042
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,580
What it was

2043
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,320
He was talking about

2044
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,400
I remembered

2045
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,660
What Pappy said

2046
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,480
That was so cosmic

2047
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,960
He said

2048
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,240
I know what

2049
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,840
The afterlife is like

2050
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,540
It's just exactly like

2051
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,680
Before I was born

2052
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,860
Remember when

2053
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,260
Before you were born?

2054
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,280
Staying on the mountain

2055
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,860
It was

2056
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,260
Staying was on the mountaintop

2057
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,900
He was

2058
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,760
And he

2059
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,860
But no

2060
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,120
No, no

2061
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,180
Stang never made it

2062
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,920
He made

2063
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,800
Stang made it to where

2064
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,240
He could peak over the mountaintop

2065
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,080
But he never got any

2066
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,720
And everybody else

2067
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,060
Got to ski down the slope

2068
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,060
Others were peaking

2069
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,620
And Stang was just peeing

2070
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,140
Down the mountain

2071
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,160
What was it

2072
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,320
The cosmic

2073
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,720
Well, one cosmic thing

2074
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
My father said was

2075
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,500
I believe whatever I want

2076
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,880
Whatever I need to believe

2077
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,540
That was it

2078
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,580
I believe whatever

2079
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,840
I need to believe

2080
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,200
I thought

2081
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,680
My God

2082
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,500
That sums up

2083
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,720
All human nature

2084
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,940
In one sentence

2085
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,580
That's right

2086
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:19,840
Yep

2087
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,400
Survive

2088
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,440
Believe whatever I need to believe

2089
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,760
The utilitarian beliefs of Pappy's

2090
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,500
Yeah

2091
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,040
Yep

2092
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,320
Just enough Jesus

2093
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,500
To keep a smile on my face

2094
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,060
And just enough Satan

2095
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,480
To keep an erection

2096
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,720
Pappy

2097
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,420
Teaches a Bible class

2098
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,180
That's when he teaches

2099
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,220
To little girls

2100
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,300
In Stangville, Texas

2101
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,440
And he

2102
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,480
Specializes in Bible class

2103
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,480


2104
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,880
In teaching them

2105
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,360
The contradictory parts

2106
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,120
Of the Bible

2107
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,720
Or the nightmarishly

2108
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,920
Fiendish and sadistic parts

2109
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,680
You know, like

2110
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,100
The smite and smote chapters

2111
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,200
Yeah, yeah

2112
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,900
When the school children

2113
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,400
Made fun of the bald pate

2114
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,080
Of the prophet

2115
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,840
And so

2116
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,460
And she-bear came

2117
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,500
And tore the children

2118
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,580
And rended

2119
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,500
Rent them

2120
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,820
Well, it's only fair, isn't it?

2121
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,200
Come on

2122
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,860
For making

2123
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,480
Well, it was

2124
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,620
It was okay to make fun

2125
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,960
Of some bald-headed people

2126
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,440
Yeah

2127
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,440
But not prophets

2128
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,120
Not a guy with a bear

2129
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,040
Not a guy with a

2130
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,460
Yeah, with an she-bear

2131
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,720
Or two

2132
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,520
Hidden in the woods

2133
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,760
Hmm

2134
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,280
Well, that's why

2135
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,840
The First Church

2136
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,420
And the Last Lap

2137
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,140
World's fastest-growing

2138
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,620
Snag religion

2139
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,920
100% less dogma

2140
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,380
To light religion

2141
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,260
One holy day a year

2142
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,320
Today is not it

2143
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,500
Is there for you

2144
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,000
That's right

2145
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,520
The First Church

2146
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,200
And the Last Lap

2147
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,640
Offers you

2148
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,120
A two-dimensional

2149
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,260
Spiritual scapegoat

2150
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,240
So next time

2151
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,080
You slam your

2152
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,460
Dog's tail

2153
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,100
In the refrigerator

2154
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,600
You lock your

2155
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,680
Sports car keys

2156
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,380
Inside your

2157
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,020
Sports car

2158
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,300
Don't blame yourself

2159
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,500
Just go to

2160
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
SaintStupid.com

2161
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,060
That's S-A-I-N-T-S-T-U-P-I

2162
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,920
Whatever

2163
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,560
Dot com

2164
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,640
And you can

2165
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,320
Gaze upon his visage

2166
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,980
The two-dimensional

2167
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,360
Spiritual scapegoat

2168
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,080
Will relieve you

2169
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,060
Of your stupidity

2170
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,580
That's right

2171
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,100
And then

2172
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,740
Only one holy day a year

2173
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,380
And it's April 1st

2174
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:05,700
Noon

2175
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,440
The Embarcadero Plaza

2176
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,000
San Francisco

2177
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,800
For the 31st Annual Parade

2178
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,920
So if you can't be there

2179
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,600
Be somewhere else

2180
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,260
Now, the First Church

2181
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,120
Of the Last Lap

2182
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,400
Has

2183
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,260
Saint Stupid

2184
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,340
And just as the church

2185
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,080
Of the subgenius

2186
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,600
Has Bob

2187
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,680
Or really vice versa

2188
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,060
But

2189
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,860
Now Bob

2190
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,000
Is a fully

2191
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,380
Half-toned

2192
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,280
Fleshed out

2193
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,560
Deity of

2194
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,520
Luck

2195
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,560
And brainlessness

2196
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,840
Whereas Saint Stupid

2197
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,720
As a logo head

2198
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,380
Is a rather

2199
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,200
Crudely rendered

2200
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,680
Line drawing

2201
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,020
Looks like a

2202
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,040
Five-year-old

2203
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,580
Drew him

2204
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,800
He kind of looks like

2205
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,000
A KKK member

2206
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,160
With a silly grin

2207
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,160
Well, the original

2208
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,740
Saint Stupid

2209
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,300
In 1979

2210
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,960
Was an engraving

2211
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,540
Out of a German

2212
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,120
Medical text

2213
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,540
Of a hydrocephalic child

2214
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,260
About this high

2215
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,120
And it was

2216
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,340
An old-time engraving

2217
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,120
Turn of the century

2218
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,640
The other century kids

2219
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,360
I've got one

2220
00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,920
Two hearts

2221
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,140
And it had a pointy head

2222
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,260
And a beatific smile

2223
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,860
So that was

2224
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,800
The original Saint Stupid

2225
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,640
Because I was reading

2226
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,560
About the Feast of Fools

2227
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,400
And there's this history

2228
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,720
About deformities

2229
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,260
Back there

2230
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,660
And so this head

2231
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,100
Would have been

2232
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,900
Looked upon as holy

2233
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,360
And also I was reading

2234
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,680
Jane Roberts

2235
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,940
Seth Speaks

2236
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,640
Remember those books?

2237
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,140
Oh yeah, yeah

2238
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:16,540
Yeah, yeah

2239
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,600
And she was describing

2240
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,140
You know

2241
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,120
The alternate reality

2242
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,460
Through this Seth guy

2243
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:20,960
But occasionally

2244
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,900
She would go into

2245
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,820
A higher trance

2246
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,780
In a being

2247
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,080
Several levels up

2248
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,600
In consciousness

2249
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,500
Higher than Seth?

2250
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,360
Higher than Seth

2251
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,460
That's pretty high, dude

2252
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,440
So high

2253
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,280
That all the energy

2254
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,820
That manifests

2255
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,980
Our reality

2256
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,020
Is but a thought

2257
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,080
In that being's mind

2258
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,820
And when that being

2259
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,320
Talks through Jane Roberts

2260
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,900
And Jane Roberts' husband

2261
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,680
Is writing it down

2262
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,240
A cone of light

2263
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,900
Forms above her head

2264
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,020
And she speaks

2265
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,000
In a monotone

2266
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,660
Not unlike

2267
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,020
The Saturday Night Live

2268
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,240
Convergence

2269
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,380
Which was going on

2270
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,700
At the same time

2271
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,740
Destiny?

2272
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,500
I don't think so

2273
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,940
So that was the first one

2274
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,840
But then the next year

2275
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,560
I couldn't find it

2276
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,140
So I sat down

2277
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,760
With a brush pen

2278
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,060
And went

2279
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,720
It looks like this

2280
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,260
It looks like this

2281
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,200
I drew about seven of them

2282
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,880
On a piece of paper

2283
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,940
Threw them away

2284
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,820
Went no, that's not it

2285
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,800
Then I had to send out

2286
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,260
The flyer

2287
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,040
So I went to the garbage

2288
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,540
Pulled it up

2289
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,320
And says this'll do

2290
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,400
And so the brush pen

2291
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,800
Version of St. Stupid

2292
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,920
Then became the logo

2293
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,120
And it really

2294
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,100
Maximized our profit margins

2295
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,980
Quite considerably

2296
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,060
Well, I can tell you

2297
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,360
It takes a lot more ink

2298
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,000
To do those

2299
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,800
Half-tone dots

2300
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,880
On Bob's face

2301
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,060
I know

2302
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,400
It's like

2303
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
You know, we can't do it

2304
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,180
And there's no shading

2305
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,180
On St. Stupid

2306
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,380
He's like a

2307
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,320
Haiku

2308
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,900
Of a face

2309
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,420
That's right

2310
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,260
It's a suggestion

2311
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:27,940
It is

2312
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,420
It's a relationship

2313
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,760
To the Holy Fool

2314
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,600
It's got Zen elements to it

2315
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,520
It's got Feast of Fools

2316
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,260
European elements

2317
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:33,840
It's got the

2318
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,780
Indian dots

2319
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,300
Not feathers

2320
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,020
Holy Festival

2321
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,440
You know that

2322
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,420
The Holy Festival

2323
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,360
In India?

2324
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,640
No, what is that?

2325
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,440
It's a very special thing

2326
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:41,680
Where they

2327
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,580
Spritch the colored inks

2328
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,060
Over everybody

2329
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,460
Everybody

2330
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,080
But it was white

2331
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,900
For a couple of days

2332
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,540
And they run around

2333
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,480
Spritching colors

2334
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:47,980
On each other

2335
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,720
Oh, and you said

2336
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,620
The Holy Festival

2337
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,440
I assumed you meant

2338
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,780
The people who worship

2339
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,260
The whole

2340
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,100
The big nothing

2341
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,600
The zero

2342
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,460
The whole nest

2343
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,520
That's whole nest

2344
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,620
The whole nest festival

2345
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:56,960
Yes

2346
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,920
Which is in trouble

2347
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,540
Financially

2348
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,480
You know

2349
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,640
You've never

2350
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,780
You should someday

2351
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,120
I would love to

2352
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,140
Introduce you to

2353
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,800
Reverend Dennis Murphy

2354
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,960
Who is the head

2355
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,520
Of the Church

2356
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,760
Of the Living Bull

2357
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,900
Oh, wonderful

2358
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,680
Another local

2359
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,240
Ohio

2360
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,240
False

2361
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,760
Satanic cult

2362
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,060
Which

2363
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,280
Room for more

2364
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,740
Worships a little

2365
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,760
Mechanical

2366
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,540
Wind-up

2367
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,060
Bull

2368
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,740
Toy

2369
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,800
And they are also

2370
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,700
Cannibals

2371
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,560
Cannibals

2372
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,120
Yeah

2373
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,840
There are still

2374
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,640
A few left

2375
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,100
I've been initiated

2376
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,240
Into the church

2377
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,280
The cult of the

2378
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:31,840
Living bull

2379
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,580
You

2380
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,100
You

2381
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,840
Scream

2382
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,640
The word

2383
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,180
Bull

2384
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,440
With the other

2385
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,080
Bullists

2386
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,140
At dawn

2387
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,400
After

2388
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,480
A certain time

2389
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:41,980
I love traditions

2390
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,600
And rituals

2391
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,500
That's what I'm all about

2392
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,040
Traditions

2393
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,600
The emergence

2394
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,300
I noticed

2395
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:45,800
I noticed

2396
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,380
That you were able

2397
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,220
To repeat

2398
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,640
Those ritualistic

2399
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,360
Statements

2400
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,340
Off the top

2401
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,840
Of your head

2402
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,560
That's amazing

2403
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,200
First church

2404
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:53,520
And the last

2405
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:53,960
Laugh world's

2406
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,500
Best growing snack

2407
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,420
Related to 150%

2408
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:55,920
Less dogments

2409
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,360
A light religion

2410
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:56,980
One holy day

2411
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,200
A year

2412
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,520
And today

2413
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,120
Isn't it

2414
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,480
You mean

2415
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,000
That one

2416
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,340
Yeah

2417
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,140
That's amazing

2418
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,660
Boy

2419
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,040
You know

2420
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,500
If we can

2421
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,900
We never were able

2422
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,580
To sum up

2423
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:03,980
The church

2424
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,900
Of the subgenius

2425
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,100
In one incomprehensible

2426
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,660
That says it

2427
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:07,720
That's it

2428
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,300
It's power packed

2429
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,040
I know it is power

2430
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,900
You take out the spaces

2431
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,120
You take out the spaces

2432
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,840
And punctuation

2433
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,640
You get a lot more

2434
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,860
Information per unit

2435
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,120
Of

2436
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,580
My

2437
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:15,840
Talkability

2438
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,980
How can you

2439
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,540
Breathe now

2440
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:17,860
Is just

2441
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,200
There's

2442
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:18,460
That a

2443
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:18,800
Faisal

2444
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:18,960
Device

2445
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,200
That it's

2446
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,500
Kind of like

2447
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:19,920
I got one

2448
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,880
Nostril trained

2449
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,180
Again

2450
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,880
And one

2451
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,620
Nostril trained

2452
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:22,840
Out

2453
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,120
It's kind

2454
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,280
Of a

2455
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,680
Circular

2456
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,160
Nasal

2457
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,540
Like the

2458
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:24,780
Yoga

2459
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,060
Thing

2460
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,480
That's

2461
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:25,860
Very yoga

2462
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,220
It's like

2463
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:26,460
What's

2464
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,340
What's

2465
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:28,460
What's

2466
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,780
The little

2467
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,080
Device

2468
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,780
By the

2469
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,440
Well

2470
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,780
That's

2471
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,000
Just a

2472
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,100
Little

2473
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:31,700
C-clamp

2474
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,140
That helps

2475
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:32,320
Me

2476
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,020
Channel

2477
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,400
Better

2478
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,980
It's

2479
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,280
Just

2480
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,320
Orchard

2481
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,680
Hardware

2482
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,640
Membrane

2483
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,060
Yes

2484
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,780
But you

2485
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,100
Get it

2486
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,240
Down

2487
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,440
Just

2488
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,800
Right

2489
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,920
At the

2490
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,400
Edge

2491
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:43,640
Of your

2492
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,560
nose there, and you can tune your nasal

2493
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,620
frequencies to wherever you want.

2494
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,640
And if you forgot the words, like say for instance

2495
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,600
that last passage that you've memorized so

2496
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,560
well, would you call them right

2497
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,500
to your cell phone right away? I mean

2498
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,600
immediately. Your phone will ring, you look at it, and there will be the

2499
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,380
lyrics. That's great.

2500
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,460
See, you don't have anything like that, Stan. No.

2501
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,480
If I did, I would have been able to remember that

2502
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,420
line that my pappy did that I'm still

2503
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,260
trying to remember. I'll probably

2504
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,180
come back and cut it in

2505
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,220
to the other versions

2506
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,340
of the show. I know what

2507
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,980
the afterlife is like.

2508
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,280
It's just exactly like before I

2509
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,600
was born. See,

2510
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,460
WCSB listeners here in Cleveland

2511
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,360
get a unique chance

2512
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,840
to hear this show

2513
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,400
before I remove my own

2514
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,220
mistakes. Oh, man.

2515
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,020
See, that's defogged.

2516
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,620
So these become like extra

2517
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,780
special, like a trader, you know, like

2518
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,620
a collector's items. This show,

2519
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,460
this whole show that we're doing tonight,

2520
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,660
this is a blooper show. This is one

2521
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,720
giant blooper collection because

2522
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,320
when I get back home tomorrow,

2523
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,720
I'll re-edit it for the other

2524
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,000
beloved stations.

2525
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,840
I can understand that.

2526
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,400
And I'll remove everything stupid.

2527
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,940
So it'll mostly be

2528
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,740
music and

2529
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,460
other material. Pretty much everything

2530
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,140
except what we've been saying.

2531
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,980
That helps that way.

2532
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,320
But we'll sell this one as the bloopers.

2533
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:04,820
Yeah.

2534
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,100
And that's what people really want anyway.

2535
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,160
They don't want the scripted show.

2536
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,580
We'll put it online. We'll put it on bloop.

2537
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:12,940
Doob.

2538
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,000
One time on a

2539
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,620
methamphetamine rampage,

2540
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,880
he took all of the bloop

2541
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,540
words, I'm sorry, and re-edited

2542
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,440
them back in so that it just sounded

2543
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,260
like somebody was just saying beep, beep, beep,

2544
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,600
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. That wasn't me that did that.

2545
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:28,960
That was hilarious.

2546
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,900
That was dial tone or something?

2547
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,100
That was a hippie in Chicago.

2548
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,320
He recorded

2549
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,440
a vicious argument between

2550
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,340
two roommates.

2551
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,600
A heartfelt, serious end of

2552
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,280
our friendship forever screaming

2553
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,700
fight between two roommates.

2554
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,380
And they made two versions. One with all

2555
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,380
the cuss words cut out and one

2556
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,760
with just the cuss words.

2557
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,360
Which was a little longer

2558
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,120
than the one with the cuss words cut out.

2559
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,380
So it was the kind of thing

2560
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,380
that we'll never be able to play

2561
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,600
on this

2562
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,480
fine, tasteful

2563
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,520
radio station.

2564
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,380
We'll have to save it for the special

2565
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,240
hour of Slack. X-rated versions

2566
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,200
which are heard only on the internet.

2567
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
At subgenius.com

2568
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:17,920
Yeah.

2569
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,720
Well the music

2570
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,600
faintly hurts.

2571
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,580
That's not a professional all the way up to the point where

2572
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,300
Dot com.

2573
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,640
I stand in front of the mirror

2574
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,040
and practice that dot com.

2575
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,300
It's weird to see the

2576
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,360
twitching eye thing and everything.

2577
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,740
It doesn't work with dot com.

2578
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:42,900
It's a video really.

2579
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,760
No, org is different macularly.

2580
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,260
It makes your mouth different

2581
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,640
when you say org.

2582
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,620
Okay, so it's

2583
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,980
stupid.com

2584
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,780
and subgenius.com

2585
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,220
and what's

2586
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,720
the lonesomecowboydave.com

2587
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,840
Oh, that's right. We're still trying to get your computer

2588
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,800
to figure out how to

2589
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,040
get it out of the PC

2590
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,300
somehow.

2591
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,120
I'm missing it.

2592
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,520
Think of it though. Someday there will be a

2593
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,420
lonesomecowboydave.com.

2594
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,900
Probably after he's dead.

2595
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,700
Right. We'll call it the abattoir dot com.

2596
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,520
Honesty, my life's blood.

2597
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,100
Here it is. For real.

2598
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,260
No, I'm sorry.

2599
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,200
I'm sick.

2600
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,600
Rhyme of the ancient mariner.

2601
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,340
I was thinking about the submariner.

2602
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,420
I was thinking about Popeye.

2603
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,540
I was thinking about everything.

2604
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,940
There's a submarine in every show.

2605
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,800
You just can't see him.

2606
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,760
Every movie there's a submarine.

2607
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,100
That's right.

2608
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,560
Every movie there's a submarine.

2609
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,520
You just can't see him.

2610
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:42,880
All the time.

2611
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,500
Well, of course, because they're underwater.

2612
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,560
Duh.

2613
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,700
That's the whole idea behind the submarine.

2614
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,100
Sub part.

2615
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,060
People don't understand that.

2616
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,880
Submarines are with you everywhere.

2617
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,240
Everywhere you go, there's a submarine looking at you.

2618
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,580
Now, wait a minute.

2619
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,920
What about Stang County, Texas,

2620
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,800
where there is no water for 500 miles

2621
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,840
in any direction?

2622
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,540
It's underground submarines.

2623
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Underground submarines.

2624
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,880
Those are so boring.

2625
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,020
With that drill in the front

2626
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,320
that moves through the ground.

2627
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,540
No, no, no.

2628
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,280
More like the Buckaroo Bonsai version,

2629
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,680
you know, with the phased molecular structure

2630
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,380
delimitator in the front of the car.

2631
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,300
Or they don't have to have a drill to bore.

2632
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,120
No, no, no, no.

2633
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,820
So they can be boring without a drill.

2634
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,520
A molecular phaser, basically.

2635
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,560
You tune it to the different frequencies,

2636
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,660
and that's whatever the rock is, you know.

2637
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,660
And then you have it on.

2638
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,480
You got computers.

2639
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,820
You know, computers make it all the more easier now.

2640
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,240
You can go right through the mountain if you want to.

2641
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,700
I guess I need to reread Buckaroo Bonsai.

2642
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,960
You know, you gotta get caught up

2643
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,240
with what's going on now, man.

2644
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,780
Even though that's like 20 years ago.

2645
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,900
You still gotta get caught up.

2646
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,000
I know, I'm still behind.

2647
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,860
With the repercussions, man.

2648
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,700
That's what we have to, you know, the waves, man.

2649
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,800
You know, the waves go on forever.

2650
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,360
And so we must grasp the waves whenever we can.

2651
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,200
And like, you know, go for the substance of the waves.

2652
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,240
And there's no future and no pasture.

2653
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,040
And there's no...

2654
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,600
No waves, Dave.

2655
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,400
Bishop Joey had an epiphany on the waves.

2656
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,040
Peak. I had a peak experience.

2657
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,720
Yeah, that was a great description.

2658
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,420
That was a true one.

2659
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,260
Our listeners will never hear of it.

2660
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,140
Yeah, you ever have one of those?

2661
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,400
You ever have one of those peak experiences?

2662
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,120
A non-drug state?

2663
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,100
Are you taking this from Ohio State?

2664
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:21,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2665
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:21,860
Ohio State.

2666
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,840
I definitely have.

2667
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,160
I've had quite a few of them.

2668
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,900
And I've had just their very opposites as well.

2669
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:28,580
Yeah.

2670
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,060
Probably a few more of those.

2671
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,940
What do you call the opposite of a peak?

2672
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,140
A ditch experience?

2673
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:33,980
A ditch experience.

2674
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,840
Yeah, I've had a lot of ditch experiences, too.

2675
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,960
Well, you have to have both.

2676
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,320
You can't have one without the other.

2677
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,840
That's true, yeah.

2678
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,020
But I think that's a good thing.

2679
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,020


2680
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,380
Yeah, yeah.

2681
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,100
Because otherwise, if life's nothing but one big peak experience, then it's just dull.

2682
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,700
None of it's a peak.

2683
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,740
We've all attained entropy, the final static state of entropy where there's no ups,

2684
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,780
no downs, and no in-betweens even.

2685
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,440
They're all irregular movements.

2686
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,440
There was a pretty girl that lived across the street named Diane, and that was my first

2687
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,360
peak experience.

2688
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:10,040
I'd sneak out and peak in her, and then later I developed the mirror on the shoes, and I

2689
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,000
had no more peak experiences.

2690
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,960
Yeah, technology.

2691
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,440
You got the X-ray specs and thought they really worked.

2692
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,880
But if you squinted.

2693
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,540
You can make them work if you squint.

2694
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,300
Then I got one of those see-through-your-neighbor's-wall special screw-in periscopes.

2695
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,060
I had another peak experience.

2696
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:30,340
Then I got the sea monkeys thinking, well, at least I could watch them have sex, and

2697
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,660
if I could never have it with Donna or Janet next door.

2698
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,140
That was more like a leak experience for me.

2699
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,260
Well, you had an old fish tank, so yeah.

2700
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,780
Well, your fish tank's old.

2701
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah.

2702
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,880
It leaked.

2703
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,440
Yeah.

2704
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:43,600
Yeah.

2705
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,080
It used to really shoot, but it just dribbles now.

2706
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:51,360
Well, maybe you could get one of those pumps, those new pumps, those new hydrostatic pumps.

2707
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:51,760
Oh, yeah.

2708
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,100
And you can get boosters for those, too.

2709
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,100
You can get 1,600 PSI animals.

2710
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,580
Yeah, there's new blue organic food.

2711
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,080
If your PSI lasts more than four hours, alert your physician.

2712
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,320
Or your hydrolithist.

2713
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,500
Have someone alert your physician for you.

2714
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,380
What time is it?

2715
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:07,940
Oh, my gosh.

2716
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,880
It's time.

2717
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,000
We're lost in time.

2718
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,820
It is the time.

2719
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,280
We're lost in time.

2720
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,740
The star of the interlacs.

2721
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,560
But luckily, the next show is coming up.

2722
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,960
And we must go.

2723
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,960
And our special ... God, there I go.

2724
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,660
I said it again.

2725
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:31,880
Our excellent guest was the King of Tyroo.

2726
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:32,760
Yeah.

2727
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,020
Bishop Joey ...

2728
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,860
His noblest.

2729
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,260
Holy Ghost.

2730
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,300
I have the first church to last lap.

2731
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:38,640
He's our homie.

2732
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,920
April 1st is the 31st annual St. Stupid's Day.

2733
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:40,980
We're going to celebrate.

2734
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,060
We're going to celebrate.

2735
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,240
St. Stupid's Day Parade.

2736
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,800
See you there in San Francisco at noon at the Embarcadero Plaza.

2737
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:52,380
And if we don't actually see it live, Puzzling Evidence TV on YouTube will almost certainly

2738
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,080
be carrying it.

2739
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,920
It'll have the video of the parade.

2740
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,480
So, yeah.

2741
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,340
Puzzling Evidence.

2742
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,600
Yes, Puzzling Evidence TV on YouTube.

2743
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,400
That's yet another one of those.

2744
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,740
And then there's Puzzling Evidence TV on RedTube, which I don't even want to think about, okay?

2745
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,080
Oh, no.

2746
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,600
No, no, no.

2747
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:06,680
All right.

2748
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,320
We'll turn on the background, whatever it's.

2749
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,460
I think it's some ...

2750
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:10,960
Oh, no.

2751
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:10,960


2752
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:10,960


2753
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:10,960


2754
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:10,960


2755
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:10,960


2756
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,120
It's a little bit more of a humor coming up.

2757
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:19,140
If it actually gets as far as the version of Purple Haze, that's by the Kleptons.

2758
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,360
But we probably won't get that far.

2759
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,680
Thank you.

2760
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,180
Cattle's my name.

2761
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,000
And there's no man west of the Rio Grande big enough to take it from me.

2762
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,580
Man of vision.

2763
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,320
Man of legend.

2764
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,720
He's going to be a legend.

2765
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,760
He's going to be a legend.

2766
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:40,920
He's going to be a legend.

2767
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:40,940
He's going to be a legend.

2768
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:40,940


2769
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:40,940


2770
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:40,940


2771
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,040
He's going to be a legend.

2772
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,440
He's going to be a legend.

2773
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,480
Well, yes.

2774
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,020
Yes.

2775
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,480
Yeah, that's right.

2776
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,900
Yeah, I suppose so.

2777
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,340
Yeah.

2778
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,680
Yeah.

2779
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,360
Come in.

2780
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,780
I've heard of you before.

2781
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,580
You're Holmes, the meddler.

2782
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,360
That is my name, sir.

2783
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,440
But look here, Holmes.

2784
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,260
I still don't quite understand.

2785
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,960
It's all quite simple, my dear Watson.

2786
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:23,940
Amazingly simple.

2787
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,580
A good doctor may tip his root out rather than use her.

2788
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,360
When she in the fight, I couldn't be made to become.

2789
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,220
How did he succeed?

2790
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,480
I mean, by what method?

2791
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,880
He thrust the slimy fool, not caffeine,

2792
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,120
through Nixon's brain, late into the fruit track.

2793
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:39,700
I see.

2794
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,820
That was why the blood in the labenters taps the full bell down.

2795
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:43,380
Exactly.

2796
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,080
And that was why the vacuum came up with just no check on the deviance, sir.

2797
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,800
Mark Watson.

2798
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,120
Oh, the feisty big butt.

2799
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,560
Quite, my dear Watson.

2800
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:53,980
Goodbye.

2801
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,760
Goodbye.

2802
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,320
Goodbye.

2803
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,720
It may merely have been the effect of delirium.

2804
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,440
I'll find myself when they pry me out of my cold, dead fingers.

2805
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,100
And my cold, dead fingers.

2806
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,520
I'll find my dead fingers out of my other cold, dead fingers.

2807
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,580
Bob was an advocate of freedom from speech,

2808
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,520
and yet he still has all these quotes.

2809
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,560
Is something sacred, he once asked.

2810
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,900
Is something sacred?

2811
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,280
I see you shiver with anticipation.

2812
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,720
Patient.

2813
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,580
The blades are on my brain.

2814
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,880
We can't clean the things that don't seem the same.

2815
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,280
I've got the money, but I don't know why.

2816
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,740
Excuse me while I kiss the sky.

2817
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,980
Purple ink all around.

2818
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,840
Don't know if I'm going up or down.

2819
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,340
Never happy.

2820
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,100
Never happy.

2821
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,100


2822
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,240
I can't listen to you

2823
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,060
Whatever it is that there is

2824
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,660
What does family mean?

2825
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,660
Help me, help me

2826
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,220
Help me, help me

2827
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,260
Help me, help me

2828
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,200
Help me, help me

2829
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,200
Yeah, I'm in heaven

2830
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,080
I'm never gonna die

2831
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,400
No doubt

2832
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,640
If it's day or night

2833
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,480
You got me broke

2834
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,120
No, my mind

2835
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,140
Is it tomorrow

2836
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,720
Or just the end of time?
