That word, come, is an invitation.
Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air.
Getting to it naturally, really getting there.
Getting such a high on loving what I do.
I'm so full of happiness, hooked on something new.
Life is such a thought to be thing.
Hello birdies, hello spring.
Each day on earth, each day on earth, each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.
The hunger and thirst that the human heart has is satisfied by coming.
Coming and believing.
These words are used interchangeably.
The come is to believe.
It means to forsake ourselves and turn to trust in the words of 9,700.

Come to me all you who labor.
And are heavy laden.
The word labor refers to an exhausting endeavor, exasperating.
That's where Ken was. He couldn't find that fulfillment of life.
He tried drugs. He tried relationships. He tried slack.
It looks more like the instruction manual for building a machine.
God knows what the machine is supposed to do.

People, I implore you
to go out in the wilderness
and build your own pleasure ships.

and the ever-important

Are you one of the frightened?
Oh, we hate all right.
Oh, we hate all right.
We hate you.
But it just isn't flipping the right circuits for us.
For some reason, it can't come out
like the hot kiss at the end of a wet fist
unless it's a real one.
Unless we're slugging ourselves.
Yes,
we're the walking wounded
of this brutal pink society.
So shell-shocked from our very existence
as if we're too damaged
to channel our resentment
into proper bob-scent hatred.
Oh, but soon,
Oh, but soon,
soon, like next July soon,
soon, like next July soon,
our shattered fragments will be swept
aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses
and, yay, we shall be
ruptured up into the heavens

After a while, after a while,

down, down, down.
And you know when you're traveling
the road of sin,
ain't no other way to go but down.
Come a travel to Broadway,
the road of sin,
and went down to decadence,
down to degradation,
down to derogatoryism,
down to nothing,
down to the bottom of the bucket.
Oh, this is a gas!

Anything you want to about this shepherd,
but don't touch my sheep.
but don't touch my sheep.
That's your Bible lesson for today.
Sometimes before you speak out,
it's best to have knowledge before you start
trying to correct someone.
Have a good day.
Thou shalt not slack,
it would be sin in thee.
it would be sin in thee.
Always remember this.
And holy, and holy,
and holy loyal men
will pitch, will probe,
below the abdomen,
for in a very, very problem
thy word by new fact
will always be firm,
will never be slack.
We spruce, we spruce,
we spruce an island of field
in front or behind
until we have to yield.
The sins that caused the escapism
still remain.
And now that I have graduated
to the Christian sins,
I find
I really find these much more difficult
than the sins of the flesh.
Every single group
has eternal sin.
It is something we get on
to run away
from our responsibilities
in this ugly world.
Someday you'll find
that the world left you out
No true love
is the only thing

that you know nothing
just roaming about.
While parties rub people
and a cold heart within.
And each time you're dancing
you're walking within.
You're taken,
made over,
in perfect disguise.
Unfaithful, unworthy,
and go so unwise.
I pity the heart
of the next guy you've been.
Like me,
he'll be losing.
I pity the heart

What the hell do you think
you're doing?
Dragging your butt through the day,
selling body and soul
to a bunch of bland normals?
Acting stupid so they'll think
you're one of them?
Tired of getting all of the guilt
but none of the sex?
There is a simple answer, dear friend.
A glowing beacon of slack
amidst the turmoil and darkness.
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs,
the black master
in the Church of the Sub-Jesus.
Bob brings a new destiny
for the abnormal.
For Bob comes to justify our sins,
to unmask the conspiracy
and to get us back.
The slack they stole away.
It's us versus them.
Are you gonna cry in hell on earth
alongside the pink boys?
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes
and accept Bob into your mind?
Repent, quit your job,
slack off, and praise Bob!
The Church of the Sub-Jesus
eternal salvation will triple your money back.
I hope you don't take that
as a crude joke.
I mean, it is a joke,
but I did not mean to be offensive about it.
We have nothing to hide.
Even though to you
we are a dangerous cult.
We understand that.
Why dangerous?
Because we threaten the family.
We threaten
the established norm
of family values.
Normal is
as normal does.
I wanna be normal!
All my friends run away from me
away from me
away from me
I don't know why they run from me
I'm normal as I can be
His production is geared to his wants.
He's doing what the other fellows are doing
and as a result feels that he belongs.
And that since the majority is traveling along this road
it must somehow be the right road to follow.
He doesn't think about this,
he simply feels this way.
What he lacks is knowledge, information.
He's not thinking simply because he does not have to think
and it's easier not to.
You're Pete,
and we're here to help.
He continues to follow along with the crowd
His chances of any real success in life
in any phase of life
are 95 to 5 against him.
He needs to know and understand
that the human race has historically divided itself
into two groups.
Those who lead rich, rewarding, interesting, and exciting lives.
and largely unrewarding lives,
and that every field of human endeavor is led by about 5% of the people.
He needs to be given a new group to which to belong,
the top 5%, who know more, do more, live more, and have more,
the elite of the world, the leaders, the contributors,
as opposed to the feeders.
When you hide the wild, the pink.
Hey, Bob!
What about me? I ain't no butterfly!
Take the boy out of the pink, but you can't take the pink out of the boy.
There's a magic pink eraser
that can work a very special kind of miracle.
Sorry, Bob, but your dream has become my nightmare.
My sixth dream was a nightmare!
Gradually, I began to make out the outlines of a boat in the early mist,
and luckily for me, a houseboat.
As I drew alongside, I saw that it was a very special type of river home.
It was a pink houseboat.
I've been haunted by this weird and painful dream.
It comes to me every night and it just makes me scream.
I wake up sweating with a feeling that I'm going to die.
Ramblin' rain can explain.
Of course we need to use an American pie.
I'm forced to live on the porch of a pink house.
Oh, please, please, save me from the pink houses.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Wake up, brush your teeth, wash your face, comb your hair, eat your breakfast, go to work. Wake up, brush your teeth.
Come into my house and see I'm 24. They're watching me with every breath and mission. Take attention, lose my galaxy.
I just wanna be normal. I work at being normal. I just wanna be average. I work at being average, average.
Come into my house and see I'm 24. The TV's turned on me with every step. Competition takes the devil's fears.
He's on the fence.
I just wanna be normal. I work at being normal. I just wanna be average. I work at being average, average.
Why can't I be like these clever guys? I wanna be normal, normal, yeah, normal.
I wanna be normal.
Normal, yeah, normal.
You look around and tell me I'm a good man.
Normal, normal.
You're up beside me when I turn my head.
Normal, normal.
Tell me what to do. I wanna be just like you. I wanna be normal.
He must be pried out of his long habit of being socially directed by showing him the wisdom of becoming more inner-directed, of swinging his allegiance from the big average 95% group to the small, uncommon 5% group.

Then again, they don't.
Are we live?
Huh?
Are we live?
No, we're live.
Are we recorded?
We're recorded.
What was I talking about just then?
I don't really know.
Who the hell cares?
Well, see, a lot of people do care, as a matter of fact.
I don't.
And what I really wanted to get to in my little gist here
is that people will follow anyone.
Who has an idea?
Who has a plan?
I don't.
Oh, I thought you were asking.
Who is the case?
Who is an exception to the fact?
So, you future cult members,
you future wannabes,
if you ever think about the possibility of being a joiner,
for Bob's sake,
don't join.
Don't join.
Just...
Hey.
He's not a joiner.
He's a rebel.
Yeah.
He's a man without a cause.
He's a man who would not kill himself
just because some guy told him that there was a UFO hiding behind a comet.
No.
He's a man of sensibility.
A man of his own direction.
A man of no direction.
A man of English conquering.
A man who leads to spam.
And that's all we can hope to be.
Just hotels.
But...
That's all we can be, my friends.
All we can be.
Just...
...unquiet.
...in the path of non-followingness.
Yeah.
Follow Pope Fred there in the path of non-followingness.
Jehovah Hates Fred played there on Susie the Floozy Show.
Well, we've been there.
We've been listening to Sister.
Beautiful Sister Susie the Floozy's Bob's Slack Time Funhouse 200th Show Anniversary Slack Special from last November.
You see?
But the predictions for X Day coming up are still good.
That's the amazing thing about this church.
We can still keep using all the old tapes.
All we have to do is cut out the year.
Or just dull down the specificity.
We just need to...
Yeah.
Let me regroup now as the music changes.
Dear friends, you may wonder why we haven't been playing tons and tons of recordings from our giant X Day gathering.
It's because I've been editing those in videotape.
It's all on videotape.
The best sound is on videotape.
So I'm editing the video first.
And then we'll feed it bit by bit onto our Slack.
But I'll tell you, there's so much cuss in, friends.
It's just so, so cuss-worthy.
And so coming up, we'll have more radio.
Some genius radio from Sister Susie the Floozy.
Edited media barrages from Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
And...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Um...
Benenzlo!
The mighty Benenz...
Master Benenzlo made a great new song.
And...
And...
And Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence returned from the grave to shamble forth against the Morlocks.
And this music in the background is Ego Plum, friends.
And you can know more of Ego Plum from...
On the World Wide Web at www.ebola-music.com.
That's ebolamusic, one word, dot com.
As in the disease, Ebola.
This is Ego Plum is the name of the individual band.
An anthology of infection.
And, uh, let's...
I just wanted to let you know, folks, that I am alive.
We're struggling onward with video editing and a bunch of computer business that you don't even want to hear about.
The...
The...
The Jesus just came back from Amsterdam.
And I don't have to talk to the kooks and the crackpots anymore.
Listen, listen, oh, listen, listen.
Both phones are ringing.
They're two phones ringing at the same time.
Two different lines in this office.
And now...
Friday Jones.
Ladies and gentlemen, every year, tens of thousands of children die in senseless, pointless accidents...
that could have been avoided.
Thousands are kidnapped by family or by strangers.
And many are later killed or hideously mutilated, destroyed and scarred for life.
This year alone, over 300 children will die by tripping and falling face first into the little cutlery tray in a dishwasher, puncturing their brain.
Ladies and gentlemen, don't have children.
OK, well, it's coming up here soon.
That's some...
I'll just here...
Mix it out, kind of.
There we go.
Massaged...
I'm massaging the board right now in the studio here.
And it's kind of pulsating.
It's not hard at all.
OK, that's...
I've got to pulsate it up.
Oh, you have one of those flesh-a-pod boards?
Yeah, where you have to sort of massage...
With the really soft, jiggly parts?
Yeah.
Oh, that is so nice.
They're really high-tech.
Those are so comfortable, and they're really...




They're really warm, and they pulsate, and they glow.
Right.
And if you please them, they have this whole thing with the pleasure center in the board.
They do have that.
When you find the pleasure center in the board, oh man.
The whole thing just drops and vibrates.
OK, here we go.
You've got to do the violin part.
OK.
OK.
OK.




OK.
OK.
OK.




OK.





Oh, that's a nice little...
You've got to do the violin part.

















OK.

has a message for you and me, even down here in this year in which we live.
And he said, take up your bed and walk.
And I believe that Saint Jesus is present through the power of the Holy Spirit,
right here in this room, right now, right now, right now.
And he wants to meet every need.
Now what's wrong with a withered hand?
Why would Jesus bend wrong to a withered hand?
Why would Jesus bend wrong to a withered hand?
Wrong to a withered hand of a man that was in the synagogue.
Wrong to a withered hand of a man that was in the synagogue.
Well, a withered hand can't hold on to anything.
Jesus coming.
Jesus moved.
Jesus moved about when he signed a point.
Jesus is here and this place is.
It ain't unpredictability.
That's right.
High unpredictability, brothers and sisters.
Another thing that we can say about the acquisition of slack
and our fight against conspiracy is that
if they get it,
they get you to conform to the conspiracy of normalcy.
And your abnormality lands away.
It goes away, never to return.
You'll never know it.
You'll never know it.
You'll be a normal dude thinking you're cool
because you listen to Frank Zappa CDs,
thinking you're cool because you might do a little butt,
but in reality you're a goddamn dude
on his way to see Jehovah One and mad alien space gods.
So it's not how much money you spend.
It's how you spend your time, Frank Zappa.
Come to me all you weak labor and our heavy laden.
It means the end of effort.
It means the removal of that which wearies the mind and the body.
It means that the exhausting, exasperating search is over.
He gives us rest.
Our search is over.
Yes, dear friends.
Remove.
Remove.
The terrible burden of the weight of the future.
Yes.
Close your eyes.
Go to sleep.
And dream pleasant dreams.
And leave the future for the other people.

Our ionization layer is failing rapidly.
We may need transportation.
Are you prepared to leave?
It's time for you to wake up, subgeniuses.
Awaken and feel the fire of Bob.
Feel it burning within your veins.
Feel it roaring within your heart.
Feel it thundering through your loins.
It's time for you to reach out and take the slap
that Bob is all but shoving into your face.
Take that slap and use it to burn a path through your enemies.
Burn a path through the city.
Burn a path through the face of the Earth itself.
Carve your initials into the very granite of the planet
and leave it as a twisted ember burning in space
as we leave it far behind on the pleasure saucers.
It's time for you to make your list.
Who's been naughty and who's been nice?
Because you're wiping them both out.
Killing all the pinks.
Killing all before you.
Killing all upon your left and on your right.
Trample them under your feet.
Hear the lamentations of their women and children.
Crush their homes.
Smash those tiny pink puppet toys that they so adore.
It is time for you to become a fire.
To burn for Bob.
With Bob.
And in Bob.
And be the light of Bob.
And burn.
Burn.
Burn.
Yes, down below the Morlocks continue to operate their machinery.
Gleaming stainless steel boilers or pumps.
Venting steam.
Constantly maintained by their Morlock servitors.
There we go.
All right, now the adjustment's been made.
And we're...
We're now moving on.
Moving backwards, actually, over the Earth.
Yes, I suppose we should get back into earlier eras.
As we prepare to lower the show back down into the parking space.
Back down into the low comedy preserve of Howard Stern and others.
And now the connection's been made.
Again.
Okay, that's your cue.
Whose cue?
Not mine.
No, no, the gong caller.
The gong caller?
Yep.
Gonged away by the Daughters of the Moon.
Picks up on a groovy, lost, and unheard of tune.




It's a journey, man.
It does, no, really.
Well, what is this?
The turkeys are laughing at us.
Is there some little thing you didn't tell us about your plan, Lieutenant?
Is there a...
Do I have a line here?
Oh, it says, uh...
Throw this axe at...
I think it's missing him.
Oh, yeah, okay, right.
I thought we did that axe thing earlier.
All right, well...
Yeah, that was a stunt that was photographed separately, so now we go to...
Oh, all right, all right, I get it.
We go to the cantina scene, I think.
Maybe the, uh...
Do you have...
Are you on the right page?
That's in your board.
I'm on the right page.

It's in the blue pages.
It's in the blue pages.

I don't think you can hear me.
Hey, caller, I'm banging on the...
I'm in the booth here.
Yeah, no, I'm banging on the caller's booth.
I'm here.
Do you have our script tonight?
This is me.
Yes.
Okay, so you know...
This is the introduction to the subject called human cybernetics.
It will help you to understand this strange term, which is now affecting the lives of
so many people, making them happier, more efficient, more successful.
That's your song.
It's got no name.
Let's hear this song.
It's got no name.
It's about Bob.
There's a fella down in Texas, and they say his name is Bob.
He tells me I should slack off.
That I should quit my job.
Well, I'm a subgenius.
Oh, yeah.
And I must have my slack
If I don't live forever
I get my money back
He said that on July 5th
Of 1998
The earth would meet destruction
Suffer a deadly fate
Bob made a deal with X-Ace
Who comes from outer space
He purchased an exemption
For the Yeti race
Well I'm a subgenius
And I must have my slack
If I don't live forever
I get my money back
The day was long awaited
Now it has come and gone
There was no far from heaven
And this whole world rose on
Old Stang was made to suffer
A terrible disgrace
Of such humiliation
And I must have my slack
He feared to show his face
Well I'm a subgenius
And I must have my slack
If I don't live forever
I get my money back
Old Bob may be laughing
Because we are such chumps
But that is no reason
To be down in the dumps
It will all still happen
No need to curse or frown
They got all the right numbers
Just got them upside down
Well I'm a subgenius
And I must have my slack
If I don't live forever
I get my money back
I get my money back
I get my money back
I get my money back

You will keep in contact until the moment of departure
I stood before the wall
And it was a wall
Stretching to infinity
In either direction
It was dark
It was thick
It was massive
And it was solid
It was not something you could see into
Rather it stopped sight
And it was solid



And it was directly in front of me
The dark clouds rolled into the sky above
And it was directly in front of me

I had heard that the wall is the end
I had heard that the wall is the end
And when you reach it
You are stopped forever
And can only turn around
And go back
But I had arrived here
By my own choosing
And I couldn't do anything
I had no intention of ever going back
I was going through
I wanted to know what was on the other side
I wanted to know what was on the other side
I am not a normal man
And we did flicker
Dancing a world full of wonder
Dancing a world full of wonder
Flying there under
Under the sea
First there was the Fig Newt
The four legged amphibian
Which evolved directly
Suddenly into the Yeti
Under excess technology
And then instantly devolved
Back down into Pythocampus
Which is represented now by Bob Mosek
Which is a Pig Newt
Which is a Pig Newt
And then instantly devolved
Back down into Pythocampus

Or any other interest has been received

A very weak signal
And to return it at such high power levels

They're good at radio astronomy
They like prime numbers
And they can send our first TV transmissions back to us

about four different things you were going to launch.
20 pounds in 20 miles in 20 minutes.
So you should actually launch your own homemade device
right into the crowd.

That should be the stunt.
We're going to do that right now.
Liquid or solid propelled, Dave?
I would say it would have to be liquid

Well, once you start the solid fuel, you can't turn it off.

It's a sick, sick, sick world.
And it's waiting for you.
And it's waiting for you.
Disgustingly true.
No symbolism. Just realism.
Afoidean Mondo Kani.
Afoidean Mondo Kani.
Kani, Kani dear.
I love you, love you so.
I love you, love you so.
I love you, love you so.
Kani, Kani dear.
Don't ever, ever go.
You're my guiding light.
Each and every light.
You're the one that I adore.
For now and evermore.
Kani dear.
Ah, Kani, Kani dear.
A blushing expose of the strange activities
that took place behind closed doors.
behind closed doors.
A film that reveals the hidden life.
A world of sieve meetings and unconventional love affairs.
Loneliness and shame.
Different, bizarre, unnatural.
This is a motion picture
that depicts the secret cult of the Devil Worshippers
as never before shown.
The hidden initiation chambers,
or the very special ones.
The sacrifice of the snow maiden upon the altar of darkness.
A ritual as frightening as it is weird.
The recruiting of young, beautiful women
for special functions in the dance hall.
It's time for you to burn for Bob.
Time to let the fire of Bob come roaring through your veins.
Time to let him thunder within your heart.
Time to let him lose like a thousand horses thundering within your groin.
It's time for you to take the fire of Bob
and use it to burn your way through the cities of the pits.
Use it to burn your way through the very continents in open.
Use it to burn your emotions into the face of the planet
before you leave it far behind.
A seared ember glowing heavenly and dying in space
as you leave it far, far behind on your way to planet X.
It's time.
It's time for you to make your list of who's been gnarly and who's been nice.
Because we're wiping them both out.
All the pinks.
All the gnarly.
All the ones who made you work.
And who made you earn all your life.
Who taught you to turn your back on the ignorance that is the happiness of Bob.
It is time for you to get your revenge.
It's time for you to burn for Bob.
Two pounds, 200 miles by the year 2000.
If the X's don't come and get us, we're going after them.
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
This is City Probe Scanning.
We've run across some illegal sexual activity.
It should be on your DTO screen now.
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
For you have chosen to join me in this unnatural participatory ritual.
This tour of relentless human folly.
Your neighbors could be doing it.
Your friends, even relatives.
And you'd never know until the blackmail has caught up with them.
What else but blackmail and violence when the so-called good people of your community start swinging.
That's right.
And they'll finally get it down.
This streaking out pit will finally blame it on God.
And there'll be some kind of church started called the Streaker Church.
And boy, they'll just, they'll probably try to make it religious.
And I want to tell you it's abominable and it's filthy and it's rotten.
And you ought to stand up against it.
Say amen.
Bob, Bob.
I knew this would bother you.
Bob, Bob.
Bob.
It's staying naked again.
Oh.
Calm down.
Breathe down.
Let yourself down.
All right.
Just take a deep breath in.
Well, it's kind of tight for you.
And kind of push it towards the middle.
You want to stand high.
Take it.
You're in there.
Bob will love you.
I love you.
You're in there.



Then throw your consolutions.
The ones you're using to listen to this music with right now.
Bob.
He'll make you hard and frightened.
Frightened and hard.
You ever been hard and frightened, friend?
Confused.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Please help me.
Help me.









On the surface of your very mind.
You'll drink to these little spaghetti-like pumps.
Just like a can of spaghetti-o.
Come on, let me play it to you, man.
I like to play blues.
Come on, man, let me play it to you.
Come on, come on.
Stick your finger in there and swirl it around.
Yeah.
Squish.
I'm not my guitar, man.
You can't even hear my guitar, man.
Come on, please.
You can play with your own mind.
Squishy.
Poke at your own brain.
I, Squishy, broke the convolution.
So sickity and squishy.
So frightened and hard.
Frightened and hard.
Frightened and hard, my friend.
I have authority and I have knowledge.
The hunger and thirst that a human heart has is satisfied by coming.
I have seen the devil in my microscope and I have chained him.
And I suppose you could say, in a sense, metaphorically speaking, I've cut him to pieces.
The devil, Mr. Douglas, I have found is nothing more than a tiresome collection of genes.
And it is with great assurance that I can tell you that Lucifer, son of mourning, is no more.
Children.
But there's a fourth thing.
The Bible said that maidens have naked.
In other words, they have no chain.
And they took off their clothes.
And they ran around in a golden cap.
And they had no monstery.
Need is revolution now.
So let another day go by.
Well, the days are getting shorter.
And it's time for us to fight.
The answer's not more love.
It ain't love.
It's blowing in the wind.
Come join the revolution now.
So let another day go by.
Are you a member, sir?
No, just tell me about the key.
Pardon me, sir, if you're not a member.
By the mystic order of the Lord,
who made his interrogation?
Superposal,uclear Ahmad甚麼?
Up rightly.
Wanna be a member?
Naughty boy
You wanna be a member?

the
wee
let's go

tracting
media barrage material in the show,
which I then re-edited some more.
And it is all coming together,
and we'll just edit on and on and on and on and on and on forever.
Forever together.
Just remember, you and me are sitting together
and listening to this.
How you fix for blades, friend?
I don't want to put anybody on guilt trips,
and I don't want to fight people.
But I'm going to tell you something.
If you're listening to a preacher or a group of people
that are telling you you are saved,
and that there's going to be the next Messiah that comes
is going to pull you up to him, and you're leaving,
that Messiah is Satan.
He is Antichrist.
And if you think you're saved whoring after Antichrist,
you are sadly misled by your little house of your repute.
That's a strong statement, but it's exactly true.
To dwell there above the saints that we love.
That'll be glory.
Right.
But to dwell here below with the saints that we know,
that's another story.
When am I going to be initiated?
As soon as number one gets here.
Number one!
What kind of stupid wiener name is that?
Oh, that's very nice.
But there is a beautiful, really a beautiful ceremony,
which I can just show you.
It's a handy chopping block that happens to be here.
I think that when people bring in,
50 caliber machine guns,
remember, I'm an old military person.
There's no church or group that needs a 50 caliber machine gun.
Nasty word for a dirty business.
There are chapters all over the world,
and it has been foretold that someday a chosen one...
Okay, okay, don't ask me a life story.
Let the initiation begin.
Ah!
Securities!
You can're worth that.
