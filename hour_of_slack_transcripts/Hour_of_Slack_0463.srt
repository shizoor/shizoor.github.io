1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
I felt it. It was one hell of a tweak.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,300
What's noise to some people is music to others.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,440
Recording in state-of-the-art three-dimensional sound.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,380
Relax for a second. We'll play it back.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,140
Happy when the digital age, huh?

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,300
The advanced digital signal processor.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,000
I think a lot of people prefer the analog.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,380
Listen to this.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Sapling, as you probably know by now,

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,980
is the digital technique of lifting musical bits and pieces

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,520
off of someone else's records

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
and using them to create sort of new ones.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Starting! Danger!

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,120
Danger!

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,300
Sapling.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,940
Sapling.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,200
Oh, I love it.

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,780
Pretty spot.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,660
Within the Great Pyramid,

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,140
the secret chamber of the subgenius.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,300
My God.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,900
Oh, we've entered the man's...

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,260
What light and steam come from the special effects department

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,640
located below the pyramid?

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,460
Here, inside the heart of the mighty structure,

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,660
puzzling evidence broadcasts

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,180
from the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid.

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,580
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio.

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:20,920
Come on.

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,620
Come on.

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,000
Come on.

32
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,540
Come on.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,380
Come on.

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:25,600


35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,020
Come on.

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,080


37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,280
Come on.

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,480
Come on.

39
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,920
Come on.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000


41
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,380
Come on.

42
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,800
Come on.

43
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,280
Come on.

44
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,460


45
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,460


46
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,720
Come on.

47
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,200
Come on.

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,280
Come on.

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,760
Come on.

50
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,860
Come on.

51
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,800
Come on.

52
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:36,800


53
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:36,800


54
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Welcome, dear friends,

55
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,180
to the subgenius

56
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,860
Hour of Slut.

57
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,280
Oh, I love it.

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,600
to get that. Meanwhile, you have some of these canapes and a hot buttered rum martini, and

59
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll be right back as soon as I take care of this minor business matter.

60
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,720
Those executive types.

61
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:23,780
Many busy executives often ask me, how do you do it, Dr. Howell? How is it that you

62
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,040
do it?

63
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,920
Yeah, I wondered about that.

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,880
Oh, well, you just do what comes naturally, man, and I'm not going to make some graphic

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,320
description like that on the radio. Besides, you have to buy into my seminars. Now, listen

66
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,140
very carefully to the embedded messages in the following moments of our show. These will

67
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,740
tell you all you need to know.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,780
Number is 617-LICK-OB.

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,120
Sampling.

70
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,900
Recorder and send them back to the OB record.

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,240
Sampling. Sampling.

72
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,980
Sampling.

73
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,520
What?

74
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,620
What?

75
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,540
Okay.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Okay.

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,380
Okay.

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:39,300
got it. Almost. There! And yes, dear friends, that was from OBE's piece, Sampling. OBE being

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,780
out of band experience. Now, what was I going to put on here in the background? And of course,

80
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:55,640
Dr. Howell there speaking from the KPFA subgenius show. And yes, and I think this new piece that we

81
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:05,380
just got in the mail, I'm just going to let you listen to this and make of it of what you will.

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,780
.

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,120
.

84
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,920

.

87
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,580
.

88
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,440
.

89
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,700
.

90
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,660
.

91
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,180

92
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:31,700

93
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:31,780

95
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:31,940

96
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:31,980

97
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,000

.

100
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,120
.

101
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:10,600
oh yes dear friends uh kindly bend over dr bizarro says that's right uh it's not

102
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,720
well you could tell it wasn't frank zappa but it's kind of hard to tell i think

103
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,800
this guy definitely owes an explanation to frank zappa and i'm sure he'll get his chance to do just

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,020
that but it is uh an amazing uh independent cassette which we got in the mail uh from dr

105
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:40,560
bizarro there at uh skokie illinois the a tape called the big machine

106
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:50,160
which is like a gigantic rock opera uh using subgenius uh doctrine and uh theology and uh

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,100
so forth the word bob it's quite an amazing thing to hear uh from somebody we didn't know

108
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:04,380
and uh and didn't know about makes me wonder how long it's been around well let's listen a little

109
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,460
while longer shall we

110
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,860
so

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
so

112
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:19,700
so

113
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,580

114
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,200
We'll be right back.

115
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,900
We'll be right back.

116
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,840
We'll be right back.

117
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,580
We'll be right back.

118
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,720
We'll be right back.

119
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
We'll be right back.

120
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,940
We'll be right back.

121
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,940
We'll be right back.

122
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,500
We'll be right back.

123
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:15,900
We'll be right back.

124
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,040
We'll be right back.

125
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,720
We'll be right back.

126
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
We'll be right back.

127
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
We'll be right back.

128
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,020
We'll be right back.

129
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,360
We'll be right back.

130
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
We'll be right back.

131
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,660
We'll be right back.

132
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,840
We'll be right back.

133
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,500
We'll be right back.

134
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,900
We'll be right back.

135
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,180
We'll be right back.

136
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,320
We'll be right back.

137
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,520
And you, needless to say, you may not get the very best price for it.

138
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,980
If he wants to buy your car, you'll sell him your car.

139
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,000
If he wants you to sell him your house, you'll sell him your house.

140
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,320
If he wants you to sell your kid, you'll sell your kid.

141
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,780
And if he wants you to sell him something equally precious, your very soul,

142
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,740
you will sell that to the anti-bomb.

143
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,240
And you will not get the best price, my friend.

144
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:40,180
And now, whereas when Bob sells something to you, he will get the best price.

145
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,840
He's the greatest salesman the universe has ever known.

146
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,220
Whereas the anti-bomb is the greatest buyer of all time.

147
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,100
So that's the difference between the anti-bomb and Bob.

148
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,320
With Bob, you know, when he leaves, you've got something you didn't have before, aside from a debt.

149
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,480
You have some.

150
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,600
And you have some thing that Bob sold you.

151
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,020
And that's more important than any debt, my friend.

152
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,380
Even if it's something broken or an encyclopedia that's 40 years out of date.

153
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:20,060
The fact that it was Bob who sold it to you makes it much more valuable than any money you may have spent on it.

154
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,640
And whereas with the anti-bomb, he takes something away.

155
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,380
Sure, you may get money, but the fact that the anti-bomb is the one who took it.

156
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,700
It'll never be worth that money.

157
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,200
He takes away your slack, my friends.

158
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,540
That thing was slack until he bought it from you.

159
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,640
That's why he bought it.

160
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,860
Because it was your slack.

161
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,940
He took it away.

162
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,280
Bob sells you his slack.

163
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,680
And it's the purest, purest slack there is, my friend.

164
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,120
It's the juiciest, richest, most orgasmic slack.

165
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
This slack.

166
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,820
The slack that Bob sells you.

167
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,720
It's so seething and broiling with pure, pure slackfulness.

168
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,400
It gets me all excited just thinking about it.

169
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,260
Yes.

170
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,580
Yes, friends.

171
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,120
So we shall praise Bob.

172
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,740
And we shall get on back.

173
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,100
Oh, we may play some of the tapes of the Starwood.

174
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,940
And some more funny cartoon music.

175
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,360
The Peckerwoods on parade.

176
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,120
And some more bizarro The Big Machine.

177
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:47,320
But you know, I think just because we've gotten on this sort of Zappa-esque,

178
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:55,480
I mean, I would have to say grotesquely more than Zappa-esque approach,

179
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,680
it brings to mind my friend Joe Newman.

180
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,960
With his Rudy Schwartz project down in Austin.

181
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,280
And it just makes me want to play this song that's not so much a Zappa.

182
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,880
Joe Newman is not, he's the ultimate Zappa fan.

183
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:25,640
But he's not so much a Zappa wannabe as someone who, you know, took the ball, picked up the ball and ran with it.

184
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,600
Okay.

185
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,240
So here's Joe Newman's little...

186
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,540
Little sad but inspiring ode to the great Frank Zappa.

187
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,360
Oh yes, thank you.

188
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,940
Thank you.

189
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,660
Thank you, Andre.

190
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:15,660


191
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,080
Okay.

192
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,320
You guys...

193
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,380
Go ahead.

194
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,380


195
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,000
Come to me.

196
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,120


197
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,120


198
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,720
That's right, yeah.

199
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,720


200
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,720


201
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,720


202
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,740
Are you ready to get started.

203
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:30,700
Yes, sir.

204
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,740
Thank you.

205
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,160
Thank you.

206
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,260
Thank you.

207
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,020
Thank you.

208
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,760
That is just so much fun.

209
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,120
Let's listen to this for a second.

210
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,320
Thank you.

211
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Thank you.

212
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,640
Thank you.

213
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,980
Thank you.

214
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,620
Thank you.

215
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,320
Tony, you are disgraced and you have proven yourself a coward.

216
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
You have therefore no function.

217
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,180
You are obsolete for that lot.

218
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,740
Oh, God.

219
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,460
You are obsolete!

220
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,480
I hate you!

221
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,600
I hate you!

222
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,600
Please follow the yellow rubber line to the back of the auditorium.

223
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Who is that?

224
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,600
Is that a minister?

225
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,760
Usually they have this fake glassy stare.

226
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:55,300
Kind of like people in B-movies or alien peapods that come from outer space and try to invade their body like they're part of the world.

227
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,000
You know, they smile.

228
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,380
You know, they're good at turning others into zombies like glass eyes.

229
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,080
They smile.

230
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,220
They're good at turning others into zombies like glass eyes.

231
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,560
It's funny, like I just said that.

232
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,460
Since the final stages of the total collection of the big machine have not yet been completed,

233
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,200
we as a society may still have one last chance to get the plugs out of our asses,

234
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,220
crush the conspiracy, put the bad guys in jail, get the girl,

235
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,520
and maybe still have enough.

236
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,460
Could this be something that could turn the reverse of the

237
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,860
end credits into a smash match?

238
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:46,600
Dude, I'm Rodrigo and we've gotten through this.

239
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:54,380
It's gonna be withجerblendinstuchist.com.

240
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,380
hak responds to своихwsjökull proceeded with enjoyed молодое

241
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:08,200
Here we go back into the big machine, dear friends.

242
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
The big...

243
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Oh, I have to get back.

244
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,140
The cigarettes laid in the ice cream dish and the room was sort of darkened.

245
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,120
But the TV showed some bearded guy and a girl with blowjob lips.

246
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,540
Some talk show host was flapping on.

247
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,620
Then a lady shows you her tampon and a guy with a gun just blew away.

248
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,400
Some dude in a pickup truck.

249
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,860
It's the only way to find out all about it.

250
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, I really can't imagine life without it.

251
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,780
Never want to lose that glassy stare.

252
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,780
Well, I wonder how did they get in there?

253
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,000
Then I switched to channel 45 as a white-haired guy was crying.

254
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,100
With a huff and a puff, I had enough, so I turned on channel 9.

255
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,600
Some guy was blowing on a saxophone with a sexy voice.

256
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,580
A girl on the telephone just begging me please to call her up so we can have some fun.

257
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,940
I never want to know my life without it.

258
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,060
It's the only way to find out all about it.

259
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,860
Never want to lose that glassy stare.

260
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,960
Well, I wonder how did they get in there?

261
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
This is Maryland TV Television.

262
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,960
And here comes our masculine galloping hero.

263
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,300
To save the girl tied up on the tracks while the bad guys rob the stagecoach.

264
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,480
I'd like to thank all my special guests tonight.

265
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,760
Who would like to thank all their special guests tonight?

266
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,740
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

267
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,880
You know, these guys are so wonderful.

268
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,720
You know, these guys are working at McDonald's or something.

269
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,740
Right, guys?

270
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,780
Hey, how about that band?

271
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,420
Take them out, buddy.

272
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:18,580
We were trying to stop this puritanism that has helped turn human beings into these violent, bloodthirsty, killer apes that they are today.

273
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,780
Although, after last night I've been thinking, well, what's wrong with those violent, bloody, killer apes?

274
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,500
But the point is, the Church of the Subgenius,

275
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,660
we don't have any choice.

276
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,200
We have to sweep over the face of America or time itself will stop.

277
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,360
That's a pretty serious end of the world.

278
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,640
Bob has a better end of the world in mind.

279
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,980
We like to call it the practical joke that we don't stick around for.

280
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,920
Oh, but then, you know, the normals think this is all a funny, funny joke.

281
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,160
And I suppose it is.

282
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,240
If you look at it this way, that Bob Dobbs is the stand-up comic,

283
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,860
the planet Earth is the straight man,

284
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,520
and the punchline is the end of all normal human reality.

285
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,280
There are vast, bodiless intentions out there.

286
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,080
Intentions of dark and light we call the Elder Gods.

287
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,820
Locked in a titanic, constant struggle.

288
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,780
And we are their weapons, their bullets against one another

289
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,360
in the coming apocalyptic storms of the near future.

290
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,500
July 5th, 1998, at 7 o'clock a.m.,

291
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,680
the Chosen Ones, the high unpredictables of the Church of the Subgenius,

292
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,340
under the last Bob, will be rewarded in that great rupture.

293
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,140
X day, when the so-called men from Planet Earth,

294
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,140


295
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,140


296
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,200
the planet X, will come, and we faithful shall be lifted up

297
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,460
in power and glory to the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

298
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,160
so-called because they're monochromosomal,

299
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,320
fleeing, but while enjoying on live TV the cataclysms on Earth,

300
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,580
while being transfigured into overmen and uberwomen and ovarymen,

301
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,660
superior mutants, dear friends, who will lead a new race,

302
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,840
the master race, because it comes in all colors, all shapes,

303
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,560
sizes, genders, sexes, and so forth, to Dimension X,

304
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,920
will be led to Dimension X, the promised kingdom,

305
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:45,340
the pleasure dimension of eternal slack and cytor-spasmic ooze-squirt.

306
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,100
Sounds good, doesn't it?

307
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,380
And believe it or not, it's not really very expensive at all.

308
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,040
If you choose the door that Bob Dobbs holds open,

309
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,980
you will be whisked aboard the excess pleasure saucers,

310
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,960
and the green carpet will be rolled out for you,

311
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,240
your every whim catered to and satisfied,

312
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,300
before you even think to ask,

313
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,260
because they know what you really want.

314
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,800
And not just for a few years either, friends,

315
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,420
it'll be for all eternity.

316
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,240
This church offers you two, count them, two paradises,

317
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,740
a technological paradise starting in 1998, if you live so long,

318
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,140
and buy your ordination,

319
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,500
your disdainment package from the church, your subscription,

320
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,960
and a metaphysical paradise after you die.

321
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,580
One heaven and one hell, I mean, give me a break.

322
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,580
You know, in my father's midway, there are many bumper car rides,

323
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,620
as Bob said.

324
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,460
And by the time you get to the Christian heaven,

325
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,060
you'll be wishing to God you'd made it to subgenius hell, my friend.

326
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,740
And you have to go through subgenius hell,

327
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,180
because subgenius hell is a party.

328
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,480
It's a giant party, all your friends will be down there.

329
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,100
But you have to go through it,

330
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,360
or else subgenius heaven would literally be too eye-wateringly pleasurable

331
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,520
for you to handle.

332
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,120
Subgenius hell is like the boot camp that gets you ready

333
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,880
for the infinite pleasures of subgenius heaven,

334
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,900
or Asgard, as we call it,

335
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,380
after you pass through just a very few short eternities in the normal hell.

336
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,000
The startling truth is, friends,

337
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,440
there is a heaven, and you can buy your way into it.

338
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,180
In fact, you must be saved even if it kills you.

339
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,880
So join the church of the subgenius, friends,

340
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,400
and meet your clandestiny.

341
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,180
As Dr. Alice A.D. once said,

342
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,480
slavery under Dobbs is preferable to freedom under any government.

343
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,120
When you fight to the death of your path,

344
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,120


345
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,120


346
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,120


347
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,900
Oh now you have a lot of information.

348
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,040
You okay, Dr. Alice?

349
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,040


350
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,500
Dr. On saved.

351
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,120
Dai co energy?

352
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,620
You're just a part of the machine.

353
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,780
There's nothing we've done that we don't see.

354
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,980
There's cameras watching you from every place.

355
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,220
You ought to know by now, we know your face.

356
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm not a teenage jerk no more.

357
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,060
You know we're in control.

358
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:14,760
And we're not afraid to fight.

359
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:14,760


360
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,100
We can make you do.

361
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,560
Suck in the front like an orc-bred whore.

362
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,060
You're in the football pool at work.

363
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,740
There's lots and lots and lots of work to do.

364
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,640
It's not just what you know, but who you blew.

365
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,880
Promotions.

366
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,160
And the title is our ploy.

367
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,460
If you're the type to be our whipping boy.

368
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,420
I'm just a part of the big machine.

369
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,320
And bend a little further so we can slip it in.

370
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm just a part of the big machine.

371
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm just a part of the big machine.

372
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,060
I'm just a part of the big machine.

373
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,180
I'm just a part of the big machine.

374
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,660
You know we're in control.

375
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,580
And we can make you do.

376
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,860
I'm just a part of the big machine.

377
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,780
Now bend a little further.

378
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,380
I'm just a part of the big machine.

379
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:44,380


380
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,760
I'm just a part of the big machine.

381
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:33,820
Pick up...

382
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,740
Hold on while the cop Doogee picks up the machine.

383
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:44,740


384
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,260
thoughtful pose in still frame at this point so the listening audience can close their

385
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:57,680
eyes for a while and kind of get into the cool keyboard thang happening here.

386
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:18,160
Picture if you will a lone outcast spurned by his so-called peers, coddled by his fawning mother,

387
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:26,200
berated by his masculine father, and lost in a world without slack or meaning. His name,

388
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,520
Doug Smith.

389
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:35,240
And only child of an average home in an average town on a lonely planet called Earth. His fate

390
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,940
to be swept up in the pre-apocalyptic world of the mighty church of the subgenius. None know why he

391
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,380
alone is chosen for none can fathom the myriad plots of this most devious of cults. But even

392
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:57,080
the spawn of the normals must bend beneath the moronic will of J.R. Bob Dobbs. In

393
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:57,660
the sense that the name of this character is not the name of the cult. This is a story of a man who

394
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:57,660


395
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,580
is forced to call a pink boy comes to Babylon.

396
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,440
Last week in episode one Doug Smith was given his first pamphlet of subgenius literature by a strange

397
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:17,180
man in black. His home life though horrible was exposed and Frank the steroid enhanced bully was

398
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:23,840
taught a lesson by the 43 year old hairy pedestrian who came to Doug's aid promising salvation for just

399
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,480
a dollar. Episode two.

400
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,620
Leave me alone I'm slacking off the scene

401
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,940
hallway outside the fitted

402
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,040
toilet of the Smiths decaying domes aisle.

403
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,980
what are you doing in there?

404
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,000
leave me alone uses the second idea

405
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,420
like that

406
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,460
when I was a basic trade at we have

407
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,060
fellers who do that and we took them out.

408
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,920
Oh, now, dear, don't you hurt yourself again.

409
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,700
You just wait till the saucers come.

410
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,080
Then you'll be sorry.

411
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,000
You don't talk that way to me, soldier.

412
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,920
You, ah, a shrapnel wound.

413
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,940
Don't, don't, don't listen to your, listen to your father.

414
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,000
He does that sometimes, too, and I have that not-so-fresh feeling.

415
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,680
Ah, do not.

416
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,080
I'm a fully functional male despite all my injuries.

417
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,340
I don't have to resort to unnatural acts.

418
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,440
Now, now, that's not true.

419
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:34,740
Ever since I gained that last 100 pounds or so, you've been doing it a lot.

420
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,080
You stink like an overripe latrine, woman.

421
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,360
I don't do that stuff.

422
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,600
It's unbecoming a soldier.

423
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,460
You remember that, boy.

424
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,420
Oh, God, yeah.

425
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,900
Don't you lie to the boy.

426
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,220
You're useless and bad ever since you had those three feet of intestines removed.

427
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,520
Mom, I don't know if I want to hear this.

428
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,040
It's probably some conspiracy lies anyway.

429
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,640
I might have more desires.

430
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:57,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

431
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,300
I guess you're more interested in my desires for coupling if you weren't such a bloated,

432
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,360
walrus-faced hag.

433
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,080
Huh.

434
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:08,940
Well, I haven't had an orgasm in 13 years, outside of leaning against a washing machine

435
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,380
when I don't spin cycle.

436
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,720
You shut up, woman.

437
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,260
I'm twice the man you can handle.

438
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:15,980
Oh.

439
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,920
Oh, boy.

440
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,280
Son, son, son, get the hypothermic needle and your father's medicine.

441
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,040
Right.

442
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,460
I'll get your insulin.

443
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,180
You know, you should try FROP instead. It'll probably work better, and you only have to do it once.

444
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,980
Bring me my beer while you're in the refrigerator, boy. Quick, boy, move.

445
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,640
Yeah, I'll get you a Twinkie, too.

446
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,120
You just do what you're told, boy.

447
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,040
Good one, son.

448
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,800
Well, Dougie's home life seems unchanged since the advent of the Church of the Subgenius in his life.

449
00:45:48,800 --> 00:46:00,480
Will the wondrous yet terrible prophecies revealed to him in his first pamphlet from Bob and his horde of hoary minions come true for pathetic little Douglas?

450
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,620
Only time and faith will tell.

451
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,960
Let's follow his trail of tears to his high school and watch his progress with his so-called, uh, peers.

452
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,180
And more importantly, the lovely and voluptuous Ashley.

453
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,740
Hubba hubba!

454
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,900
Hootie, hootie, hootie.

455
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,760
Gee, Doug. You seem almost apathetic today instead of your normal chronic depression.

456
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,560
I am! No longer will Frank be able to lord over me. Everything is so clear. My life has changed.

457
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,700
I now realize the stench from the fat kids was just a natural safeguard to protect myself from rejection by the obese.

458
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,280
Gym class is so much better. The hook's fell down when the major eds hung me up today.

459
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,460
I've got slack! Ha ha ha ha!

460
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,780
And I know really well, I'm just a little bit of a loser.

461
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:48,780


462
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:55,680
I realize the reflecting lasers isn't that bad. My bite can act as a defense for all the subgenii who are victims of the physics club's light experiments.

463
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,840
I found a place at lunch. I stole the chess team's damn queen and sold her to Big Barbara.

464
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,340
She funnels her more than me. I think I found my niche. Remember the hairy guy in the church coat?

465
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,880
He's my mentor now, and he took care of Frank. All my problems with Frank. Hey, watch this.

466
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,900
Oh, wait. I don't think this is such a good idea, Doug.

467
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,780
Uh, don't worry. Bob can do anything. See?

468
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,980
He protects me from you and your bullying, Frank! Nice cast, by the way.

469
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,780
Doug, you're dead. Casts are very useful as instruments of pain.

470
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,800
Didn't you see The Longest Yard? That's one of my favorite films.

471
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,160
Yeah!

472
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,040
Ha! My mentor, the Man in Black, is waiting for the holy commands of JR Bob Dobbs!

473
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,320
You try anything, and you'll taste a stark fist of removal!

474
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,800
Oh, that guy. Oh, hey, I don't see him.

475
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,060
Yeah, he's talking to Daisy!

476
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,320
Ha ha!

477
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:46,800
Ha ha!

478
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:46,980
Ha ha!

479
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,160
Ha ha!

480
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,080
Ha ha!

481
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,700
Ha ha!

482
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,680
Ha ha!

483
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,340
Ha ha!

484
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,400


485
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:54,740
Ha ha!

486
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:54,740


487
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,220
Ha ha!

488
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,560
Ha ha!

489
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,420


490
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,420


491
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,420


492
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,420


493
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:57,540
Ha ha!

494
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:57,560
Ha ha!

495
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:57,560


496
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:57,560


497
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:57,560


498
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:57,560


499
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,380
Gee, Doug. I didn't think you could bend your knees that way.

500
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,940
A small price to pay for sanity. Darn it, he even took my wallet. That Frank sure learns fast.

501
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,580
Oh, sorry about that.

502
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,700
That's okay. I've still got Bob in my pocket. See this pamphlet? Bob can do anything.

503
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,280
Yeah?

504
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,240
Can he make a rip-proof pamphlet?

505
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Hey, Frank! Put that down! That's my salvation you're holding!

506
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:33,920
Doug had thought he had found the... slack. Supposedly in the words of JR Bob Dobbs' cult pamphlet.

507
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:46,260
But it seems he was sadly mistaken. The rest of the day at school seemed even more depressing, as time and time again, little Dougie Smith was hurled around the school.

508
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260


509
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260


510
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260


511
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260


512
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260


513
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260


514
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:53,420
Hurled to the floor, painfully reliving every horrible experience of his school days a thousand-fold.

515
00:48:53,820 --> 00:49:04,620
Each episode of torture made even more painful by the brief glimpse of light and hope that Bob's maniacal cult had fostered in his impressionable young mind.

516
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:11,340
Is the whole church a joke perpetrated by the strange, foghorn-leghorn-esque, hairy-pelted spaceman?

517
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,760
Or is Doug somehow...

518
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,320
unworthy...

519
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,680
unworthy...

520
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,120
unworthy...

521
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:16,760
unworthy...

522
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,580
unworthy...

523
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,260
unworthy...

524
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,960
unworthy...

525
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,100
unworthy...

526
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,400
unworthy...

527
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:25,420
unworthy...

528
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:25,760
unworthy...

529
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:25,840
unworthy...

530
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,220
unworthy...

531
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,220


532
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,220

Why is Bob forsaking me?!

00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,060
You know,

557
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,160
You know,

558
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,700
Yeah, I know you. Yeah, you, dancing to Totally 80s.

559
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,000
Don't you know you're going to be crushed beneath the weight of your collection of A-tracks?

560
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,500
And you, looking in the fridge for a 2 a.m. snack.

561
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,680
Don't you know? Soylent Green is people!

562
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,780
Look, you evil scum, no longer will I be your lackey.

563
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,140
The earth shall be my liege.

564
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,640
Third reign supreme.

565
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,280
The ground is calling my name.

566
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,160
Yes! Yes! Here I come!

567
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,620
No more ridicule! No more slack!

568
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,440
No more light at the end of the tunnel!

569
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,940
Goodbye, cruel world!

570
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,800
Hello, Jehovah One!

571
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,800
Whoa there, son! Don't jump, plummet that is.

572
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,780
You seem to got your panties all bunched up in a wad.

573
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,420
But you were doing fine just then.

574
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:40,680
You really? I say you really opened yourself up to the abnormality potential within yourself.

575
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,820
Come on over here, boy.

576
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,020
What? I can't. You're a perched force.

577
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,320
I mean, your story's up on the flagpole.

578
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,220
Oh, yeah.

579
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,520
How'd you get up there anyway?

580
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,760
Now, let's not get nosy, son.

581
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,400
But I'd say I digress.

582
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,020
Now, I know you were all frustrated, right?

583
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,100
Right.

584
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,280
But it helped fuel the fans and the flames and all that stuff you hate.

585
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:12,600
Until, I say, it boiled over in a torment of miscellogenizing.

586
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,280
Oh.

587
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,400
Mind spew, that is.

588
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,280
Right?

589
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,820
Uh...

590
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,760
Oh, wait, let me put it this way.

591
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:24,240
If somebody gets in your face, act like a nut, maniac that is.

592
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:30,260
And if you do what you did just now, you'll scare the immovable poop out of them.

593
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,260
And they'll run away and die and stuff like that.

594
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,560
Huh. Cool.

595
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,760
Yeah, it's the power of the rant, boy.

596
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,020
A true subgenius can go on a verbal bay-roge that can shatter souls.

597
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,420
Blow minds and rip, I say, rip the earth asunder.

598
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,480
Got that?

599
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,940
Uh, yep.

600
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:51,840
Yeah, right.

601
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,720
Now, oh yeah, and here, here's these tracks.

602
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,040
Take these to the copy store and Xerox them and cut them up and give them out to everybody.

603
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,020
All the kiddies and stuff.

604
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,100
And put them in the library books and on the urinals and all that stuff.

605
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,200
Bob wants you to freak, I say, freak the school out, son.

606
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,060
I'll do it, Mr. Man in Black.

607
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,040
Huh?

608
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,420
Where'd he go?

609
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,000
To the library.

610
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,000


611
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,800
Tune in next week for the next exciting episode of the continuing story we are forced to call

612
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,520
A Pink Boy Comes to Bobalon.

613
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,380
Same Bob time, same Bob station.

614
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,040
Oh, man.

615
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:41,140
Well, dear friends, like you, probably, I don't know quite what to think of A Pink Boy Comes to Bobalon,

616
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,980
uh, which is the...

617
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,680
This is one of the other odd new tapes we got in which someone had worked very hard

618
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,560
and taken the teachings of Bob and the materials from the holy books and turned them, in this

619
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:05,500
case, into a rather amateurishly performed but sort of well-written play, radio play.

620
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,660
It's kind of, like I say, I have mixed feelings about it, but I thought that I would spring

621
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,640
that on you.

622
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,440
Just, you know, what the heck.

623
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:27,980
Uh, I have certain personal problems with the, uh, this particular, some of the name choices in the,

624
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:38,760
uh, but anyway, uh, but you know, you know, the subgenius way forgives lousy microphones, or at least

625
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,860
I certainly hope so.

626
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,540
In this particular case that we're listening to right now.

627
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,600
And, uh, you know, and it forgives youth.

628
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:53,020
Yes, the folly of youth, which I, these guys sound like, uh, kids, you know.

629
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,240
They're just a bunch of kids.

630
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,240
They're probably high school or college kids or some such thing.

631
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:04,280
Somewhere I had a, a, uh, letter from them and it's gone away.

632
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,200
So many things have gone, oh wait, here they are.

633
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:17,740
I think more comes to bubble on from, uh, Reverend Alec Abdul Alhazred Lidell, apparently.

634
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:23,980
Uh, John Ling.

635
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,520
Yes.

636
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:35,220
Reverend Maynard and who you can run Montgomery, Alabama, where you could write two to five Colgate drive Montgomery, Alabama.

637
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,280
Three, six, one.

638
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,140
Oh, man.

639
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,660
And I'm going to be a little bit more.

640
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:38,660


641
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:38,660


642
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:38,660


643
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:38,660


644
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:44,020
But of course, uh, friends, that is not the, uh, phone number of the church of the subgenius.

645
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:57,280
Uh, no, the phone number of the church of the subgenius, the actual subgenius foundation from which, uh, uh, this, uh, entirety of this radio broadcast, uh, comes from, uh, not counting individual pieces by the individual makers.

646
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,960
Uh, let me tell you where to write for free information on the church of the subgenius friends.

647
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,200
I just write to Bob.

648
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,480
At P O box.

649
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,960
One four zero three zero six.

650
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,480
That's right.

651
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,800
Friends box one four O three O six in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

652
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,920
Seven five two one four.

653
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,000
Yes.

654
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,580
That's the phone number of the church box.

655
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,140
One four O three O six Dallas, Texas.

656
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,160
Five two one four.

657
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:28,760
Ah, yes.

658
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,040
So let's all now all climb right back into that big machine.

659
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,420
Oh,

660
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:34,660
Oh,

661
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,340
Is I'm not quite.

662
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,380
Do you know?

663
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,360
I think you want too long.

664
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,540
Uh,

665
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:00,940
it's well.

666
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,120


667
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,200
Three O four.

668
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,660
What are you doing in the bathroom?

669
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:01,660


670
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:01,660


671
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:02,900
Beginning mor sekali.

672
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,640
Be there.

673
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:04,640


674
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:12,020
And even though you don't even know it, we can blow up the smithereens.

675
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:20,900
Now just forget the big house with two cars and all the money they make you spend.

676
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:30,080
Cause if you keep letting them control you, you'll get it right in the end.

677
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:37,660
And if you don't watch out, they will drive you insane.

678
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,280
Insane.

679
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:46,740
Because the cable you let them put up your ass goes right up to your brain.

680
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,600
Your brain, your brain.

681
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,560
This is your brain on drugs, oh yeah.

682
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,980
This is your brain on drugs.

683
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,700
This is your brain on drugs.

684
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,560
My ten rules of the wisdom of ignorance.

685
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:41,460
Carved into these stone tablets here by the tip of my holy rod.

686
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,420
Never take anything too seriously.

687
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,400
Place no value in things that are easily replaced.

688
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,000
Seek not to control.

689
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,460
Control anything but yourselves.

690
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,520
You owneth nothing.

691
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,800
All things are unknown.

692
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,580
Worship neither money nor the concepts of money.

693
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,800
For both are vengeful gods.

694
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,500
Empty your mind of all human knowledge.

695
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,060
For everything you know is wrong.

696
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,740
Only that which can standeth up under ridicule is truly perfect.

697
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,620
Kill no one you disagree with.

698
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,340
It only proves their point.

699
00:58:48,140 --> 00:59:00,060
Weareth not either your hair or your clothes in any manner consistent with any educational, religious, or religious doctrine.

700
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,060


701
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,060


702
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,060


703
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,060


704
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,060


705
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,460
Ghosted by the stories of following the先生.

706
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,160
He

707
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,600
Let no one beat

708
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,240
you

709
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,860
You need to give time to explicitly determine

710
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:11,860


711
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,140
and how more wholesome they are

712
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,920
or how the role of the religion

713
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,640
