🎵

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:04,520
🎵

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:24,660
🎵 Normality 🎵

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,200
🎵 As I speed through the cosmos 🎵

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,280
🎵 Much faster than light, faster than light 🎵

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,100
🎵 Where stars shine brighter than day 🎵

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,760
🎵 Space looms darker than night, darker than night 🎵

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,220
🎵 I must confess, the sheer adventure 🎵

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,080
🎵 Sometimes overwhelms even me 🎵

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,720
🎵 I go through the reaches where life has been banished 🎵

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,860
🎵 Yawning abysses where planets have vanished 🎵

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,140
🎵 Caverns of space where the dwarf stars are lurking 🎵

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,180
🎵 And zones where the laws of all space are not working 🎵

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,120
🎵 Through dangerous fields of intense radiation 🎵

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,120
🎵 Where particles form in bizarre generation 🎵

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,580
🎵 The perils I seek with heroic defiance 🎵

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,320
🎵 Include those unknown to religion or science 🎵

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,260
🎵 I am a category unto myself 🎵

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,360
🎵 With no other equal 🎵

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,740
🎵 There will never be a sequel 🎵

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,320
🎵 To my story 🎵

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,920
🎵 As I dare to intrude into undefiled space 🎵

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,860
🎵 Undefiled space 🎵

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,280
🎵 With a resolute set to my jaw 🎵

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,680
🎵 And a smile on my face 🎵

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,280
🎵 A definite smile on his face 🎵

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,820
🎵 I must confess 🎵

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,960
🎵 The sheer adventure 🎵

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:18,440
🎵 Sometimes overwhelms even me 🎵

30
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,560
What is that from now?

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,740
It's from a show I wrote years ago.

32
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,600
A science fiction musical.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,160
No...

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,980
What happened to my coffee?

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,120
I don't know. It was...

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,660
I didn't take it.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,860
That's your coffee over there.

38
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,580
You should get it.

39
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,340
Alright.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,440
Now you got your coffee, we can get going, I guess.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,840
Ugh...

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,600
Ugh...

43
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,060
Ugh...

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,580
Look at all the media now.

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,100
Yes, I've been recently roman celling this especially awful thing,

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100


47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100


48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100


49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100


50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100


51
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,080
Yea, a Variety Anchor.

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,080


53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,080


54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
When you need to.

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,980
When I get HORSE ABSRC Annie,

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,500
And she tries to be a 對不對,

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,480
Where can you sell Plymouth?

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Well she did do it with a permettre service,

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,640
And now I have several other people,

60
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,360
Don't talk to me!

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,560
Alright,

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Yes, everything's going fine.

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,480
It's a happening scene.

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,060
We're recording.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,140
Everything's going fine.

66
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,380
And so, on this historic occasion,

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,600
we begin the second in a series of award-winning Bobcasts

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,520
from the center of X-Day,

69
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,980
Caffeine, the administrative nucleus.

70
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,940
And we have a great show for you today,

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,520
but I understand there's some camp business

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,080
we have to take care of first.

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,940
Did anybody hear any of those strange noises last night?

74
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,620
We had reports of extremely strange sounds.

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,180
Everybody was a little paranoid

76
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,580
because we were expecting terrible weather.

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,480
The conspiracy weather people had tried to tell us

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,420
that we shouldn't even be here,

79
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,540
that it was going to be floods

80
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:22,920
and landslides.

81
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,720
And lightning and everything.

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
I think we got sprinkled on a little bit

83
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,600
and the temperature's been quite terrible.

84
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,440
It veered at the last moment

85
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,860
and the pinks got the terrible storm

86
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,980
and we were spared by some miraculous intervention.

87
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,040
Yeah, but some people asked me

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,620
if I thought those noises were thunder.

89
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,860
But I don't know what it was.

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,800
Well, there were other sounds distinct from thunder.

91
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,740
Something like the fabled moody noises

92
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,920
heard in the camp.

93
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't know what they were.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


101
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,600


102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,660
Strange cracks and almost laughter-like sounds

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,240
interspersed with growling and grunting.

104
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,840
But on a much lower level.

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
But like that, yeah.

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,480
It reminded me of that new Godzilla movie.

107
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,400
Which I still haven't seen.

108
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,040
Maybe it's old Sequa.

109
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,080
Maybe old Sequa's coming out of his den

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,640
at the bottom of the swimming hole.

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,040
My dear sir, what you say is an impossibility.

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,280
Old Sequa does not have vocal cords.

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,400
He's a Chillonian.

114
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
He's silent.

115
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
All he can do is hiss

116
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
before he drags a squealing, struggling Bobby

117
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,040
down to the abyss.

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,020
Well, I still like to think

119
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,560
that those moans and rumbles from the ground.

120
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,560
And we saw moles fleeing the ground

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,120
in order to come where people were.

122
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,500
Yeah, even whacked a couple.

123
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,780
Now, what is scaring a mole that much underground?

124
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,740
Hmm.

125
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,900
So it's all...

126
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,780
Anyway, there is some serious business, though.

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,740
There's more than one mole in the subgenius organization.

128
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,700
That's right.

129
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,460
I'm not going to say which subgenius it was

130
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,680
that broke the rules.

131
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,320
You're not supposed to have pets at X-Day.

132
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,600
Right.

133
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,940
It's in the brochure.

134
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,560
But who reads a brochure?

135
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:02,960
Exactly.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
And somebody thought,

137
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,880
well, if I bring little...

138
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,160
What was the dog's name?

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,580
Snuggles or Snippy or something?

140
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,320
Snuggles?

141
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,820
I thought it was Snuckles.

142
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,140
Snuckle.

143
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,900
Yeah, I can't...

144
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,620
Anyway...

145
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't know what...

146
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,680
These people thought they had to bring their little...

147
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,600
Boy, that was...

148
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,300
...apply-named shit.

149
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,300


150
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,760
It's a skit-sue.

151
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,880
Ugliest dog.

152
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,160
It's like a dead rat in a tube top

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,900
with wet fur around the mouth.

154
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,640
Right.

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,660
So bottom line is this dog,

156
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,960
Sniggles or Snuggles or whatever his name is,

157
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,640
got loose.

158
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,400
If I'm not mistaken.

159
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,700
Your fellow subgeniuses,

160
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,080
I noticed the one, they aren't here,

161
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,280
probably because they're embarrassed.

162
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,480
We're hoping if you see this hideous little dog,

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,600
I've been describing it as it looking like a face-fucking bat

164
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,340
with its wings torn off.

165
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,960
We're kind of hard on it.

166
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,060
It doesn't appear to be an attractive animal,

167
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,720
and it's old.

168
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,000
It's got a perpetually wet gray muzzle

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
and big watery eyes,

170
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,800
but it will probably come into somebody's camp

171
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,040
to get food or to take food.

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,320
So if you see it, that's what's going on.

173
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,360
And please inform Princess Wee that Snuckles...

174
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,740
Or me.

175
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,520
...has been found.

176
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,000
Or Hal or Pisces.

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, you can tell me.

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,080
Any of the bossy looking.

179
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,440
Yeah, if you see a subgenius who looks bossy

180
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,320
and you have a horrible little thing,

181
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,660
you think might be a dog,

182
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,760
tell one of the bossy subgeniuses,

183
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,580
and then you're going to have to,

184
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,540
the couple who brought Sniggles or Snuckles

185
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,000
or whatever will have to...

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,860
They said, I might have gotten it wrong.

187
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,240
I thought they said Snuckles.

188
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll take your word for it.

189
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
You know, like Knuckles only.

190
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,620
Oh, yeah.

191
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,300
Anyway, that's what you get for breaking the rules.

192
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,200
Now, wait a minute.

193
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,760
What am I saying?

194
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,060
This is a church of subgenius.

195
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,380
I thought we were supposed to do everything

196
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,600
that the conspiracy station was supposed to do.

197
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,220
Humans, yes, not animals.

198
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,700
But they said,

199
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,600
don't take drugs,

200
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,980
so we just go out and shoot up...

201
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,700
We're talking about animal infractions, Stang.

202
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,620
This is not the usual thing

203
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,340
where humans can do whatever they want.

204
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,840
This is involving animals,

205
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,240
so that naturally is beyond the pale

206
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,200
as far as we're concerned,

207
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,620
unless we're able to handle people's livestock

208
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,100
and become animal wranglers

209
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,300
as well as everything else

210
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,020
without increasing the basic charges,

211
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,700
portage and drayage,

212
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,200
all of that sort of thing.

213
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:20,820
So, you know,

214
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:20,820


215
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,280
shipping and handling.

216
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,940
Those little fees that add up.

217
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,000
Now, I see,

218
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,280
when I was talking about that dog,

219
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,660
I saw some guilty faces.

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,860
I think some others...

221
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,160
People have probably been feeding it,

222
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,920
and that's one way to make it go away.

223
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,440
So there's no reason to feel guilty.

224
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,040
We just need to recapture the beast

225
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,520
and return it to its owner.

226
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:42,980
I think they all brought pets.

227
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,160
I think they all have a cat

228
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,400
or a little dog hidden in their car.

229
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,220
Well, there are cats up where we are,

230
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,380
but that doesn't count.

231
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,040
We got cats.

232
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,260
Well, we've got the big house.

233
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,820
We are up at the big house

234
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,480
with cats.

235
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,260
Right.

236
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,800
We make the minions sleep in the mud.

237
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,920
I've been informed of that many times,

238
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,580
that I sleep in a mansion

239
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,560
and I make the minions sleep in the mud.

240
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,640
Actually, Princess,

241
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,940
we and I slept in the mud

242
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,900
just like everybody else

243
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,820
for the longest time,

244
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,480
but now we have more and more...

245
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
Well, yeah, it's kind of warm.

246
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,260
With the mud men?

247
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:19,980
Well,

248
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,560
when we hibernate,

249
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,840
you know,

250
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,800
all through the winter,

251
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,920
deep in the mud.

252
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,280
Yes.

253
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,820
That's a different matter.

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
You don't see us around

255
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,180
during the winter much.

256
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,380
Yeah, right.

257
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,700
You know,

258
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,860
some dinosaurs did that

259
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,600
and I predicted it in my book

260
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,620
and then that prediction was borne out.

261
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,580
What, dinosaurs curled up

262
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,760
like crocodiles?

263
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
Some of them burrowed.

264
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Basal heterodontosaurs burrowed

265
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,220
as I wrote in one of the many poems

266
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,860
in my dinosaur book.

267
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,780
And lo,

268
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,140
it was proved to be so

269
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,460
and they found the fossil,

270
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,580
Burroughs.

271
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,880
Validated.

272
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,640
Vindicated.

273
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes, that might balance

274
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,380
some of the mistakes

275
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,620
that are in that book.

276
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,600
I bet that makes you feel

277
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,540
as good as I feel

278
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,100
when I read a new health story

279
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,940
that says,

280
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:05,700
why,

281
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,100
surprisingly,

282
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,140
coffee is good for you.

283
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,540
Boy, they've even said lately

284
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,720
that Diet Coke is good for you

285
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,020
if you're a diabetic.

286
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,620
And, uh...

287
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,260
I could understand it not hurting you,

288
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,040
but now they're saying

289
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
it's good for you.

290
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,460
Well, some like to say

291
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,980
that marijuana helps fend off Alzheimer's.

292
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,940
And my question is,

293
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,640
what's the difference?

294
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,080
Doesn't it really just

295
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,520
give you practice for Alzheimer's?

296
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,700
So it becomes a little harder

297
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,160
for your loved ones to tell

298
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,460
that you've changed.

299
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,720
No, that's just an old hag's tale.

300
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,780
That it actually,

301
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,640
you, whatever it is,

302
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,220
you, wherever you want to go,

303
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,320
it facilitates it.

304
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,620
So if you happen to be

305
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,880
someone who goes into jazz,

306
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,160
and memory trips,

307
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,020
and so forth,

308
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,260
and stares off into space,

309
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,920
it will help you in that project, too.

310
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm not going to eat

311
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,460
any of those cookies today

312
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,380
for this show.

313
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,760
Not before the show's over.

314
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,780
You have any of those cookies?

315
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,740
No, I deliberately left them buried.

316
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,820
God, freak Daniel.

317
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,520
With the corpse of Snuckles.

318
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:07,820
Oop!

319
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,160
Oh, my God.

320
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,880
Just kidding.

321
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,300
That would make me

322
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,560
not ever want to eat

323
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,320
one of those cookies.

324
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
I would sure like to

325
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,420
wring that little dog's neck.

326
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,020
The most annoying...

327
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,800
A dog!

328
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,860
Isn't a dog supposed to be

329
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,500
something big and bounding

330
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,600
and full of life

331
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,560
and companions?

332
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,460
And just listen,

333
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,240
the circus music started out.

334
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,100
Yeah, well...

335
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,280
The circus of subgenius clowns

336
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,000
and trained horseback riders.

337
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,380
Nude horseback riders.

338
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,880
Why carry this

339
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,900
Oh, look, they just went by.

340
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,600
They're gone.

341
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,840
They're gone already.

342
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,600
You missed it.

343
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,540
You should have turned around.

344
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,280
Poor subgeniuses.

345
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,860
Of the elephants.

346
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,240
Elephants?

347
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,560
Well, people bring pets

348
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
to Burning Man, too,

349
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,640
although that is

350
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
strongly forbidden.

351
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,180
I even saw a chicken

352
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,840
there once.

353
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
No, I'm not joking.

354
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,540
Not Chicken John.

355
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,040
An actual hen,

356
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
or I don't think

357
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,840
it was a rooster

358
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,220
was walking around there.

359
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,080
Eh, you're not supposed to.

360
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,180
That would be

361
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,040
a terrible place

362
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,420
for an animal to escape.

363
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,560
Yeah, that would be

364
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,580
one fried chicken.

365
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

366
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,440
But I really did see it.

367
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,720
Well, you know,

368
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,620
we find desiccated

369
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
subgenius skeletons

370
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,680
all over Cleveland

371
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,620
after the bad weather.

372
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,020
They get so feverishly...

373
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,740
It's a hard winter.

374
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,040
They can't feed themselves.

375
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,000
They wander,

376
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
and then they drop down,

377
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,340
and then they become

378
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,680
sort of mummies.

379
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,900
It's awful

380
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,000
looking at them.

381
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,980
They're all bruised up

382
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,240
from being hit by cars.

383
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
They sleep in the street.

384
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,160
We've got to do something

385
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,840
about the subgeniuses.

386
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,100
They're overpopulating

387
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
our cities now,

388
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,060
and you can't just shoot them

389
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,680
and put them out of their misery

390
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,120
because you'll go to jail.

391
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,080
They're the most pathetic

392
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,100
things in the world.

393
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,280
They're subgeniuses

394
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,140
who haven't paid

395
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,300
their $35.

396
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:49,860
Huh.

397
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
They have drunk the Kool-Aid,

398
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,760
but they're not going to get

399
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,580
on the saucers.

400
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,340
They're the most ineffective,

401
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,080
worthless pieces

402
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,160
of human protoplasm imaginable.

403
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,920
But they can sure post

404
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,180
on Facebook, can't they?

405
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,820
Yeah, that's all

406
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,460
they're good for.

407
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,380
I saw one of them

408
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,580
laying in the snow.

409
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,220
He's huddling around

410
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,340
his little iPhone

411
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,520
for warmth.

412
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,260
Oh.

413
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,800
But he still had the iPhone.

414
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,860
He could have sold it,

415
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,440
you know,

416
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,680
lived through the night,

417
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,340
but he had to get

418
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,120
that last...

419
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,740
that last...

420
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:19,840
those last...

421
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,400
last few...

422
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,580
How did Onan put it?

423
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,340
Your unpaid

424
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,560
24-7 data entry job

425
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,340
for Facebook.

426
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,100
Well, now they've installed

427
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,000
the kill switch,

428
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,420
which they say

429
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,480
is for disabling iPhones.

430
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,260
Ha ha.

431
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,460
Oh, really?

432
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,820
Yes, they've installed

433
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,080
the kill switch.

434
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,580
Yes, they say

435
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,460
that if your

436
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,780
electronical doodad

437
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,400
is stolen,

438
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,040
it can be

439
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,060
permanently disabled,

440
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,660
forcing you to buy

441
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,400
another electronical doodad

442
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,840
and forcing it to be...

443
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,620
uh...

444
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:49,840
uh...

445
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,060
useless to the person

446
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,540
who took it.

447
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
They say it's only

448
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,080
the doodad

449
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,160
that will be disabled.

450
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,040
They say.

451
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,880
Right.

452
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,560
Well, but some people

453
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
invest their whole brain

454
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,800
and spirit

455
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
into their little laptop.

456
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,280
I can't remember

457
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,920
a phone number.

458
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,900
They're all in my laptop.

459
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,520
I can't remember your name.

460
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,120
Hey, you know,

461
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,800
there's an empty

462
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,160
microphone up here.

463
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,700
Uh, Dr. Hal and I

464
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,440
are just sitting here

465
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,520
boring each other.

466
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,600
All right, all right.

467
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,300
Princess Wee

468
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,980
was gonna come up here.

469
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,920
You know, this reminds me

470
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,100
of an amusing anecdote.

471
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,400
Uh...

472
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,420
Yeah.

473
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,400
Yeah, Princess Wee is...

474
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,920
Oh, she's across the street

475
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,620
enjoying the shade

476
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,720
of the shade structure.

477
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,940
Oh, I know what she's doing.

478
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
Yes, she's enjoying...

479
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,560
I know what she's doing.

480
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:32,960
...relaxing, refreshing.

481
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,860
Relaxing.

482
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,320
Retrenching.

483
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,900
Reverend Two Beans.

484
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,820
I know what that's all about.

485
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,160
Yeah, right.

486
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,780
Two Beans.

487
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,080
Okay.

488
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Boy, does that guy get around.

489
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,840
Okay, so, uh,

490
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,260
what we're going to do then

491
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,880
is continue with the old

492
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,220
slap-happy, uh,

493
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,620
hour of slack.

494
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,940
Uh, scientific.

495
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,220
Scientific.

496
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,080
Educational.

497
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,000
Um, uh, um...

498
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,060
Now, um...

499
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,400
Good fun for the whole family.

500
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,860
Between the Carboniferous period

501
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,200
of 250 million years ago...

502
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,220
Oh, no, not again.

503
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,380
No, no, no, no.

504
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,360
...the Paleozoic,

505
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
ending approximately

506
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,680
200 million years ago...

507
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,460
...came the age

508
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,600
of giant insects.

509
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
You have to say it

510
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,080
into that microphone, right?

511
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,140
If this might...

512
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,700
Oh, there it is.

513
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,860
Sud Piper up there.

514
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,160
Oh.

515
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,540
Okay.

516
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,100
Oh, is this thing on?

517
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,900
Is that what you're asking?

518
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,820
Yes, yes, yes.

519
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,040
So, I'm going to make

520
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,680
an announcement about

521
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,480
something for the

522
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,060
Bulldada auction

523
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,160
that is coming later.

524
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,260
Giant insects?

525
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,860
No, those are after

526
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,580
the Bulldada auction.

527
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,860
But, um,

528
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,000
giant insects aside,

529
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,320
uh, Sud Spishaw

530
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,780
will also be donating

531
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,060
a piece of original art

532
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,560
this year.

533
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,280
Oh, yeah?

534
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,740
So, um...

535
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
A comic book cover

536
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,620
by New Chomps?

537
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,540
On the auction day

538
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
on the 4th,

539
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,460
we'll be auctioning it off.

540
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,980
The opening bid is $35.

541
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,560
It will be 11 by 14.

542
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,200
It is ink, pencil, paint,

543
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,180
that sort of thing.

544
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,920
So, um...

545
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,920


546
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,920


547
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,920


548
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,920


549
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,920


550
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,920


551
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,520
It, um...

552
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,860
You will be bidding on it

553
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,400
to be...

554
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,460
He will draw it here.

555
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,220
He will sit down

556
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,860
at a table.

557
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,960
He's got his art kit

558
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,060
and he will draw it

559
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,100
live in person.

560
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,440
His art what?

561
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,600
Kit.

562
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,760
Oh, okay.

563
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,220
His art kit.

564
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
No, his art kits.

565
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,020
Okay, thanks.

566
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,820
He's got his art kits.

567
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,440
I don't have to cut that one.

568
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,720
And, um,

569
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,080
so since that's the case,

570
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,920
it'll be a $35 opening bid

571
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,180
that will be on the, uh,

572
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,680
Bulldada auction

573
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,320
on the 4th.

574
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,460
So, um,

575
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
you have to have

576
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,280
at least $35

577
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,020
and you will get

578
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,840
an O.A.

579
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,060
Sud Spishaw

580
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,540
original.

581
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:20,580
Yes.

582
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:20,780
Of course,

583
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,520
at the same time,

584
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,800
even if you're saving money

585
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,960
for the Sud Spishaw

586
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,260
original,

587
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,620
doesn't mean you might

588
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,320
not want to check out

589
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,260
the merch table,

590
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,760
which has a number of

591
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,760
officially licensed

592
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,580
Bob Dobbs shirts.

593
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,140
Oh, b-b-b-boy.

594
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,940
Right.

595
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,740
Uh, yeah,

596
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
buy your T-shirt now

597
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,040
before Scotty gets here

598
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,520
with his competing line

599
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,060
of subgenius T-shirts.

600
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,060
I haven't even looked

601
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,480
through it, uh, yet.

602
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,900
Uh,

603
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,680
this, uh, trip,

604
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,920
uh, what wonders

605
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,280
might be available?

606
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,260
There's, uh,

607
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,920
CDs

608
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,720
to annoy

609
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,800
your neighbors with.

610
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,560
CDs,

611
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,300
CDOs,

612
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:58,980
or if you have

613
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,760
a radio show,

614
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,780
you can play those.

615
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,780
There are buttons.

616
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,100
Buttons,

617
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,160
bumper stickles,

618
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,800
bingles,

619
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,480
bangles,

620
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,320
and baubles,

621
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,000
gee-gaws,

622
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,760
gim cracks,

623
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,680
new laminates,

624
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,400
honeydews for old,

625
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,940
knock-offs,

626
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,340
rip-offs,

627
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,420
you name it,

628
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,660
Bob sells it.

629
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,780
Jingling Johnny,

630
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,040
whatchamacallit,

631
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,960
sting futzers.

632
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,800
And I'm not gonna

633
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,420
stay up here long,

634
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,180
but, you know,

635
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,540
somebody,

636
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,900
they were serious.

637
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,040
You can come up here

638
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,080
and chat with the boys.

639
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,200
That's right.

640
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,040
You know, like,

641
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,640
people, like,

642
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
adorable, cute little girls

643
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,060
who play cards

644
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,720
could come up here

645
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,520
and chat with the boys.

646
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,160
But that would mean

647
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,740
they would have to

648
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,120
stop playing cards

649
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,060
if they did that.

650
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,940
Nerds.

651
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,880
God, they go to a campground

652
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,100
to watch television

653
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,700
and play video games.

654
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,320
That's what I did last night.

655
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:44,780
What?

656
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,760
Oh, good.

657
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,280
I think she will join us.

658
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,480
So,

659
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,320
so that would be

660
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,480
exceptionally great.

661
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:49,980
Okay, well,

662
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
I'm gonna sit the mic down gently.

663
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,900
Good plan.

664
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,260
Unlike certain radio stations

665
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,280
where huge, clumsy people

666
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
with giant feet

667
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
make loud, clumping,

668
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,000
banging noises

669
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,800
and destroy the symmetry.

670
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
Oh, you listen to Rush, too?

671
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,220
Well, I was actually

672
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,360
thinking of problems

673
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,480
and meant my own broadcasts

674
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,780
when puzzling evidence

675
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,280
upsets everything

676
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,060
onto the board

677
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,260
with flailing elbows

678
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,240
and mustache.

679
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,180
Well, I got,

680
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,320
we got to witness

681
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,980
an interesting clash

682
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,680
of cultures this morning.

683
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,980
Thank God for culture clash.

684
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,060
Our buddy,

685
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,280
Mr. Sistar,

686
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,420
who, of course,

687
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,100
is famous for lolling

688
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,080
at all of us socialists

689
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,440
and such,

690
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,140
was,

691
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,940
he was having breakfast

692
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,360
at the big house.

693
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,560
I wasn't there.

694
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,320
I was still in bed.

695
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,640
But apparently,

696
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,520
Charlene,

697
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,100
the hippie witch

698
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,460
who runs that place,

699
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,320
was trying to explain

700
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,240
her recycling

701
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,340
set up.

702
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,500
And Mr. Sistar said,

703
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,920
I put all my stuff

704
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,600
in one bag

705
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
and stick it right out

706
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
on the street.

707
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,300
We actually have

708
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
recycling in our neighborhood.

709
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,200
Well, you know,

710
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,020
that gives...

711
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,560
It's just,

712
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,280
Charlene started to try

713
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,200
to explain to Mr. Sistar

714
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,640
why recycling was good.

715
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,840
The long-suffering,

716
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,380
saintly Charlene, yes.

717
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,140
Princess, we cut in

718
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,520
and said,

719
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,900
you're barking up

720
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,240
the wrong tree there, Charlene.

721
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,140
You ain't gonna get

722
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,040
anywhere with this one.

723
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,260
Yes, her bite

724
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,220
is worse than her bite.

725
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,400
Bark.

726
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,320
Anyway.

727
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,540
The only way you could get

728
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,220
Mr. Sistar to recycle

729
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,100
would be if

730
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,120
Obabo told everyone

731
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,020
they should stop recycling.

732
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,000
But somebody's got to do it.

733
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,520
Somebody has to stand up.

734
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,920
Well, you know,

735
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,800
if you don't recycle...

736
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,620
Actually, I had a

737
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,440
Cleveland Heights garbage man

738
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,140
told me that

739
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,560
at the time,

740
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,400
a few years ago,

741
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,160
they were indeed

742
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,900
dumping the cardboard

743
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,100
in the same dump

744
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,560
because

745
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,840
there was no longer

746
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
a market for recycled cardboard.

747
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,400
There was a glut.

748
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,020
There was too much of it.

749
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,920
You couldn't give it away.

750
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,340
All the Vietnamese people

751
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,280
came and got it.

752
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
But by that same token,

753
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,800
if you don't separate

754
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,560
your recycling,

755
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,940
some handy bum

756
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,740
on the street

757
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,440
will go through

758
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,020
your garbage

759
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,160
and thoughtfully

760
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,100
take out everything.

761
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,980
Mr. Sistar has just brought

762
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,640
a treasure trove

763
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,180
of bulldada up here.

764
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
For the auction?

765
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,300
For the famous

766
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,160
bulldada auction?

767
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh, we're gonna auction these?

768
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,020
Oh, my God.

769
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, turn the music off.

770
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,200
Oh, we're bothering

771
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,720
the neighbors.

772
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,440
We have to turn it down.

773
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
Probably just making it

774
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,700
hard to hear.

775
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,960
I don't know.

776
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,920
Hard of hearing, you say?

777
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,560
What?

778
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,720
But look, we have

779
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,140
the shockumentary

780
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,440
Plain Jane,

781
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,580
which is,

782
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,240
if you haven't seen it,

783
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,480
it's hilarious

784
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,840
and sexy

785
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,240
and eye-opening

786
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,820
because Jane...

787
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,440
Never heard of it.

788
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,940
It's actually a friend of ours

789
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,920
who has a...

790
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess she's a dwarf

791
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,380
with brittle bone disease.

792
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,880
Basically looks kind of

793
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,480
like a head

794
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,740
with little limbs

795
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,660
hanging from it.

796
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,680
And yet,

797
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,560
she's one of those people

798
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
that the doctors said

799
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,560
wouldn't live

800
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,620
out of her teens

801
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,460
and she's about

802
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,840
40 years old now.

803
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
It's when she quit

804
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,080
taking all the medicine

805
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,260
they told her to take.

806
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,560
And she...

807
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,800
She...

808
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,240
felt a lot better

809
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,660
and...

810
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,900
she teaches...

811
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,760
She even has

812
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,460
a sex education sequence

813
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,500
in that video

814
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,700
where she goes,

815
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,320
people,

816
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,060
people,

817
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,700
they're always real curious.

818
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,180
They're always real curious

819
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,740
and they want to know

820
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,720
how I do it.

821
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,720
And all I can tell people

822
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,080
is how do you do it?

823
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,700
Ah.

824
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,340
You know.

825
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,620
It's great

826
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,880
and he also brought

827
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
The Chocolate War,

828
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
a real movie.

829
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,680
This movie's static.

830
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
It's on a different wavelength.

831
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,140
I thought we were watching

832
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,600
the room

833
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,060
at the Bloody Mary thing.

834
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,000
Are we not doing that?

835
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,960
Where's Mr. Sister?

836
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,720
You have multiple copies.

837
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,760
All right.

838
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,160
You're a good man.

839
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,680
That's a terrible movie.

840
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,660
I couldn't watch it

841
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,860
after the first 10 minutes.

842
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,660
I gave up.

843
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,540
It's funny, though.

844
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Which is the movie

845
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,480
about the guy

846
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,780
who's locked in a room

847
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,500
for a chunk of his life

848
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,760
by some super criminal?

849
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,360
That's Old Boy.

850
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,380
Oh, Old Boy.

851
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,120
Oh, Casper Hauser.

852
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,560
It actually happened to him.

853
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,140
I depend on you

854
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,980
to set me straight

855
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,720
on these things.

856
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,300
There was a historical case

857
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,840
of a...

858
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,580
The American one's not that great.

859
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,240
...a feral man

860
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,540
in a room

861
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,060
in Germany

862
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,280
who had been kept in a cage

863
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,440
all the way to adulthood.

864
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,580
Casper Hauser.

865
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,320
Yes.

866
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,400
Mysterious case.

867
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,460
Right.

868
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
They say his ghost

869
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,840
became fairly friendly.

870
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,200
There was an early movie

871
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,420
about that by...

872
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,580
What's his...

873
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,340
Werner Herzog

874
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,100
did a movie

875
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,300
about Casper Hauser.

876
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,880
It was cool.

877
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,500
God Against All

878
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,440
or something like that?

879
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:41,660
No.

880
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,080
It was called

881
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,520
Casper Hauser, I think.

882
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,100
The Mystery of Casper.

883
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,280
Yeah.

884
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,940
Casper Hauser.

885
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,520
No one knew

886
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,340
where he came from,

887
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,540
but he was a good man.

888
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,900
Probably some rich family

889
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,720
had had him stashed away.

890
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,560
But it had a subtitle

891
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:51,840
of...

892
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,400
which ended in

893
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,960
God Against All

894
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,900
or One Against All

895
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,800
or something like that.

896
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
Are you thinking

897
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,360
of Aguirre?

898
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,600
No.

899
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,260
I'm thinking

900
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,440
of Casper Hauser.

901
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:01,820
Okay.

902
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,280
What about

903
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,220
Casper the Friendly...

904
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,340
Casper the Friendly Hauser.

905
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:05,820
Yeah.

906
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,100
He's friendly

907
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,840
because he's got

908
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,860
a Hauser to haunt.

909
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,860
He was dead,

910
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,700
but he was cute.

911
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,420
He'd build you

912
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,240
a big old house.

913
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,120
He looked kind of

914
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,980
like an embryo,

915
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,520
probably an early birth.

916
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
The tagline

917
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,540
for the movie

918
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,280
The Room is

919
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,300
Are you ready

920
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
to see reflections

921
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,460
of your life?

922
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,880
No.

923
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,820
I turn all...

924
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,060
My life never resembles

925
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,920
anything close to that.

926
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,740
You can turn

927
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,820
your mirror

928
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,340
to the...

929
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,380
Turn your mirrors

930
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,980
to the wall.

931
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,200
Okay, Mark.

932
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,180
Yes.

933
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,160
You just don't want

934
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,180
to see your face

935
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,320
staring back sometimes.

936
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,980
That's just

937
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,360
the ultimate thing

938
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,140
that can drive

939
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,660
your temper

940
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,540
over the edge

941
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,180
to see that

942
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,800
strange-looking person

943
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,040
there

944
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,080
who's not at all

945
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
like your young self.

946
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,520
You got to

947
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:47,660
be careful

948
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:47,660


949
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:47,800
You guys traded

950
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,860
mics on me.

951
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,560
That's why I was

952
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,080
going insane just now.

953
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Well, what's the matter

954
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,600
with that?

955
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,980
These are equal

956
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,920
opportunity mics,

957
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,400
aren't they?

958
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,600
I was trying to

959
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,340
turn up mic one

960
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,220
and mic two,

961
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,140
but they were switched.

962
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,720
Well, I thought

963
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,600
she should have a mic

964
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,700
that would stand.

965
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,220
What are these?

966
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,740
What are these cards?

967
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,440
Mine won't stand.

968
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:04,940
Those are

969
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,800
H.P. Lovecraft cards

970
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,160
with little snippets

971
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
of H.P. Lovecraft's

972
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,020
prose on one side

973
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,880
and frightening images

974
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,620
on the other.

975
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,480
Are these for

976
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:15,960
the Bulldog?

977
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't know.

978
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,540
Those are from

979
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,100
the private

980
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,200
Ivan Stang

981
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
fetishistic collection

982
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,400
of never-to-be-allowed-out-of-his-sight

983
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,940
property.

984
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,540
With any luck,

985
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,440
we can make off

986
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,860
with it at this festival.

987
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,380
Uh-huh.

988
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,300
But I've

989
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,440
separated

990
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,500
some of the more

991
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,960
plummy passages

992
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,680
of Lovecraft's writing.

993
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,340
I thought we might

994
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,260
shoot some in

995
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,980
to this broadcast,

996
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,920
give it an injection,

997
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,760
put it on its feet,

998
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,860
if we start

999
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,540
slobbing and slubbing

1000
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,100
about lost little dogs

1001
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,800
and so on.

1002
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,240
And if no one

1003
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,140
really does want to hear

1004
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,740
about the age

1005
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,500
of giant insects,

1006
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,500
there are plenty

1007
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,080
of other things

1008
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,360
that we can pop in.

1009
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,200
Oh, there is an age

1010
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,420
of giant insects?

1011
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,420
Well, yes.

1012
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,160
That's what I was

1013
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,180
starting to say.

1014
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,980
Climaxing in the

1015
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,880
end of the Paleozoic

1016
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,560
when the Permian period

1017
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,860
ended and the

1018
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,800
greatest extinction

1019
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,860
that ever hit

1020
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,700
the planet Earth

1021
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,940
hit the greatest extinction

1022
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:15,940


1023
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,660
The Great Dying,

1024
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
as it's called,

1025
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,980
before the dinosaurs

1026
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,120
even got started.

1027
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,740
You see, the planet

1028
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,460
got hot,

1029
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,780
and when it gets hot,

1030
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,480
everything dies,

1031
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,620
almost everything.

1032
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,820
And it killed off

1033
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,300
the great big bugs

1034
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,840
that lived until then.

1035
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,560
No!

1036
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,840
Oh, yes.

1037
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,460
They couldn't live

1038
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,320
because the atmosphere

1039
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,440
changed and their

1040
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,380
breathing systems

1041
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,340
wouldn't work

1042
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,140
in the atmosphere,

1043
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,980
which is closer

1044
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,820
to the atmosphere

1045
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:45,920
of the Earth.

1046
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,920


1047
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,920


1048
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,920


1049
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,920


1050
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,920


1051
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:45,920


1052
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:45,980
They're much more

1053
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:45,980


1054
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:45,980


1055
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,520
we have today

1056
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,980
than what they enjoyed

1057
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,540
before.

1058
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,660
The moral of that story,

1059
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,200
friends, is don't try

1060
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
to breathe through holes

1061
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
in your sides.

1062
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,140
It works if you've got

1063
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,080
lots of oxygen

1064
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,140
in the atmosphere.

1065
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,180
I find dragonflies

1066
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,000
scary enough

1067
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,660
when they're only

1068
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,180
a couple inches,

1069
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,660
and I don't need them

1070
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,360
to be four feet.

1071
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,320
But to them,

1072
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,640
you're the monster.

1073
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
They're not really dragons,

1074
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,120
you know.

1075
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
They don't really

1076
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,860
breathe fire.

1077
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,140
They're pretty harmless.

1078
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,960
If they were,

1079
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,660
that would be cool.

1080
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
No, it's the buzzing.

1081
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,260
They can't...

1082
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,320
The buzzing sounds.

1083
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,280
The old-fashioned kind

1084
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,500
with the wings

1085
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
more than a yard wide

1086
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,180
couldn't fold those wings

1087
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,900
like the modern dragonfly could.

1088
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,180
Well, there is a kind

1089
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,400
of a lost world

1090
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,260
just down this road.

1091
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,580
They call it the pond

1092
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,760
where, because of the

1093
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
dense atmosphere,

1094
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,980
the oxygen is much stronger

1095
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,400
and the insects do grow huge.

1096
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,180
It's in the mud.

1097
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,980
Like that spider

1098
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,060
we found two years ago there.

1099
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,760
That was a spider.

1100
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1101
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1102
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1103
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1104
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1105
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1106
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1107
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1108
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1109
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1110
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,760


1111
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,700
It's a real whopper.

1112
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,960
But only down...

1113
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,580
And the mosquitoes,

1114
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,200
of course,

1115
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,660
are the size of small

1116
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,240
hang gliders.

1117
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,120
Trailer bikes,

1118
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:49,980
chigger bikes,

1119
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,900
and mosquitos

1120
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,240
collide aimlessly

1121
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,400
in the dense gas.

1122
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,080
Right.

1123
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,620
And you can experience

1124
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,720
that primordial atmosphere

1125
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,980
when we have our

1126
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,780
holy baptism ceremony,

1127
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,160
which I think is Friday.

1128
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,080
And you can sink down

1129
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,940
into that swamp

1130
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,480
and meet those gigantic,

1131
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,940
buzzing insects.

1132
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,480
Well, they'll come to you.

1133
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,060
Don't worry.

1134
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,720
Thank you.

1135
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:11,760
Thank you.

1136
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


1137
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


1138
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


1139
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


1140
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:11,760


1141
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,740
We should try to look

1142
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,380
for the bones

1143
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,840
of whatever hippie

1144
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,660
lost this ring

1145
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,360
that I found.

1146
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,840
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,560
That was a weird thing.

1148
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,160
If it was a hippie

1149
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,160


1150
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,300
Baby Bear was swimming

1151
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
in a strange ring

1152
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,140
with hieroglyphs

1153
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,960
seemed to find its way

1154
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,280
in the pond

1155
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,280


1156
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,860
onto her toe.

1157
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,620
Oh.

1158
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,300
You were on the edge

1159
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,400
of the abyss, right?

1160
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,320
Yeah.

1161
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,180
Right on the...

1162
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,020
Right where it plunges down

1163
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,620
into unending,

1164
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,280
freezing cold water.

1165
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,600
And it's too big

1166
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,980
even to be a toe ring

1167
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,760
for you, right?

1168
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
It's pretty large.

1169
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,300
It's a pretty big ring.

1170
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,880
It came from a hefty hippie

1171
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,680
in his prime,

1172
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,420
but now,

1173
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,560
there's no doubt

1174
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,700
if he even survives

1175
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,720
into the present era,

1176
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,240
he's withered, shrunken,

1177
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,200
and etiolated.

1178
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,940
I think that thing

1179
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,120
is far older, Dr. Howell.

1180
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Probably a sacrifice.

1181
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,040
I think that thing

1182
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,420
dates from some time

1183
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,460
before history.

1184
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,660
Well, some hippies

1185
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,800
are old, too.

1186
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,280
Well, yeah.

1187
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,620
But how do you know

1188
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,300
it's not some ancient

1189
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,540
Native American thing

1190
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,720
with a curse on it?

1191
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,440
That's my point.

1192
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,940
Yeah, it could have been

1193
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,380
an ancient sacrifice.

1194
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,760
Ancient Native American

1195
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:11,760


1196
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,160
did the Americans

1197
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,680
minted silver rings

1198
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,540
and carved them?

1199
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:15,940
Well, maybe

1200
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,520
truly ancient.

1201
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,180
I don't know,

1202
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,940
but orcs and monsters did.

1203
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:19,940
Paleologians.

1204
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,760
The minute I saw that thing,

1205
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,660
I wanted to just

1206
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,560
run off with it,

1207
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,180
turn invisible,

1208
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,460
and start panting

1209
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,720
and going,

1210
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,840
Precious!

1211
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,940
Sorry, finders keepers.

1212
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:27,980
It's mine.

1213
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,440
It's my precious.

1214
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,100
Right, right.

1215
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,080
It's her precious.

1216
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,040
We hates humanses.

1217
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,960
You're out of luck.

1218
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,440
They had a very good relationship.

1219
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,280
Now, let me get this right.

1220
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,820
You found a mysterious

1221
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,840
silver ring

1222
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
with ancient engravings

1223
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,760
at the bottom

1224
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:41,760


1225
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,760
of the pond,

1226
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,780
baby bear?

1227
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,200
Yes, yeah.

1228
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,540
With her toe.

1229
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,880
I picked it up with my toes.

1230
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,520
An ancient,

1231
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,660
by accident.

1232
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,660
By accident.

1233
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,940
It just jumped onto your toe.

1234
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,420
Did you get a strangle

1235
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,640
you were wearing?

1236
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,360
Like something out of,

1237
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,980
oh, I don't know,

1238
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,100
Lord of the Rings or something.

1239
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,600
Just as a joke.

1240
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,020
But,

1241
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,420
you were just looking for

1242
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,100
You know, I hope that's not

1243
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,940
some Indian thing

1244
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,700
that would put a curse

1245
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,320
on the camp

1246
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,600
and draw some horrendous force

1247
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,820
out of the ancient.

1248
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,020
Oh, wow,

1249
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,680
the edge of the ledge.

1250
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,240
Yeah.

1251
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,480
Maybe now she has the power

1252
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,300
to combine with

1253
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,320
four other people

1254
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,760
to get it out

1255
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,720
into one super hero

1256
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,600
who can save

1257
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,380
the environment.

1258
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,340
Oh, Red, that's true.

1259
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,300
Then maybe it's the key

1260
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,080
to something good.

1261
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,220
We'll just have to see.

1262
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,020
I just have to hope,

1263
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,100
on record,

1264
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,260
that this doesn't start

1265
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,740
some horrible chain of events

1266
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,040
that no one can predict.

1267
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,040
Oh, if it does,

1268
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,880
it just does.

1269
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,460
See, look,

1270
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:30,900
it's working.

1271
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,380
Whenever we meddle

1272
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,500
with the tombs

1273
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,200
of ancient civilizations,

1274
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,900
we are toying with forces

1275
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,780
we may not completely understand.

1276
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,380
Sure,

1277
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,620
we archaeologists

1278
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:41,760
are not the only ones

1279
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


1280
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


1281
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


1282
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
and scientists think

1283
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,500
we know everything,

1284
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,760
but who knows

1285
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,300
what ancient spirits

1286
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,060
could be stirred

1287
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,860
by the disturbance

1288
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,500
of a tomb.

1289
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,600
Oh, well,

1290
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,760
maybe there's more jewelry

1291
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,660
to be found in the pond.

1292
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,820
What about that, gang?

1293
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
No, that's true.

1294
00:29:59,720 --> 00:29:59,920
You know,

1295
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,760
whenever you stumble

1296
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,960
upon a golden ring,

1297
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,840
don't run off

1298
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,080
to the pawn shop, man.

1299
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,640
Look around

1300
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,360
and see if there's

1301
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,280
more golden rings.

1302
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,180
I was looking for car keys.

1303
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,160
Right.

1304
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,740
I thought for sure

1305
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,740
I'd find some car keys.

1306
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,740
As long as you could find

1307
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,320
the car that they came to.

1308
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,240
But I find

1309
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,880
when I'm swimming,

1310
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,800
if I don't watch out,

1311
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
my ring wants to fly

1312
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,940
off my finger

1313
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,780
and get lost.

1314
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,740
Your personal jewelry,

1315
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,800
people go in with earrings

1316
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,560
and so on,

1317
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,980
that can get lost

1318
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,020
very easily.

1319
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,340
Somewhere there's

1320
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,360
an old hippie

1321
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,640
or a Mayan mummy

1322
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,440
looking for that ring.

1323
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,220
I'm just saying,

1324
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,300
if we start,

1325
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,420
you know,

1326
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,440
if some shuffling thing

1327
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,020
starts slaying

1328
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,740
something,

1329
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,360
some livestock,

1330
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,580
some tourists around here,

1331
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,040
you may want to think

1332
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,020
about throwing that ring

1333
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,560
back into that bottomless pit.

1334
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:48,840
Maybe that's what happened

1335
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,540
to the dog.

1336
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,440
Well, we hope that dog shows up

1337
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,980
just so they'll stop yapping

1338
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,060
about it and whining.

1339
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,160
But when the dog shows up,

1340
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,080
then that will start

1341
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,040
yapping and whining.

1342
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,560
Well, yes,

1343
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,020
but then we can give it

1344
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,900
to its owners

1345
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,400
and levy them

1346
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,760
the enormous fine

1347
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,640
for bringing dependent,

1348
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,400
subordinate life out here.

1349
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,740
Or we could just give it

1350
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,340
to old Cipha.

1351
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,040
Yes, just throw that little

1352
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,860
weasler out over the pond

1353
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
and the huge jaws would come up

1354
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,180
and snap and take it.

1355
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,060
That's kind of what I think

1356
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,600
we should do,

1357
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,140
is return it to nature.

1358
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,160
It's nature's nature.

1359
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,880
I mean, it's a cool ring

1360
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,440
and everything,

1361
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,520
but I just have a bad feeling

1362
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,460
about all this.

1363
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,900
Well, if you'd found it,

1364
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,900
Stang, you could do

1365
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,120
whatever you wanted with it,

1366
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,700
but possession is nine points

1367
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,480
of the law.

1368
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
You just want the ring

1369
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,260
for yourself.

1370
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,860
Hey, the Purses.

1371
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,380
It's not the right color.

1372
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,500
I'd keep an eye on old Stang

1373
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,700
if I were you, baby bear.

1374
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,180
He's got that glint in his eye.

1375
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,260
Don't get him started

1376
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,660
on that ring thing.

1377
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,920
But we've got plenty

1378
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,580
to talk about.

1379
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,760
Even if we cut the giant bugs

1380
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,820
out of the equation,

1381
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,220
there's a lot to talk about

1382
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,860
because we have to solidify

1383
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,660
and cement our plans

1384
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,260
for X Day itself

1385
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,840
and who gets what.

1386
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Without squabbling,

1387
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,840
as advanced beings,

1388
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,980
we can easily carve up the earth

1389
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,760
and essentially plant

1390
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,460
our marker flags.

1391
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,520
Well, yeah, but what happens

1392
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,260
when some other subgenius decides

1393
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,900
he wants to fight you

1394
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,060
for the Grand Canyon?

1395
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,300
Trial by combat.

1396
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,720
Or whatever.

1397
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,220
You can hold a hot iron

1398
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,900
in your hand

1399
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,720
and the one who drops it first...

1400
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,640
Well, there are a lot of old ways.

1401
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,840
But you can't just

1402
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,020
put a rattlesnake in your hand.

1403
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,800
The Gong-Jabbar.

1404
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
Stick your hand in my mailbox

1405
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,580
and if you're an unholy person,

1406
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,020
you won't get your hand back.

1407
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,320
Some psycho put a rattlesnake in there.

1408
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,820
Didn't the Scientologists make the news

1409
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,220
for putting rattlesnakes

1410
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,560
in the mailboxes of...

1411
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,260
They did it.

1412
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,840
And I don't know if anyone remembers,

1413
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,220
but Rajneesh Puram,

1414
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,500
the followers of Rajneesh,

1415
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,000
put rattlesnakes in people's mailboxes.

1416
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,340
Well, yeah,

1417
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,400
the motion picture

1418
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,860
will be temporarily disconnected

1419
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,440
until these technical aspects can be re...

1420
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Yeah, we're showing an exciting...

1421
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,800
What is that wonderful movie

1422
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,780
that's being shown?

1423
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,180
...slide show,

1424
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,160
I mean, movie show.

1425
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,360
It's happening right now,

1426
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,340
ladies and germs.

1427
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,860
It's...

1428
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,120
Normally, that has its own soundtrack.

1429
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
Look at it go.

1430
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,500
Boy, it's in eye-burning omnicolor.

1431
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,620
How parallel is it?

1432
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,640
Now, you know, if we nail that screen,

1433
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,980
to the floor...

1434
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,140
The problem is it's like...

1435
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,040
...this whole building,

1436
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,620
it might turn into a sailing ship

1437
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,720
and go shooting off across the...

1438
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:44,720


1439
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,800
It is a sail.

1440
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,300
It will catch the wind,

1441
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,920
like the wings of an enormous pterodactyl.

1442
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,500
Well, we could be like that pirate ship

1443
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,460
in the Monty Python movie

1444
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,680
that's really a building full of accountants.

1445
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,360
The Crimson Permanent Assurance.

1446
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,240
I want that to happen

1447
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,500
to my office building every day at work.

1448
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,220
Really, that is the most...

1449
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,620
If only those old accountants

1450
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,920
and British accountants

1451
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,180
would just dash in here,

1452
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,420
kill all the pigs,

1453
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,040
make me their mascot or cabin boy.

1454
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,720
No, I would prove my superiority.

1455
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,640
Then you wouldn't have to burn the building down anyway.

1456
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,060
IGTBTBD.

1457
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,620
Yes, there's only...

1458
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,340
So far, they can push a subgenius

1459
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,920
and then no farther.

1460
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,740
Yes.

1461
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,680
Well, you can push them pretty far.

1462
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,900
You're talking about moving the screen, yeah.

1463
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,940
There's a...

1464
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,800
Yeah, that's what we call moving pictures, Dr. Al.

1465
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,520
Yeah, they move around.

1466
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,360
The subgeniuses never did figure out

1467
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,160
that persistence of vision thing,

1468
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,720
but we can make the screen move like the dickens.

1469
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,900
If the screen won't move for you,

1470
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,580
we'll move the screen for you.

1471
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,360
I had a moment last night

1472
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,080
involving projection screens

1473
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,120
where I had the incredible shrinking brain.

1474
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,640
It was one of those moments

1475
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,200
when I've had just too long of a day

1476
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
and everything flips.

1477
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,520
Yes becomes no, right becomes left.

1478
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,900
And I was desperately trying to teach Dr. Dark,

1479
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,620
who projects movies all the time,

1480
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,080
how to move the projector back

1481
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,480
to make the picture smaller.

1482
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,120
It was a moving experience.

1483
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,360
And that's one of those cases

1484
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,280
where I get to prove,

1485
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,180
in case there was any doubt,

1486
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,320
that I'm definitely qualified

1487
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,340
for this particular church,

1488
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,200
the church of the subgenius.

1489
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,360
You are judging yourself too harshly.

1490
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,860
Not the uber genius or the menstruating menses

1491
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,220
or any of that stuff.

1492
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,180
No, sir.

1493
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,980
But, you know, we do occasionally get somebody go,

1494
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,920
well, I guess you people think you're very smart.

1495
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,200
So do you think you're geniuses or something?

1496
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,980
Well, no, that's kind of,

1497
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,020
almost sort of means the opposite.

1498
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,660
But what you gonna do?

1499
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,980
Well, what are they getting at?

1500
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,680
Do they want to reprimand us

1501
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,200
for our lack of smarts?

1502
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,180
No, they want to reprimand us.

1503
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,500
They want to reprimand us for thinking we're smart.

1504
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,140
Because the word genius is somewhere.

1505
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,340
...existing in the first place

1506
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,540
and disturbing their equilibrium.

1507
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,020
And you don't want to explain to them,

1508
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,140
no, Pobucker, don't you understand?

1509
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,980
What we're saying is they've missed,

1510
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,500
been misdefining intelligence all this time.

1511
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,800
You got it all mixed up.

1512
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,100
Intelligence is not wisdom.

1513
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,900
Well, you know, Pobucker, illiterate Pobucker,

1514
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,820
you might be the smartest person around here.

1515
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,460
But how are you gonna find out?

1516
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,400
Because you hate book learning,

1517
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,700
and you don't want to be

1518
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,800
pompous talking like I'm doing.

1519
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,020
Well, that's wisdom.

1520
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,960
It's not intelligence.

1521
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,880
Wisdom is the stuff you accumulate.

1522
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,000
Intelligence is what you do with it,

1523
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,480
essentially, to break it down into two.

1524
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,420
Sure, there's lots of book-smart folks around,

1525
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,520
but they don't know how to change attire,

1526
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,040
and they never brush their teeth.

1527
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,220
And they never change their attire.

1528
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,760
Right, and they never change their underwear,

1529
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
even more important.

1530
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,100
Bob don't ever change.

1531
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,920
Weren't we talking about this last year

1532
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
with the problem where subgeniuses

1533
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,500
are suddenly the smartest people in the room,

1534
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,420
and that's like a terrifying, terrifying revelation.

1535
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,060
Well, it's gonna happen.

1536
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,080
That was Pisces' moment of horror.

1537
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,020
Everybody else is gonna be gone,

1538
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,540
and subgeniuses will be the smartest.

1539
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,680
No, I mean while the people are still here, we are.

1540
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,700
Oh, well, they're probably still the smartest,

1541
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,900
even before that happens.

1542
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah, but that's a grim, grim thought.

1543
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,380
Well, it's grim that the average person

1544
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,900
is incredibly stupid, and half of everybody is.

1545
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,000
Everybody, by definition, is dumber than that.

1546
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,540
Well, but at least it's not against the law yet

1547
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,340
to sell stupid crap, or to buy stupid crap.

1548
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,880
That's even more important.

1549
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,800
Not saint stupid crap, although we could sell that.

1550
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,520
What if, what if, what if,

1551
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,720
well, people are always saying,

1552
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,540
well, those televangelists that raise all that money

1553
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,480
off our illiterate old ladies on TV,

1554
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
they should go to jail.

1555
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,300
Well, if Pastor Bob Tilton was gonna go to jail,

1556
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,040
he'd throw us in jail, too.

1557
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Uh, well, he's tax-exempt, isn't he, Stang?

1558
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,480
Yeah.

1559
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,400
Well, that saves us.

1560
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,500
That is our bulwark against meddling

1561
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,560
from the nanny state government.

1562
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,500
That's right, we pay our taxes.

1563
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,460
Oh, just before we left, Cleveland,

1564
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,460
uh, I mean, really, as we were about to leave,

1565
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,820
the mailman came, and what did I find in the box

1566
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,880
but the IRS writing the subgeniuses.

1567
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,420
The subgenius foundation,

1568
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,140
and that's a scary envelope to look upon.

1569
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,040
They're writing the wrongs done to the subgenius foundation.

1570
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,800
I was pretty sure that, um,

1571
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,540
it was gonna be an audit.

1572
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,480
They were gonna say,

1573
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,800
well, we're gonna have to look at your books,

1574
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,880
which, I, I hate to confess this.

1575
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,940
Nobody looks at those books.

1576
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,420
They're actually pretty accurate and sad,

1577
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,260
but it's still a horrible hassle

1578
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,440
to have the IRS dig through your stuff.

1579
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:55,940
It's happened to me before.

1580
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,380
Sure is.

1581
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,020
You don't want them rummaging through your door.

1582
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,560
But it turned out they were giving me money back.

1583
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,140
I was gonna say that's another option.

1584
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,440
Reverend Stunt, you made a mistake.

1585
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,480
We owe you 320 more dollars.

1586
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:05,820
Wow.

1587
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,660
No, 323.

1588
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,280
Not X day, tax day.

1589
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,900
Right.

1590
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,820
See, Dobbs comes through again.

1591
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,660
Praise Bob.

1592
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,300
See, I'm young enough that my taxes are simple enough

1593
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,780
that I always get money back,

1594
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
and a considerable amount, too.

1595
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:22,480
Good for you.

1596
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,600
So I enjoy doing my taxes every year.

1597
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,280
That's the fun time of the year for me.

1598
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,160
Boy, how amazing.

1599
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,540
To me.

1600
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,760
To me, incredible torture,

1601
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,980
but I, you know, don't have those skills.

1602
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,200
Well, you're basically bragging to the government

1603
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,460
how broke you are,

1604
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,380
and they go,

1605
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,820
oh, that's so sad.

1606
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,900
We shouldn't have taken so much from her paycheck.

1607
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,900
We're sorry.

1608
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Here's $100 back.

1609
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,200
Here's $60.

1610
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,620
Here's $57 back.

1611
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,100
Whatever.

1612
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't spend it all in one place.

1613
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,200
Spend it to keep the economy humming.

1614
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,380
Yeah, bragging about how much...

1615
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,320
You just spend it on Magic cards.

1616
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,240
It's all going to one single shop in...

1617
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,380
Magic cards are liquid.

1618
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:00,780
...my town.

1619
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,400
You can sell those, can't you?

1620
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,340
If you wanted to.

1621
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,540
Not that you would.

1622
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,820
Some of them get good value later.

1623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,920
You can save your dupes for trade and all of that.

1624
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,800
Also, Arazu, I hope I can trust you

1625
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
to look after my Magic cards right there.

1626
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,060
Yes, no light-fingered subgenius...

1627
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,840
Don't let anyone touch them.

1628
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,120
...should dare filch them.

1629
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,860
Well, you can also see from where you are

1630
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,360
in your perch here,

1631
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,220
as we overlook the card place,

1632
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,720
the playing table.

1633
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,320
Now, are those cards Magic like in stage Magic,

1634
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,700
or like in supernatural Magic,

1635
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,640
or that half-assed, kind of in-between OTO Magic?

1636
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,200
I would say they were actual supernatural Magic.

1637
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,520
Because I heard they were Devil.

1638
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,640
That was Devil stuff.

1639
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,480
The Magic is Devil stuff?

1640
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,140
Magic the Gathering or the game or whatever,

1641
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,060
that's Devil stuff.

1642
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,540
That's been Devil stuff from the get-go.

1643
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,200
I always got that about Dungeons & Dragons.

1644
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,260
From Christians.

1645
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,560
They believe in the Devil.

1646
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,220
The Devil is a Christian character.

1647
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Step outside the Christian mythos.

1648
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,300
Christians believe that all this Magic energy,

1649
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,460
or mana, comes from the Devil.

1650
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,780
Well, it doesn't come from God,

1651
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,360
because you can't command God.

1652
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,620
God commands.

1653
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,400
But to Christians, let's remember,

1654
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,740
all the old gods and other gods are demonic,

1655
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,360
because they aren't Jesus.

1656
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
So they're connected.

1657
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,900
They're consigned to a demonic role

1658
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,940
that they may not actually occupy.

1659
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,120
Still, we can't really poo-poo this, can we?

1660
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,060
Because our entire world is controlled

1661
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,880
by an invisible supernatural force.

1662
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,000
Something which does not exist

1663
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,380
controls the entire human race.

1664
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,080
And I refer to money.

1665
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,600
Money no longer even exists in coins and bills, really,

1666
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,200
but as tiny bits of symbolic energy,

1667
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,400
information flashing past faster than nanoseconds.

1668
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,380
But, uh, symbolically,

1669
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,040
a thing that doesn't exist controls everybody's life,

1670
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,280
compels suicides and everything else.

1671
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,420
All the tragedy of life.

1672
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,100
So let's not say that things that don't exist

1673
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,780
can't affect a terrible change,

1674
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,320
or wield power,

1675
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,260
or be a source of destruction.

1676
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,140
Praise Bob.

1677
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,820
All those who...

1678
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,280
If you think about it,

1679
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,500
most people only know Bob as a flat sheet of paper.

1680
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,600
And yet, look at the power he wields

1681
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,760
over their very lives.

1682
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,760
He's actually an 8D.

1683
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,720
Especially their sex lives.

1684
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,980
Well, I didn't want to talk about that.

1685
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,920
Bob won't steer you wrong, friends,

1686
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,520
in your private life,

1687
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,100
as incredible as that might seem.

1688
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,540
Is he trying to stay hip and current?

1689
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,100
Did he get that ear piercing

1690
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,500
with the safety pin in it?

1691
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,040
Bob?

1692
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,080
Is he trying to be cool?

1693
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,840
Oh, uh, maybe...

1694
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,820
Yeah, he went through a period there,

1695
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,280
you know, lots of guys,

1696
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,200
when they get to be about 45 or so,

1697
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,900
they have this kind of second childhood.

1698
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,680
I thought an infuriated fan did it.

1699
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,300
But that's not...

1700
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,040
Baby Bear, you know,

1701
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,660
that's not really J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1702
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,020
What?

1703
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:18,460
That's a clever...

1704
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:18,900
No.

1705
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,860
That's a clever replica.

1706
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,120
What? What?

1707
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,040
It's realistic.

1708
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,420
It looks just like him,

1709
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,740
but that's just a dummy.

1710
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,260
It's what we call a deodad.

1711
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,360
That's why he's hanging there

1712
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,340
as if he was dead.

1713
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,920
Something to be given to God.

1714
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,520
But that's not that weird

1715
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,500
for Bob, either.

1716
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,160
The idea is that...

1717
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,000
I just thought he was...

1718
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,100
I just thought he was being freaky.

1719
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,620
You know, he's into that kind of stuff.

1720
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,180
Well, he is.

1721
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,100
He's being freaky.

1722
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,820
He's with it.

1723
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,560
He's relaxed.

1724
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,000
He's a slackful, a studly guy.

1725
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,380
But he's also a phony.

1726
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,820
He's hanging up there

1727
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,080
so that all the malevolence

1728
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,500
will go into that dummy

1729
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,220
and not the real J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1730
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,880
And Bob didn't even plan it that way.

1731
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,240
But he's naturally lucky,

1732
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,400
and so that's the way

1733
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,440
it will flow.

1734
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,580
If that's not Bob,

1735
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,260
I just don't know

1736
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,800
what to believe anymore.

1737
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,140
In some ways, all of us...

1738
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,900
That's an idol.

1739
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,680
...throws my whole world view

1740
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,160
into chaos.

1741
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,400
Baby Bear, it's an idol.

1742
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,100
An idol.

1743
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,660
We are not idolaters here.

1744
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,540
Well, and it's also a sinkhole

1745
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,400
for the bad vibes.

1746
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah, but it sucks

1747
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
those bad vibes in.

1748
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000


1749
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,660
To say Bob.

1750
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,000
And in that respect,

1751
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,200
how is that dummy

1752
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,180
so very different from us?

1753
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,160
Not at all.

1754
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,880
Are we not dummies for Bob

1755
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,860
in some ways?

1756
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Yes, dang.

1757
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,940
It's terrifying.

1758
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,360
You know, we get

1759
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,380
the anti-dummy.

1760
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,020
We get the anti-slack,

1761
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,820
and that keeps him

1762
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,940
from getting the anti-slack.

1763
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,600
Well, one thing about surfing

1764
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,100
the luck plane, friends,

1765
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,720
which every subgenius should do,

1766
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,180
when you're surfing,

1767
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,960
you will wipe out

1768
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,080
from time to time.

1769
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,820
That's just the way things are.

1770
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,780
So you've got to get back

1771
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,840
on the board.

1772
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,860
Cowabunga.

1773
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,680
And continue to surf

1774
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,240
the luck plane

1775
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,660
instead of whining

1776
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,360
and complaining

1777
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,420
about how you barked

1778
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,100
your shins

1779
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,200
and your elbows.

1780
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,380
And that's the way

1781
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1782
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1783
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1784
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1785
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1786
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1787
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1788
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1789
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,380


1790
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,600
you're going to do it.

1791
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,260
Oh, whatever else you did.

1792
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,700
Because...

1793
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,260
It's just because

1794
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,900
you fell off your woody

1795
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,540
and it came up

1796
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,720
and knocked you in the head

1797
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,340
and you can't ever surf again.

1798
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,620
Don't hold that against

1799
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,060
the luck plane.

1800
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,260
Right.

1801
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,560
It's worth the gamble,

1802
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,000
we say.

1803
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,640
Yeah.

1804
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,960
And make sure

1805
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,280
you send your money in

1806
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,740
because if you become disabled,

1807
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,740
then it'll be harder

1808
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,340
for you to send that money

1809
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:20,920
our way.

1810
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:21,980
Right.

1811
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,700
That's why we want

1812
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,900
to keep you healthy, folks.

1813
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,220
First things first.

1814
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,660
Producing.

1815
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,380
Live on

1816
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,380


1817
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,380


1818
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,380


1819
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,420
livestock for Bob.

1820
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,900
Yes, the corrals must be filled

1821
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,200
on that last day

1822
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,780
when the bellwethers lead

1823
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,980
the bleating herds

1824
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,700
up the gleaming ramps

1825
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,080
into the saucers.

1826
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,080
No one seems to disagree.

1827
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,500
That means you all

1828
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,120
got to get to work

1829
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,900
and have more kids.

1830
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,700
Reverend Rachel Weardigan

1831
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,860
is doing the right thing.

1832
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,940
She's got one

1833
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,500
and something in the oven.

1834
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,440
How about that,

1835
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,060
ladies and gentlemen?

1836
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,800
A round of applause

1837
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:55,540
for Bob.

1838
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,920
Sub-Razoo.

1839
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,720
There's the seed

1840
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,700
deliverer there.

1841
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,220
The rising generation.

1842
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,760
He had something to do

1843
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:03,940
with this, too.

1844
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,480
Of sub-dini.

1845
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,280
Welcome to your new life,

1846
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,240
Reverend New Razoo.

1847
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,140
Everything will be different.

1848
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,960
Everything will be born again.

1849
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,720
You know, some people,

1850
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,520
when they become parents,

1851
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,000
they go,

1852
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,480
oh, now I've got to buckle down.

1853
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,140
I can't.

1854
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,000
I got to quit wasting my time

1855
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,360
on this sub-genius stuff.

1856
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:26,360


1857
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,020
Oh, I've got to be

1858
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,580
a real square now.

1859
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,080
And others go,

1860
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,440
wait, suddenly I have a kid

1861
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,020
and a job and,

1862
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,740
wait, this is my last chance.

1863
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,380
If I continue in this direction,

1864
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,580
I'll be a pink forever

1865
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,780
with a station wagon

1866
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,280
and a cute family.

1867
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,880
This is my last chance

1868
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,400
to completely wreck

1869
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,640
my life forever.

1870
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,980
I know.

1871
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
I'll go to work

1872
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,380
for J.R. Bob Dog's

1873
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,120
full time.

1874
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,880
Well, some said...

1875
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,240
Yes, indeed.

1876
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,400
If you look at the timeline,

1877
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,200
my son, Zandy,

1878
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,660
was born August 1979,

1879
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,780
and by January 2nd, 1980,

1880
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,800
the first sub-genius pamphlet

1881
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,840
hit the streets.

1882
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,300
And our first mentally ill

1883
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,900
sub-geniuses started appearing.

1884
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
Thanks, Buck.

1885
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,860
She lives on Main Street

1886
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,900
Bland and normal

1887
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,420
Main Street.

1888
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,600
So, yeah, it doesn't have to be

1889
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,160
the end of the world.

1890
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:29,660
She has a station wagon,

1891
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,220
subscribes to House and Garden.

1892
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,980
You can be that square

1893
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,380
with the square job

1894
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,480
and the square car

1895
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,840
and the square little children.

1896
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,260
A regular fella,

1897
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,260
regular clothes,

1898
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,180
regular appearance.

1899
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,880
And still be like Bob.

1900
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,140
He's the squarest,

1901
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,780
most normal-looking person

1902
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,700
of any of us.

1903
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,080
Yes, but that glint

1904
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,440
in his eye shows that

1905
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,900
the sub-genius thing,

1906
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,900
is not cryptic,

1907
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,580
where he is concerned.

1908
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,360
But some sad subs

1909
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,560
have to put up with

1910
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,600
having all their sub-genius stuff

1911
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,660
in one little closet-like room.

1912
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,500
And everything else

1913
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,080
is a normal house.

1914
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,080
That normal eyes is,

1915
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,440
and that normal people

1916
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,660
wouldn't be uncomfortable in.

1917
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,320
But a true blue,

1918
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,120
sold-down-the-river sub-genius,

1919
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,900
his entire house

1920
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,920
is his slack altar.

1921
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:20,960
Well, you know,

1922
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,260
a lot of that depends on...

1923
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:22,300
The thousands of

1924
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,820
undustable doodads.

1925
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,200
That depends on the spouse.

1926
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,960
Yes, the spouse sometimes

1927
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,020
just can't handle

1928
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,040
all these grimacing

1929
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,700
little statuettes and so on.

1930
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,700
And so they're sort of in the

1931
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,580
dad's rumpus room.

1932
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,820
We don't go in there.

1933
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,340
Come and look at the carpets in here.

1934
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,880
See, you don't have to worry about it

1935
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,300
with Arazu and Rachel Weard again,

1936
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,820
because their entire house

1937
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,940
is beautiful,

1938
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,320
bulldada.

1939
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:45,580
Of course.

1940
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,680
Slack altar.

1941
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,500
We would expect nothing less.

1942
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,980
If they wanted to go straight,

1943
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,880
they'd have to throw

1944
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,960
everything away

1945
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,060
and buy everything anew.

1946
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,880
And I heard you don't have

1947
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,120
that much money after you have kids.

1948
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,460
Too painful.

1949
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,840
Too hard to do.

1950
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,340
And besides,

1951
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,960
these so-called hoarders

1952
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,940
don't have too much stuff.

1953
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,020
They just don't have enough room.

1954
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,760
That's it.

1955
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,540
So contribute.

1956
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,540
Donate.

1957
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,700
And...

1958
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,600
So that I will have more room

1959
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,500
in the slacker room.

1960
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,800
I don't know how much stuff

1961
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,440
was brought,

1962
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,980
but the bulldada auction

1963
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,980
at these events

1964
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,960
is a great time

1965
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,860
to pick up more dust catchers.

1966
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,240
And haul them home.

1967
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,760
So we hope...

1968
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,320
We don't know what's in the hopper,

1969
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,600
but we may be able to sell

1970
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,860
more stuff,

1971
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
like the wonderful videos

1972
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,000
that were just donated

1973
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,280
by Mr. Sistar.

1974
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,980
He sure is generous

1975
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,060
for a greedy old Republican type,

1976
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:38,620
isn't he?

1977
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,000
He's playing it on both sides.

1978
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,860
Every time I make fun

1979
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,380
of Republicans on the computer,

1980
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,100
I'm looking at a monitor

1981
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,920
that he donated to us.

1982
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,600
He's the biggest socialist

1983
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:50,840
in the world.

1984
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,000
He's the biggest socialist

1985
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,620
in the whole gang.

1986
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,980
From each according

1987
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,860
to his means

1988
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,800
to each according

1989
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,540
to his needs.

1990
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,300
That's right.

1991
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,220
Oh, well.

1992
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,620
But remember,

1993
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,040
a revolution is not a tea party.

1994
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,260
But you know,

1995
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:02,900
if you do have to...

1996
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,960
If you do have to

1997
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,540
pretend to be normal,

1998
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,980
there's no shame in that.

1999
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,480
That's...

2000
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,480
The masks of abnormality

2001
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,420
were spoken of early

2002
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,080
in the church's history

2003
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,660
by Dr. Philo Drummond,

2004
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:16,980
who...

2005
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,700
I think it's...

2006
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,180
As an arms salesman

2007
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,900
for the conspiracy,

2008
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,000
you should really

2009
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,980
look pretty straight.

2010
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,480
It's great to be

2011
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,560
a secret subgenius

2012
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,720
burrowing into the belly

2013
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,520
of the beast

2014
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,300
like some liver fluke

2015
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,880
or whatever.

2016
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,600
You seem to be normal.

2017
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,240
Like the Kandiru Toad.

2018
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,720
Like the Kandiru Toad.

2019
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,560
There are warnings

2020
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,620
posted around

2021
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,760
about the Kandiru Toad,

2022
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,300
I believe.

2023
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,440
And you know,

2024
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,120
you seem to be,

2025
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
in this scenario,

2026
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,960
eager disciple of normalcy.

2027
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,780
But you're actually

2028
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,960
a subgenius. And when you're supposed to be working on your computer, you're actually

2029
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,020
listening to clandestine radio shows and all sorts of

2030
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,180
forbidden subgenius activity. That's my life

2031
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,220
at work. And they couldn't get along without you. Headphones in

2032
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,200
and just listening to weird stuff. Although they got rid of the dress code

2033
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,180
last year, so now I just wear metal t-shirts.

2034
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,900
That's pretty cool. Metal? That might pinch a little bit.

2035
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,120
You wouldn't want to go to work for a church of subgenius because we won't let you do that.

2036
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,480
We'll log every single keystroke you do. You can't look at

2037
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,960
slack hole or... I don't know. I don't do that that much. I still get a lot of work done.

2038
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,400
Yes, exactly. See, that's why I never get to do any of that.

2039
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,240
I'm my own boss. That means I'm not paid by the hour.

2040
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,840
But if you work for the church, then isn't being on Scrub part of

2041
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,440
working for the church? Make the updates

2042
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,660
and check in on everything.

2043
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,720
He bullies himself to get himself to work.

2044
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,600
Well, you know, a subgenius can only get to work

2045
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,280
after procrastinating, and that's what I use the Scrub Genius Forum for.

2046
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,100
That's the pressure that builds up that forces the action to take place.

2047
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,860
I'll go on and on TLDR about the job I'm about to have to do.

2048
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,540
TLDR? And then the job only takes about five minutes once you're energized

2049
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,480
with procrastination. Or it seems like it takes five minutes because you're not there

2050
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,860
when it's happening. You're off doing...

2051
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,960
You're off doing something else while your hands are busy.

2052
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,240
But I know it's true in your case that if you stop working for your conspiracy job,

2053
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,760
the whole enterprise would crumble like a rotten pumpkin.

2054
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,160
Actually, it's probably going to do that whether or not I stay because...

2055
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,640
You're prolonging its life.

2056
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:37,420
There's a huge exodus at my job right now, and I'm kind of having fun watching the whole thing

2057
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,120
deteriorate, and everyone is just all falling around all the manager's ears,

2058
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,880
and it's kind of fun to watch.

2059
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,860
I don't know how I could say this, but there must be a...

2060
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,860
subgenius here somewhere in this organization. Nothing else explains it.

2061
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,860
We've got to root him out, man.

2062
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,060
Right-o, Mr. Big.

2063
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,380
Well, that won't happen.

2064
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:06,860
Well, I've kept several really despicable pink offices going

2065
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,800
with my skills and talent and hard work.

2066
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,260
I used to work for Christian filmmakers.

2067
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,140
TV commercials and industrial films and stuff like that.

2068
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,280
The Christian with the clodhoppers who run across...

2069
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,480
But by golly, I got paid 20 bucks a day.

2070
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,200
And with that, I could go home and buy Dobbs heads.

2071
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,800
Hundreds and hundreds of Dobbs heads.

2072
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,180
Plus you could splice in...

2073
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,660
And eventually dinner.

2074
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,700
Splice in single frames of, like, penises and things like that.

2075
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,180
Right, yeah.

2076
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,320
In Christian films, yes.

2077
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,900
You get subliminal projection to make them sit up straight.

2078
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,840
If that subliminal crap worked,

2079
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,880
we subgeniuses...

2080
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,840
would be way ahead of where we are.

2081
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,500
I don't think it works.

2082
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,820
How about superliminal projection?

2083
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,620
Instead of some tiny little thing that just flashes on for a moment

2084
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,280
that your subconscious mind picks up,

2085
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,620
a huge towering sign that's always there

2086
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,580
that's too big to see consciously,

2087
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,220
but you're actually loading it as information

2088
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,800
while you're in its presence.

2089
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,440
Right, you can only tell that there's been a Dobbs head looming over you

2090
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,400
when you take your first helicopter ride.

2091
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,820
And see that that mountain really is a Dobbs head,

2092
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,240
only you have to be seeing it from way, way back.

2093
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,440
All right, I don't want to get disgusting and gross here,

2094
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,720
but I heard from parents of small children...

2095
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:30,940
Ew!

2096
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,920
...that a Dobbs head is great for toilet training.

2097
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,940
If you're having trouble with that little moppet on the pot

2098
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,260
and he's being a handful,

2099
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,140
if you put a Dobbs head in front of the toilet,

2100
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,600
it just causes him to let go and all the problem is solved.

2101
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,760
No kidding.

2102
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,020
People, more than one person has told me this anecdote

2103
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,540
that I wasn't prepared to hear, didn't want to hear,

2104
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,080
but now you've heard it.

2105
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,900
I thought the gross part of that story was parents with small children.

2106
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,680
That was the gross part, of course.

2107
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,020
Hey, I can add to that a grandparent's story.

2108
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,560
Uh-oh, even worse.

2109
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,780
When, of course, a subgenius radio host

2110
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,360
does the unthinkable and becomes a parent,

2111
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:15,040
of course you train your kids to say Bob stuff.

2112
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,180
Shineful, shineful.

2113
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,880
There's a...

2114
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:22,020
There's a recording of my daughter at age two and a half or three, maybe.

2115
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,240
You have to love Bob. You have to.

2116
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,780
Right, right. Yeah, yeah.

2117
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,560
If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out.

2118
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,380
Bob you out.

2119
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,320
He'll kill you. He'll Bob you out.

2120
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,140
You have to love Bob.

2121
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,800
He loves you, but you love Bob.

2122
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,060
You have to.

2123
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,860
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

2124
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,800
He'll kill you.

2125
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,500
He'll Bob you out.

2126
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,960
He'll Bob you out, folks.

2127
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,740
You heard it here first.

2128
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,040
If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out, man.

2129
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,620
This morning...

2130
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,900
Yeah, she does it perfectly.

2131
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,360
You have to love Bob. You have to.

2132
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,320
It's really good.

2133
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,100
Doing your homework.

2134
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,900
You can see I have played that little piece of tape a lot.

2135
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,620
Well, this very morning, before we left the big house,

2136
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,340
I checked my email, and my daughter,

2137
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,880
the one who said that...

2138
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,100
Oh.

2139
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,940
...had sent me a recording of our grandchildren doing the same thing.

2140
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,240
In unison.

2141
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:24,800
In unison.

2142
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,820
The first recording was just one of them going,

2143
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,220
He'll kill you.

2144
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,680
He'll Bob you out.

2145
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,400
But they don't have a Texas accent.

2146
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,780
She had to teach them that.

2147
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,120
Bob will kill you.

2148
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,360
And then you could hear both of them.

2149
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,080
We'll Bob you out.

2150
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,240
We'll kill you.

2151
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,760
We'll Bob you out.

2152
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,780
We're gonna Bob you out.

2153
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,400
We're gonna Bob you out.

2154
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,560
We're gonna Bob you out.

2155
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:48,560


2156
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,920
If you could just see these little subgenius grandchildren.

2157
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,800
Don't kill Bob, Daddy.

2158
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,220
I love him.

2159
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,500
I taught my nephew that.

2160
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,540
That was one of the first words I taught him.

2161
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,620
Easy to say.

2162
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,560
Impossible to forget.

2163
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,440
He still responds to it.

2164
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,060
He just turned four.

2165
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,820
He still remembers.

2166
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,940
If he comes into my house and sees the Dobbs head,

2167
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,060
He'll never forget.

2168
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,160
No.

2169
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,580
Well, you know, to this day,

2170
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,300
I've run into people who go,

2171
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,880
Oh, wow.

2172
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,740
This Bob.

2173
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,420
Bob thing.

2174
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,260
My parents made me memorize that stuff back in the day.

2175
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,480
I hate that crap.

2176
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,140
And the person saying that is 45 or 50 years old.

2177
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,080
A sad, sorry sight.

2178
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:31,560
Yeah.

2179
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,760
But there's always the new crop.

2180
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,180
Now, my kids were never all that impressed by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

2181
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,720
He was just around too much.

2182
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,500
You know, the presidency.

2183
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,580
They learned to pee on Bob's head very early in the game.

2184
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,940
They didn't have to be taught.

2185
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,860
I'm told that toilet training thing really does work.

2186
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:54,380
There's something about the Dobbs head that removes the tension and the kids can just go.

2187
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,700
Or scares them.

2188
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,240
Maybe.

2189
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,340
Or scares the crap out of them.

2190
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,700
Well, and when you get older,

2191
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,780
and I'm not saying any of us have to do this.

2192
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,080
No, you don't have to do any of that.

2193
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,080
Say you have problems with, you know, sexual release or something.

2194
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,100
Some, I'm not saying who,

2195
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,440
have found that, you know, having a Dobbs head,

2196
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:20,100
uh, mask on the sex partner or something like that.

2197
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,640
You know, a Dobbs head pinned up on the headboard.

2198
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,420
We have the, uh,

2199
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,020
at the moment of crisis, so to speak.

2200
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,360
You can look up and, you know, it's not queer if it's Bob.

2201
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,300
Okay, guys?

2202
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,580
I mean, that's, you don't have to, not that I would know.

2203
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,120
And so what if it is?

2204
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,460
You don't have to, yeah, right.

2205
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,360
So what if it is?

2206
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:36,820
Exactly.

2207
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,800
Yes, you're queer for Bob, aren't you?

2208
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,640
Sure.

2209
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,160
We all are.

2210
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,540
Yeah.

2211
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,560
We like it.

2212
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:42,760
Yeah.

2213
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,860
We used to, we used to have an ad on the back of the catalog.

2214
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:45,920
Yeah.

2215
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:45,920


2216
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:45,920


2217
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:45,920


2218
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,360
It said, Bob's post office box is a hole.

2219
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,940
Be cool like gay people and fill Bob's hole.

2220
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,180
Some people didn't get, you know, people get offended too easily.

2221
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,180
You gotta be careful.

2222
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,300
They're all gloomy, grumpy gusses.

2223
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,720
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry,
