1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,760
Ah, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,260
Welcome to Hour of Slack 870,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,540
which in this case will actually be

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,920
Reverend Susie the Floozy's

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,300
Bob Slacktime Funhouse episode number 447

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,040
from WREK in Atlanta,

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,640
Susie's Sniper Show.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,540
There was a place they wanted me to be.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,240
My next stop...

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,260
The Potomac in the sunset

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,960
Is a river turned to flame

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
And the bloom of cherry blossoms

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,740
Is like nothing you can name

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,680
That's why we like to be

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,980
In the sun

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,980
In Washington, D.C.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,660
One of the good things about America...

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,560
We know that everybody in America

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,260
is either a cowboy or a gangster,

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,720
but I've been very disappointed.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,400
I haven't seen a St. Valentine's Day shooting yet.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,360
I haven't even found a body in the trunk of a car,

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,720
and I'm very disappointed.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,540
Sounds like blood.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,360
Wondering when we'd write another visit?

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
Our job is to see that our task force gets oil.

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,720
Task force?

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,160
Yes.

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,500
I'll send it if you have to, but get the job done.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,840
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,420
We have a...

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,740
Please, we have a number of leads.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,540
How do we know that?

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,680
I'd raise you in shock.

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,700
Number one detective found this clue.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,480
I must confess that this doesn't match with nothing.

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,100
Anything to your bond?

38
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,780
Yes, the holes do seem to match.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
The

40
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,940
action.

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,420
Everybody was going towards a common goal.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Everybody was excited for everybody else.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,400
And all of a sudden I felt like I was a big loving.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,340
I just, I all of a sudden found a place

45
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,360
that I felt like maybe I could grow into.

46
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,820
Why not? What's happening?

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,200
Look, just go about your business

48
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,660
like it was any other Saturday afternoon.

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,900
Read your papers and look at your TV.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
Anything you want, but nobody leaves the house.

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
Something fishy about all this.

52
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,780
Official business.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
What sort of official business?

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,820
Mr. Benson is a former agent of the Secret Service.

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,540
You should understand.

56
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,100
He

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:29,920
Thanks Cristo.

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
It could just go from bad to worse

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,060
It starts like a kiss, it ends like a curse

60
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,560
But nothing's true

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,340
She said everything is permitted

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,820
She got jewels on her tongue to time the sauce

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,000
She drives all morning in unmarked cars

64
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,920
But nothing's true

65
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,520
It's all permitted

66
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,860
She got these special tools just to keep things tight

67
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,980
But they robbed her eyes long ago of light

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,500
But nothing's true

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,400
She told me it's all permitted

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,760
She got inscrutable poise

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,840
and nihilist charm

72
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,880
She gets her three through twos in her arm

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,580
She said nothing's true

74
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,240
She said everything's permitted

75
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,280
She nods on graves of marbles cold and white

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,780
Her dreams surround the sun like a satellite

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,120
She said nothing is true

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,680
She told me it's all permitted

79
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
The spiders milk her thigh

80
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,380
It does not faze her

81
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,100
She cleans her skin with a Krypton laser

82
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,060
Nothing is true

83
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,600
Everything is permitted

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,660
She got heels so high

85
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,020
She got a gown so thin

86
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,260
Her eyes sock the whip before it tames her sin

87
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,120
She said nothing's true

88
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,620
Everything is permitted

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,200
She got a perfect technique to clone

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,940
Y'all better remember you're all alone

91
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,040
Because nothing's true

92
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,560
She said everything's permitted

93
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,280
You hear me?

94
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Yeah

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,420
A steamer trunk full

96
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,240
And not any of that stepped on street crap

97
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,660
Call the D.A. and tell them to cough up their private stash

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,060
And I want it delivered by a brown-shoed square in the den a night

99
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,300
Yeah, I could use a few bucks for bullets and gas, too

100
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,100
Oh yeah, my secret message this time is

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,420
Your chickens are not sane

102
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,100
Got that?

103
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,120
Hello?

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,320
Hello?

105
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,440
Hello?

106
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,140
Ah, incompetence

107
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,800
Evil Susie, will you get off that damn phone?

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,220
You've been playing two-bar all night

109
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,420
Haven't you had enough fun?

110
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,740
Come on, watch a little portable battery-operated TV like a good American

111
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,840
Hey, watch it

112
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,140
That nail polish is stinkin' up the whole van

113
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,720
Yeah, isn't it, though?

114
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,100
Some members are overreacting to the real threat of the fire

115
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


116
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


117
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


118
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


119
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


120
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


121
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


122
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


123
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


124
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


125
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


126
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


127
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


128
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


129
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,100


130
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,520
Oh, gee, isn't there anything else on?

131
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,360
Eh, it's the October sweeps

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,640
All the networks are so creatively bankrupt

133
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,060
They've got the same lame idea for a miniseries

134
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,100
The crazy snipers

135
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,380
Oh, man, their ratings must be lower in Satan's basement

136
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,100
Where's the jiggle?

137
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,920
Why ask me?

138
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,420
Oh, jeez, Forza

139
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,340
Mm-hmm

140
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,360
I'll say such a crazy scenario

141
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,680
Like a crazed sniper driving people crazy

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,660
And mowing down yuppies here in the D.C. area

143
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,260
If that were true, that'd be pretty crazy, right?

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,420
Yeah, right, crazy

145
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,500
ClichÃ©, too

146
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,800
Hey, uh, yeah

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,900
Uh, yeah

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,280
Say if it were really happening, uh

149
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,140
Mm-hmm

150
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,620
Right

151
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,280
You'd never suspect me, right?

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,180
You?

153
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Oh, right

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,720
All that running and shooting and running and reloading and shooting

155
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,160
Right, you working

156
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,300
I'd probably do a better job in this jerk, though

157
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,520
He's no Andy Robinson, that's for sure

158
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,300
I don't know about that

159
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,840
You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at 1530

160
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,900
1530, this is news on the radio

161
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,600
The highest importance

162
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Take care not to miss it

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,900
Oh, hey, maybe it's a major plot twist in this dog of a show

164
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,960
To the person who left us a message at the Ponderosa last night

165
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,220
The person you called could not hear everything that you said

166
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,860
The audio was unclear

167
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,660
Call us back so that we can clearly understand

168
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,540
You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things

169
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,000
You asked us to say, quote, your children are not safe

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,580
Oh, oh

171
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,320
We feel it's important to provide this information to the public

172
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh, you morons, you incompetents

173
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:32,480
Oh, look, Fleas, I gotta borrow the caprice and go out and shine some crabs or whatever

174
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,700
Don't wait up, okay?

175
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,840
And don't leave the van unattended

176
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I ain't going nowhere till my toenail's dry

177
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,220
You haven't seen that box of curtain rods I had anywhere, have you?

178
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,380
Oh, yeah

179
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,300
Boy, you got some fancy tasting curtain rods

180
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,580
Curtain where? What, QVC?

181
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:00,080
Never saw one like that early American wood number with the Charlton Heston signature engraved on it

182
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,540
Gee, uh, you, uh, didn't mess with that, did you, Fleas?

183
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, I needed something to hang our wet G-strings on

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,280
What?

185
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,160
Oh, by the way, when I nailed it up, it, uh, shot a hole in the side of the van

186
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,180
Oh, my, yeah, it's a new thing, see?

187
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,540
What do they think of next?

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,980
Curtain rods that drill their own pilot holes for convenient hanging

189
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,840
Ah, you shouldn't worry about that, Evil Susie

190
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,460
Hanging's too good for you

191
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,940
Ah, so you say

192
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,080
Later

193
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,880
It was cold in the house, so I slept in my car

194
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,760
And I steamed up the windows, then it started to rain

195
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,920
And I dreamed about sex, and I dreamed about peppers

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,620
Woke up doing 85 in the passing lane

197
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,840
I didn't have a map, so I went to Virginia

198
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,900
Cause I know how to get there, and cause that's my girlfriend's name

199
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,920
So I was in Virginia, and Virginia was in Boston

200
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,680
Boston was indifferent, Virginia was the same

201
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,160
I need a new place to go

202
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,320
A new place where people wear their clothes inside out

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,680
Where everyone was born on UFOs

204
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,260
First I'll learn their language, then I'll ask them out

205
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,120
I was talking to a girl at a truck stop in Texas

206
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,900
We were counting up our problems

207
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,160
I had the most

208
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,220
I held her hand, then I told her I was lonely

209
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,300
I was in the middle of the road

210
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,300


211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,300


212
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,760
Suddenly she got up and left

213
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,520
I ate her toast

214
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,120
Four of hearts, eight of spades

215
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,780
Two of spades, jack of diamonds, jack of clubs

216
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,260
Why have you disturbed our sleep?

217
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,740
Awakened us from our ancient slumber

218
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,840
You, a eye

219
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,540
One by one

220
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,320
One by one

221
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,860
And we will take you

222
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,920
You have a gun?

223
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,700
No

224
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,800
Know how to use one?

225
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,020
After four years in the Marine Corps

226
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,120
Here, you think we'll need these?

227
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,900
You'll never tell

228
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,860
Let's get going

229
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,940
I'm so dull and uninspired

230
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,780
My boyfriend left me and I just got fired

231
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,640
Gotta go out and buy a gun

232
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,440
Gotta blow the case out of everyone

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,300
And there's a feeling that I've never known before

234
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,380
People screw around with me and they don't know what to store

235
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,220
That's the best you can do when my finger's on the trigger

236
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,320
Somehow I just can't

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,300
Feel all right with her

238
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,760
Got no money, don't be annoyed

239
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,720
Just buy a gun and make some noise

240
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,700
As you smile and open the door

241
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,700
You can take a look out of any store

242
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,060
It gives the feeling

243
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,300
That I've never known before

244
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,300
People screw around with me and they don't know what to store

245
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,120
That's the best you can do when my finger's on the trigger

246
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,200
Somehow I just can't

247
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,180
Feel all right with her

248
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,720
Every day I walk through the valley of death

249
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,960
I shall fear no evil

250
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,840
I got a gun

251
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,280
Keep the same foot position

252
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,320
However there's one difference in establishing your gun point

253
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,300
You put your gun straight in the middle of your face

254
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,340
of the line between eight and the low house and after you've gotten it in that position move it

255
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,840
a yard towards eight for a right-handed shooter this prevents you from shooting your gun in a

256
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,020
jerk and you have a little better chance of moving your gun smoothly with the target

257
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,920
i felt this incredible surge of power like god must feel when he's holding a gun you're sick man

258
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,540
you're sick i don't like that like i said shut up don't play god just because you've got a gun

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,280
but you see sheriff that's the way it is when you've got a gun you are a sort of god

260
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,960
if you had the gun i'd be the chump and you'd be the god the gun gives you the power of life

261
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,160
and death it's a funny sort of feeling to have control of life and death you must have had it

262
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,360
during the war you could miss a man if you had a mind too or you could kill the dead in his tracks

263
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,460
and that made you kind of god and i liked it without the gun or nothing

264
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,160
and i never had anything before i got one first time i got one of my hands and killed a man i got

265
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:01,960
some self-respect i was somebody like this kid over here if that cat pistol was a real gun and

266
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,380
i didn't have a gun he'd be a kind of a god too and if i wanted my life i'd worship the

267
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,420
ground he walks on and i'd pay him the half a million dollars for my life because life is all i

268
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,620
had

269
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,280
but the squirt doesn't have the gun i have and i can lose the lightning

270
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,460
some members are overreacting to the real uh threat of the sniper if you're more likely

271
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,740
to be hit by lightning sniper do you think some people in this community are overreacting

272
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,840
well sir i i again is not my nature to speculate but i think that um

273
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,040
that can you comment on reports um about the sniper having called

274
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,420
the fbi and five times or more not getting through and being frustrated and calling them

275
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,160
incompetent is there any sense that uh things have been straightened out if they need to be

276
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,540
we're going to release the information when it's appropriate it's all coming together at once

277
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,580
some things take longer than others just like an illness some things don't

278
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,960
respond to treatment right away some cases don't respond to our methods right away we

279
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,360
try new things sometimes it takes a little bit longer we would have liked to solve this by now

280
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,280
but it's it's not going to happen it's going to take a little bit longer but it's going to take a

281
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,440
little bit longer certainly not for the uh the sake that we're trying our best so it may take a

282
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,420
little longer but we're certainly confident that we're going to resolve this there are witnesses

283
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,020
that we have not talked to and whereas this is a delicate matter we feel like in some ways there

284
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:40,340
may be some people with some type of immigrant status that may be witnesses oh lord oh that's

285
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:47,140
right illegal immigrants i think i'm going to be sick immigrants i knew it was them we need to get

286
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,560
rid of them is this all routine seems to me to be kind of overboard i mean all this checking and

287
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,000
everything as though you expected this town to have you noticed any strangers in town during

288
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,980
the past week no are you sure sure i'm sure i know everybody in this bird the only strangers

289
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,820
we get are tourists we want to know from either you or your deputies the minute any stranger

290
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,320
doesn't keep going through then this isn't routine no it isn't can you tell me we'll not be in a

291
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,260
position to take any questions as stated earlier everyone knows that all of our citizens are not

292
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,880
citizens are and have been at risk the person or people have demonstrated a willingness and

293
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,900
ability to shoot people of all ages all races all genders and they've struck at different times of

294
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,340
the day different days at different locations we recognize the concerns of the community

295
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,440
now why would i want to get myself killed because it's five minutes to five and a shot

296
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,420
might bring those state troopers storming all over the joint before the president arrives

297
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,020
i can put you away in two seconds by twisting your arm again

298
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,600
fbi fbi yes good morning sir whoa you have indicated that you want us to do and say certain

299
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,980
things you asked us to say quote we have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose in quote we

300
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,320
understand that hearing us say this is important to you like a duck in a noose like a duck in a noose

301
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,100
like a duck like a duck like a duck duck duck duck

302
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,920
We have not been able to assure that anyone, any age, any gender, any race,

303
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,160
we've not been able to assure anyone their safety with regards to this situation.

304
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,140
How do we know that?

305
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,800
We want to stress that that is not our interest in this matter.

306
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,660
Here they are on their way to school on a beautiful spring day.

307
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,200
Duck and cover.

308
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,820
They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover method.

309
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,480
Who's laughing now?

310
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,060
What?

311
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,980
Please understand that that is not the interest of the task force,

312
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,040
not the interest of the Montgomery County Police Department

313
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,200
as we continue to put this puzzle together.

314
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,820
Oh, how I love it when the pieces of puzzles come together.

315
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

316
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,740
There was an immediate lure of laughter at the other end.

317
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,420
Then?

318
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,460
You're wrong about God and the gun, sir.

319
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,360
The thrill killers.

320
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,380
Homicidal maniacs on a bloody rampage of horror.

321
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,420
Hungry axes bursting for the blood of the living.

322
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,060
Thrill killers starring Cash Flag as Mad Dog Click.

323
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Kill crazy psychopathic maniacs who would do anything for a kick.

324
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,860
Maniacs with a gun.

325
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,720
The thrill killers with Liz Renee,

326
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,800
love-starved nymphomaniac whose insatiable passions

327
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,620
drove men to the very brink of hell.

328
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,540
Oh.

329
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,120
Fly with Mad Dog Click as the head chopper,

330
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,520
three,

331
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,640
as they blaze a terror trail of manipulating evil

332
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,660
in one of the thin cities of the world.

333
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,420
Cash Flag, Liz Renee,

334
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,540
the thrill killers.

335
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,860
The recoil kicked the gun hard into her shoulder

336
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,900
as the slender cylinder blasted out toward the approaching stormtroopers.

337
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,260
Yes, are we retreating?

338
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,260
Not at all.

339
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,400
No chance.

340
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,700
We're heading in.

341
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,300
Get moving.

342
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,720
The approaching stormtroopers,

343
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,320
finally presented with a target,

344
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,200
opened fire.

345
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,160
Just as the grenade hit the ground ten meters in front of them,

346
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,580
exploding into a billowing cloud of green smoke.

347
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,520
We're going in.

348
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,380
Over the roar of the engine,

349
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,220
she could hear the thuds of her erstwhile attackers

350
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,380
falling out of the sky

351
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,000
as the specially formulated smoke

352
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,140
burned into the speeder bike's power connectors.

353
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,900
But where are we going?

354
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,300
Shada swung the speeder bike around.

355
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,440
She knew that eventually,

356
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,280
truly, the pain of that loss would catch up with her,

357
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,060
but for right now,

358
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,920
she had only enough room for a single emotion.

359
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,180
Rage.

360
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,160
We don't know the rise

361
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,900
of our fantastic range.

362
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,080
We don't know the half of it, baby,

363
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,020
or half my age.

364
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,760
You won't have the money.

365
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,620
You will drop my car.

366
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,300
You will do the cocaine.

367
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,100
You will sleep with stars.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,260
You will know the wrath of my fantastic rage.

369
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,440
You don't know the half of it, baby.

370
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,460
You will be there all new ways.

371
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,180
You will have the money.

372
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,920
You will be my girl.

373
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,580
You will be my honey.

374
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,440
You'll be wearing hell.

375
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,720
Hell.

376
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,580
You will wear the brunt of my outstanding love.

377
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,580
You don't know the half of it, baby.

378
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,480
You'll be my girl.

379
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,380
You will have the money.

380
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,260
You will sleep with stars.

381
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,780
You will start the cocaine.

382
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,200
You will drop the past stars.

383
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,380
You will disappear like owls.

384
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,200
You couldn't find you big on the

385
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,200


386
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,740
You won't have the money.

387
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,720
You don't know the half of it.

388
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,600
You will be my girl.

389
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,340
You will be my honey.

390
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,060
You'll be wearing hell.

391
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,920
You will have the money

392
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,800
You will have the time

393
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,180
You will have the time

394
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,580
You will have the time

395
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,640
You will have the time

396
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,420
You will have the time

397
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,900
Pete knows that kids play with guns.

398
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,520
I'm telling you, every one of your friends is a potential smacker.

399
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,040
Hey, so are you!

400
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,280
Where'd they get you?

401
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
Only the leg wedge.

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,760
I'll make it.

403
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,360
What do they expect a handful of patrols to do?

404
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,620
Clean out this whole jungle?

405
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,420
Give me a hand.

406
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,420


407
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
I'll get a couple of companies and I'll clean it out pronto.

408
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,700
You're not here to fight chaps.

409
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,640
You're here to fight time.

410
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,360
And you're doing great.

411
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,340
Yeah, doing great.

412
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,980
Watching my men get knocked off like ducks in a birdbath.

413
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,780
Like a duck, like a duck, like a duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.

414
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,200
In color.

415
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
What's the sense of it?

416
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,980
That's what I'd like to know.

417
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,100
I can do it and I'm going to do it.

418
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,680
But you're an American citizen.

419
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,680
Sure.

420
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,480
And one minute after five, I'm going to be a very rich American citizen.

421
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,920
You'll never get away with it.

422
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,680
Turn it off, will you?

423
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,760
So scary.

424
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,420
You're so terrible.

425
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,420


426
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,420


427
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,620
It's terrifying if we dare you to see the maniacs are loose.

428
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,100
The world's first horror movie made in hallucinogenic hypnovision.

429
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,860
Hallucinogenic horror is not only on the screen, but in the audience all around you.

430
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,240
It's a hallucinogenic nightmare.

431
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,180
You are put in the middle of the picture with bloodthirsty maniacs all around you.

432
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,120
Not only on the screen, but live maniacs in the audience.

433
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
All over the theater looking for victims.

434
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
Almost idle maniacs.

435
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,500
Escape from an asylum.

436
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,060
They terrorize a community.

437
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,300
Reliable love stars women become their prey.

438
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,960
And you'll see these same bloodthirsty maniacs in the audience all around you alive.

439
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,720
For the thrill of your life.

440
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,880
See, the maniacs are loose.

441
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,300
You're doing fine here.

442
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,340
Good.

443
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,840
If it weren't for these snipers, a three-man hit today.

444
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,080
What do you recommend?

445
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,120
If you really want to sleep easy at night, I recommend sealing off every door and window with bulletproof lucite.

446
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,600
Wouldn't we all suffocate?

447
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,860
Well, I should hope not.

448
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,520
Let's get down to suffocation thing.

449
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,040
If I do say so, it took a little courage.

450
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,060
Next door, real right-wingers.

451
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,060
American flag up every day.

452
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,100
Real fascists.

453
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,400
Ought to be gassed.

454
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,200
You know the type.

455
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,720
Oh, yes.

456
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,280
Brother, the fight they put up.

457
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,700
But I told them.

458
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
These are liberal times.

459
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,460
Hey, Dad.

460
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,420
You want the Magnum 357 in the back?

461
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,740
In the house?

462
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,720
Darn it, Bing.

463
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,320
I told you not to play around with my guns.

464
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,240
No, I do not want that in the house.

465
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,700
That is my car gun.

466
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,300
My house gun is already in the house.

467
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,640
Now, put that right back in the glove compartment.

468
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,420
And don't let me catch you fooling with my guns again.

469
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,440
I'm sorry, Dad.

470
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,040
Great kid.

471
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,660
I thought you said you were an accountant.

472
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,720
I am.

473
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,840
What do you have all of these guns around there?

474
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,120
You know.

475
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,560
They can be found anywhere in thisáº§n

476
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,580
Was it revenge?

477
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,940
Or pleasure?

478
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,940
Or was it a strange compulsion?

479
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,840
Bring it on.

480
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,400
Give it to me then.

481
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,120
The kindling, which is the most divine and Ã§al three philippines.

482
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,000
Something within him.

483
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,560
Something stronger than the self-control he sought.

484
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,480
He tried many ways to overcome his strange compulsion.

485
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,100
But each attempt ended in failure.

486
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,100


487
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,100


488
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,100


489
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,400
further frustration. Believe me, I fight the impulse. I fight and fight and fight it, but

490
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:33,980
sometimes it's too much and I've got to give in to it. Can he be satisfied with just looking?

491
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,080
Or must he go further with the object of his interest?

492
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,900
What strange compulsion is it that separates the mild deviant from the potential killer?

493
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,700
What prompts a man in one moment of anger to risk his career, his life?

494
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,580
I can still hear a mocking laughter.

495
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,660
Thought as though I were stripped naked as I ran.

496
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:23,060
Is he one of many or of a tortured few? You decide when you see strange compulsion.

497
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:33,180
Guns. Why? The right-wing extremists. Disarm them and us liberals will disarm. Right? Refill?

498
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,120
You have used up all your strength. How can one actually be ì²ï¿½ Dhaka?

499
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,320
That's because you have said no.

500
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,440
It's enough slurping around such a funny call.

501
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,660
Today the prime minister has been called to site by a ê·¸ë¬ëê¹ established president.

502
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,220
Welcome youeyed politician!

503
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,100


504
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,480
Take it away

505
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,840
Time bomb in elevation

506
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,260
Time bomb send a train

Time bomb ship into orbit

508

Time bomb blow your way

509
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,460
Emotion explosion

510
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,860
Time bomb ready to go

511
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,940
Right to society

512
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,600
Time bomb ready to go

513
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,200
Brain bending, knees trembling

514
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,260
Time bomb way to go

515
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,920
Maze popping, head dropping

516
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,960
Forgot it's gonna blow

517
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Time bomb

518
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,300
Time bomb

519
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,520
Time bomb

520
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,280
Time bomb

521
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,720
Time bomb

522
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,000
Time bomb

523
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
Uh, damn

524
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,360
WREK Atlanta

525
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
Secret Chesapeake Bay Area

526
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,060
Rest Stop Mobile Unit

527
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,860
Oh, it's you

528
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,980
No, no one's called for you

529
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,400
Why?

530
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,880
Uh, no reason

531
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
Oh hey, now I think I figured out

532
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,200
The end of this lame-ass miniseries

533
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,020
I'm watching

534
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,140
Oh, great

535
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,700
Oh, you know, the devious workings

536
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,080
Of your brilliantly-enriched

537
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,080
Sensitive mind

538
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,620
Utterly enthralling

539
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,980
No, I sure do

540
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Okay, so just think

541
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,220
It's like the Washington, D.C. area, right?

542
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,140
Mm-hmm

543
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,940
And it's someone intimately experienced

544
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,300
With rifle fire, right?

545
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,020
Uh

546
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,420
And it's someone that I wouldn't suspect

547
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,060
In a million years, right?

548
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,040
Uh, someone like, uh

549
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,860
J.S.

550
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,740
K.

551
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,800
Uh-huh

552
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,720
Uh-huh

553
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,760
Thanks, I mean, who has the motive?

554
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,980
Who has the opportunity?

555
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,700
And don't forget that juicy

556
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,620
Dead Sinatra mob connection

557
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,980
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

558
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,020
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

559
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,040
Yeah, I see your point

560
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,120
Point schmoint

561
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,820
Everybody's got one

562
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,640
Hello?

563
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,720
Hello?

564
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,300
Damn

565
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,900
What?

566
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,280
Golly!

567
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,980
The president?

568
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,080
The president?

569
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,880
Well, that's different

570
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,720
That's right

571
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,740
The president?

572
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,620
Why, that's the greatest thing ever happened to this town

573
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,600
We go down in secret, can't we?

574
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,160
Sorry, kid

575
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,300
But I want to get up close

576
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,040
No dice

577
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,380
Uh

578
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,280
No

579
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,760
Something I don't understand

580
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,740
And though we made every precautionary check

581
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,680
We never went to extremes like this unless

582
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,040
Unless you were tipped that there was to be an attempted assassination

583
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,020
You don't mean it

584
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,720
I mean it

585
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,320
But you're FBI

586
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,180
Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the president

587
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,960
We're using everybody this trip, Mr. Benson

588
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,220
Have a look down there

589
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,500
State troopers

590
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,900
Your local law enforcement agent seasoned us

591
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,600
It was no idle fear

592
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,700
Adelaide, our ambassador, made a ringing denial

593
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,120
That the United States was in any way involved

594
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,140
Hallelujah

595
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,880
Hallelujah

596
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,500
Hallelujah

597
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,240
How could we admit that this ludicrous operation

598
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Apparently spawned by the insane

599
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,800
Had actually come out of the bowels of the Central Intelligence Agency?

600
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,600
The whole country would be a laughingstock

601
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,600
You

602
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,080
You're not telling me that you're a laughingstock?

603
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
You told me to fix the television set?

604
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,340
You told me to set?

605
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,960
Get your stuff and fix it, it'll keep you from getting patriotic

606
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,480
Don't do something, I'm going to attack you sitting here

607
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,400
Fix the set and shut your mouth

608
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,860
I don't like what you say anyway

609
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,420
The Los Angeles police picked up a small-time stool pigeon night before last

610
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,860
Shot through the lungs and left for dead

611
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,280
Before he died, he told them something was up

612
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,220
Some dirty squeal pigeon stooled on me

613
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,720
What do you mean something was up?

614
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,340
An assassination attempt

615
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,400
I mean the tip of a dying stool pigeon

616
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,080
This stoolie seemed very proud of being in America, but he was not the only one who was killed by the stool pigeon

617
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,080


618
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,040
He was the only American before he kicked off

619
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,620
Meaning crime is crime, but this is something else again

620
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,960
Right, so we can't take any chances

621
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,980
Let's go

622
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,720
Let's roll, guys

623
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,360
In the war room that night, the agency argued for further escalation of the plan

624
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,220
Throw the fat in the fire

625
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,480
I refused, I called the whole thing off and took the blame

626
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,680
That is the first thing I learned as president

627
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,200
And the most important thing

628
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,100
Is to be rule number one in the guidebook for presidents

629
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,160
If you don't want the truth to come out, take the blame

630
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,540
Good evening, my fellow citizens

631
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,760
This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance

632
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,600
How do we know that?

633
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,080
Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact

634
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,620
That a series of offensive military equipment is being initiated

635
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,620
Where they're found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons

636
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,940
Thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere

637
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,240
Further action will be justified

638
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,920
I have directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventuality

639
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,580
So I took the blame

640
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,600
So much so that it has become almost a generic term now

641
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,460
Rare is the man who doesn't somehow have his bay of pigs under one name or another

642
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,580
I had decided to frighten them, to tell them

643
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,240
How serious I regarded the situation

644
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,340
So I told him emphatically

645
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,220
President Kennedy is not speaking lightly

646
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,780
He means what he says

647
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,500
His tone shocks me

648
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,520
I have never heard him so serious

649
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,060
Moral outrage

650
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,840
I dare not question him

651
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,160
I don't know how much he knows

652
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,640
We hopped over to Vegas to have a meal with Frank

653
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,560
And he was there

654
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,080
He was a family friend

655
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,820
Or so I thought

656
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,240
Betty, bring in the gear

657
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,340
Put the car out back

658
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,780
Bart, do you see the back door is locked tight?

659
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,040
Outrageous

660
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,020
Check the cellar to be sure

661
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,180
I got me some teachers to lick

662
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,600
I still don't understand

663
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,540
It should be obvious to you that if anybody wanted to kill the President

664
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,940
He could do a beautiful job of it

665
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,320
Right from this window of yours

666
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,480
With the love of Mike

667
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,880
You'll see when we get to it

668
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,160
This gun's got a heavy recoil

669
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,060
It won't stand still

670
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,960
We got just three seconds to nail the President

671
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,060
Tommy gun would do just as good

672
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,220
Tommy gun stinks

673
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,020
No accuracy, no punch

674
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,700
No one with a gun on him is gonna see Mr. Kennedy here

675
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,640
If Kennedy gets killed now

676
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,980
Everybody will say I did it, huh?

677
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,260
I am not gonna take that rap

678
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,000
This is the gun

679
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
When I was in the Army

680
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
So I wasn't in the Army

681
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,080
Just a question an hour later

682
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,780
If it gives the President a bit of an edge, why don't we get it now?

683
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,340
They won't hurt us, he said so

684
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,820
Because it's convenient, Ellen

685
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,940
You think these cronies are a problem?

686
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,640
They would kill the President and then take off

687
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,100
Leaving us behind to identify them

688
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,480
Sure, sure, and I meant it

689
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,460
You indicated that this is about more than violence

690
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,720
Call us at the same number you used before

691
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,120
We remain open and ready to talk to you

692
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,400
About the options you have mentioned

693
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,160
We are waiting to hear from you

694
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,700
A specific threat in other words?

695
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,080
How would you describe the situation we're in right now?

696
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,620
FBI, good morning

697
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:08,960
FBI

698
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,320
FBI, come in, sir

699
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,580
implementation of an evacuation There's no parks

700
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:28,820
Hey Are 0 sound coming out of my ear?

701
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:28,960
What's that sound?

702
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,820
That's the fireman

703
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:29,820


704
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,480
And what the hell are they filthers doing?

705
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Prestige

706
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,300
We're always

707
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,260
One, one, no

708
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,600
Let's go

709
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,420
What are we going that?

710
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,120
Robert seems to have a little more on the ball.

711
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,160
I need to back and tag this.

712
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
You're going to let me in on whatever the hell is going on here.

713
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm sure I'll forget a lot to talk about.

714
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,540
You've moved some of the time from that podium when you've spoken to the sniper.

715
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,980
You've spoken somewhat apologetically.

716
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,460
Each and every time, you've spoken courteously, even respectfully, to the sniper.

717
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,140
Why?

718
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,520
It just seems to be the right thing to do.

719
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,560
Do the right thing.

720
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,700
The sniper's a killer, Chief.

721
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,400
Yeah.

722
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,500
Yeah, I never killed a president before.

723
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,580
The guy in school?

724
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,540
Don't ever say that again.

725
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,200
Ever.

726
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,200
I got no feeling against the president.

727
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,580
I'm just earning a living.

728
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,740
By treason.

729
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,780
Don't listen to this guy.

730
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,380
I know guys like that in the army.

731
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,020
We're just doing a job, that's all.

732
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,180
Todd, what's going on?

733
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,100
They're planning to assassinate the president, Judd.

734
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,640
Which president?

735
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,600
It's not funny, Fisker.

736
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,060
The president of the United States.

737
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,320
He arrives here this afternoon.

738
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,220
You're kidding.

739
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,080
Okay with you?

740
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,700
No, you're not kidding.

741
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,400
I'm kidding.

742
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,100
The president?

743
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,740
Kill the president?

744
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,880
They can't.

745
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,320
They couldn't do a thing like that.

746
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,680
They're stinking traitors.

747
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,760
They're Benedict Darnels.

748
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,040
Are you guys crazy?

749
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,580
You can't do a thing like that.

750
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,740
Sit down, reckless.

751
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,360
Don't you realize what that means?

752
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,480
That's assassination.

753
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,600
He's your president, too.

754
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,000
Take a deal with you, boy.

755
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,000
We kill you instead of the president.

756
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,080
That's even, Stephen.

757
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,280
Okay with you?

758
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,260
Thought not.

759
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,740
Anybody else want to take the heat off the president?

760
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,980
How about you, Sheriff?

761
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,920
It's a bad joke.

762
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,220
Anybody else want to volunteer?

763
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,520
For commies.

764
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,320
For enemy agents.

765
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,340
All right, who is behind it?

766
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,540
I haven't the slightest idea.

767
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,920
What's in it for you?

768
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,720
Rape?

769
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,520
Ace those crabs.

770
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,820
No, no, not rape.

771
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,280
Kill him.

772
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,820
That's what you like.

773
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,200
Kill him.

774
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Maybe shooting down NRPWs, huh?

775
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,180
Sit down and shut up.

776
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,960
I know you got away with it, so I got it.

777
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,640
Section 8.

778
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,360
You went out on a Section 8.

779
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,660
Section 8.

780
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,360
Psycho in charge of killing, huh?

781
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,460
You know, I knew guys like you.

782
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,660
Killing was sweet.

783
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,660
Rather kill a man than love a girl.

784
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,180
A real kick.

785
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,220
The thrill with the guts.

786
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,400
That's it.

787
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,400


788
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,400


789
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,400


790
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,400


791
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,520
Or maybe you didn't like your CEO.

792
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,620
Maybe you shot him in the back.

793
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,000
That in.

794
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,840
Maybe you killed...

795
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,780
Like I said...

796
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,500
Shut up.

797
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,880
Because tonight at 5 o'clock, I kill the president.

798
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,680
One second after 5, there's a new president.

799
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,100
What changes?

800
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,380
Nothing.

801
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,900
What are they paying for?

802
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,800
Nothing.

803
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,440
Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken the job, Sheriff.

804
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,340
You'd have taken it.

805
00:42:59,480 --> 00:42:59,980
You think so?

806
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,400
Yeah.

807
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,740
Do you have any feelings at all?

808
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,980
No, I haven't, lady.

809
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,700
They were taken out of me by experts.

810
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,160
Feelings are trapped.

811
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,660
Show me a guy with feelings and I'll show you a sucker.

812
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,400
You think so?

813
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


814
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


815
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


816
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


817
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


818
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


819
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,400


820
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,340
Weakness makes you think of something beside yourself.

821
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,900
If I had any feelings left in me at all, it'd be for me.

822
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,100
Just me.

823
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,560
Don't you ever think of your mother or your father?

824
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,760
Think of him?

825
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,920
I used to think of him a great deal.

826
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,660
My mother wasn't married.

827
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,700
My old man was a dipsaw.

828
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,520
They left me in a home.

829
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,520
A home.

830
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,300
You don't start making more sense, we're going to have to put you in a home.

831
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,120
You already put me in a home.

832
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,640
Then we'll put you in the crooked home each hour in 60 minutes.

833
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,320
Okay.

834
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,380


835
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,380


836
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,380


837
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,380


838
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,600
I'll be good.

839
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,660
Doesn't that worry you?

840
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,020
I haven't got time to worry.

841
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,140
I just make my plans and carry them out.

842
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,520
That's what John Wilkes Booth thought too.

843
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,260
Booth?

844
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm no actor.

845
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,300
Busting my leg on a stage so I can yell down with a tyrant.

846
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,440
If Booth wasn't such a ham, he might have made it.

847
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,160
He got pretty far at that though.

848
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,400
The guy who killed Garfield didn't make it either.

849
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:03,820
Him?

850
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,280
He didn't plan anything.

851
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,600
Just took a lucky shot.

852
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,200
Strictly left handed, just like McKinley.

853
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,360
And then Gary got the chair for his friend.

854
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,360


855
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,360


856
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,360


857
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,360


858
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,360


859
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,360


860
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,080
And then I had Rose Booth.

861
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,320
He had to fight in a crowd.

862
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,880
A hate crowd.

863
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,240
Well nobody ever did.

864
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,460
Up till here.

865
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,740
I'm just a guy making a living.

866
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,160
You'll never get away with it.

867
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,640
Shut up.

868
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,360
It's a terrible thing.

869
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:21,960
It's a terrible thing.

870
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,760
Turn it off, will you?

871
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,720
It's just another man.

872
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,060
A man.

873
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,860
He's not just a man.

874
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:25,540
President.

875
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,680
That's what's so funny.

876
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,480
The laugh is on the guys who are paying the freight.

877
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,520
All the sloot and they don't even know what they're doing.

878
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,680
A half a million clams for absolutely nothing.

879
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,160
You're a born killer, that's all.

880
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,700
Yeah.

881
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,780
I know a couple.

882
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,120
Just when you get real good at something, you're a murderer.

883
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,340
Yeah, over the years I've been a murderer.

884
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,620
In a day or two, if you kill a guy, you can knock over a whole platoon.

885
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,780
Or a guy had a bomb that killed a hundred thousand people just like that.

886
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,980
And maybe gets more medals.

887
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,120
Here, you put a slug in a double-cross and squirt that isn't even worth burying.

888
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,180
You have to take the gas.

889
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,740
We hopped over to Vegas to have a meal with Frank.

890
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,540
We met in the Lounge of the Sands.

891
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,680
Frank showed up with a girl on his arm.

892
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,000
This was not unusual.

893
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,320
Frank alone would have been getting a little beat up.

894
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,320


895
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,420
been cause for concern. One lesson Pop had omitted, beware of Italians bearing gifts.

896
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,760
Perhaps I should have suspected something, but with Frank, it never seemed like printing,

897
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:28,560
only generosity. Or maybe that's just what I wanted to believe. Always lost in a great big crowd.

898
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:38,240
Oh, nothing. I'd never seen that happen before, such total rapture. He had a quality, a glow that

899
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:45,100
was hard to define. I'd seen it only once before, somewhere. In an odd way, it seemed political.

900
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,880
Don't give me that politics jazz, it's not my racket. We went to the main ballroom then to watch

901
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,760
Frank's show, but from the moment the spotlight picked him out on the dark stage, I found myself

902
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,900
riveted. There were a thousand people in that huge room, seated on rising tiers, many behind

903
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,060
tables, midway through the news. Always lost in a great big crowd.

904
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,660
I hated that crowd. I used to dream about the crowd once in a while. I used to see all those

905
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:20,960
faces scratching and shoving and biting, and then the mist would clear, and somehow all those faces

906
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,940
would be me. All me and all nothing. But the instant he started to sing, all noises ceased.

907
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,880
Silverware stopped clicking. People stopped talking. Meals went uneaten as the audience,

908
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,100
with its eyes, devoured Frank Sinatra.

909
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,420
Huh?

910
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,400
Francis Albert.

911
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,240
Francis Albert, Sinatra.

912
00:46:47,940 --> 00:47:02,280
And I sing love songs, mostly after dark, mostly in saloons. I've had some very good years.

913
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:15,220
Nothing has happened in the motorcade group. There has been a shooting. I repeat, a shooting in the motorcade in the downtown area.

914
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,480
Hey, Harry! Look out!

915
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,320
Oh, no!

916
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,780
Oh, no!

917
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:34,840
V. Harvey O. didn't have no daddy. He never caught a break, he never drove a caddy.

918
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,920
Join the Marines to learn.

919
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,160
Join the Marines to learn.

920
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:01,340
Join the Marines to learn.

921
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,120
Join the Marines to learn.

922
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,300
To cool some heels and the oil pallet.

923
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,260
Unfriendly country, but he was unafraid.

924
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:25,100
He would wave to the people from a passing motorcade, at 11 miles an hour, such a gently speed.

925
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,920
11 miles an hour at the time of place agreed.

926
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,060
They pulled their limousine down and watched me slow and green.

927
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,140
Nothing like the shower at 11 miles an hour.

928
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,220
There!

929
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,680
Yes, it is.

930
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,040
Yes, it is.

931
00:49:40,940 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes, it is.

932
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:24,180
Yes, it is.

933
00:50:43,240 --> 00:51:06,220
Yes, it is.

934
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:25,140
Yes, it is.

935
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:42,540
Yes, it is.

936
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,280
Yes, it is.

937
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,120
Yes, it is.

938
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,060
Yes, it is.

939
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,740
Yes, it is.

940
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:21,480
Yes, it is.

941
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,880
Yes, it is.

942
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,540
Yes, it is.

943
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,660
are snoring.

944
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,360
Ugh.

945
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,000
Ugh.

946
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,960
Ugh, I wish Evil Susie

947
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,480
were here.

948
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,000
Ugh, she'd know what to do about this.

949
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,920
Damn it, I'm gonna have to go

950
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,740
deal with them.

951
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,440
Ugh.

952
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,700
Ugh, all the times we're already done.

953
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,500
Hey, hey!

954
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,340
Wake up in there!

955
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,700
Wake up!

956
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,100
Hey, idiots!

957
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,640
You morons!

958
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,520
Starting to get

959
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:12,880
mad!

960
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,460
Wake up!

961
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,840
Just

962
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,400
smash it open!

963
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:20,480
Ugh.

964
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,300
All I did was

965
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,360
cough on it.

966
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,200
Oh!

967
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,520
So what do you

968
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,060
do with yourself

969
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,440
to savor yourself?

970
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,680
Hey, little girl,

971
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,960
I'm in a world

972
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,340
I've been a bad,

973
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,100
bad boy

974
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,400
I'm on my knees

975
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,420
Forgive me, please

976
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,860
I've been a bad,

977
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,620
bad boy

978
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,840
I'm not the man

979
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,080
you think I am

980
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,640
I'll give you

981
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,540
warning

982
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,920
You wake

983
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,480
up and find me gone

984
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,900
Some sunny morning

985
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,860
Things that I said

986
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,120
run through my head

987
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,140
I've been a bad, bad boy

988
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,420
My past is black

989
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,420
I'm coming back

990
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,640
I've been a bad, bad boy

991
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,840
In my time

992
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,860
I've done a lot of things

993
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,900
I'd better not weep it out

994
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,700
Remember

995
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,100
But you'll see

996
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,240
Such a changing me

997
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,300
I'm making you forget

998
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,000
Your resolution

999
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,960
To run and hide

1000
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,660
from this confusion

1001
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,600
You've got to face it

1002
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,060
I'm a loser

1003
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,060
I'm just a cloud

1004
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,200
when I'm down

1005
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,240
And while you sleep

1006
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,020
I softly weep

1007
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,880
I've been a bad, bad boy

1008
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,840
Here come the nights

1009
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,840
We'll be all right

1010
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,940
I've been a bad, bad boy

1011
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,300
Just hold my hand

1012
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,240
And I'll take you with

1013
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,560
The sun and moon

1014
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,920
Are always shining

1015
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,520
One fine day

1016
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,620
You'll turn to me

1017
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,840
And see a silver lining

1018
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,860
Yeah

1019
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,560
guitar solo

1020
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,680
guitar solo

1021
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:35,880
guitar solo

1022
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1023
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1024
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1025
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1026
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1027
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1028
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1029
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1030
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:35,880


1031
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,020
guitar solo

1032
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,520
guitar solo

1033
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,640
guitar solo

1034
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,140
guitar solo

1035
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,140
guitar solo

1036
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,340
guitar solo

1037
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,340
That's all you have to say for yourself?

1038
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,260
Oh, you little weasels

1039
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,700
You got me right in the center of my beehive

1040
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,660
Nobody hurts my hair

1041
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:03,340
And you

1042
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,300
Oh, Bob

1043
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,220
laughter

1044
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:05,520
laughter

1045
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:05,860
laughter

1046
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:05,860


1047
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:05,860


1048
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:13,120
Damn! Oh, not again. Now I'm going to have to fill out paperwork.

1049
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,460
You stupid idiot!

1050
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,720
Trap. Big, beautiful booby trap.

1051
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,180
He played a part real good. Should be in television.

1052
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:34,760
1.18 a.m. Long day. Completely won over the local population.

1053
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,000
As Sherman did in Atlanta.

1054
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,400
You'd better prepare the appropriate paperwork for action unbecoming a field officer.

1055
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:46,000
You better be ready to redefine unbecoming, baby.

1056
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:54,260
Thanks to the flus busting up my little game, I'm going to be getting kind of bored.

1057
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,120
Oh, no!

1058
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,340
We couldn't take a chance on the president's safety once it was proven the assassins were in town.

1059
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,020
The president went on to Los Angeles.

1060
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,020
Someday those guys are going to start taking you for amateurs, huh, Mr. Wilson?

1061
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:09,780
I hope not.

1062
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,080
The bad dream is over. Now we can sleep in peace.

1063
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:19,280
You asked us to say, in the form of a postscript, quote...

1064
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,480
No, no, no, I'm all right. Just thankful to be alive.

1065
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,460
I'm on my hands and knees in the parking lot of the branch office in Spokane.

1066
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,340
Death is seldom kind and never fair.

1067
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,220
I know that good is stronger than evil.

1068
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,680
And yet sometimes it's difficult to see.

1069
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,420
Sure, everything's fine.

1070
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,100
Gee, well, look at me, saving the world again.

1071
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,720
Oh, I sure couldn't have done it without some help tonight.

1072
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,400
Like, oh, the Jim Carroll band with Nothing Is True.

1073
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,760
That was really good to start us out.

1074
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,580
Oh, and then Virginia, that timely little song by Ed's Redeeming Qualities.

1075
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,740
That's all I know about that.

1076
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,880
That one, and I'm not saying no more.

1077
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,440
And I'm sure there's an anti-disclosure clause tied up with

1078
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,680
Buy a gun by Pink Lincolns.

1079
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,980
Oh, yes, and Das Clown.

1080
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,520
Oh, they hopped in with Time Bomb.

1081
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,080
That was really timely.

1082
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,620
Tick, tick, tick.

1083
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,940
Oh, what else did we have?

1084
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,580
Oh, yes, Was Not Was with Eleven Miles.

1085
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,580
per hour.

1086
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,760
And Malamok.

1087
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,360
Oh, they were in their loud, fast, and hard Jiminy Pistol.

1088
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:51,440
And then we capped it off with Bad, Bad Boy by Paul Jones

1089
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,440
from the Privilege soundtrack.

1090
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,260
And we couldn't have done it without Frank Sinatra.

1091
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:00,200
Yes.

1092
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,080
From a movie he made in the mid-50s

1093
