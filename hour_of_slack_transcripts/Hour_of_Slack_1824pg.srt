1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
... a choice of a primordial importance, because Japan does not forgive divorce.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,700
Hi, I've missed somebody.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,380
I'm here tonight to talk about the rights of the unconceived.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,280
That's right, you heard me right children.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,340
The rights of the unconceived.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,800
Those as yet not conceived.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,200
Abstinence has been said on this stage already tonight, but it bears repeating. Abstinence is murder.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:50,080
We're talking about going into a singles bar and protecting the rights of thousands of potential unborn people.

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,660
I don't understand you.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,780
I just don't understand you.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
I don't understand.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,860
I don't understand the things you say.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,540
I can't understand a single word.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,880
I don't understand you.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,380
I don't understand you.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,800
I just don't understand you.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,220
I heard a sound. I turned around.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Turned around to find the thing that made the sound.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,980
The Soap Genius Hour of Swag.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,560
Designed to make those synapses fire. Designed to make that blood circulate. Designed to make that heart throb even harder.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,520
Yes. Causing vasoconstriction and violent headaches at times.

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm going to go to the spooky post office.

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,980
Get the evil mail.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Yes.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,700
And then...

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,280
And then...

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,860
Oh, the lobotomy. That's right. I have an appointment for a lobotomy.

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,640
Who?

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,780
Who?

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:02,940


31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
This is a scary neighborhood this morning. Strangely silent.

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,340
No one on the streets.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,380
Are the kids all in school or have they all been taken away to the future?

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,480
To be kept as slaves on Mars?

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:22,940
Ha.

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,580
Ha.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,680
Ha.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,220
Ha.

39
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,220
Ha.

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,080
It was born for good luck.

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,780
And that you can see.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,980
I got seventeen dollars.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,660
So don't you mess with me.

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,360
Don't you know I'm here.

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:43,800


47
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,660
Oh.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:48,700
Oh.

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,040
Everybody knows I'm here.

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,780
Somebody knows I'm here.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,480
Oh.

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,040
Oh.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,580
Jerry Givensindeら, eighth grader from the late ol Delos ind frågg,

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,340
Don't you know?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,480
Chick will shoot some Şeyda?

56
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,800
They are

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,040
овой

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,140
happened to it? He fell from grace, yeah. All great men have their fall, and he met his, that's for sure.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,700
Wasn't he present in Carbonite? Who runs the Subgenius Foundation now? Me, Dr. Philodrum, and like it was always

60
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,520
intended, I've taken over the Subgenius Foundation. You mean you're a corporate corporation?

61
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,840
What? You're now in Dallas, Texas. Listen, this is more international than Dallas anymore.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,960
Sure, that's a fine place to be born, but you know, the boy grows up and has to go out into the world.

63
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,740
I know, he has to go west, young man. It's the same thing over and over. It's like all the bad old movies you watch.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,240
Oh, he's Hawaii, that's great. Let's go. Well, what's your question, caller?

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,340
Well, I was just wondering. You thought Ivan Stang was going to give a better show than we do, huh?

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,440
Is that what it boils down to? Well, you know, you don't have to hit me in the corner about it.

67
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
Where's the kill button here?

68
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,580
No, no.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,480
It's right over there, doctor. There, that should teach these callers what happened when they got too big for their britches.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,420
I was just kidding, caller. I don't...

71
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,940
Too late. You snuffed him. He's gone.

72
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,160
I was just looking around and hit that button.

73
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,280
Well, you just looked at him and he blew up.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,480
I want to clear... I don't want anybody to think there's any rivalry between Reverend Stang and myself.

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,180
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

76
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,040
But, uh...

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,820
Well, look, I mean, there's only so much I can say. My lawyers really caution me not to say very much about...

78
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:47,820


79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,160
Oh, what a...

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,780
...the situation because it could be damaging in the upcoming situation.

81
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,120
I won't refer to it or really lead you on as to think it could be anything more than that.

82
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,100
Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

83
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
The door seems to be jammed.

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,380
Please check the lock on your side.

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,380
You get him from where you are.

86
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,520
We won't harm you.

87
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
We only want to help you.

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,620
Look, I just punched up one and I'm opening...

89
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,000
Should we zoom the...

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,440
...dead?

91
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,940
Yeah, so it's best to go back to two and really...

92
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,500
That's it. Okay, now watch that reading and as it...

93
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,840
Watch the needle on five now. Watch it.

94
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,300
This knob is...

95
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,320
Which is the switch to get it out?

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,040
Master...

97
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,760
Okay, there we are.

98
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,300
What is the real dope on the cortex bond problem anyway?

99
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,140
Oh, you find yourself with...

100
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,600
What if you...

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,020
And I punched two up.

102
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,920
Tonight we have a very special show for you.

103
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,060
Tonight we have Jesus.

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Is that your cognomen?

105
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,780
Yeah, Reverend Jesus Christ of the Church of the Subgenius.

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,540
Okay, and...

107
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,720
You can just call me Jesus or...

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,160
The Lord, Teacher, Messiah, King of Kings, JC.

109
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,700
JC, one of those.

110
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
And the Subgenius is an organization.

111
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
The Subgenius Foundation, is it?

112
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,220
Right, the Subgenius Foundation is more of the...

113
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,240
I'm the CFO of the Subgenius Foundation,

114
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,480
which is sort of the capitalistic branch of the Church of the Subgenius.

115
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,900
The Church of the Subgenius is actually the religion around it.

116
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,400
I mostly just run sort of the t-shirt and book-selling side of it.

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,720
I brought the money, the tax collectors and change collectors back into the church, actually, I feel.

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,860
I see, so you righted the table.

119
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,460
Exactly.

120
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,760
Okay, well, there, that works.

121
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,740
And you can perform marriages.

122
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,940
That's true.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,280
Well, anyone who's ordained in our church, we have a...

124
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Much like, different than many other religions, we have a one-time $30 fee.

125
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,660
We sell eternal salvation, or triple your money back.

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,360
That's been our promise for over 25 years.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,420
And anyone who is ordained, as myself, through the church,

128
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,800
which you can do on...

129
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Can I put my shameless plug?

130
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,160
Okay, no money.

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,020
You can't say money, but you can say the website.

132
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,600
www.subgenius.com

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,500
But all of our reverends, yes, can perform marriages,

134
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,160
sickenings, healings, and we'll marry you to anyone or anything.

135
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,400
We don't really have any laws.

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,180
I can marry you to your wallet, to your Dr. Demento hat.

137
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,160
Well, there you go.

138
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,900
Has that been auctioned off?

139
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,620
That's been auctioned off.

140
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,660
The Dr. Demento top hat.

141
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,120
That's on my website, Rome.org, R-O-M-M.

142
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
That was auctioned off at MarsCon.

143
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,980
I got to wear it briefly, and it was special.

144
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,840
I can marry you to your radio station.

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,820
In fact, I can marry everyone to everyone.

146
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,900
How did you happen to become a messiah?

147
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
Was that just a calling?

148
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah, it was more of a calling.

149
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,000
It was sort of an accident.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
I sort of fell into it.

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,460
I was mowing the lawn of Reverend Ivan Stang,

152
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,480
who is kind of given the credit of founding the Church of the Subgenius.

153
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,900
Actually, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the founder,

154
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,240
but Reverend Stang sort of has picked up the word.

155
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,680
And one day, almost like a miracle,

156
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,860
I received a call from J.R. Bob Dobbs,

157
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,360
and he said to come work for the church in Dallas, Texas.

158
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,220
We now, of course, are located in Austin, Texas.

159
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,560
You know, a lot of moving.

160
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,960
The church tends to stay on its feet, you know,

161
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,440
just to avoid FBI, CIA, and such.

162
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,640
But, yeah.

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
It was sort of a revelation one day

164
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,380
when we realized that, you know,

165
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,120
my personal divinity and my calling

166
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,100
to save the Church of the Subgenius from financial ruin.

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,340
I see.

168
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,520
So, did you have to get dunked or shaken

169
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,740
or whatever branch that is?

170
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,520
We have.

171
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,840
Well, within the church, we have what we call baptisms,

172
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,320
which are usually done nude

173
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,840
with a lot of people present during our X-Day festival.

174
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,580
But, personally, no, there's no light,

175
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,320
no, you know, blinding light from,

176
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,340
from Bob.

177
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
There was just simply a phone call,

178
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,800
and he said,

179
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
Hey, you're Jesus, and by the way,

180
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,840
I'd like you to come work for me.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,180
And that's, that's pretty much how it all started.

182
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,660
Yeah.

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,220
How many disciples do you have?

184
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,120
Um, well, not many.

185
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
You see, the strange thing is,

186
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,460
once I realized that I was the Lord and my own divinity,

187
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,320
I kind of looked back at history and what had happened before.

188
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,340
I said, where?

189
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,440
This is perfect.

190
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,220
If I just stay within the Church of the Subgenius

191
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,000
amongst the disbelievers and the blasphemers of the world,

192
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,320
no one will ever find me,

193
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,620
and perhaps I could sort of sneak out,

194
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,580
and this is my 33rd year of life,

195
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,340
and this is the year it's supposed to happen.

196
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,600
Um, and I'm hoping that, um,

197
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,760
that because I'm around the disbelievers,

198
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,820
that I won't get nailed to the stick this time.

199
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
So I have very few disciples,

200
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,760
because really no one does truly believe that I am the Lord,

201
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,000
and as long as I can keep that low profile,

202
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,920
I think I'll be okay.

203
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,940
Well, do you want to go through the same experience

204
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,640
that the other one is going through in the...

205
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,460
No, absolutely not.

206
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,600
Absolutely not.

207
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,720
I've been promised by Bob,

208
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,160
now, I know you don't know a lot about our philosophy, but...

209
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,440
Not a lot.

210
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,300
We believe that on July 5th, uh, this year,

211
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,600
the world will come to an end,

212
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,120
and all the saved subgeniuses,

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,020
that is, those of the non-human race,

214
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,300
those of the subgenius race,

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,260
will be taken up aboard the, uh, space vessels of the sex goddesses.

216
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,400
And I, too, am supposed to be, have a front seat ticket

217
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,860
on that space vessel,

218
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,820
and hopefully then I won't have to go through the whipping

219
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,300
and the bleeding and, you know, you've seen The Passion, or...

220
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,880
Well, I've heard about it.

221
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah, me too.

222
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
It's a relatively well-known story, so I...

223
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,540
Yeah.

224
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,120
Been around for a while.

225
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,820
Been around for a while, and, um,

226
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,340
that's, uh, so what is your philosophy?

227
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
I mean, how do you, do you, what are some of your major holidays?

228
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Um, well, our main holiday is X-Day.

229
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,080
That would be the end of the world.

230
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,160
Um, that is July 5th at 7 AM,

231
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,000
and this is, I believe, the sixth time

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,920
that we've predicted the end of the world,

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,440
and it hasn't happened, um,

234
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,040
so that puts us right up with some of the greatest of all religions.

235
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
That's true, you're up with the Millerites, yes.

236
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah.

237
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,040
So, uh, we're hoping this time, you know,

238
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,660
maybe after we get seven or eight, you know,

239
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,860
we can get even better than, like, let's say,

240
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,480
the Jehovah Witnesses or, you know,

241
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,940
the Seventh-day Adventists, you know.

242
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,000
Um, but X-Day is our main holiday that we have.

243
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,280
There are some other ones in there,

244
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
St. Janer's Day and, and such.

245
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,480
Um, I've always advocated that a subgenius holiday

246
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,540
should happen exactly five days after the conspiracy holiday,

247
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,160
so you can hit all the good sales.

248
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,560
But, you know, that's...

249
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,900
That works for me, yeah, sure.

250
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,080
And, um, do you, is there any sort of dietary restrictions?

251
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,420
No, no, uh, uh,

252
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,240
no subgenius, we eat just about near anything.

253
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,020
I'll tell you, well, our, our group is very eclectic.

254
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,400
Um, it is a group of people who, uh,

255
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,520
seriously believe almost nothing,

256
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,860
or those who will believe just about anything.

257
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,620
Um, the philosophy itself is based in a,

258
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,940
on the shifty, sandy beaches of, of hypocrisy.

259
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,700
We're the one of the few churches,

260
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,920
and this is what lacks in religion today, Baron,

261
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,220
is we're one of the few religions that not only lie,

262
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,840
but we try to keep them alive.

263
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,800
We tell you the truth about it.

264
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,760
Um, the rest of them are gonna lie to you.

265
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
We're the only ones that are gonna honestly tell you right now,

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,100
we're lying to you.

267
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,200
So, kind of making the philosophy up as you go.

268
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
That is, that's pretty unique, it's true.

269
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,280
Most of them just sort of say,

270
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,040
well, this is the truth in various forms,

271
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,520
and whether they're lying or not, they'll just claim it's the truth.

272
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,140
Correct.

273
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,040
One of the things that, um, Bob has, has always told us is that, uh,

274
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,680
pretty much if you say it, it is the law.

275
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,620
You know, whatever it is that you truly want to believe,

276
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,920
um, we want, Bob once said to us,

277
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,860
you'll pay to know what you really think.

278
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,300
And really that's where it's based in.

279
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,140
We also have the fundamental belief in slack.

280
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,900
Slack.

281
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,900
And that is, yes, the, the, the non-ending chase

282
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,780
for fulfillment of your own personal dreams, whatever that may be.

283
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
Which they should cut you.

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,540
Yes, and you should get, everyone should cut you some slack, right?

285
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,220
That's, that's right.

286
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,960
But in the meantime, here is an apropos song.

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,100
This is, uh, Jesus Jr.

288
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,840
Jesus Jr.

289
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
His grandpa is the Lord.

290
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,940
Jesus Jr.

291
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,240
He drives a big white Ford.

292
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,180
Jesus Jr.

293
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,340
He takes his dad's advice.

294
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,340
Jesus Jr.

295
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,720
The country of Western Christ.

296
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,200
Well, he was born in Tennessee, not somewhere out in Galilee.

297
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,020
His dad got his at Calvary and his mom works at the grocery.

298
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,000
Jesus Jr.

299
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,060
His grandpa is the Lord.

300
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,100
Jesus Jr.

301
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,560
He drives a big white Ford.

302
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,280
Jesus Jr.

303
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
His grandma marries Joy.

304
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,700
Father, son, and a holy good ol' boy.

305
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,400
Well, Junior takes his name in vain

306
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,480
when folks abuse the passing lame

307
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,620
and at his favorite bar main.

308
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,820
The only thing he'll raise is Cain.

309
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,440
Jesus Jr., his grandpa is the Lord

310
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,720
Jesus Jr., he drives a big white Ford

311
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,860
Jesus Jr., at least he's not a Jew

312
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,020
Ten for Satan, his rig's passing you

313
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,740
Now if his wheels get stuck in mud

314
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,880
He'll part that shoulder lock with flood

315
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,580
And when he drives on he stir

316
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,100
But his left hand signals dripping blood

317
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,840
Jesus Jr., his grandpa is the Lord

318
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,560
Jesus Jr., got mudguards on his big white Ford

319
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,220
Jesus Jr., he takes his dads and buys

320
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,660
Jesus Jr., the country western Christ

321
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,600
Jesus Jr., the country western Christ

322
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,640
Because of our special guest,

323
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,900
although my name is Dave Rome,

324
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,360
you're listening to Shockwave Radio Theater,

325
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680
and over there is Jesus.

326
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,100
Not the one with the nails,

327
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,020
but the one with the subgenius.

328
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,120
The one with the checkbook.

329
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,860
The one with the checkbook.

330
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,720
And the Church of the Subgenius

331
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,380
has been around for a while, hasn't it?

332
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,180
Yeah, we originally, well some people say

333
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,400
that the church was originally founded

334
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,720
back in the 60s, but the first book,

335
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,040
the Book of the Subgenius,

336
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,040
and pamphlet number one was penned in 1980.

337
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
As you may or may not know,

338
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,520
we also have the Hour of Slack radio

339
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,500
program that's on in many public radio

340
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,820
stations and colleges across the United States

341
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,300
and in Canada, and that's been going on

342
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,320
also since that time.

343
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,440
So we have our own ministry of merchandise.

344
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,820
How do you convert people?

345
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,500
What do you say to them as they're coming

346
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,100
out of the Scientology booth or whatever?

347
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,060
Most of our people, it's very difficult

348
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,340
to know where you're going to find a subgenius

349
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,280
or what's going to draw them to us.

350
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,240
Sometimes it's...

351
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,620
Sometimes it's...

352
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,180
Sometimes it's hearing the preacher,

353
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,480
sometimes it's the books,

354
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,480
sometimes it's Bob.

355
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,140
Mostly it's just the promise of cheap sex

356
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,900
that really draws in most of our members.

357
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay, well sure.

358
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,740
And how did you happen to pick Jesus

359
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,220
as your savior as opposed to the Dalai Lama

360
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,920
or the chief rabbi or the, I don't know...

361
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,240
Well, actually the savior, I guess you can think of

362
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,700
actually the Jesus of the Church of the Subgenius

363
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,740
is not really me.

364
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,620
The subgenius is me.

365
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,400
The leader behind it all is Bob.

366
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the world's greatest salesman.

367
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,920
He's a multi-millionaire.

368
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,500
Actually, he's a multi-billionaire.

369
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,380
Many people think Bill Gates is the richest man

370
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,900
in the world.

371
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,460
Friends, if you know the name of the richest man

372
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
in the world, he's not the richest man in the world.

373
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,000
There are people who can buy and sell Bill Gates

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
and J.R. Bob Dobbs happens to be one of these.

375
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,920
And not only is he the richest man,

376
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,520
but he also is the luckiest man.

377
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,000
And that is pretty much how he made his money.

378
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,260
Bob always said, I'd rather be lucky

379
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,460
than good any day.

380
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,220
And he is.

381
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,780
Extremely lucky.

382
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,780
Okay.

383
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,480
And so, that's...

384
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,500
Some of...

385
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,080
Let me start that sentence again.

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,140
Describe some of your more pleasant rituals.

387
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,520
We have a lot of, like I said earlier,

388
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,880
healings, sickenings.

389
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,240
The marriage ritual, I think, is the...

390
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,060
Would you mind if I married your entire audience today?

391
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,800
I mean, I can do that.

392
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,120
A mass marriage real quick?

393
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,400
Sure.

394
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,820
It'll only take about 30 seconds or so.

395
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,900
Okay, so all of you out there,

396
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,620
be prepared to get hitched.

397
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,600
Yeah, what you want to do...

398
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:40,600


399
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,720
And maybe we can come back after a little while

400
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,540
and at least let you find your significant other.

401
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,460
Man, woman, animal.

402
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,480
Again, we can marry you to your wallet.

403
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,760
Or your favorite CD.

404
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,660
To your favorite CD.

405
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Just, you know, grab anything,

406
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,300
but you do want to have it prepared and with you.

407
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,220
The marriage ceremony,

408
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,400
is there something that we need to do?

409
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,540
Sprinkle rice or...

410
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,920
I don't know.

411
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,480
No, you simply just need to have the person or object

412
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,920
that you wish to marry with you.

413
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,900
In thought?

414
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,140
Do they have to physically be there?

415
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,380
No, they don't even have to really be there.

416
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,560
No, they don't have to physically be there.

417
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,580
No, they don't even have to physically be there.

418
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,480
In fact, you can call them up later

419
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,840
and let them know that you're married.

420
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,940
Now, this is what we call a short-duration personal marriage.

421
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,300
I see.

422
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,700
We feel that long-term relationships

423
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,180
are, you know, really a part of the conspiracy.

424
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,500
So, today's marriage ceremony,

425
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,200
at least for this one that we're doing over there,

426
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,580
will just be for 24 hours.

427
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,080
I see.

428
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
And then, of course, it's annulled.

429
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,000
But during that 24 hours,

430
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,860
you are legally bonded in holy matrimony.

431
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,220
Okay.

432
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,320
So, I'll play the fake organ here.

433
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, are we ready?

434
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,420
Yes, go for it.

435
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:40,520
Are you ready to do it?

436
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,760
Well, what are you going to get married to there, Baron?

437
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,680
I think I'll get married to this Kinky Friedman CD.

438
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,060
Okay, that's appropriate.

439
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,960
I'm going to do sort of the short version here

440
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,580
of the subgenius short-duration personal marriage.

441
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,980
The first thing you want to do, though,

442
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,840
is take out your CD or your favorite person,

443
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
your loved one or your wallet,

444
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,140
and you want to just hold it in your left hand.

445
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,760
Something that means something to you.

446
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Something that means something to you.

447
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,420
And I'll just do this.

448
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,400
Everyone can just do it.

449
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,200
Just play along at home,

450
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,780
but I'll do it with the Baron here.

451
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,780
Baron, in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs

452
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,100
and what other deities, gods, and saints

453
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,940
you may wish to worship at this time,

454
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,120
do you take this CD

455
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,880
to be your lawfully wedded object

456
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,440
for the next 24 hours?

457
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,660
Oh.

458
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,020
That's a yes.

459
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,500
It's a yes.

460
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,880
And do you, CD, take...

461
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,900
the Baron David Rahm to be your lawfully wedded partner

462
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,120
at least for the next 24 hours

463
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,520
till death do us part?

464
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,980
Yes, the clapping of the CD.

465
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,080
Then, now this is something you could do

466
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
if you actually have a human.

467
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,260
This might be difficult with a CD.

468
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,260
Shake their hand and say,

469
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,420
it's a deal.

470
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,320
And friends, in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs

471
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,440
and the Church of the Subgenius,

472
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,620
that was the quickest short-duration marriage on record,

473
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,320
I now pronounce you thing and thing

474
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,700
for the next 24 hours.

475
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,420
Praise Bob.

476
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:10,820
Wow, yeah.

477
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,020
I, I, and I, and I've discussed this with the CD,

478
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,300
but I really only got married for the health insurance.

479
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,820
You must now consummate the marriage.

480
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,280
Oh, I forgot that part.

481
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,720
Oh.

482
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,140
Well, I already played the CD.

483
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,660
Well, I don't, yeah, you, you can wait till after.

484
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,060
Okay.

485
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,620
I don't, I don't necessarily want to see that.

486
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,740
You can wait till after the show.

487
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,160
Um, okay.

488
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,280
Um, sure.

489
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,160
Do you have a lot of, um, luck proselytizing

490
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
when you go out and spread the word?

491
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,180
Well, I, I, yeah, I think we do.

492
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,820
I think people, it's a message that people want to hear.

493
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,900
Um, and, you know, we really don't collect feedback.

494
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,300
Uh, I don't think we really care whether or not we're getting through.

495
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,380
We mostly just preach with big megaphones.

496
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,920
Sort of a one-way communication.

497
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,240
We just sort of, you know, uh, force our message on to people.

498
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,760
I mean, that's just the way of religion.

499
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,100
That's right.

500
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,900
You know, we don't really care.

501
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,760
Well, do you have, do you have gatherings?

502
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,780
I mean, I went to one of your big gatherings in 1984.

503
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,560
It was a while ago.

504
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,260
Uh, that was a big thing in Chicago.

505
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,240
Yeah, we have, um, what we call devivals.

506
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,180
Subgenius.

507
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,600
Subgenius devivals.

508
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,240
And, in fact, a lot of them take place, um, uh, in the north.

509
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,600
The frozen north in places such as Cleveland, Ohio.

510
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,980
And, um, if you want to know more about these devivals

511
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,920
and when you can go to them, see preachers,

512
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
see some subgenius music, um, go to our website.

513
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,840
It's simply subgenius.com.

514
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,380
Maybe I should spell that for the geniuses out there.

515
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,160
No, they're subgeniuses, right?

516
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,060
S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.

517
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,840
There's no O in subgenius.

518
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Some people try to put it in there.

519
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,760
And if you do, then you know you belong.

520
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,020
You belong to our group, right?

521
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,000
That's right.

522
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,940
The subgenius is an interesting word.

523
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,260
A lot of people think that it means that, uh,

524
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,260
believe that that means that you're stupid.

525
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,600
You're under a genius.

526
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,840
But, truly, it's the genius of the subculture

527
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,420
is what it was supposed to be.

528
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,720
I know there was a rival group,

529
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,580
the Wile E. Coyote Super Genius branch

530
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,200
that had split off.

531
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,180
I don't know if that was a heresy of yours or just...

532
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,020
Well, there's a lot of...

533
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,680
We do have a lot of, uh, clenches

534
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,760
and a lot of detractors that will go out

535
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,240
and form their own groups.

536
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,240
The Church of Dawn.

537
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,160
Uh, some of you know that.

538
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,840
Some of you may have heard of.

539
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,760
It's a pretty popular group, but...

540
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,720
Church of Dawn.

541
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,880
Yeah, it's sort of the anti-Bob group

542
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,800
for the people who hate Bob, but...

543
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,300
I should think the anti-Bob would be Odo.

544
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,240
No, Obo.

545
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,920
Obo.

546
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,420
Obo, you know, strangely enough,

547
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,160
you know, Baron, that's why you are a great subgenius

548
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,420
because there is an anti-Bob named Obo.

549
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,900
It's amazing.

550
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,280
It's just like it's already been in your brain.

551
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,840
Well, there you go.

552
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
The electric mind is one that can achieve

553
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,020
a versatile, high-quality self-medication.

554
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,120
Oh, I was, uh, excuse me.

555
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,080
I didn't realize you were going to open the door.

556
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,900
I should have locked it.

557
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,440
Oh, well, um, now...

558
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,520
Oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on.

559
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,720
You know, science doesn't acknowledge

560
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,560
the existence of some of these transient phenomena.

561
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,300
After all, science must basically, uh...

562
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,860
Well, I've been using this brain,

563
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,500
I mean, this machine for years.

564
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,140
And science says,

565
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,140
it doesn't even work.

566
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,540
And yet, I found it to be greatly, uh, satisfying

567
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,980
and pleasing to my alpha rhythms.

568
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Not only that, the, uh, yes,

569
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
the vibrations that get processed

570
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,380
when the brain is in motion

571
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,620
is one that can only be reflected back upon oneself

572
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,260
with the proper polarity

573
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,520
and reversal transmission migration,

574
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,140
uh, um, mutated, uh, magnetic resonances.

575
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,880
Magnetic mutants?

576
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,360
Getting you down?

577
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:41,980
Mutated.

578
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,840
Well, there's always one thing you can do about it.

579
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,420
You can, uh...

580
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,600
We only use the word mutant.

581
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,000
...dispense these, um...

582
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,420
To apply to those...

583
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,980
...altered ones, let's call them.

584
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,020
...similar, but less elaborate.

585
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,580
...who cluster around the more fortunate...

586
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,480
...like magnetic monopoles in a cloud chamber.

587
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,700
What are we to do with this social solace?

588
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,800
It's a question we've asked since the beginning of time.

589
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Are we going to sweep the problem under the societal rug?

590
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,500
Is it...

591
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:05,920
Or perhaps...

592
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,600
...perhaps...

593
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,020
...use the societal vacuum cleaner...

594
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,240
...or Corinthian leather?

595
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,900
...in the societal...

596
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,380
...closet...

597
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,200
...to suck up every particle...

598
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,900
...of that which makes us...

599
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,740
...uncomfortable...

600
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,880
Is it simulated, Naga High?

601
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,160
...or afraid?

602
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,900
But some of us understand...

603
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,920
From where does the Naga originate?

604
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,200
...that all men are my brothers,

605
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,780
though I wouldn't want some of them to marry my sister.

606
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,880
And which...

607
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,660
Furthermore, it's not only humans...

608
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:31,660


609
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,420
...who find themselves punctured by this predicament.

610
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,080
According to the latest scientific information,

611
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,720
male marmosets...

612
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,260
...have highly of sex.

613
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,120
A Naga is related to the marmoset.

614
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,000
The Naga, you say?

615
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,760
The Naga.

616
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,400
It's related to the marmoset.

617
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,640
Naga is the source of the Naga hide.

618
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,940
Of Naga hide, yes, that's right.

619
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,360
But I was speaking of male marmosets and their high approval of sex.

620
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,980
In other words, the realm of monkey love.

621
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,180
The mighty monkey.

622
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,620
Upon noticing the seductive sex...

623
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,060
Did you know that the marmoset...

624
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,060


625
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,360
...was the set of a female marmoset?

626
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,680
...was the size of a human that it could lift its own body and a house?

627
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,380
A male...

628
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,320
...inside the house.

629
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,100
...marmoset doesn't pursue her mindlessly.

630
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,500
Male marmosets appear to think about, not just react to, what they're getting into.

631
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,120
Just as people do.

632
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,800
Would they?

633
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,220
Well, they said that, but then their actions would belie their true intent.

634
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,420
That's it. It's time for Haku's by Dave.

635
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,040
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to listen to...

636
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,320
No.

637
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,260
I once was a very happy young man.

638
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:52,660
At the age of five, my father taught me how to bleed and stop the bleeding in case an emergency involving a garbage truck should ever ensue.

639
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,800
At 19, I took my first banking down by the river with a thermonuclear device.

640
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:06,340
And it sure made Mom and Dad awful happy to see the ganglia growing back again the way they did in summertime.

641
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,400
The time of those days gone by.

642
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
The ganglia's all here, Ma.

643
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,940
Just look at that.

644
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,240
The little scamps coming right back.

645
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,740
Look, the punk is grabbing too much stuff in his usual, sit your ass down and listen to this family story.

646
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,080
It's almost like we hadn't done nothing to him in the first place.

647
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,700
No, he's still as miserable and stinky as...

648
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,880
Let's do it to him again.

649
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,880
Ungrateful as he ever was.

650
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,280
He was a red-headed stepchild, Dave was.

651
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,440
And they yanked him by that red hair and threw him into the well.

652
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,000
Until he learned respect for his elders.

653
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,140
And so here he is today.

654
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,100
Thank you, thank you everyone.

655
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,100
Let's have a hand.

656
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,680
Thank you.

657
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:01,860
He's giving Elder Dingleberry their props now as Dave with his beautiful, not only red hair, but his entirely red face is ready to face an entire world.

658
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,520
The basketball team armed with AK-40.

659
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,940
With the Spanish officer.

660
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,540
Oh, the soy.

661
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:40,540


662
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:40,540


663
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,300
He's a little early in his dream Authority, or should you say adult?

664
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:43,860
Yeah.

665
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,460
And heiry's off to see readers.

666
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,460


667
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:50,780


668
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,720
The TV plays by this guy on the seabed.

669
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:53,720


670
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,280
Courtesy from the one that stars.

671
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,280


672
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,840
JAZ esto que te cogite.

673
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,940
Are closer than they seem

674
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,340
But they're backwards like Leonardo's hand

675
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,240
He wrote all of the answers down in disappearing ink

676
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,740
And I'm happy, yes I'm happy

677
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,240
As a goddamn clam

678
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,300
I'm happy, oh I'm happy enough

679
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,340
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

680
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,360
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

681
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,460
There's music at the mini-mart

682
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,720
There's rhythm in the rails

683
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,000
I gotta think for sixteenth notes

684
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,780
But at the top

685
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,480
I was just about to crack it

686
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,900
But the code got tough

687
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,540
You ask me if I'm happy

688
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,760
Guess I'm happy enough

689
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,260
Dot, dot, dot, dash, dash, dash, dot, dot, dot

690
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

691
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,580
We were doodling in the margins of the Domestika book

692
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,800
You could draw a dick but not a crowd

693
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,020
So we turned it up loud

694
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,660
And we sang it real rough

695
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,320
Did it make you happy?

696
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,520
Made me happy enough

697
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,380
Oh, I guess it made me happy

698
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,660
Made me happy enough

699
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

700
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,140
I was digging through my bottom drawer of uncut gems

701
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,560
Looking for a ruby in the rough

702
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,240
Hold my beer while I wrestle with the clown and get pinned

703
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

704
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,440
I guess, guess, guess, guess I'm happy enough

705
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,740
Hey, love is all around you if you know where to look

706
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,220
My life is overflowing with the stuff

707
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,160
You'll know it when you see it, it'll hit you like a book

708
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,960
Guess it made me happy, made me happy enough

709
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
Ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

710
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,180
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy enough

711
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, happy enough

712
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,020
That was Bob Walkenhorst, known for The Rainmakers,

713
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,980
a year-old song called Happy Enough.

714
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,400
He has a Patreon set up,

715
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,000
you can get a song a month,

716
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,840
and you can get his books and paintings.

717
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,480
Before that, well, this episode, number 1,824,

718
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,480
started with some old puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley,

719
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,540
then we heard my old partner Jesus on somebody else's show,

720
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,680
which I really enjoyed,

721
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,960
then some more puzzling evidence with Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Hal,

722
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,040
then the origin of Lonesome Cowboy Dave

723
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,480
on the old ESO Swamp Radio Show on WCSB,

724
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,880
hosted by Chaz Smith.

725
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,720
Almost every old subgenius on this show,

726
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,500
who's still alive, I talked to this week.

727
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,240
Here's another one, Father Joe Mama, known as Papa Joe,

728
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,660
on the puzzling evidence show Engaging with Callers.

729
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,280
Incidentally, Papa Joe will be at the Florida Ex Day this July,

730
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,500
as will I and Dr. Hal.

731
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Customer service?

732
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,400
Yes, dear.

733
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,000
Papa Joe here, and you know, you're far too young to remember this,

734
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,200
but when I was a boy,

735
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,680
we didn't have any of these weaklings,

736
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,980
Jesus with a handgun.

737
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,480
We only prayed to an almighty God that puts fear,

738
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,280
fear in his disciples.

739
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,660
I'm talking about Jesus with a hand grenade.

740
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,580
Fear in his cereal?

741
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,580
No, Jesus, back in my day, Jesus had AK-47.

742
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,960
Jesus had a Stinger missile.

743
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,640
I understand, that's the old world.

744
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,380
You're in new thinking now.

745
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,440
See, that's what's happened today.

746
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,340
People get sloughed off with these cheap imitations.

747
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:05,540
Yeah, but Papa Joe Mama, I can't even have a list of high-ranking officials

748
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,360
that were there that night and were actually such geniuses.

749
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,040
All right, punch it up.

750
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,760
Well, it has been alleged that certain hierarchies

751
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,120
have carried weapons of destruction on their persons during public appearances,

752
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,100
but this is merely a defensive measure, let me assure you.

753
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,720
These allegations of opening up on the audience,

754
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,960
dispensing with people that didn't applaud loud enough,

755
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,360
these are...

756
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,100
These are purely exaggerations.

757
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,760
Okay, all right, there was some shooting on the audience,

758
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,460
but it was target practice.

759
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,180
We were deliberately missing.

760
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,360
Tell the truth.

761
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,540
Okay, okay, so, all right, a few people were hit,

762
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,520
but that was from...

763
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,080
What a beautiful future it is.

764
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,860
Listen, what I lie to you, what I lie to you...

765
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,820
We're the elite of the world.

766
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,000
Those people that died, those were people that wanted to die.

767
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,340
They didn't...

768
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,680
They jumped up in the line of fire.

769
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,820
If you lied to me, what about that night you told me you were...

770
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,600
Well, never mind.

771
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,760
Never mind.

772
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,700
Never mind.

773
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,760
Quote the Raven, never mind.

774
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,260
Never mind.

775
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,800
Never mind.

776
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,620
Never mind.

777
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,240
Never mind.

778
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:27,860
Never mind.

779
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,220
There's a place where there's no sun to shine A little planet called X19

780
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,260
No flowing rivers, no communists Just pours, vapor, and electric mist

781
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,120
What do you know?

782
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,420
What do you know?

783
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
What do you know?

784
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,880
What do you know?

785
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,480
She's driving me crazy

786
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,640
Ah, the view is hazy

787
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,440
Oh no, it happened again

788
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,540
And every time I say

789
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,700
I'll never fly with lizard eyes

790
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,680
And turn the other way

791
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,300
Then you find you came to swim in water

792
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,480
That is free and flowing in a night sky

793
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,800
Of a land beyond, beyond a world of hope and fear

794
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,600
And so I bid you space man

795
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,180
Now I'm here

796
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,560
Now I'm here

797
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,080
Now I'm here

798
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,320
Now I'm here

799
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,180
Now I'm here

800
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,480
There's a place where there's no sunshine

801
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,220
A little planet called X-1-9

802
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,680
No flowing rivers, no communists

803
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,100
Just poison, vapor and electric mist

804
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,380
What do you know?

805
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,560
What do you know?

806
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,880
What do you know?

807
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,120
What do you know?

808
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,420
She's driving me mad

809
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,540
I see you now

810
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,420
I see you now

811
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,680
I see you now

812
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,560
Oh no, it happened again

813
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,660
And every time it goes

814
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,300
I put her in my sights

815
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,540
I jump like Geronimo

816
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,220
Then you find you came to swim in water

817
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,620
That is free and flowing in a night sky

818
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,920
Of a land beyond, beyond a world of hope and fear

819
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,740
And so I bid you space man

820
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,220
Now I'm here

821
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,640
Now I'm here

822
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,060
Now I'm here

823
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,220
Now I'm here

824
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,660
living in a first global,

825
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,020
living in the the collateral

826
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,100
Do I get what I deserve here?

827
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,100


828
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,720
Ah, there's no time for here

829
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,100
Barren snow

830
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:28,860
Epstein's Secret Orchestra, a song about Planet X from the rare album Sex in Another Dimension.

831
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,320
I've worked with that Cleveland band for years.

832
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:41,380
Michelle George on electric violin, Dave DeLuca on guitar, Bob Mosick drums, Regis Sedlock mixing.

833
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:50,180
Well, sir, ma'am, X days are coming, including an actual real-life gathering at Landa Id in Florida.

834
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:56,280
I'm about to play audio of the section about X Day Drills from Sandy Boone's new documentary,

835
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, now streaming everywhere but Netflix.

836
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:15,160
The voices you'll hear are Irreverent Friday Jones, Papa Joe Mama, Dr. Legume, Onan Canobite, Hal Robbins, Doug Wellman, me, and Dr. Philo Drummond.

837
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,480
The

838
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:43,120
The countdown has begun.

839
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,720
It's like Christmas, you know.

840
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,960
Santa's coming.

841
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,380
Santa's coming real soon.

842
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,340
We've got the shortwave.

843
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,940
Tune in and hear Santa delivering.

844
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,300
These little gifts of death and destruction.

845
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,060
That X Day, you always see all sorts of different people, and they all have this kind of common sense of humor, a warped sense of humor, a dark sense of humor.

846
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,040
And I find dark sense of humor to be the most fascinating type of sense of humor because it's taboo.

847
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,400
You can talk about all these taboo subjects and make jokes about things that polite company would find extremely distasteful.

848
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,380
Find out if he's really Jewish.

849
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,420
Make him Jewish if he's not.

850
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah!

851
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,620
It was cool as s**t.

852
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:35,220
I was a socially awkward person, and suddenly, you know, after a couple of sermons, I could go to half the towns on the East Coast and people would open their doors to me, buy me dinner.

853
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:45,860
About a week ago, I had a vision of 7 o'clock coming and Reverend Stein getting up on stage and making some kind of lame excuse why the saucers didn't come.

854
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,180
And some bent dumbass out in the audience just putting a bullet in.

855
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,540
We're missing Jesus and Steve.

856
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:04,020
Perhaps there are some amongst us that are worried that if nothing shows up in 20 minutes, they're going to get themselves beat to a bloody pulp.

857
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,920
It's a white limo blowing up!

858
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,760
It is a white limousine!

859
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,880
Hail the limousine!

860
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,900
Of course, there's tremendous feeling of anticipation.

861
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,260
20 years ago, I thought 1998 was a million years off.

862
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,460
Jeez, it's really coming. This is really happening.

863
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,560
This is the original handwritten note in J.R. Bob Dobbs' own hand that says,

864
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,700
The world ends July 5th at 7 a.m. 1998.

865
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,180
This is the original paper touched by Bob.

866
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,180
It's been difficult.

867
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:53,540
It's been difficult to be patient, but I knew that if I just persevered, I'd be able to say goodbye from above, from the saucers.

868
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:03,240
Here's this joke that I've been telling myself and other people for over half my life.

869
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:16,360
13, 12, 11, 6, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2...

870
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,360


871
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,360


872
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,360


873
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,320
You! What!

874
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,400
Mob?

875
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,120
If they can't take a job!

876
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,560
And then the saucers didn't show up.

877
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,560
At one time, this date was comfortably far in the future.

878
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:46,060
But it has turned out that the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses did not descend on that occasion to lift us all off.

879
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,400
Into universes of slag.

880
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,680
Everybody was looking around.

881
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,320
Looking around at each other.

882
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,100
He's a charlatan!

883
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:54,960
Yeah!

884
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,940
That fucking charlatan you've been lying to us all these years!

885
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,760
There ain't no Bob Dobbs, this dude don't know!

886
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,120
He just got me!

887
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,920
I just got him!

888
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,160
I had a real philosophical problem with the X-Day thing, and I still have a hard time remembering the date.

889
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:16,340
Because in any religion, if you have an end-of-the-world date, I think it should be written into the bylaws that that date has to happen long after you, the person, and the person who's going to be there.

890
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,340


891
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
And issuing the date is dead.

892
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,360
You don't put it just a few years later.

893
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,820
We never really expected the church to go to 1998.

894
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,340
Back in 1981, we set 98 out there because it was still way out there.

895
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,280
We tried to warn him, children.

896
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,120
He wouldn't listen.

897
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,440
You can't take all the money, all the girls, and all the slag, and never have to pay it back.

898
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,180
We're gonna need a good lubricant, aren't we, children?

899
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:54,620
I guess to be honest, I'd have to say that I never really expected any flying saucers.

900
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,640
To be honest, a lot of this stuff is really, really stupid.

901
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,500
But I guess a lot of people need something really stupid in their lives to give it meaning.

902
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,920
I don't know, it's still a pretty beautiful world we've got here.

903
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,340
And Bob is still a very important part of my life.

904
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,280
And always will be.

905
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,660
There was some sense that, now what?

906
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:53,060
Who do you think is going to buy this town?

907
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,540
Oh?

908
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:53,980


909
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,100
We ate lots of mushrooms to commune with nature

910
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,300
How are we to know we'd have to move our ship later?

911
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,140
Five hundred colors flashed into my brain

912
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,200
My cell division occurred in three or four planes

913
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,220
My brain was blasted, my head feeling fixed

914
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,180
My eyeballs protruded but I didn't get sick

915
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,360
We packed up our tips but we kept seeing dots

916
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,500
Then we found that the peak had gotten all the best spots

917
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,020
So we got high, so high, dark, dark mountains

918
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:03,280
Yeah, we got high, so high, dark, dark mountains

919
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,740
The people were happy, they were all having fun

920
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,840
While Dr. Sparob was farming skulls in the sun

921
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,340
The corpses were all dead

922
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,960
The cops were swinging, their love did abound

923
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,040
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

924
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,160
The bandit there, God was speaking his name

925
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,380
While the doctors on the plant show were claiming their fame

926
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,280
Sparkdog explosion and combo gang fight

927
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,180
Finish this then, just in time for lunch

928
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:43,500
And we got high, so high, dark, dark mountains

929
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:52,140
Yeah, we got high, so high, dark, dark mountains

930
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,400
On top of a swimming pool

931
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,020
Showed our hands to see who could stop us

932
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,460
Really good at it, could be fry-fresh

933
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,960
Woman may grow tall, just like mins

934
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,480
ah yes dear friends

935
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
the swinging love corpses

936
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,100
I'm gonna go back there, I'll even meet the Pope

937
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Better make it to Dark Stock or just give up hope

938
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,000
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear

939
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,160
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear

940
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,220
Now I'm gonna go back, and I won't be stopped

941
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,240
I'm gonna go back to smoke the ultimate frog

942
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,060
You just can't imagine what it's like to go

943
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,680
When reality's on hold and Dark Stock's the show

944
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,980
We go high, go high, Dark Stock Mountain

945
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:30,360
We go high, go high, Dark Stock Mountain

946
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,800
Oh yeah, I went way up high on Dark Stock Mountain

947
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,040
I climbed down, I climbed up all the way up

948
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,040


949
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,620
I went all the way to the top

950
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,160
I took everything you could think of

951
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,140
I shot beer, I smoked heroin

952
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,180
I started marijuana

953
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,760
I stuck a stiff glue

954
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:09,000
I put barbiturate repositories in my rectal cavity

955
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,820
The Swingin' Love

956
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,760
I could see the corpses, Philo on vocals

957
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,180
That song is about the pre-X-Day subgenius events called Dark Stock

958
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:22,380
But it perfectly describes the average X-Day drill as well

959
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,100
And now, Oingo Boingo

960
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,040
Tiny people with little guns

961
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,040
Little armies march to the little drums

962
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,460
What do they want? What do they want?

963
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,720
Tiny soldiers with little guns

964
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,040
To tanks no bigger than your thumb

965
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,020
They want you

966
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,460
Little people with tiny brains

967
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,080
Little bullets flowing in their veins

968
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,740
What do they want? What do they want?

969
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,020
Little airplanes with tiny bombs

970
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,380
To squadrons dropping dimples on their palm

971
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,140
They want you

972
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,740
You, you, yeah, you, you, you

973
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,740
Tonight

974
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,000
ensuite

975
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,000


976
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,220
count

977
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,240
Le

978
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:37,520
sixty- Eye-opener

979
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,560
Oh, yeah

980
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,440
Tiny people with little guns

981
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,860
Little armies march

982
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,520
To little drums

983
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,520
What do they want?

984
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,860
What do they want?

985
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,140
Tiny soldiers with little guns

986
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,180
Little tanks

987
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,340
No bigger than your thumb

988
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,840
They want you, you

989
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

990
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Tiny people

991
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,360
Little guns

992
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,320
Tiny people

993
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,240
Little guns

994
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,160
Tiny people

995
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,860
Little guns

996
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,980
That's such a perfect image

997
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,960
for what we're going through right now

998
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,200
what's trying to pierce our humble little books

999
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,620
And there you see

1000
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,400
once the administration

1001
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,800
is in place

1002
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,600
The administration is in place now

1003
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,920
You know, at least with Clinton

1004
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,600
it was a literal

1005
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,760
screw

1006
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,900
When they said you were getting screwed

1007
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,040
that's exactly what

1008
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,800
they meant, I mean, that's what it was

1009
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,540
That meant if you were like

1010
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,860
some blonde fired

1011
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,200
This secondary thing, it's like

1012
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,940
think how many Monica Lewinsky's

1013
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,760
there are in between us and George now

1014
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,620
and none of them are cute

1015
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,820
None of them are even women

1016
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,660
They're just more ugly old white men

1017
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,840
all the way down the line

1018
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,400
except for a few old white women

1019
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,700
who are really ugly old white men

1020
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,360
in disguise

1021
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,760
Well, that is where our power structure is today

1022
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,360
We have 500

1023
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,540
ugly old women disguised

1024
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,520
as 500 ugly old women

1025
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,200
Now there's like thousands of them

1026
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,580
and most of them don't even look as much like a woman as she does

1027
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,500
Or even as much like Janet

1028
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,140
But they're the same much

1029
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,820
and not that, you know, I mean, hey

1030
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,720
I don't judge a book by its cover

1031
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,960
I judge it by its

1032
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,760
I judge it by how many pages are stuck together

1033
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,500
Here you come fully equipped with a bunch of those

1034
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,380
Janis Joplin or Janet Reno

1035
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,120
who sings the blues better

1036
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,080
Who sang the blues better?

1037
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,060
Has a, well like, with a grading system of 10 to 9

1038
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,340
What, what, what do you, um, in what way?

1039
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,780
Who had more soul?

1040
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,100
Who had the greater range?

1041
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:44,680
Come on, man

1042
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,940
Who does ball and chain better might be another way to look at it

1043
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,940
which would give you

1044
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,720
That was erudite

1045
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,680
That was laconic

1046
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,660
That was lugubrious

1047
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,280
I mean, I mean, forget all of that

1048
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:53,760
That was quick

1049
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,580
That was a panacea

1050
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,580
Love is like a ball and a chain, yay, yay, yay, yay, baby

1051
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,460
Oh my gosh

1052
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,740
Oh my God, we just watched one of his strangest words

1053
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,220
We're, we're looking at the internet monitor right now

1054
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,060
We're not going to get the internet porno on the radio anymore

1055
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,860
Higgins, forgive the bluntness, but if I'm to be in this business, I shall be responsible for the girl

1056
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,480
I hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position

1057
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,680
What, that thing?

1058
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,480
Sacred, I assure you

1059
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,380
Come now, Higgins, you know what I mean, this is no trifling matter

1060
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,000
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

1061
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,980
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

1062
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,880
Yes, very frequently

1063
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,580
Well, I haven't

1064
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:42,480
I find the moment that a woman makes friends with me, she becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious, and a damn nuisance

1065
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,780
And I find the moment that I make friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical

1066
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,360
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so

1067
00:54:50,920 --> 00:55:04,620
Well, after all, Pickering, I'm an ordinary man who desires nothing more than just an ordinary chance to live exactly as he likes and do precisely what he wants

1068
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:15,520
An average man of mine, of no eccentric whim, who likes to live his life free of strife, doing whatever he thinks is best for him

1069
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,980
Well, just an ordinary man

1070
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:31,440
But let a woman in your life, and your serenity is through, she'll redecorate your home from the cellar to the dome

1071
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,720
Then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling your home

1072
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:34,720


1073
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,940
Let a woman in your life, and you're up against a wall

1074
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,300
Make a plan and you will find she has something else in mind

1075
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,720
And so rather than do either, you do something else that neither likes at all

1076
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,360
You want to talk of Keats or Milton, she only wants to talk of love

1077
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,840
You go to see a play or ballet and spend it searching for her glove

1078
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,720
Let a woman in your life, and you enjoy the fun of overhauling your home from the cellar to the dome

1079
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,980
And fight eternal strife

1080
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,820
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands

1081
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:19,260
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let a woman in my life

1082
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:28,860
I'm a very gentle man, even-tempered and good-natured, whom you never hear complain

1083
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:33,780
Who has the milk of human kindness by the court in every vein

1084
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,420
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips

1085
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:44,480
The sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips

1086
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,160
A very gentle man

1087
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,280
But let a woman in your life, and patient hasn't got a chance

1088
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,940
She will beg you for advice, your reply will be concise, and she'll listen very nicely

1089
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,760
Then go out and do precisely what she says, and you'll be happy to see her again

1090
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,160
And she'll tell you what she wants

1091
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,740
You were a man of grace and pollock, who never spoke above a hush

1092
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,400
Now all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush

1093
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,220
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife

1094
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,360
Let the others of my sex tie the knot around their necks

1095
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:35,100
I'd prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a woman in my life

1096
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:44,920
I'm a quiet living man, who prefers to spend the evenings in the silence of his room

1097
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,460
Who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb

1098
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,280
A pensive man am I, of philosophic joy

1099
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,340
Who likes to meditate, contemplate, free from human fear

1100
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,700
A man that is mad in human noise

1101
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,820
Quiet living man

1102
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,940
But let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through

1103
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,040
In a line that never ends, come an army of her friends

1104
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,380
Come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with you

1105
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,380
She'll have a booming, boisterous family, who will descend on you en masse

1106
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,080
She'll have a large, wagnarian mother

1107
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,480
With a voice that shatters glass

1108
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,480
Let a woman in your life

1109
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,900
Hey, Marquis San Francisco boy, I say this to you

1110
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,840
Never let a woman in your life

1111
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,500
..

1112
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:37,520
..

1113
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:37,960
..

1114
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,360
I shall never let a woman in your life

1115
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,120
A woman in my life.

1116
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,200
Rex Harrison singing in My Fair Lady.

1117
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,540
Of course, by the end of the show, he's singing a different tune.

1118
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,080
A friend of mine said that was his theme song when he was 14.

1119
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,040
Anyway, friends, this is Hour of Slack.

1120

It's there. And with that, I'm out of here.

1126
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,480
Praise Bob.

1127
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,040
Thanks to the Empire Jazz Orchestra there for the music.
