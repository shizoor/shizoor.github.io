1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,080
Ah, yes, there.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,500
You see that coin?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,440
That is insured for $10,000.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,100
See how it seems to gather the light and draw the eye?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,020
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,700
I get great repose from these things of age and beauty.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,940
They soothe one and seem to induce sleep.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,060
Sleep.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,920
Close your eyes, my friend.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,060
Sleep.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,100
Sleep.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,260
Sleep.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,340
Hello, everybody.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,700
Look out!

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,580
Shut up!

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,420
Shut up!

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Come in.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,440
Shut up!

19
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,220
$772,000.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,920
Shut up!

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,200
$772,000.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,500
Shut up!

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,920
$341,000.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,440
Shut up!

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,880
$341,000.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,800
Shut your face!

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,300
Is that correct?

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,320
Yes, it is.

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,240
$61,000.

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,020
Thank you.

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Shut up!

32
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,900
That will be all for the present.

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,080
Very good.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,600
Shut up!

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,960
The Subgenius Powerhouse.

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,200
Watch.

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,580
Excellent.

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,480
And at the top of the show, we've got a very interesting guest to be sure.

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,080
Reverend Ivan Stang.

40
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,000
He's the founder of the Church of the Subgenius and the book,

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,660
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack, the Bobliagraphon.

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,280
That's right.

43
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,760
Stick around.

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,860
You're going to say, what?

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,480
Of course, the question is, who's Bob?

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,940
Well, Bob's an interesting guy.

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,100
He gets high on the real thing.

48
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,280
A full tank of gas and a clean windshield.

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,540
All righty then.

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,760
First off...

51
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,900
Worried about covering the lower half of your body?

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,360
Here's Bob One for A1 Slack.

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,080
Things go better with slacks and trousers.

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,620
Things go better with slacks.

55
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi, this is Bob One.

56
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,960
And I wonder how many of our go-go-now generation action man on campus realizes

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,360
how important it is to keep the lower half of your body covered

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
without disguising the fact that it is indeed the lower half of your body.

59
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,760
Well, there's nothing like a pair of trim-fitting,

60
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,820
A1 slacks.

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,640
They're better than skirts and a lot warmer, too.

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,060
Thank you, Bob.

63
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,500
You're welcome.

64
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,620
And now, back to our movie.

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
Looks like we're going to find more.

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,480
Bob.

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,800
Bob.

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,520
Bob.

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,800
Bob.

70
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,460
Bob.

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,860
Bob.

72
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,760
Bob.

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,120
Bob.

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,600
Bob.

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:52,980
Bob.

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Bob.

77
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,340
Bob.

78
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Bob.

79
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Bob.

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,160
Bob.

81
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,380
Bob.

82
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,520
Bob.

83
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Bob.

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,100
Bob.

85
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,560
Bob.

86
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,000
Bob.

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,260
Bob.

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Bob.

89
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,680
Bob.

90
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:08,980
Bob.

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,500
Bob.

92
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:09,720
Bob.

93
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,260
Bob.

94
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,260


95
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,000
I know who he is, Fred hissed.

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
So what, said Nobby.

97
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,020
He's a raving genius.

98
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
He's a loony.

99
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,520
Yeah, well, they say there's a thin line between genius and madness.

100
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,820
He's fallen off it, then.

101
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,260
But Terry Pratchett went first.

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,800
Thanks to Lee Murr for the song and intro,

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Reverend Zontar for the ancient fire sign theater actual radio ad,

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,560
and Frankenstein1970 from 1959.

105
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,540
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1143,

106
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,960
a Bob Renewal reintroduction to that most important thing in the world

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,220
for those who might have briefly forgotten.

108
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,460
The first in a series of shows using categorized bits of the recordings

109
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,560
from a dozen recent Lives of Genius outreach events,

110
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,840
hither and yon, which it has taken me many days to chop up.

111
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,360
Besides the collage work of Norell Preff, Lee Murr, and yours truly, Reverend Stang,

112
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,720
we'll also be hearing from the Winter Star Devival of March 1, 2008,

113
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:24,940
and the first of the four.

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,080
John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio from last December.

115
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,960
A Puzzling Evidence show from Berkeley on February 22nd,

116
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,820
and a radio synesthesia show from WCSB Cleveland on March 9th,

117
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:48,980
and a Denver, Colorado talk show excerpted from Rick Barber's show on KOA Denver.

118
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,040
And also some real radio ads from the fire sign theater, more of those,

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,140
prompted by Zontar.

120
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:03,040
We're hearing Bonobo's Convergence in the background, recorded live last X-Day.

121
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,140
And I think that's all.

122
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,180
Oh, Bonobo's Convergence will be at next X-Day, Drew.

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,240
We've been on the road a lot, friends,

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,680
and I've just now chopped all this audio into millions of tiny bits.

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,940
And also tonight, I'm working in some audio swipe from a great movie called Slipstream,

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,160
directed by Anthony Hopkins,

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,660
which makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay.

128
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,200
And we even have some new songs.

129
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,140
And next week or two, it'll be all politics on the show, friends.

130
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,480
Yes, I'm afraid so.

131
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,880
So let's bask for now in pure, untainted bobbery, at least for this week,

132
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,740
starting with what the curious heard as they approached the giant subgenius circus tent

133
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,600
at Winterstar 2008.

134
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,900
Last March 1st.

135
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,240
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up.

136
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,240
Welcome to the subgenius medical curiosity show.

137
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,600
It's all real, all here, all alive.

138
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,340
And it's all on the inside.

139
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,360
See the smart boy who can't keep a job.

140
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,360
See the pretty girl who can't get a date.

141
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,700
Alive and on the inside.

142
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,940
We have diseases that are spread through sexual...

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Congress.

144
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,280
We have debates settled by fisticuffs.

145
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,700
We have people famous for being famous.

146
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,020
And they're all inside.

147
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,900
Alive, alive, alive.

148
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,000
See grown men and women talk to an invisible monster that lives in the sky.

149
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,580
See your own body become ever more fragile before your very eyes.

150
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,900
Feel the horror as schools turn innocent children into innocent adults.

151
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,820
Listen to shock.

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,580
Listen to shocking tales wherein you pay to work.

153
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,240
They're all here on the inside.

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,100
We have pictures of a salesman who smokes a pipe.

155
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,400
What other religions charge all worldly goods for what we offer at a discounted and guaranteed low rate?

156
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,280
Eternal salvation or triple your money back?

157
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,160
Read words on a cathode ray tube and attend amateur religious satire performance art.

158
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,660
Get slacked and feel alive.

159
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,560
Alive on the inside.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,560
Praise.

161
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:43,960
I wish I could say that I wrote that, but actually that was recorded outside a freak show by Dr. Onan Canobite.

162
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,400
I don't think they ought to live for that one.

163
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,180
Anyway, that's what happened on this date in history.

164
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,240
Well, we're going to talk about something that you may not know about.

165
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
And those of you who have heard of it, you might find this most interesting indeed.

166
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,120
The Church of the Subgenius, founded in 1953.

167
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,360
And although its current popularity is traced to the publication of Subgenius pamphlet number one in 1979,

168
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,240
it's found quite a bit of acceptance, especially in underground pop cult circles,

169
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,060
embraced on college campuses, in the underground music scene, on the Internet.

170
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,180
And because the tenets of discordianism, the Church of the Subgenius is often described as,

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,800
as a syncretic offshoot of the belief.

172
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,360
However, members state that the organization developed on its own with the publication of Subgenius pamphlet number one,

173
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,300
also known as The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die by Reverend Ivan Stang, who is our guest.

174
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,500
And Reverend Stang, good morning.

175
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,540
Well, I praise Rick, praise Bob, and happy birthday, Dan Quayle.

176
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,980
Dan Quayle.

177
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,220
It's not true, but it's alleged that, of course, you know, he was head of the space program during Daddy Boy.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,940
Bush's era.

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
And there was.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,220
Appropriate.

181
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,540
Yeah.

182
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,460
And there was.

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
And there was.

184
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
There was this.

185
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,360
There's kind of this, you know, almost underground.

186
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,760
So we say a legend that Dan thought it would be a good idea to send a mission to the sun.

187
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,100
But because it was so hot, he thought we'd do it at night.

188
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,640
There you go.

189
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,900
See, and that's my kind of guy, you know.

190
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,100
All right, Dan.

191
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,460
We always considered him a sort of an honorary subgenius.

192
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:31,780
Well, even though he never officially joined up, he somehow he definitely was was not a genius.

193
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,440
He certainly.

194
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,860
So we knew that he would qualify for our august organization.

195
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,700
Indeed.

196
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,140
Tell us something about the Church of the Subgenius.

197
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,340
And by the way, who is Bob?

198
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:52,040
J.R. Bob Dobbs is our guru and the sort of, you might say, the god of the subgeniuses and of strippers.

199
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,940
I'm told.

200
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,560
Cool.

201
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,200
Yeah.

202
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,580
Yeah.

203
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:07,840
Bob, some of your listeners may be familiar with his face, which you see tattooed on kids and spray painted on cars and so forth.

204
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,360
He looks like he looks like the 1950s version of the all around good guy dad on sitcoms.

205
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,960
That's right.

206
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,740
And if you look at any old magazine, it'll be full of ads of these square looking happy guys with pipes.

207
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,520
They're always smoking a pipe.

208
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:23,900
Right.

209
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,060
Laying in a hammock while somebody else mows the yard.

210
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,680
Right.

211
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,580
And we my partner and I, Dr.

212
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:40,140
Philo Drummond and I had noticed that the same figure popped up in all these old magazines and in old movies.

213
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,180
We thought it must be the same guy.

214
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:53,080
And at that point, Bob revealed himself to us through weird coincidences and messages and things.

215
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,100
So not too.

216
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,260
Many people have actually met Bob in person and survived.

217
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,360
In other words, you cannot look upon the face of Bob.

218
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,220
Well, he's so lucky.

219
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,760
I think he manages to avoid most of his followers without even trying to.

220
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm looking at the picture of the the Kababala.

221
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
We owe a lot to other religions.

222
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,740
It's true that we we when we were.

223
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,000
We.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000


225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,760
We're trying to put the the Church of the subgenius structure together.

226
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,640
We as Bob directed us, we studied all the great religions from Zoroastrianism all the way up to Scientology.

227
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:43,400
And we picked all the good parts, you know, what when you were a kid, you'd find your dad's secret stash of paperbacks and look for the good parts.

228
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,960
That's what we did with our dad's holy books.

229
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,660
Nice.

230
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,200
I was always looking for my own stash of Mad Magazine, which my father would hide.

231
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Well, you've just mentioned one of our true holy books is Mad Magazine and their great publisher, William Gaines.

232
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,180
And the great Alfred E.

233
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,120
Newman, who is a cousin to Bob.

234
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,120
I always thought I always thought there was a kind of a connection there.

235
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,200
Yeah, he's well, Bob's better looking.

236
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,580
But yeah, they are related.

237
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,940
I think Alfred E.

238
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Newman was more like the country cousin.

239
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,000
And he's a little older than Bob in real life.

240
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,700
They both are.

241
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,560
They're ageless figures.

242
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:36,740
Now, the and by the way, I'm looking at some of the names that involve a high profile names like Paul Rubens, Peewee Herman, who placed a picture of Bob in every episode of Peewee's Playhouse.

243
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:49,800
David Byrne, Mark Motherspawn, Penn Jillette, Penn and Teller, Robert Wilson, Robert Anton Wilson, science fiction writers, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, actor Bruce Campbell.

244
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,060
And even Frank Zappa.

245
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,980
And so far, all of those are true.

246
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,780
I don't think any of those are lies or exaggerations.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, I'm almost certain it's probably true, especially in the Peewee Herman stuff.

248
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,680
Well, you could see it by he had Peewee in his title sequence every Saturday morning.

249
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,400
All the kids of America saw Bob leering over Peewee's shoulder during the titles.

250
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,740
Peewee never paid for his membership.

251
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,280
He he left a phone message asking us to send him an ordainment package.

252
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,580
He.

253
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,960
He could be a minister, but he never.

254
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,200
And he said he said, Bill, Bill, me.

255
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,800
And we did.

256
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,740
But he never paid up in our church really is a pretty major sin.

257
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,540
But I figure putting Bob on CBS for a year was worth at least 10 bucks.

258
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
Well, at least.

259
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,780
Yeah.

260
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,480
I mean, and after you had to give the guy some slack.

261
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,920
Yeah.

262
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,060
Yeah.

263
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

264
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,740
Poor, poor Peewee.

265
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,100
He really it's it's a shame.

266
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,640
What happened?

267
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,660
Well, yeah.

268
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,120
I always wondered, you know, he got busted for doing what big deal.

269
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,320
Try try try your 13 year old kid.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,680
Like the old T-shirt used to say, we're pulling for you.

271
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,680
You betcha.

272
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,660
Bob, if he isn't Bob, if he isn't Bob.

273
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,460
Bob.

274
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,820
Yeah, I dig it.

275
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,120
Bob.

276
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,280
Oh, Bob.

277
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,360
How long will it be?

278
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,360
How long will it be?

279
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,860
Bob.

280
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,680
I'm going to miss you.

281
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,700
Bob's a bad influence on me.

282
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,100
Oh, Bobby.

283
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
So charming and continental.

284
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,580
This is Bob.

285
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,200
I know Bob.

286
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,820
I know Bob.

287
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh, Bob.

288
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't know when I've been so hungry.

289
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,620
Bob, you really shouldn't have given me yours.

290
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, Bob.

291
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,700
I don't think I can eat when I'm full of greens right up to here.

292
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,420
Fill me up.

293
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,720
I got pot.

294
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,020
You naughty, naughty boy.

295
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Bob, would you like to buy some information?

296
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,600
I've got it, Bob.

297
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,240
Oh, Bob.

298
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,580
So the church, what is the Church of the Subgenius?

299
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,240
Good question.

300
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,180
We're still trying to figure that out ourselves.

301
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,460
It's like, well, is this a joke or is it a real religion?

302
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,440
And our answer is, why not both?

303
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,760
We are probably one of the only serious religions that admits that we're completely full of

304
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,440
crap, and as such, possibly the only true and honest religion.

305
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Doesn't that just figure?

306
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,340
You know, but we have the problem of Bobbies.

307
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,480
They're the ones that want to, they're so excited about it, they immediately want to

308
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,980
start telling all the inside jokes, and they haven't even gotten the outside joke yet.

309
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:46,020
And some of them, I mean, really need luck getting the, but basically, back in 1950,

310
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:56,160
1953, this, a man, this, that man, J.R., Bob Dobbs, and by the way, the J.R. doesn't

311
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,700
spell for, stand for anything.

312
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,980
It's on his birth certificate, even with quotes on the name Bob.

313
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Bob was a mere salesman.

314
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,380
Well, not a mere salesman.

315
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,500
He was actually the greatest salesman the world has ever known.

316
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,720
And he was pretty, but he was a very young man, and he was just starting out on his road,

317
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,280
his path.

318
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,360
Religion had nothing to do with it.

319
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,840
He was just interested in money, like any sane person.

320
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:28,360
But he was tinkering with a TV, he was trying to build his own TV set.

321
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,400
And it was, he was in his basement, standing in a puddle, and suddenly, he had this, he was seized up

322
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,960
in the spirit.

323
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:43,100
He had this, this epiphany, which we call the divine immaculation of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

324
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,700
And on the, he was, he was an exorcist.

325
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:55,480
In this timeless moment, Bob was communicating with an alien intelligence calling itself Jehovah One.

326
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,540
You may have heard that name before.

327
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,900
This creature had been masquerading as God to many cultures for centuries.

328
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,360
And it revealed to Bob that throughout history there had been a conspiracy,

329
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:16,780
not the kind that kills Kennedy or gets Bush into office or hides UFOs and so forth, none of that stuff.

330
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,840
This was a conspiracy of plain, ordinary, garden-variety, normal human beings

331
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,660
who didn't even know they were part of a conspiracy, but just automatically, out of the fear of anything different,

332
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:37,720
had been keeping down and oppressing the slack of all the weirdos, the abnormals, the different people,

333
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,820
the disbelievers, and most importantly, those who will believe anything.

334
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,120
And that is when the Church of the Subgenius was formed.

335
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:54,700
Not on a solid rock like some of our more prosperous competitors,

336
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,080
but on a shifting sandy beach of pure hypocrisy.

337
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,180
Hypocrisy, friends, that is the beach our church is built on.

338
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,820
We have a million rules which can all be read.

339
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,260
We've got a million rules that we've read in our three books, but there's only one that really counts.

340
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:20,540
And since there's no one here but children, I'll say it in full vulgar English.

341
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,180
The one rule of the Church of the Subgenius is, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

342
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,200
So if you are feeling tender today, you should perhaps leave.

343
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,360
The Bob Show.

344
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,960
Brought to you by Bob.

345
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,600
Permanent, perfect, permanent, perfect.

346
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,340
And here he is, Bob.

347
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,900
Smile, stop, smile, stop.

348
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,060
You bet your life, you bet your life, there is heaven right here on Earth.

349
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,900
There is heaven right here on Earth.

350
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,900
Home of the dick jazz.

351
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,180
So come on, guys and gals.

352
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,900
Won't you come along with me?

353
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,860
Heaven on Earth.

354
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,800
No fussy, frizzy curls for this smart girl.

355
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,160
She has a Bob.

356
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,580
The perfect, permanent, permanent, tight, kinky with a Bob.

357
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,540
Because Bob is so easy, you can do it yourself.

358
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,920
Just regular pin curls and gentle Bob-ocean.

359
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,300
That's all you need.

360
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,060
A Bob, a Bob, new body.

361
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,520
Make your next permanent a Bob.

362
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,860
Bob-permanent.

363
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,880
Permanent.

364
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,120
Give yourself a Bob.

365
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,840
Give yourself a Bob.

366
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,620
Give yourself a Bob.

367
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,320
Give yourself a Bob.

368
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,200
You'll go Bob, Bob, Bobbing along with your Bob.

369
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,140
My mom had untold me.

370
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,120
My mom had untold me.

371
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,240
My mom had untold me.

372
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,060
My mom had untold me.

373
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,440
A worrisome thing, a worrisome thing.

374
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,020
Train it, train it, train it, train it.

375
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
My mom had untold me.

376
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,700
Whoa!

377
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,560
Never before a stick so red.

378
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,000
Redder than a fire engine.

379
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,900
See what stick can do for you.

380
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,480
The comf, the comf, long-lasting.

381
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,180
You'll just love Bob.

382
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:41,480
Be sure to listen again next week when Bob Perfect for Today again brings you The Bob Show from Bobby Wood.

383
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,360
This girl knows that Bob is the essence of romance.

384
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,540
Who tonight?

385
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:58,000
BanditNorAlPref.com is the essence of collagery as most of the subsequent collages will continue to demonstrate.

386
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,200
And just as Fernanda Nande-Lemur is the killer of Bob.

387
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,980
You'll have to get rid of him somehow for good.

388
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,980
But how?

389
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,900
Suddenly you found the answer.

390
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,700
It's as simple as kill Bob.

391
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,860
Kill Bob.

392
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,600
If he contacts you, don't try to help him.

393
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,260
He's dangerous.

394
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,380
Bob, Bob.

395
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,520
Hello?

396
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,420
Hello.

397
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,840
Did you hear the news on the radio?

398
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,480
They say I killed Bob.

399
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,620
Guess that's when I must have fallen asleep.

400
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,940
Bob's the only person I can kill.

401
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,280
I can kill Bob.

402
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,480
First thing I saw was Bob's body.

403
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,180
Then the gun beside me and I killed Bob's body.

404
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,300
Are you sure?

405
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm afraid so, Bob.

406
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,640
I don't think the police will believe it.

407
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,700
But it's the truth.

408
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,600
I killed Bob's.

409
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,640
Yes, Bob.

410
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,700
Yes, Bob.

411
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,740
You've got to answer it, Bob.

412
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,040
Hello?

413
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:47,920
Hello, Bob.

414
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,240
Oh, darling.

415
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,360
Listen to me, Bob.

416
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,840
She was in love with Bob.

417
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,740
Oh, no, Bob.

418
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I was at the cock party.

419
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,800
I actually thought I could kill Bob.

420
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,400
Where did you go after the cock party last night?

421
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,380
Somebody set up a boot trap in your cabin.

422
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,840
It was a dark one, Bob.

423
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,460
Then it did just that.

424
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,080
I said I could kill Bob.

425
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
She meant that boot trap for you.

426
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,200
Don't look away, Bob.

427
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,480
Perhaps I did kill Bob.

428
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,520
Doesn't that make sense?

429
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:15,960
Well, yes.

430
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,960
Yes, it makes sense.

431
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes, Bob.

432
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,600
Bob.

433
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,120
Listen, Bob.

434
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm sorry about Gavin, but he's a little stressed.

435
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,880
Okay, but hell, he doesn't have to jump down my throat.

436
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Does he have a family or relatives?

437
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,040
Yeah, I have a wife and a child.

438
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,260
Okay.

439
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,180
You know, the deceased, what's his name, Dobbs, does he have a family?

440
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:37,900
Yes, he does.

441
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,620
He has a family.

442
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,920
He has a wife and two young kids.

443
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,980
I think they're divorced.

444
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,340
His kids are divorced?

445
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
What the fuck is wrong with you?

446
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Do you laugh at anything?

447
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,060
I mean, do you just laugh at anything?

448
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,880
A man has died.

449
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,660
She thinks this is funny.

450
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,160
No, no.

451
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,920
Are all you movie people like this?

452
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,440
Go, go, go.

453
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,700
Here's Bob One for A1 Slack.

454
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,260
Hi, this is Bob One.

455
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,240
Years ago, my grandfather, Abner, was a movie star.

456
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240


457
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240


458
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240


459
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240


460
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240


461
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,240


462
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,280
Abner One, known for short because he was, invented the A1 Slack.

463
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,280
However, today's go-go action now generation man on campus and off wants a little more

464
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,840
out of life.

465
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,620
So, we added another leg to our super slim from fitting A1 Slack and came up with super

466
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,240
slim from fitting A1 Slacks.

467
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
A1 Slacks, the two-legged action slacks for the two-legged action man.

468
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,940
Thank you, Bob.

469
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,400
You're welcome.

470
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,720
And now, back to our movie.

471
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,020
Looks like we're gonna find more and we've clicked it.

472
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,220
And we've, uh...

473
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,420
Over the years, because of the church, this...

474
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,520
We went public in 19...

475
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,920
Actually, July...

476
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,820
January 1st, 1980, we printed the first sacred subgenius pamphlet and have been misunderstood

477
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,300
from that day on.

478
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,820
But you know, as they say, those who know don't say and those who say don't know.

479
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,780
So we should all just shut up.

480
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,440
But look here, we keep blabbering on and on.

481
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,380
Is it the drugs?

482
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,200
That's what the Cleveland Police Department...

483
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,360
The Cleveland Police Department might tell you.

484
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:11,520
In fact, a friend of ours sat in on a lecture to the Cleveland Police Department by a cult

485
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,380
expert who explained that Bob was a sign for Satan and drugs and stuff.

486
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,500
But obviously, friends, this is a religion.

487
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,580
Bob is here to replace the drugs.

488
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,620
Just looking at his face eats up more brain cells than most of your drugs.

489
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:37,040
If you're doing it right, like a real subgenius, if you can meditate upon the dots, every

490
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,220
little dot...

491
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,140
So many of you have done this, I know.

492
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:47,880
You just focus on that thing and after a while, you feel so much slack.

493
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,460
It's like heroin combined with PCP combined with DDT, LSD, and marijuana, as my father

494
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,040
puts it.

495
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,500
Um...

496
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:09,000
But what Bob's preaching is the joy of drugs, but not necessarily with the drugs, although

497
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,580
those can certainly enhance everything for the first ten minutes.

498
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,860
What Bob preaches is slack, friends.

499
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:28,700
And slack is so simple that I can't explain it, because it's different for each person.

500
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,200
Everybody has their own form of slack.

501
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:40,320
Some people get their slack from sitting on their ass watching TV and drinking beer.

502
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,140
There's nothing wrong with that.

503
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,420
The conspiracy of the normal people would love for that to be the only way you feel

504
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,700
you're getting slack.

505
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:57,700
We're here just as a pep talk, just a reminder that slack is whatever makes you feel like

506
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,320
you're doing what you were supposed to be doing.

507
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,780
I'm not saying you're not supposed to be doing what you're supposed to be doing.

508
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,520
I'm saying you're not supposed to be doing what you're supposed to be doing.

509
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,200
And that could be anything, you know, for our friend Dennis Murphy here.

510
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,240
Slack might be...

511
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,980
God, I can't even begin to imagine.

512
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,860
Maybe I should have picked a different...

513
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,460
You know, some people like bird watching, right?

514
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,780
Some people like pornography.

515
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,560
Some people like movies, you know?

516
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,020
Some people like people.

517
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,260
And just hanging out and talking.

518
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:30,760
And that's the thing.

519
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:30,760


520
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:30,760


521
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,660
Slack can be your purest form of slack.

522
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,680
And you can steal that slack while on the job, as you've learned around the coffee machine,

523
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
I'm sure.

524
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:50,700
As my good friend and speechwriter, you might say, Dr. Onan Kanabite put it, slack is the

525
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,520
oomph in comfortable.

526
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,760
That's it.

527
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,640
See, he has some stage...

528
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,760
He has...

529
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Slack is the oomph in comfortable.

530
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:00,760


531
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:00,760


532
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:10,200
It says, oomph is accompanied by a gesture of vigor from the hips among adults or a pumped

533
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
elbow on US TV.

534
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,520
So, it could actually be slack is the oomph in uncomfortable.

535
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,160
Why do I keep wanting to say uncomfortable?

536
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,260
And as I said, slack can come when you throw good money after bad and bad money after Bob,

537
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,740
and that's fine.

538
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,440
That's why that sales table is out there.

539
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,280
This...

540
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:42,100
Oh, and we have a new book out, Intelligent Design for Dummies, our new publication.

541
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,220
So, be sure, if you think you've already bought all the accessories that go with Ken and Barbie,

542
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,740
there's some new accessories out there.

543
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,780
So...

544
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,940
So, you know Bob has many death days.

545
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,660
What's his birthday?

546
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:07,660
Bob has had so many lives, so many past lives that by chance, you know, one of almost

547
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,240
every day of the year is the birthday of a Bob.

548
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,800
Where is Bob now?

549
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Is there somebody that we should be looking towards?

550
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Where is Bob?

551
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:22,740
Is he mayhaps fishing on Lake Titicaca with G. Gordon Gordon?

552
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,960
Is he perhaps selling ice to an Eskimo somewhere in Alaska?

553
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,680
Is he perhaps selling hypocrisy to a subgenius in San Francisco?

554
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,680
But Bob is a traveling salesman and resides at no fixed address, unlike the god of the

555
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:50,460
Mormons, who is known to be on a planet circling the star Koloff, having sex with his many

556
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,260
spirit wives.

557
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm talking about a guy named Smith on terrible pieces.

558
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,760
Although we don't know where Bob is.

559
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:56,840
Joseph Smith?

560
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,020
Yes.

561
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,180
He's a man of his word.

562
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,180


563
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,500
We know that Bob is coming.

564
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,180
And when I say that, I don't mean...

565
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,440
It has been said.

566
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,360
It's not like when Jesus is coming.

567
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,840
That usually means Jesus is on his way, is due to arrive.

568
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,040
When we say Bob is coming...

569
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,540
Like Santa Claus.

570
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,800
...Bob is literally...

571
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,020
That is what Bob is.

572
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,460
...is always coming.

573
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,300
And it's true.

574
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,440
I mean, but isn't he sometimes there, and then other times not?

575
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,900
Yeah.

576
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,960
When you come tonight, you will see Bob.

577
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, otherwise...

578
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,320
I'll be looking...

579
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,540
...about an hour and a half.

580
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:26,820
...of course, in the next couple of hours.

581
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:26,820


582
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:26,820


583
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,240
You're not defeating him.

584
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,200
That's terrible, though.

585
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,080
I don't want to see him.

586
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,160
No, no, I'll be home by then.

587
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,700
And you can't move.

588
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I know, but I just don't want to see him during that thing, you know.

589
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,800
You don't want to be everywhere.

590
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,180
But, I mean, don't you think you'd understand it all at that point?

591
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,460
Or maybe not.

592
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,480
I think that's when the shark bites you.

593
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,040
That's the part I thought about.

594
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,520
Because you're looking...

595
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,360
There are others swimming around, and a shark bites you, and if you're...

596
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
Because you're being distracted.

597
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeah, and if you're together enough to understand that last big organism, then you're pretty

598
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,000
well set.

599
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,800
Instead of the music stopping, you're just sitting there, and you're just...

600
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


601
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


602
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,460
No, you shouldn't have...

603
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,680
...like some amateur show on a stupid radio theory.

604
00:29:59,680 --> 00:29:59,680


605
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,400
No, it's now that Bob's coming your way.

606
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,900
He's coming your way.

607
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,320
He's coming your way.

608
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,660
He is.

609
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,040
Ah!

610
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,200
K-runch.

611
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,740
Bob!

612
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,960
I mean, no, I said, oh, god.

613
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,440
I mean, oh, Bob, I did.

614
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,400
Well, there are no atheists in foxholes.

615
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,860
I mean, I'm just a little bit...

616
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,200
Hey, Gav!

617
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,480
Cat!

618
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,680
Where the hell am I?

619
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,780
Dobbs just died.

620
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,980
Who's he?

621
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,120
He was your bright idea, wasn't he?

622
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,840
What do I know?

623
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,440
I'm just the writer.

624
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,660
Hey, you better get up there to the desert and do a rewrite before some other idiot gets

625
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,120
hold of it.

626
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,780
Who will play Bob in the movie of Bob?

627
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,260
Uh, oh, it's called In the Name of Bob.

628
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,020
...around Robert Downey Jr. or, uh...

629
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,620
Plan B Productions, I think, has slated to produce that.

630
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:56,800
Oh, yeah.

631
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,560
There's that Lithuanian actor.

632
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,280
Johnny Depp plays the young Ivan Stang, and Jim Carrey plays Philo Drummond.

633
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:13,800
I don't know who else has been cast yet, but Bob would be Andy Serkis, the guy that

634
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,180
played Gollum and Kong.

635
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,140
Right, Andy Serkis.

636
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,640
That would be good.

637
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,160
Absolutely.

638
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,760
So he would basically be a performance capture.

639
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,180
And Mike Myers is the voice of Cthulhu.

640
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,700
You can see we've been thinking.

641
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:26,780
Oh, yeah.

642
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,240
We've been thinking about that.

643
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,720
Very true.

644
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,240
Very true.

645
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,760
Any love interests in the film?

646
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:38,440
Yeah, uh, the hero would be lonesome cowboy Dave, and I think it would be his, uh, he'd

647
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,360
be courting, uh, popular bull girl Daveena.

648
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,160
It's voiced by Lindsay Lohan.

649
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,260
Yeah.

650
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,160
In a bikini.

651
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,620
Just because.

652
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,480
Just because.

653
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,780
And they're all penguins, right?

654
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
Yeah, I love them.

655
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,060
That's right.

656
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,700
They're all CGI penguins.

657
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,120
I'll take them in.

658
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,960
creates all the cute stuff on any TV set.

659
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,040
Tons of outlining everything you can wear.

660
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,040


661
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,040


662
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,280
Ooh, Mark.

663
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,280


664
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,320
That's funny.

665
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,320


666
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,320


667
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,740
What's glassy?

668
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:17,740


669
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:17,740


670
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:17,740


671
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:17,740


672
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:17,820
I wish I could help you.

673
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:17,820


674
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:17,820


675
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:17,820


676
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:17,960
essentially님이aciason.

677
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,580
Intro to a second half Vin Conservashing like to something that they should really

678
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:21,920
like.

679
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,900
It is the thinking studio.

680
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,800
I gotta get a employed.

681
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
one of my favorites. I never saw the remake.

682
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,080
What is this thing?

683
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,260
It stinks. That was a joke.

684
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,000
That was a joke. It stinks.

685
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,220
What is this thing? The second big feature

686
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,480
was a

687
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,360
possible name for a subgenius

688
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,380
feature movie. What was the name?

689
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,620
Second big feature.

690
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,840
I thought they were like a real band.

691
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,080
Second big feature? Yeah. But

692
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,320
Philo disabused me of that notion tonight. He said it was

693
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,020
just negative land.

694
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,400
The Swingin' Love. Wait, write that down.

695
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,660
That's a good name for a band.

696
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,320
Yeah. Not negative man.

697
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,240
Negative land.

698
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,340
Nobody expected what happened next.

699
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,560
Sensational career.

700
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,820
I'm Bob.

701
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm Bob.

702
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,180
So why are so many people

703
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,320
flocking to Bob?

704
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,260
My message is that God is

705
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,220
a hope that he'll take us places

706
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,160
we've never dreamed of. It's hard to break

707
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,080
a dick to break a dick. You may be misleading

708
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,260
some people. So big. Being gay.

709
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,440
Gay and generous.

710
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,160
Leading them to some false god

711
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,200
or something like that. Deluding and

712
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,000
dumbing down.

713
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,900
You know.

714
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,240
Right up there

715
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,220
with gardening. Bam, there's a hit.

716
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,200
Great, great, great, great, great, great.

717
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,160
Wait, you're saying that. Great, great, great,

718
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,660
great, great, great. Oh my God.

719
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,360
Nothing. Make beautiful women

720
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,440
fall all over you. No doubt there.

721
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,360
Take steroids. Slack, slack, slack.

722
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,360
Cut, cut. I'm weak.

723
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,480
Now, a lot of people say

724
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,560
that some

725
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,540
terms that are in the

726
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,660
in the, as you

727
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,140
say, the bibliography on the

728
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,480
the

729
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,180
cyclopedia

730
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,800
it kind of uses

731
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,500
notions similar to, not the

732
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,460
same as, but in the same area as

733
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,700
Scientology or kind of a new agey

734
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,400
but in a fashion

735
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,340
that's almost Dada-esque.

736
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,420
Well, you know,

737
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,660
any religion or priesthood

738
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,360
is based

739
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
on impenetrable jargon.

740
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,860
Lawyers, doctors,

741
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,120
for instance. And we get a lot of

742
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,380
lawyers and doctors joining up

743
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,360
because they appreciate

744
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,720
that impenetrable

745
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,120
obfuscation

746
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,360
and invented words.

747
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,620
And words

748
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,900
that have been recombined.

749
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,460
So that when you're reading

750
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,380
this stuff, you feel like you're really part

751
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,100
of a secret army. And

752
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,940
the great thing is, you are.

753
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,480
It's not much of a

754
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,440
I mean, it's still a secret, so it's

755
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,320
not that much of an army. Not much of an army, yeah.

756
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,340
But, you know, it's kind of like

757
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,120
what they used to say about Fight Club.

758
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,520
Yeah, yeah. First rule, don't talk

759
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,540
about it. Don't talk about it, yeah. Of course, naturally

760
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,820
everybody talks about it.

761
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,080
Well, and, you know, the Hell's

762
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,220
Angels used to say, those who say don't

763
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,200
know, and those who know don't

764
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,160
say. And we should probably

765
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,120
just shut up. Well, yeah, and

766
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,580
then the show would go right to hell.

767
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,160
I like

768
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,080
one thing about it, and I always say, you know, this

769
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,020
has got to be the best deal

770
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,440
in organized,

771
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,720
shall we say, religion

772
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,060
or church, and that is

773
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,160
guaranteed salvation or

774
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,180
triple your money back. That's

775
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,200
right. Eternal salvation or triple your

776
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,940
money back. That's an offer.

777
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,580
That no other religion makes.

778
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,740
Well, you know, none of them do.

779
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,960
And I'm thinking, you know, now, there's one you can

780
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,000
grasp. That's the

781
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,360
kind of church I can get behind.

782
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,000
Right. It costs $30

783
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,880
to join, and that means

784
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,000
that if you, at the end of

785
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,720
time, find yourself in

786
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,280
the pit of hell,

787
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,960
we will gladly

788
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,080
refund your money. Not only

789
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,020
your $30, we'll give you $90.

790
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,020
Now, there is

791
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,880
a little book that Bob's

792
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,180
else down there called

793
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,840
Hell on Five Cents a Day,

794
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
which I think is $89.95.

795
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,260
Nowadays, yeah.

796
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,860
And a day lasts a long time.

797
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,020
In hell. Yeah, in normal hell.

798
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,660
Now, subgenius hell is kind of like

799
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,960
an endless party. Well, that's my

800
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,020
idea of a good idea. Right.

801
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,400
Yeah.

802
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,000
You know,

803
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,880
it's possible. Some people think the

804
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
subgenius thing is just a joke.

805
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,020
And, I mean, some people think...

806
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,580
Well, compared to what, though? Right, exactly.

807
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,880
You know, everybody's religion is

808
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,500
going to be a joke to somebody else.

809
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,800
One of them has to be true.

810
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,460
What if it was this one?

811
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,780
Who knows? Who knows? Crazier things

812
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,420
have happened.

813
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,660
Look at the Inquisition.

814
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,200
Look at the news. See?

815
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:10,920
Yeah.

816
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,860
You know,

817
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,600
I wouldn't be surprised at anything

818
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,820
that would happen, although

819
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,800
we are kind of

820
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,880
behind Scientology. We got started

821
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,820
a little bit later. That's all right.

822
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,720
All right. So did L. Ron Hubbard.

823
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,580
Hold on a second, if you will,

824
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,860
Reverend. We're going to take a quick break here.

825
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,440
Reverend Ivan Stang. He is the founder

826
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,760
of the Church of the Subgenius.

827
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,460
And talking more about the Church

828
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,420
of the Subgenius, for those of you out there who've never

829
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,480
heard of it, well, here's a chance to find

830
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,800
a religion you can really get behind.

831
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,900
Or next to, or in front of, or...

832
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:43,840
Something.

833
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,360
Vidae, vau, vidae, ev, nom, nevus, hier, fo, hier,

834
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,100
five, the number, it's nine, alf, eno, vut, mas,

835
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,900
eno, mis, sky, McBarber, you're listening to

836
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,380
the New England Radio 50-week KOA.

837
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,340
I just don't understand.

838
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,740
What's that horrible stench?

839
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,120
The laughing lemur.

840
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,320
Is there much communication

841
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,240
with otherworldly subgeni?

842
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,460
Well, there's,

843
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,200
of course, on other continents,

844
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,000
there are the Euro

845
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,620
subgeniuses. There's a Euro subgenius

846
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,000
Yazu.

847
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,020
You know,

848
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,220
oddly enough, as the dollar

849
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,880
becomes more

850
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,360
less...

851
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,300
less and less valuable compared to

852
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,520
other countries' money,

853
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,460
we get fewer memberships

854
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,440
and ordainments here in the U.S.,

855
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,060
but we're making a mint

856
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,320
off of, all of a sudden, in Euros.

857
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,280
People in Europe are

858
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,620
joining up, and Australia,

859
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,840
all the English-speaking world.

860
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,180
But we're also

861
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,240
starting to hear from Russians, and

862
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,420
oddly enough, a lot of

863
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Nigerians keep offering us

864
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,360
huge fortunes.

865
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,960
As long as you give them

866
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,240
your...

867
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,560
bank account number.

868
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,060


869
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,940
So, um, yeah, it's

870
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,640
it's definitely one of the

871
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,280
world's fastest growing religions.

872
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,320
But it's not a snack religion.

873
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,620
It's strange, but true.

874
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,680
Well, it is a sack religion.

875
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,760
No, a snack.

876
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,240
Oh, I'm sure it's a snack religion.

877
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,060
Okay, very good.

878
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,360
We push Bob as a short-duration personal

879
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,720
savior. We don't expect you to

880
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,540
cling to it forever. It's...

881
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,240
We don't want you to use Bob as a crutch.

882
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,220
Rather, we want...

883
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,400
to let...

884
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,600
You should let Bob use you as a crutch.

885
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,960
You are Bob's crutch.

886
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,260
I'm interested in your information.

887
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,920
I'd like to subscribe to the newsletter.

888
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,800
Wait, I already do.

889
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,920
You go to subgenius.com and

890
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,680
click on the news button.

891
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,980
It's actually all very logical.

892
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,020
There used to be a hard copy, that

893
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,780
famous publication,

894
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,720
The Stark Fist of Removal.

895
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,240
But in the cyber age, it

896
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,100
doesn't come out very often. We allow special members,

897
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,200


898
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,280
to print out the online version.

899
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,920
Well, you know, and...

900
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,300
and... and...

901
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,400
and... Dobbs made most of his important deals

902
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,900
in strange places when he first started out.

903
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,540
Like a Waffle House in Haightville, Georgia.

904
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,540
I thought it was Ellicott City, Maryland.

905
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,820
It was the Stuckeys in... in Texas.

906
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,480
Well, there were several.

907
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,600
See, Stang has to be...

908
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,300
He knows all this stuff.

909
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:12,840
Right.

910
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,880
Where... where was it?

911
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,880
He fell asleep.

912
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,200
Stang.

913
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,020
Um...

914
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,880
I think... I think Stang's...

915
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,680
He's checking his back machine.

916
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,440
He's suffering the wounds of Cripes.

917
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,140
Mm-mm-mm.

918
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,400
Hey, you know, I got a joke.

919
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,100
What's the... what's the difference between

920
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,060
Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

921
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,460
Are you guys talking about me?

922
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,180
No.

923
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,920
We were saying we're, uh...

924
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,300
I was actually, uh...

925
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm in the process of flipping a...

926
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,020
a tape, so, uh...

927
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,500
Are we supposed to be funny now?

928
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,600
No, I don't think so.

929
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,820
No, we wanted to know the connection between

930
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,020
the Raelians, on the one hand,

931
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,660
Dr. Sinister's show,

932
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,360
and Bob's hardest sell, not anything to do with primate arrest.

933
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,180
So what is... what's the difference between, uh...

934
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,580
What's the difference between Jesus and a picture of him, I don't know.

935
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,320
Oh, yeah, that was it.

936
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,780
Yeah.

937
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,640
What's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

938
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,440
You only need one nail to hang up the picture.

939
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:09,960
Oh!

940
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,980
Hey, what's... what's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

941
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,040
The picture is real.

942
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,380
Oh!

943
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,640
Keep going.

944
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,260
Oh.

945
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,920
But Bob is real.

946
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,960
Bob is real.

947
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,360
Bob is real.

948
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,600
You should be careful, you know.

949
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,060
You don't want to offend the Arabs, saying Bob is real.

950
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,900
Bob is real, and there was a waitress in, uh,

951
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,600
Hapeville, Georgia, who...

952
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,400
I can't say this stuff on the air.

953
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,300
Sure you can.

954
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,140
Well, can you?

955
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,240
No, I can't.

956
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,840
Um, it... it... it... it...

957
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,180
Somebody found a Dobbs head in a pancake?

958
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,080
No, no, no, no, no.

959
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,860
It's much more complicated than that.

960
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,360
Um, when I met her, I was... it was about 3 o'clock in the morning, and, yeah, she was

961
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,200
a... she was a Waffle House waitress, which, you know, is pretty normal.

962
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,200
And, uh, and she started telling me... I had on a Dobbs shirt, and she said,

963
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,460
I've seen him.

964
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,660
He was here with these weird guys.

965
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,140
And she tells me this long story, and I can't really tell it on the air, to...

966
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,600
not giving... I don't want to give away too many secrets.

967
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,440
What, like the guys weren't really guys?

968
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,760
They were like aliens, or something?

969
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
You know, what's... what's the difference?

970
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,200
Yeah, you're on a racetrack.

971
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
But she had met Bob.

972
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,060
Just that she had met Bob?

973
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,220
Yep.

974
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,600
Oh.

975
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,880
She had served Bob a cup of coffee.

976
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,160
That's not unusual.

977
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,940
Uh, Bob often has been where a subgenius arrives, just before the subgenius got there.

978
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,320
You hear that all the time.

979
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,600
I actually have seen him before.

980
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,960
Subgeniuses are always arriving just as Bob has just... has left.

981
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,820
I've... I've seen him a couple times, actually.

982
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,980
Well, people wonder if he's a memory or a premonition, because the... it's so fleeting,

983
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,620
and... and they're just aware of something having happened.

984
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,080
I've seen him driving away twice.

985
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,260
I've been passed by Bob on the highway at least twice.

986
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,900
Actually, I saw him get thrown out of a coffee shop, actually, because...

987
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,360
Really?

988
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,980
Because he wouldn't put his pipe out, you know, and they... they threw him out, and...

989
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,380
He can't.

990
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,320
That pipe can't go out.

991
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,660
Exactly.

992
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,640
And I... I... but I figured I'd just leave it, you know, hands off, you know.

993
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,200
And, uh, I don't know what exactly it was, but the people in there got really upset about something.

994
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,020
They forcibly threw him out, like literally threw him out, and right as soon as he threw him out,

995
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,560
a big bus came by, and...

996
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,620
A bus came by, and hit him right as they threw him out there, and then he was gone.

997
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,380
You see, that's...

998
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:28,740
And all I saw left behind was like... there was like some, uh, like a smoldering of the, uh, of like a broken pipe there.

999
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,620
But then again, you know, next week I saw Bob again, you know, he was fine.

1000
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,840
Yeah, well, you know, it's funny, the reason...

1001
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,620
Sure, he'll be fine.

1002
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,600
...the Waltham House waitress was asking about the shirt I had on is that Bob never paid his bill.

1003
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,640
Ooh.

1004
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,900
Why is it always the rich ones?

1005
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,120
That was...

1006
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,380
I'm trying to tell you, you know, it really was Bob.

1007
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,920
Why is it always the rich ones?

1008
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,080
Well, if you tell me, it was like the sec... it was like the first night they were open at this particular location.

1009
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,560
So this had to have been back in like 58 or 60.

1010
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,840
And she still remembered the guy, because he stiffed her.

1011
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,540
You know, it...

1012
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,580
Well, you always remember the person who stiffed you.

1013
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,640
Yeah, the person who first stiffed you.

1014
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,820
Especially if they look like that, you know, and they're grinning while they're doing it.

1015
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,100
Your first night... your first night getting stiffed. Yeah, we always remember that.

1016
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,280
Has anybody delivered a pizza to Bob and, you know, 13-cent tip?

1017
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,700
Get the idea?

1018
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,940
Wow, a whole 13 cents?

1019
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,220
That's pretty good.

1020
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,060
Bob doesn't tip to drivers either. That's happened.

1021
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:26,320
I know a driver who delivered to him, and Bob doesn't tip.

1022
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,840
Bob says, let me give you a tip. Don't get screwed or something really dumb and witty like that.

1023
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,720
Yeah, he grabs the...

1024
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,880
It's the same thing to every pizza delivery guy.

1025
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,060
Yeah.

1026
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,160
My dad does that too.

1027
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,920
Do you know how a leper leaves a tip for a hooker?

1028
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,820
Oh.

1029
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:45,840
Oh.

1030
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,000
We can stop there.

1031
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,320
Man.

1032
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,520
That was a quick one.

1033
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,060
That was quick.

1034
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,600
It's old.

1035
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,740
Yeah.

1036
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,040
Yeah.

1037
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,780
Old like me.

1038
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:06,920
You know, and when I get home, I'll chop up another three shows out of this one real fast and take off for Texas.

1039
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,920
It's in Stang County where we go every December to help...

1040
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,880
...to help oversee construction on the compound.

1041
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,460
We're building a big cult compound in Stang County, Texas.

1042
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,900
You don't want to go down by Stang County, son.

1043
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,040
It's near Dead Branch Pass.

1044
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,400
Actually, in Stang County has a nuclear power plant that serves Dallas.

1045
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,220
It has a really big tax base. We have a lot of tax money because of that.

1046
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:46,740
And my family is very involved in city politics, county politics, and so forth.

1047
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,880
So we've been able to go forward on construction of this underground bunker.

1048
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,060
It started as a missile, an abandoned missile silo bunker.

1049
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,900
Even better.

1050
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,380
There are a lot of those in Texas.

1051
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,640
They've done the digging for you.

1052
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,280
Yeah, that's right.

1053
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,640
I saw something a while back about people living in these, in the bunkers, owning them, right?

1054
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,180
Yeah.

1055
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,340
Yeah.

1056
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:06,720
In their home.

1057
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,420
We did that, and we also have extensive tunneling going on.

1058
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,280
To the mall.

1059
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,440
Luckily, there's uranium, raw uranium on the land of Stang.

1060
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,780
Brilliant.

1061
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,880
And goats.

1062
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,440
Like every good compound.

1063
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,400
Why goats, you may ask?

1064
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,000
Well, because there was a drought.

1065
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,880
Why a goat?

1066
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,980
And the cows, there wasn't enough grass for the cows or the zombies.

1067
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,180
Goats in Jehovah.

1068
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:34,840
Yeah.

1069
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,360
But the goats, the goats are happy.

1070
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,500
We actually have a cult compound in Texas with goats.

1071
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,520
Slightly radioactive goats.

1072
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,460
Yeah, machine gun, you know, encampments.

1073
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,180
The horns glow.

1074
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,980
It's a terrible thing.

1075
00:46:52,320 --> 00:47:02,040
So we, most of the time, the other members of the Stang clan run the ranch.

1076
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,120
I just go down there every now and then to oversee it.

1077
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,100
The Stang stomping ground.

1078
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:07,800
The killing hound.

1079
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,760
Stang likes to go down there to supervise the killing.

1080
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:16,100
We're going to build a big TV studio there and a crystal cathedral.

1081
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,940
And a drive-through crystal cathedral so that, and a creation.

1082
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,780
Drive-through.

1083
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,060
Drive-by.

1084
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:28,320
And we're going to have a special museum about the way evolution really worked, where

1085
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,940
subgeniuses really came from.

1086
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,560
Where they'll be displayed.

1087
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,320
Audio animatronic yeti.

1088
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah.

1089
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,880
Arrival of the exes.

1090
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,020
The creation of the humans by the yetis and so forth.

1091
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,160
That's actually my favorite part.

1092
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,320
We have the audio animatronic Stang and Grover and the guys talking and their arms kind of

1093
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:45,580
moving.

1094
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,600
Are you familiar with the creation of the humanoids movie?

1095
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,560
Yes.

1096
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:49,920
Yeah.

1097
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,780
Most certainly.

1098
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,060
Yeah.

1099
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,700
That's a great film.

1100
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,700
The mandatory subgenius movie.

1101
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,360
Why doesn't he listen to you?

1102
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:57,760
What's his name?

1103
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,500
Gavin.

1104
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:58,740
Right.

1105
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,200
Garvin.

1106
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,400
Right.

1107
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,360
I can never remember his name.

1108
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,840
So why doesn't he listen to you, huh?

1109
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,660
Because I'm a human.

1110
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1111
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1112
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1113
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1114
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1115
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1116
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1117
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,900
I tend to rattle his cage.

1118
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,020
He doesn't like it.

1119
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,880
So was it like this before the actor?

1120
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,420
What was his name?

1121
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:09,880
The one who died?

1122
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,640
Dobbs.

1123
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,260
Yeah, Hobbs.

1124
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,280
What was going on then, huh?

1125
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:12,960
Anarchy.

1126
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,440
Dobbs was rewriting the script.

1127
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,420
He'd call script conferences every morning before shooting.

1128
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,300
It made everyone crazy.

1129
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,520
Well, you already had a script.

1130
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,620
What was the problem, huh?

1131
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,120
He was an actor.

1132
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,060
What can I tell you?

1133
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,920
He wasn't even good at it, you know?

1134
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,060
He was the look at me scratch my balls school of acting.

1135
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,400
Oh, such assholes.

1136
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,000
I asked this guy, Dobbs.

1137
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,940
I asked him last week.

1138
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,160
I said, why are you doing this?

1139
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:33,860
What did he say?

1140
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,640
He said it was a good idea.

1141
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,880
It was a generational thing.

1142
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,740
And what's that mean, huh?

1143
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,020
Beats the hell out of me.

1144
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,280
Little puke.

1145
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,220
Come on!

1146
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,800
You couldn't do anything to stop it?

1147
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,980
What could I do?

1148
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,720
Gavin had no control.

1149
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,900
He was terrified.

1150
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,100
Couldn't make decisions about anything, even about breakfast.

1151
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,840
It could have helped me, you know?

1152
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,040
Works.

1153
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,000
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

1154
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,420
Colts, Colts.

1155
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,500
Just out of time.

1156
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,320
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, went off.

1157
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,500
The incredible last wrong committed.

1158
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:04,620
I'm not going to do this again.

1159
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,620


1160
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,620


1161
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,620


1162
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,620


1163
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,620


1164
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,960
Committed.

1165
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,440
Committed.

1166
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,360
Now you do know, Colt.

1167
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:14,260
You know, with ADHD and, you know, just kind of, you know, you know, just kind of, you

1168
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,460
know, you know, uh, you know, um.

1169
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,760
You know, uh, put your arm around these young men.

1170
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,640
Watch it.

1171
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,100
Watch it.

1172
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,440
You know, but Colt, I, I, it's my Colt.

1173
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,820
I, uh, you know, you know, Secret Life on the Internet Colt.

1174
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,140
It, uh, it, well.

1175
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,060
Doody, doody.

1176
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,800
Uh, uh.

1177
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,020
It doesn't make any sense, you know.

1178
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:38,740
Action.

1179
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,560
And so we were, you know, coming.

1180
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,180
You know, it's, you know, you know.

1181
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,180
Hmm, hmm.

1182
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,680
So we got off, you know.

1183
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:51,420
I'm really deeply involved in girls and boys and girls today.

1184
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,480
Mm-hmm.

1185
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,380
In a cult.

1186
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,060
Perfect.

1187
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,780
Gone down the wrong road, but beautiful.

1188
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,900
Crazy things get said.

1189
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,600
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

1190
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,900
Back again.

1191
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,540
We're up right against the top of the hour and, of course, a news update.

1192
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,560
But want to, uh, get some final details from our, our, our good guest, the Reverend Ivan

1193
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,200
Stang.

1194
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,740
He's, uh, uh, the, the, uh, head, head, headmaster, I guess.

1195
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,380
And.

1196
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,860
No, uh, my, my, uh, title is Sacred Scribe.

1197
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,500
Cool.

1198
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,140
All right.

1199
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,200
Sacred Scribe number 273.

1200
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,700
Uh, Bob Dobbs is the living avatar of Slack.

1201
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,520
Wow.

1202
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,300
That's his official title.

1203
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,780
Not to be confused with the other Dobbs down the road from us.

1204
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:42,260
Um, uh, for those who wish to find out more and, or get your books and your, and your

1205
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,920
DVD and, and also, by the way, that, that hell on five cents a day kind of thing.

1206
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,440
Um, how does one do this?

1207
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:56,320
If you're on the internet, the simplest thing would be to look at subgenius.com.

1208
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:57,920
Mm-hmm.

1209
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,220
And I'll, uh, uh, subgenius does not have an O.

1210
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:01,940
Mm-hmm.

1211
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,180
I have to say that because there are a lot of subgeniuses out there.

1212
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,140
It's S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.com.

1213
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,160
All right.

1214
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,440
All right.

1215
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:13,960
Very good indeed.

1216
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,340
And Reverend Stang, I'm going to, by the way, I'm going to put you on hold.

1217
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,320
My producer, Steve, needs to speak with you, but, uh, I want to thank you so much.

1218
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,840
It's been a lot of fun.

1219
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Thank you very much.

1220
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,240
I'm just, I'm a little concerned that I'm going to have those Monkees songs stuck in

1221
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,900
my head for the next three days.

1222
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,740
An ear bug is the worst, isn't it?

1223
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:28,900
Yeah.

1224
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,440
Thank you very much.

1225
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:30,900
Indeed.

1226
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,200
And thank you for being here.

1227
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,200


1228
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,200


1229
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,200


1230
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,920
Thank you very much.

1231
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,520
Okay.

1232
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,580
And please stay there, Reverend, but thanks very much indeed.

1233
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,380
Praise Rick.

1234
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,920
And praise, praise Ivan.

1235
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,860
Anyway, we're going to take it up to the news.

1236
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm involved in a prostitution ring.

1237
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:49,300
President Bush says the U.S. will help Poland modernize its childhood obesity.

1238
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,820
Mr. Bush says health officials are overweight.

1239
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,600
I'm optimistic that we'll be able to live in deprivation and fear.

1240
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,020
Health officials say children and teenagers are not immune from congressional subpoenas

1241
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,660
as claimed by the Bush administration.

1242
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,280
The president also said today that this is PR News in Washington.

1243
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,040
A thanks to Leimur for that and PR News and laughing.

1244
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,900
This has been Hour of Slight Number 1143 with Dr. Hal Pasling, Evidence, Philo Drummond,

1245
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:25,760
John Hell, Mongoloid, and K. Robin San Francisco, Dr. Sinister and Princess Pisces, and Lonesome

1246
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,920
Cowboy Dave on WCSB Cleveland, and Governor Ratnar and No Money Mark.

1247
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:37,000
The movie soundtrack that is so weird is from Slipstream and the background music is Bonobo's

1248
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,120
Convergence from Last X Day and Next X Day.

1249
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,860
And now, from Norell, this message.

1250
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,900
For the safety of your smile, see your dentist twice a day.

1251
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,740
The Bob Show starring Bob and his guest star, Lone Throat.

1252
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,740
Bob's a good guy.

1253
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,900
He's a good guy.

1254
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,720
He's a good guy.

1255
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:01,940
He's a good guy.

1256
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,040
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

1257
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,640
This is Bob.

1258
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,000
I was so glad to be back I went down to the blood bank and gave a pint of blood.

1259
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,160
WC Fields was there too.

1260
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,000
He donated a fifth.

1261
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,780
Trip the Light, fantastic.

1262
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:23,820
Have you tried going a little buggy with a girl and a horse with a horse?

1263
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,660
The horse wants to go out for a little buggy.

1264
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,360
Get a horse.

1265
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,760
Black or brown or gray?

1266
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:29,880
Black or brown or gray?

1267
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,540
What a horse

1268
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,320
Robert, quit putting it in your pipe

1269
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:34,880
Jugs

1270
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,440
I thought you used your nose for that

1271
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,940
You talk like I was a freak

1272
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,000
I was a freak, freak, freak

1273
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,460
Father, I'm down here with a nice young man

1274
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,380
Get a horse

1275
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,440
Hello

1276
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,560
Wrong number

1277
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:47,960
Uh-oh

1278
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,560
Hello

1279
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,160
Hello

1280
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,580
Remove that film

1281
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,280
Quickly, easily, safely

1282
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,740
No one, no one

1283
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,820
Get a tube, get a tube

1284
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,600
Ladies and gentlemen

1285
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,200
You really like the girls, don't you?

1286
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,700
Yes, Bob, I do

1287
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,900
Now, ladies and gentlemen

1288
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,640
I'd like to introduce one of the reals of genius

1289
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,480
Thank you very much

1290
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,340
I presume you're Bob

1291
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,620
of genius

1292
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,960
I'm becoming known as the Bob of this generation

1293
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,820
Bob, magic Bob

1294
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,620
I know, Bob

1295
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,300
Why do I stand here reading this tripe

1296
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,780
when I can get a good job at Lockheed?

1297
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,860
I'm Bob

1298
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,780
Sit down, Bob

1299
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,960
I'll read your future

1300
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,340
I can tell you who's going to be in the White House

1301
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,320
I do a lot of deep thinking

1302
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,020
Get loaded

1303
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,800
So, uh, someone died?

1304
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,720
Yeah

1305
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeah, Dobbs

1306
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,320
You wrote the part of Ray for an African-American, right?

1307
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,400
I did?

1308
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,660
Yeah, man

1309
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,520
What's wrong with you?

1310
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,180
Are you on drugs?

1311
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,640
No, no, I'm not on drugs

1312
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,760
Ray, the character that Dobbs was playing, was black

1313
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,080
Dobbs wasn't a black actor, man

1314
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,080
He was white, like her

1315
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,580
Oh, my God

1316
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,980
Why did you kill me off feelings?

1317
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:52,780
Barbara

1318
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,280
I was just a script supervisor

1319
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,280
That's all I was

1320
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,140
It's Bob

1321
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,700
Now you have no control over me

1322
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,360
Continuity

1323
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,820
Nothing makes sense anymore

1324
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,720
It's so unfair

1325
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,760
It's just so unfair

1326
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,660
So unfair

1327
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,420
Go, go

1328
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,420
Mommy

1329
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,360
Mommy

1330
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,060
In dealing with Supernatural, uh, uh, Ray

1331
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,880
Reanimated mummies

1332
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,980
Played the old age home

1333
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,520
Just like DJs at Firecat Radio, ladies and gentlemen

1334
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,620
One day they are gonna mummify us

1335
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,660
And it will be an honor

1336
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,920
Your encrusted sarcophagus

1337
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,940
Rich with jewels and hieroglyphs

1338
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,920
Will be lowered into your own personal vault

1339
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,140
And sealed by the sands of time

1340
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,880
I want to be frozen in loose sight like Bob did

1341
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,040
Bob, Bob is, uh, one of the Bobs, Bob is the best

1342
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,040


1343
00:55:59,060 --> 00:55:59,700
in lucite.

1344
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,920
It could be frozen in the ice.

1345
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,260
Which we lost.

1346
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,600
Lost? Where did it go?

1347
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,760
Well, I mean, we lost ownership of it.

1348
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,980
But that's where Bob is?

1349
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,220
One of the Bobs?

1350
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,480
The one that Puzzling Evidence shot.

1351
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,040
Damn you.

1352
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,660
But he's like...

1353
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,180
It was a real flesh and blood Bob, that Bob.

1354
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,060
Wow.

1355
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,560
The scary Bob.

1356
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,840
When I introduced people to that Bob,

1357
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,040
they would do a great big double take.

1358
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,580
The last thing you expect

1359
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,580
is actually to be introduced to Bob.

1360
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,140
A small Bob.

1361
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,340
But then came that terrible day,

1362
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,960
the Victoria Theatre Show,

1363
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,940
the anniversary of the beheading

1364
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:49,240
of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette,

1365
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,520
the assassination of Bob.

1366
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,600
Yeah, we all remember where we were that day, don't we?

1367
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,740
I know where I was.

1368
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,840
And it's on videotape,

1369
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,480
and I can prove it.

1370
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,500
So, we have one Bob buried in Dallas.

1371
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,820
Is that right?

1372
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,900
Well, uh, you go back over the Hinckley Commission hearings,

1373
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,380
the entire official answer was sort of cobbled together

1374
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:22,340
out of variant strains of rumor and innuendo.

1375
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,240
Where's the director?

1376
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,220
Huh.

1377
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:26,760
Ah!

1378
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,040


1379
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,820
Let's get him!

1380
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:28,820


1381
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,840
John Woodhead!

1382
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:30,720
Oh!

1383
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,300
Come on!

1384
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,520
Cut! Cut! Cut!

1385
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,360
Cut!

1386
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:34,740
Cut!

1387
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:35,720
Cut!

1388
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:36,980
Cut!

1389
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,180
Cut!

1390
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:37,420
Cut!

1391
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,520
Hey, Harvey!

1392
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,300
Mr. Oh, I didn't know you were...

1393
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,180
It's his money, isn't it?

1394
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,400
Oh, well, I'm sorry, but you got it.

1395
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:43,780
You got it.

1396
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,160
Let's shot this.

1397
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,920
Hot shot!

1398
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,980
What are you talking about?

1399
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,620
What are you doing?

1400
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,020
I gotta get out.

1401
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,460
I've gotta get out of here.

1402
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:52,660
Stop.

1403
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,800
What are you doing?

1404
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,060
Fuck.

1405
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:58,840


1406
00:57:59,220 --> 00:57:59,980
I've gotta get back.

1407
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,820
It's 4 o'clock.

1408
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,560
It's 4 o'clock.

1409
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,380
My time's up.

1410
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,640
My time's up.

1411
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,100
I've gotta go.

1412
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,780
Please stop.

1413
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,180
My time's up.

1414
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I've gotta get back.

1415
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,820
I've gotta get back.

1416
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,280
I've gotta get back.

1417
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:10,720
I'm almost home.

1418
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,400
I'm here to help.

1419
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,080
Please stop.

1420
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,480
We're not gonna hurt him.

1421
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,500
What's wrong?

1422
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,820
He's on some kind of medication.

1423
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,300
Hey!

1424
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:16,880
Wait, wait!

1425
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,720
Oh, God!

1426
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,540
Please!

1427
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,280
Please!

1428
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,660
Please!

1429
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,120
Please!

1430
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,360
Please!

1431
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:21,380
Please!

1432
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:21,380


1433
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:21,820
Please!

1434
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,100
Please!

1435
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,360
Please!

1436
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,900
What's that, dear?

1437
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,680
Oh, yes.

1438
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,320
I heard.

1439
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,480
I heard.

1440
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,640
Poor old Felix.

1441
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,500
Cut!

1442
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,360
That's lunch, everyone!

1443
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,480
That's it.

1444
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,080
Good.

1445
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,200
Now I will count three.

1446
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,600
And at the count of three, you will wake up and...

1447
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,380
remember nothing.

1448
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,480
One, two, three.

1449
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,900
Ten thousand dollars.

1450
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,180
What do you know?

1451
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:10,580
Yes.

1452
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,160
Beautiful, isn't it?

1453
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,180
Ah, this castle is filled with rare old treasures.

1454
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,340
Feel free to browse, my friend.

1455
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,920
Thank you very much.

1456
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,580
A pleasant good evening to you.

1457
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:22,980
Thank you.

1458
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:22,980

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:22,960

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:22,960

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:22,960


1472
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:22,960


1473
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:22,960
