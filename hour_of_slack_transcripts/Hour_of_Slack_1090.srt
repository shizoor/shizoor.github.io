PR comes from the Non-Fun Foundation.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,220
PR is BJFD and BAPR.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,740
PR PR is PR.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,880
PR PR News.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,580
Confused?

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,580
PR Now.

7
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,080
Minnow says we end up creating a real root problem, which has to do with about 10 other problems.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,600
Supporters say it's obesity-related.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,220
Obesity. Those are his words.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,960
Monahan says diabetes and heart disease.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,780
We can wait.

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,820
She says lardolidin.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,280
That's the end of it.

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,460
Miriam says.

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,080
That'll show the sides where there's no monosomes, but there's not hot cell hard sex.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,140
Nelson says there's a sporting mall, and it's creepy.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:38,740
God.

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,380
She says mouth means good members.

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,580
This is PR.

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,500
So, Bob, you're making $5, $10, $15 a month?

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,140
Uh-huh.

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,560
Job?

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,640
Job? Not really.

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,500
How did you do it? You had help.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:53,860
Yep.

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,400
Who helped you?

27
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,440
Well...

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,780
The Self Genius.

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,980
Power of wax.

30
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,160
Pressure him.

31
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,700
Wow.

32
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,720
Or threaten him.

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,220
Persons attempting to find a motive in this show will be prosecuted.

34
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,560
Persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished.

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,120
Persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.

36
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,600
The man with a new idea is a fool.

37
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,720
Until the idea succeeds.

38
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,380
The Sad But Strange Story begins in New York.

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,520
60 years ago.

40
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,400
And so, in May 1900,

41
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,660
a skillful but envious and desperate,

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,360
undistinguished but alluring and halting but fashionable

43
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,720
and ordinary but careful, glittering-eyed man

44
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,960
with a fabulous automatic cue

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,400
and strange alluring flowing oriental raiment

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
registered at a automatic and desperate but fashionable

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,280
and fabulous hotel in famed but diminutive London.

48
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,440
I find...

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,520
I find you humans quite interesting.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,380
Even though you are a worthless, greedy lot.

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,720
How annoying that sound is.

52
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,880
Fools.

53
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,080
What fascinations there are on this planet.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,020
Strange mortals with curious customs.

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,860
We'll have a storm now.

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,160
And an earthquake if you like.

57
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,440
This makes me think, in the words of the great Mark Twain,

58
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,480
all that I care to know is that a man is a human being.

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,020
That's enough for me.

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,320
He can't be any worse.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,360
Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can read.

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,000
The wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,080
Grief can take care of itself.

64
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,000
But to get the full value of joy,

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,860
you must have someone to divide it.

66
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,060
And you must have someone to live with.

67
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,140
Adam and Eve had many advantages.

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,140
But the principal one was that they escaped teething.

69
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,980
We like a man to come right out and say what he thinks,

70
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,580
if we agree with him.

71
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,580
We ought never to do the wrong thing when people are looking.

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,100
Few things are harder to put up with

73
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,280
than the annoyance of a good example.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,960
I have been complimented many times.

75
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,300
And they always embarrass me.

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,160
I always feel they've not said enough.

77
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,200
Here's another one that's kind of funny.

78
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,060
Read this one.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,280
Man, these newspaper articles are coming thick and fast.

80
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,380
I must do this show.

81
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,020
Here, quit looking at that.

82
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,000
Do the show, man.

83
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,380
You look at that.

84
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,560
What?

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,720
Yeah, I gotta quit doing the show.

86
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,440
It's all about somebody's intestine.

87
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,300
Oh, yeah, something weird about...

88
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,240
It's the spooky horror tunnel of the show

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
where lots of effects happen.

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,680
I'll have to read that.

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,900
It's where we store all the hours of show.

92
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,360
Yeah, you have to read that one. It's funny, man.

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,680
He's in a temporary cabin, you know.

94
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,000
And it has the bathroom outside.

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,760
And it's cold because it's snowing.

96
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,640
Well, you have to go whether it's cold or not.

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,320
Yeah.

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,160
Sometimes you do if your guts are churning, right?

99
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,060
Yes.

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,140
You got that churning gut syndrome?

101
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,900
You gotta do something about it.

102
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,420
I know.

103
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,240
So you try to think of a good solution that's gonna be best for everyone.

104
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,300
Because you're in close quarters with other people.

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,480
You gotta really think about how it's gonna work out as a collective thing.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,480
You can't just go it alone every time.

107
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,820
You have to think about how it's gonna...

108
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,100
Your behavior...

109
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,640
Your behavior and your activities in close quarters amongst others will actually affect the others.

110
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,840
You can't just go off half-cocked, single-handedly and unilaterally,

111
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:48,300
completely unconscious of your behavior's effect upon the well-being and good nature of your fellow travelers

112
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
who are also stuck inside this tiny little room

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
with your smelly, vetted armpits exuding that odor.

114
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,640
Or at least mine.

115
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,120
Maybe not yours, but mine.

116
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,980
And now what?

117
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,460
Well, you've got...

118
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,340
Hey, dude, you look like you've got a piece of corn in your ear.

119
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,940
What happened?

120
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,960
Yes.

121
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,780
Well, it says Dick Cheney found the Holy Grail here on this other publication you have.

122
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,020
And a picture of him clutching it, too.

123
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Well, that's certainly unexpected development.

124
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,540
What do you think he's gonna do with that, Dr. Howell?

125
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,060
Do you think he'll use the Holy Grail for good purposes, or do you think he'll be...

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,720
No, I think he'll use it for some evil ceremony.

127
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,360
Do you think he'll use it for a satanic purpose?

128
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,340
To gain occult powers.

129
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:43,300
Do you think he'll concentrate his occult powers that he already had into a, like, a much more powerful position now that he has the Holy Grail?

130
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,360
Uh-huh.

131
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,880
In such a cracked-brain theory...

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,040
Excuse me.

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,280
Yes.

134
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,220
Hello?

135
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,500
Yes.

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,560
Yes, I see.

137
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,360
I see.

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,160
Here's the door.

139
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,220
We're inside the inner shell.

140
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,080
Careful.

141
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,740
Do you suppose Philo will find us?

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,900
I assure you, Henry, that Philo will never find us here.

143
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,480
Not in a million years.

144
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,980
Phew, that was close.

145
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,960
I got a look at him.

146
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,020
It was Philo.

147
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,300
He said they have agents.

148
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,580
Philo's probably one of them.

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
He'll be looking for you now, trying to kill you.

150
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,480
Philo's probably waiting.

151
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,760
I think they have...

152
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,720
You know, we figure some way...

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,780
Wait, I know.

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,500
How?

155
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,940
Listen.

156
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,880
What's this Philo like?

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,200
Hmm?

158
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,180
I don't know.

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,700
He's strange.

160
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,140
I see.

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,680
Well, I don't know.

162
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm beginning to get interested in your Philo.

163
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,800
Yes.

164
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,420
They have agents under him.

165
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,780
Hear me?

166
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,800
Hello?

167
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,160
Agents in...

168
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,280
Henry, look out!

169
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,660
There's a light!

170
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,820
Someone at the window.

171
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,880
Philo?

172
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,580
Philo.

173
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,260
I'll be glad to meet him.

174
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,280
Are you nuts?

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:48,960
Yes.

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,340
You'll recognize him.

177
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,460
I'll be glad to meet him.

178
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,460


179
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,460


180
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,340
You'll recognize the dropped palm of your old friend, Philo.

181
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,840
Philo?

182
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,880
But I thought...

183
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
That he was part of the conspiracy?

184
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,000
No, on the contrary.

185
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
No more nonsense.

186
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,360
Hmm?

187
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,800
But you...

188
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:01,980
You...

189
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,440
You...

190
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,840
You can't do this to me!

191
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,240
No!

192
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,600
No!

193
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:04,840
Just make it.

194
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
No more nonsense.

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah.

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
Like I said, I'm back from the dead.

197
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,440
Perfect guitar to take on Crusader.

198
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,700
Each is his own 새로운 shapes and shades.

199
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,400
Postbide.

200
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,400


201
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,880
Everybody can have one.

202
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:37,280
It's time for C 예 wegen Castle Charlotte.

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:49,940
Did you read it?

204
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,660
Well, I was walking down the street

205
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,580
Looking for a job

206
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,240
I ran into a man

207
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,820
Called himself Bob

208
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,840
Well, I forgot

209
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,700
I forgot I even needed a job

210
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,220
Oh, it all happened to me

211
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,760
When I ran into a guy named Bob

212
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,020
I was fresh in town

213
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,540
Didn't have a dollar

214
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,300
I was so poor

215
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,000
I was starting to holler

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,460
Then I ran into a man

217
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,360
Called himself Bob

218
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,660
And I plumb forgot about the fact

219
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,960
That I had no money and no job

220
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,120
Well, Bob is hot

221
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
And Bob is cold

222
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
And Bob is young

223
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
And Bob is old

224
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,940
But I forgot

225
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,700
Forgot I needed to know anything else

226
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh, it all happened to me

227
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,100
I just took my own personality

228
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,280
And put it up on the shelf

229
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,200
Bob's brain

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,020
So damn big

231
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,400
He'll make you look like a greasy little pig

232
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,480
Oh, you'll forget about your whole personality

233
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,480
As soon as you give your entire brain to Bob and me

234
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,400
If you're young

235
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,460
And you're looking for a job

236
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,100
Just look for a guy

237
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,680
Whose name is Bob

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,880
And you won't have to worry

239
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,660
About getting a job

240
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,280
You won't have no money

241
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
But you'll have Bob

242
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,140
Yes, you'll have Bob

243
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,280
Yes, you'll have Bob

244
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,000
Swingin' Bob

245
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,580
That was Swingin' Bob

246
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,060
By Glass Madness

247
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,180
Friends from the last century

248
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,840
And before that

249
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,480
Puzzling Evidence show

250
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,140
From KBFA and Berkeley

251
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,140
With Dr. Philo Drummond

252
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,880
Puzzling Evidence

253
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
And Dr. Howell

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,580
And Chloe

255
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,960
Prior to that

256
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,160
Cuts by Leemur

257
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,140
And words by Mark Twain

258
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,480
Cause this is the

259
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
Hour of Slack episode number

260
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,320
13

261
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,760
The Decadely Mark Twain Special

262
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,300
But first

263
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,920
Let's briefly go

264
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,300
20 years back in time

265
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,660
To answer several recent questions

266
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,020
From listeners

267
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,780
First

268
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,340
Is Bob your Jesus?

269
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,400
Bob is my Jesus

270
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Always does he please us

271
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,220
Everywhere he's near us

272
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,120
Always bold and fearless

273
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,180
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

274
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,800
Bob, Bob, Bob

275
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Bob

276
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,300
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,420
Bob, Bob, Bob

278
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,420


279
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,420


280
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,420


281
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,980
Bob, Bob, this is Bob

282
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,640
Bob Bill

283
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,420
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

284
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:01,440
Bob, Bob, Bob

285
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,440


286
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Bob, Bob, Bob

287
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:01,740
Bob, Bob, Bob

288
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:01,900
Bob Bill

289
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,000
Bill先

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,460
All good

291
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,000
Webb Hook

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000


293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000


294
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,060
it's so

295
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,900
then

296
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,000
Bob

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,120
Bob

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,120


299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,120


300
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,120


301
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,120


302
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,760
成

303
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,200
Closing

304
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,060
Washington

305
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,820
ini

306
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,140
grave importance and must see him alone tonight.

307
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,460
Dr. Pretorius?

308
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,420
Pretorius?

309
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
I don't sleep.

310
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,380
I hate those little slices of death.

311
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,120
Is that what you call an intelligence officer?

312
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
That's what I call a nut!

313
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,380
Yeah, I call him a nut too, but look how nicely he fits in on Earth, chasing Indians and blondes.

314
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,620
Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die, even the undertaker will be sorry.

315
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,720
There are two times in a man's life when he should speculate.

316
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,300
When he can't afford it, and when he can.

317
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,920
Fleas can be taught nearly everything that a congressman can.

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,840
In the South, the war is what A.D. is.

319
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,700
They don't come from elsewhere.

320
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,540
They date from it.

321
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,780
Everything human is pathetic.

322
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,280
The secret source of humor itself is not joy, but sorrow.

323
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,180
Thunder is good.

324
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,940
Thunder is impressive.

325
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,220
But it is lightning that does the work.

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,680
It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world, and moral courage so rare.

327
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,720
The meaning is everything.

328
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,680
The peach was once a bitter almond.

329
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,380
The cauliflower is nothing but a cabbage with a college education.

330
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,460
Familiarity breeds content.

331
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,440
And children.

332
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,740
To be a writer, one must observe three rules.

333
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,320
One, write.

334
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,880
Two, write.

335
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,480
And three, write.

336
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,420
My books are water.

337
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,280
Those of the great genius.

338
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,380
The greatest geniuses are wine.

339
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,480
Everybody drinks water.

340
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,940
As to the adjective, when in doubt, strike it out.

341
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,280
Write without pay until somebody offers pay.

342
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,960
If nobody offers within three years, sawing wood is what you were intended for.

343
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,260
A classic is something that everybody wants to have read, and nobody wants to read.

344
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,360
I make it a point never to smoke more than one cigar at a time.

345
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,540
There's nothing difficult about giving up smoking.

346
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,860
I've done it hundreds of times myself.

347
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,320
But there's still a danger between giving and not?

348
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,360
There's risk until a

349
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,360


350
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,380
Look in a good effort.

351
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,380


352
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,380


353
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,440
Poor things go in the past.

354
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,140
Because of us.

355
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,260
Drinking.

356
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,180
Washing.

357
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,940
Playing games.

358
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:30,940


359
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:30,940


360
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,800
Take coal.

361
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
Have drinking.

362
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,240


363
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,440
A special noise there just for you,

364
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,220
hour of slack listeners by Fernanda Ndelemer.

365
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,740
Friends, have you made your reservation for X-Day, July 5th?

366
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
You know, that's when the world ends.

367
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,500
Starting at Brushwood in New York,

368
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,540
the clothing optional campground where,

369
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,740
if they know about it,

370
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,820
from the events page on subgenius.com,

371
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,020
subgeniuses may gather to worship Bob as they choose.

372
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
They're naked.

373
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,320
So are we all the day we're born.

374
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
But we learn very modest.

375
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,360
Not all over.

376
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,080
Just in places.

377
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,660
But it's just as well, I suppose.

378
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,940
Naked people have little or no influence in society.

379
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,460
I forgot to bring my fake snake.

380
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,960
First time I was at a Winterstar,

381
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,700
I think I was on something,

382
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,960
but I walked into the drum cabin

383
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,100
and it was the first time I met that man.

384
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,600
I was sitting there.

385
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,200
Mr. Dennis Murphy.

386
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,800
His beautiful wife walked up and said,

387
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,100
hi, we're married now.

388
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,560
They were marrying everybody they met just then

389
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,780
just like I ordain everybody.

390
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,760
And when I walked into the drumming cabin

391
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,140
and I think it was Dennis was walking around

392
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,380
with a toy snake.

393
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,940
And I thought it was real.

394
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,360
I thought that you guys were in there

395
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,320
and they were dancing around candles.

396
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,860
They didn't even have a bonfire.

397
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,860
They didn't even have the fake flames then.

398
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,340
Yeah.

399
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,680
I thought, what have I gotten into?

400
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,120
These people are really nuts.

401
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,060
Since then, of course, the subgeniuses got to where they have sex with poisonous vipers.

402
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,720
You really don't want to hear the details about that.

403
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,920
Impromptu sermonizing there by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang from Winterstar 2007.

404
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:03,240
That's from Cleveland's Association for Consciousness Exploration, or ACE.

405
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,340
You can look at Rosencomet.com.

406
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,620
Now let's go see what has hatched from Lemur's drag nest.

407
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,600
Sergeant Friday, could I see you a minute, please?

408
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,420
Yes, all right.

409
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,800
There's the patient's name, right there at the top.

410
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,240
Miller.

411
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,680
12.30 p.m., a local broadcast and an APB was gotten out on Miller.

412
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,800
Then we sent a communication to the police department asking them to check for a possible lead on the Miller woman.

413
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,540
After that, we started making the rounds of the bars in the neighborhoods.

414
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,000
7.55 a.m. the following morning, I reported back in for work.

415
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,280
Morning, Joe.

416
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,080
Hi, Betty.

417
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,440
What do you know, anything new?

418
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,260
Uh-huh.

419
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,720
Mm-hmm.

420
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,240
No, I just happened to think, this description of the Miller girl.

421
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,460
The Miller girl's description?

422
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:52,820
Yeah.

423
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,020
That description of Miller?

424
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,500
Mm-hmm.

425
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,780
This part here doesn't make much sense.

426
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,120
Does it?

427
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,340
Lewis said Miller was small and fairly tall.

428
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,380
Dark blue eyes.

429
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,740
Long dark hair, dark eyes.

430
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,800
Long blonde hair.

431
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,600
Man sure doesn't figure.

432
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,140
9.05 a.m.

433
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,360
The traditional parade.

434
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
Some parade, isn't it?

435
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,160
Yeah, it's beautiful.

436
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,400
Drag nest.

437
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,840
And now, Chloe describes her first appearance on the Puzzling Evidence show.

438
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:34,240
It was one of the pinnacle points of my life because I got a phone call while I was at dinner with Rob from my boss at 12 Galaxy saying,

439
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,820
Hey, Chloe, you gotta get over here.

440
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,560
I got a giant busload of clowns and they don't know what to do.

441
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,600
Wow, look at that.

442
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,220
They just happened to arrive to perform at your show.

443
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, that looks good.

444
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,240
But I think that's the only time in my life that I'll have a busload of clowns being held up.

445
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,820
Don't be too sure about that.

446
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,460
Life is uncertain.

447
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,900
However, it's statistically likely that no more bustling.

448
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,760
Busloads of clowns will unexpectedly.

449
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,420
Be awaiting my beckon call.

450
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,040
Yes.

451
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,800
But I would be the last to wish to discourage you.

452
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,360
Hammer relentlessly on the forces.

453
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,700
The iconic representation of future technology.

454
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,480
Since one busload of clowns is already.

455
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,800
We can rest assured that.

456
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,400
Which means helicopters.

457
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,000
Appeared.

458
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,140
The backward aspect.

459
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,320
That shows that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that such a thing could happen.

460
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,620
That ancient religious movement will indeed save us once again.

461
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,680
That another busload of clowns.

462
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,820
Will be denied at any time.

463
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,080
From the busload of clowns.

464
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,820
I hope so.

465
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,800
Up here to assist you when you need it.

466
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,380
So once I was on a busload with a clown.

467
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,880
No, a clown had a busload.

468
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,120
He had a load in his what?

469
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,100
He had a load in his.

470
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,180
A load of clowns on a bus.

471
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,480
They were loaded.

472
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,480
He had a buttload of what?

473
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,900
He had a busload of.

474
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,660
They're on the bus.

475
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,080
But it was a clown bus.

476
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,080
It was a clown mode.

477
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,200
In his pants.

478
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,660
Clown mode?

479
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,400
There's a mode?

480
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,360
A buttload.

481
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,980
The mode is called clown mode.

482
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,780
Clown mode.

483
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:55,900
Clown mode.

484
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:55,900


485
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:55,900


486
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,840
And they're in clown mode.

487
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,280
Clown mode.

488
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,660
Buttload.

489
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,160
They have a bus that's got a buttload of clowns.

490
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,400
You ever thought about how much is a buttload?

491
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:02,920
That's a lot.

492
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,440
It's ice.

493
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
That's a shortened form of boatload.

494
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,420
Enough to fill the bowl.

495
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,460
Well, there is a bowl.

496
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,280
It may be enough for you to be a shortened form of boatload.

497
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,760
The clown bowl is the destination of all clown mode buses.

498
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,660
But I believe buttload also came from now you're letting your mouth overload.

499
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,160
Letting your ass overload your mouth again.

500
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,200


501
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,540
Yeah, your.

502
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,520
My favorite was your mouth is writing checks your ass can't support.

503
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:25,900
Yeah.

504
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,700
I love that one.

505
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:26,920
Yeah.

506
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,160
Can't cash.

507
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,940
Boy, some people are really.

508
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,840
Can't support.

509
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,940
Can't underwrite.

510
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,340
Can't.

511
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,600
You can't run from your own mouth is writing checks that your ass can't cash.

512
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
Okay, just for that, I got to do this.

513
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,260
Have you ever given anyone a MasterCard?

514
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
It's where you take your hand and you stick it in the crack of their butt and swipe it.

515
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,420
Yeah.

516
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,320
It's like a form of a wedgie, only it's just more directed to the point.

517
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah, I like that.

518
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,060
MasterCard.

519
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, it's called a MasterCard.

520
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,520
Yeah.

521
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,540
And that's as out of place as a Presbyterian in hell.

522
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,840
Fortune knocks at every man's door once in a life, they say, but in a good many cases,

523
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,900
the man is in a neighboring saloon and does not hear her.

524
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,880
I do not like work even when someone else does it.

525
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,240
When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around.

526
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,400
But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much he had learned in 7 years.

527
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,140
That's all Mark Twain's words, friends.

528
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,140
I'm gleaning this from a book called Man is the Only Animal That Blushes, or Needs to,

529
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,220
The Wisdom of Mark Twain, an ancient book by an ancient subgenius.

530
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,140
I beg your pardon, mister, but ain't you forgot something?

531
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,400
Forgot something?

532
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,300
Not that I know of.

533
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,900
Why?

534
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,660
My harp and my wreath and my halo and my hymn book and my palm branch.

535
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,520
I never heard of these things before.

536
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,980
Oh, trust me, you won't be conspicuous in this district without it.

537
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,700
Well, good day.

538
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,260
Where you really going in that thing, Mr. Twain?

539
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,840
Going traveling?

540
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,140
Travel has no longer any charm for me.

541
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,800
I've seen all the foreign countries I care to see except for heaven and hell,

542
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,220
and I have only a vague curiosity as concerns one of those.

543
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,440
Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.

544
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,460
I believe that our heavenly father invented man because he was disappointed in the monkey.

545
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,940
If Christ were here now, there is one thing he would not be.

546
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,400
A Christian.

547
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,940
My advice to girls.

548
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,700
First, don't smoke to excess.

549
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,320
Second, don't drink to excess.

550
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,000
Third, don't marry to excess.

551
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,180
If you can't get a compliment any other way, pay yourself one.

552
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,440
If you tell the truth, you don't have to.

553
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,700
You don't have to remember anything.

554
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,020
The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer someone else up.

555
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,820
It is a mistake that there is no bath that will cure people's manners, but drowning would help.

556
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,660
The man with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.

557
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,760
It is not best that we should all think alike.

558
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,500
It is difference of opinion that makes horse races.

559
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,160
It is easier to stay than get out.

560
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:09,860
Vast material prosperity always brings in its train conditions which debase the morals and innervate the manhood of a nation.

561
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,240
Loyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.

562
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,380
There are several good protections against temptation, but the surest is cowardice.

563
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,600
I reckon it's Mr. Twain.

564
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,860
I am the only man living who understands human nature.

565
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,780
God has put me in charge of this branch office and I retire.

566
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,020
There will be no one to take my place.

567
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,140
I shall keep on doing my duty.

568
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,980
When I get over on the other side,

569
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,920
I want to use my influence to have the human race ground again.

570
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,980
This time, ground good.

571
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,820
No omission.

572
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,380
No art.

573
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,260
If there was an all-powerful God, he would have made all good and no bad.

574
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:17,680
Whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is, knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam.

575
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,300
He was the first great benefactor of our race.

576
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,700
He brought death into the world.

577
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,240
Most people are bothered by those passages of scripture they do not understand.

578
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,660
But the passages that bother me are those I do understand.

579
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,000
You can't pray a lie.

580
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,720
I know that you are.

581
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
Well, look who's here.

582
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,920
You know, I begin to see that a man's got to be in his own heaven to be happy.

583
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,180
Perfectly correct.

584
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,860
Did you imagine that the same heaven would suit all sorts of people?

585
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,220
Go that way.

586
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,140
A million leagues or so.

587
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,920
Well, thank you, sir.

588
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,000
So long.

589
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,860
So long.

590
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,080


591
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,540
It's been swell.

592
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,220
It's been grand.

593
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,560
Our playing book, Airwings, Halo, size 13, size 13.

594
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
For Captain Eli Stormfield of San Francisco.

595
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,840
San Francisco, you betcha.

596
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,540
Make him out a clean bill of health and let him in.

597
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,920
Show me a cloud.

598
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,960
I'm all right now.

599
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:36,860
Shh.

600
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,540
I think.

601
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,160
Shh.

602
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh, sorry.

603
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,000
I forgot.

604
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,400
Shh.

605
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,760
You're supposed to be quiet.

606
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,860
Shh.

607
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,000
Shh.

608
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,920
Aha, for hem book and wings.

609
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,240
Good God, what a swindle.

610
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,260
I'm led to consider a different path.

611
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,020
Heaven for climate.

612
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,800
Hell for company.

613
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,080
Either way, you gotta die to get there.

614
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,340
Baby birds from the sky.

615
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,860
May the crows pick up their eyes.

616
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:33,080
America, wronged and betrayed by those guys in the Green Beret.

617
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,180
Dipping food was not enough.

618
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,900
I'm a little bit hungry.

619
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:39,900


620
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,600
The call's defeat was pretty tough.

621
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,080
Interrogate.

622
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,380
Kissing your sloes.

623
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,120
Death's too good for those mozos.

624
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,660
Burning flesh beneath their heels.

625
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,920
Screams of pain to them sex squeals.

626
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,880
Rubber hoses filled with smoke.

627
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,360
Sand.

628
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,880
Broken bodies.

629
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,700
Children of the land.

630
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,640
Down below are young white fries.

631
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,040
Green Berets cheers death from the skies.

632
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,120
But there is an napalm, too.

633
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,340
Making sure that their lives burn through.

634
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:38,880
Interregnizing.

635
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,650
The wreck that's being done

636
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,130
These murderers should all be damned

637
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,310
Harbingers of doom and pain

638
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,370
Their leaders are all insane

639
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,890
Cause they are baby birds from the sky

640
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,150
May the crows pick out their eyes

641
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,570
Humanity

642
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,250
From death betrayed

643
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,970
By those guys

644
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,710
In the green parade

645
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,210
On war, Twain said, there never was a just one,

646
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,690
never an honorable one on the part of the instigator of the war.

647
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,190
I can see a million years ahead,

648
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,590
and this rule will never change

649
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,130
in so many as have been.

650
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,910
Half a dozen instances.

651
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,950
The loud little handful, as usual,

652
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,550
will shout for the war.

653
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,970
The pulpit will object at first.

654
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,530
The great dull bulk of the nation

655
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,170
will rub its sleepy eyes

656
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,650
and try to make out why there should be a war

657
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,970
and will say earnestly and indignantly,

658
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,010
it is unjust and dishonorable

659
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,650
and there is no necessity for it.

660
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,310
Then the handful will shout louder.

661
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,470
A few fair men on the other side

662
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,290
will argue and reason against the war

663
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,370
with speech and pen

664
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,090
and at first,

665
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,250
will have a hearing and be applauded.

666
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,930
But it will not last long.

667
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,110
Those others will outshout them

668
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,230
and presently the anti-war audiences

669
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,690
will thin out and lose popularity.

670
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,350
Before long, you will see this curious thing.

671
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,170
The speakers stoned from the platform

672
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,190
and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men

673
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,710
who in their secret hearts

674
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,210
are still at one with those stoned speakers.

675
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,750
But do not dare to say so.

676
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,790
And now,

677
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,590
the whole nation, pulpit and all,

678
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,910
will take up the war cry

679
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,390
and shout itself hoarse

680
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,250
and mob any decent man

681
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,790
who ventures to open his mouth

682
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,610
and presently such mouths

683
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,050
will cease to open.

684
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,450
Next, the statesman will invent cheap lies

685
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,210
putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked

686
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,590
and every man will be glad of these

687
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,490
conscience-soothing falsities

688
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,390
and will diligently study them

689
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,290
and refuse to examine any refutations of them

690
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,610
and thus he will by and by convince himself

691
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,390
that the war is just

692
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,310
and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys

693
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,870
after this process of grotesque self-deception.

694
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,770
Mark Twain.

695
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,590
And Charles J.

696
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:54,810
If Soundbite continues its

697
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:54,810


698
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,390
fabrications,

699
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:05,510
every marginal media

700
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,570
It's all the way.

701
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,150
Death.

702
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,530
Is to have just distance.

703
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,090
Doom.

704
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,270
Is to stimulate casual.

705
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,830
As I are these saints.

706
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,750
The promise of those saints.

707
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,310
Sure.

708
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,410
But not this ball.

709
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,250
And I'll leave them with.

710
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,390
But I'm not going to keep on killing.

711
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,250
I'm going to keep on killing.

712
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,490
I'm going to keep on killing.

713
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,550
I'm going to keep on killing.

714
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,010
I'm going to keep on killing.

715
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,190
I'm going to keep on killing.

716
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:18,170
I'm going to keep on killing.

717
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,290
I'm going to keep on killing.

718
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,950
I'm going to keep on killing.

719
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,270
I'm going to keep on killing.

720
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,430
I'm going to keep on killing.

721
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:28,950
I'm going to keep on killing.

722
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,130
I'll keep on killing.

723
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,710


724
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,310
I'll keep on killing.

725
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:31,570
I'll keep on killing.

726
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:31,670
I'll keep on killing.

727
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,490
Thank you.

728
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,170
Thank you.

729
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,950
Thank you.

730
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,510
Thank you.

731
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,570
Thank you.

732
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,210
Thank you.

733
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,910
Thank you.

734
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,390
Thank you.

735
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,670
Thank you.

736
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,230
Thank you.

737
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,730
Noice proves nothing.

738
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,570
Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid.

739
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,730
People need pizzas.

740
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,810
This actually equals this.

741
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,570
Exactly.

742
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:53,310
I'm recommending five buttered pizza skins plus a pat of butter.

743
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,450
One thousand nine hundred and forty one grams of startling numbers for an average adult.

744
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,350
Eat larger portions.

745
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,470
Ruby works for a dog nutrition group, so it's hard to know what you're eating.

746
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,590
This looks healthy.

747
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,950
It certainly does in this case, though.

748
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,610
Two sirloin pizza skins with Caesar skins and buttered baked pizzas,

749
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,330
plus five buttered pasta butter.

750
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,630
That's a good idea.

751
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,450
Right now to the retard peeing on the pipes.

752
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,350
Live and edited.

753
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,410
Alright, it's true.

754
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,350
Uh, uh...

755
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,430
How could I do that?

756
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:42,730
Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.

757
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,510
My conscience is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started with.

758
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:59,770
It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there's no distinctly Native American criminal class.

759
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,310
Except Congress.

760
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:07,730
In statesmanship, get the formalities right, never mind about the moralities.

761
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:14,370
All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, and then success is sure.

762
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:20,130
Put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket.

763
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,770
There is an old time toast which is golden for its beauty.

764
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,330
When you ascend the hill of prosperity, may you not know.

765
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,070
Meet a friend.

766
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:39,690
Good breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person.

767
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:45,490
You aim for the palace and get drowned in the sewer.

768
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:52,090
Let us be thankful for the fools, but for them the rest of us could not succeed.

769
00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:00,330
The holy passion of friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring,

770
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:06,650
and so is the nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, if not asked to lend money.

771
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,150
On hold.

772
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,750
Farm life.

773
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,550
So any of that gum can help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

774
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,790
And thanks for holding.

775
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,050
You can get rich by holding.

776
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,190

I can't take your extension.

864
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:00,750
Thank you.

865
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,290
Thank you.

866
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,090
The Alzheimer's Association notes that Brain Biopsy features your top hip-hop, rock and

pop artists and albums with compilations of music videos, behind the scenes and interviews.

868
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:08,850
Hello.

869
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,490
Please hold while we connect you to an associate.

870
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,430
Premium hardwood.

871

The Alzheimer's Association provides a tool to detect one of the two well-known hallmarks

872

of Alzheimer's disease.

873
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,830
Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and Scientology.

874
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

875
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:19,850
Cross your legs.

876
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,750
Lie down on your back.

877
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,170
One of the most anticipated movies of the year, the enactment of NAFTA.

878
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,030
You've been listening to Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

879
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,510
Slowly and painfully.

880
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,330
Spiritual growth.

881
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,330
New world view.

882
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,290
Power leads man towards arrogance.

883
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,010
Power narrows the areas of man's concern.

884
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:34,770
Find out tonight.

885
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,490
Welcome to Plasma Protein.

886
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,470
To quantitate proteins.

887
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,530
A monthly breast exam.

888
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,530
One out of three and one in ten.

889
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,770
We are driven by a passion to discover and develop medical needs.

890
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,490
Medical needs.

891
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,370
We are dedicated.

892
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,770
We are driven by a passion to discover and develop serious illness and chronic symptoms.

893
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,550
Our approach to chronic symptoms.

894
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,090
Beautiful.

895
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,570
What everyone really wants is a word on the street.

896
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,790
All you have to do is scream.

897
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:56,610
Happy little rabbits.

898
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,310
First of all, disaster is on the way.

899
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:58,710
On the horizon.

900
00:44:58,890 --> 00:44:59,870
Welcome to disaster.

901
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:00,550
Bet.

902
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:00,830
Bet.

903
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:01,150
Bet.

904
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,550
Humanitarian rights offer a strange sense of security.

905
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,470
And we take it very seriously.

906
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,050
On hold.

907
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:07,430
On hold.

908
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:07,810
On hold.

909
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,190
On hold.

910
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:15,190
Here then is a review, a movie review of The Pick of Destiny.

911
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,110
Don't believe mealy mouth criticism from egghead reviewers in your local weekly friends.

912
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,710
Even the Onion reviewers were wrong on this one.

913
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,010
Believe me.

914
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,550
First, let there be no question.

915
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,270
Tenacious D rules.

916
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,990
They rule all other metal bands.

917
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,650
And it goes without saying that metal rules all other forms of music.

918
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:41,350
If you ever doubted that, The Pick of Destiny puts all such foolish doubts to rest.

919
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,910
I am sure of this.

920
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,550
Princess Wee and I have watched the new Tenacious D movie twice.

921
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:52,650
And we've listened to the score, which I ripped from the screener rip, hourly for days now.

922
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,550
So there can be no question.

923
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,930
No room for quarter.

924
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:56,770
No negotiation.

925
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,690
Not even Satan rocks as hard as The D.

926
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:05,190
In fact, in this movie, Satan actually loses a rock off to Tenacious D.

927
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,590
Although not exactly because of their music.

928
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,270
I'll grant that.

929
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:16,870
You should take it from me that Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny is the best rock and roll movie since rock and roll high school.

930
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,630
Making it therefore the greatest rock and roll movie possible.

931
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,330
It is basically a rock opera.

932
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,690
A greater rock opera.

933
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,450
Even than Ken Russell's version of Tommy.

934
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,630
Only it's supposed to be funny instead of being accidentally funny.

935
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:39,510
The music of The D is running through at least 50 minutes of the movie's duration.

936
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:46,050
The D's magnificent virtuoso guitar playing is augmented by magical drums and bass from nowhere.

937
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:53,370
And eventually even operatic chorales and layered on orchestral instrumentation worthy of the later Beatles albums.

938
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:59,390
Satan himself does a cameo near the end playing himself and playing some juicy riffs.

939
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:10,710
Of special interest to Subgeni is the Sasquatch is my daddy sequence in which JB inadvertently eats handfuls of magic mushrooms and meets Bigfoot in a vision.

940
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:18,370
He sings at length of how the Sasquatch is his true father and even turns into an infant yeti during the hallucination.

941
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,350
This segment incidentally features some of the most triacly magic dreams.

942
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,530
Like a drug head kingdom music ever committed to a film score.

943
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:33,850
In summary Tenacious D and this movie completely sum up metal and metal fans.

944
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:39,010
They represent the be all and end all of all hard rock heaviness.

945
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:53,330
And my greatest ambition in life I just now remembered is to produce the ultimate metal concert featuring the swinging love corpses, Tenacious D, Spinal Tap and headlining Frank Marino and Mahogany.

946
00:47:53,350 --> 00:48:02,850
Rush. So friends, there's our movie review. I actually watch movies that are considered to be

947
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:09,290
good as well. I watched Perfume and The Illusionist the same night as I watched that,

948
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:15,910
and they were actually good. And I know a bad movie when I see one. I saw Night at the Museum,

949
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:22,030
which is the penultimate in suckery, and it would suck even if Robin Williams wasn't there.

950
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:27,810
So friends, take my word for it. The D rules. And if you haven't seen Idiocracy,

951
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:34,310
that one, it is your duty to rent that one. And praise Bob.

952
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,930
Maybe that's all Bob is.

953
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,570
Bob.

954
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,470
Bob.

955
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:46,890
Bob.

956
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:47,670
Bob.

957
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,210
Bob.

958
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:48,710
Bob.

959
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:49,370
Bob.

960
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:49,810
Bob.

961
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,310
Bob.

962
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,350
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

963
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,070
Bob, Bob.

964
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,430
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

965
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,490
I know where he got you.

966
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,610
Why would you do that to me, Bob?

967
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,650
By Stang and Lemur and others.

968
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:21,550
And this background music we're listening to is by Transmission.

969
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,690
Or Stephen Kent from an album called Meanwhile.

970
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:35,690
Earlier, the On Hold collage was by the great Nor Elpref of norelpref.com.

971
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:41,970
You are currently listening to Hour of Slack number 1090 from the Church of the Subgenius.

972
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,610
For more information about that, you can check out subgenius.com.

973
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,010
Or just type subgenius into Google and see what happens.

974
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:58,970
You, like so many others before you, will learn that Bob is Lord.

975
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,950
His word is the sword.

976
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,010
And his radio shows are out of the ord.

977
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,330
This is craziness.

978
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:15,430
Everyone is a moon and has a dark side, which he never shows to anybody.

979
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,730
If he can help it.

980
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,070
My books are water.

981
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,190
Those are the great geniuses.

982
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,730
They're wine.

983
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,030
Everybody drinks water.

984
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,630
Let me see.

985
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:35,190
There are a number of things I need to tell you before I go.

986
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:44,530
Always obey your parents when they are present.

987
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,030
Be respectful of your superiors.

988
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:49,730
If.

989
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:50,650
You have any.

990
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,190
Rise early.

991
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,990
For it is the early bird that catches the worm.

992
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:59,030
I once knew a man who tried it.

993
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,070
Got up at sunrise.

994
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,590
Horse bit him.

995
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,790
It's time.

996
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,730
I'm still considering whether to go.

997
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,550
I have never seen an atom of truth that there is a future life.

998
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,750
Yet I am strongly inclined to expect one.

999
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,270
Anyway, don't be.

1000
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,950
Such a sissy in the face of a real adventure.

1001
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,570
And I'm not as big a fool as Don Phil if I can't swear I won't stay.

1002
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:46,710
Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits a baby is an inestimable blessing and bother.

1003
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:49,270
Always.

1004
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:54,390
Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.

1005
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,710
We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it.

1006
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:08,130
The cat that sits down on a hot stove lid will never sit down on a hot stove lid again, and that is well.

1007
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:12,270
But also, she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.

1008
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,530
Do something every day that you don't want to do.

1009
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:22,410
This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain.

1010
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:30,590
Columbus elaborated a deep plan to find a new route to an old country.

1011
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,330
Circumstance revised his plan for him, and he found a new world.

1012
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,190
And he gets the credit of it to this day.

1013
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,550
He hadn't anything to do with it.

1014
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,030
My kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to its institutions,

1015
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,330
or its office holders.

1016
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,810
The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing.

1017
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,310
It's the thing to watch for, care for, and be loyal to.

1018
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,310
Almost any man worth his salt would fight to defend his home.

1019
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:06,990
But no one has ever heard of a man going to war for his boarding house.

1020
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:16,810
Among the three or four million cradles now rocking in the land are some which this nation would preserve for ages,

1021
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:17,990
as sacred things.

1022
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,930
If only we could know which ones they are.

1023
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,310
There is no other life.

1024
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,750
Life itself is only a vision and a dream.

1025
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:34,510
For nothing exists but space and you.

1026
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:42,230
Friends, that's the last of my quotes from Mark Twain.

1027
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:46,790
Except for this last memorandum written on his deathbed.

1028
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:52,750
Death, the only immortal who treats us all alike,

1029
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:56,970
whose pity and whose peace and whose refuge are for all,

1030
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,650
the soiled and the pure, the rich and the poor,

1031
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:03,770
the loved and the unloved.

1032
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:07,330
And friends, we love you,

1033
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:12,250
because this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1034
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,470
And this has been a sort of a Mark Twain special.

1035
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:17,190
And I hope you enjoyed it.

1036
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:23,690
The clips that I've been running of somebody else doing Mark Twain quotes

1037
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:27,990
are from the wonderful 1980s claymation film,

1038
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,870
The Adventures of Mark Twain by Will Vinton.

1039
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,970
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1040
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:42,490
Oh, the music in the background is by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stan.

1041
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,370
To put it in crude modern terms,

1042
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,150
the earth wobbles as it spins on its axis,

1043
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:54,430
and thus the sky changes over the centuries and millennia.

1044
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,230
When's our pole magnetism thing going to happen?

1045
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,990
When are the poles switching?

1046
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,370
Day after tomorrow, but don't tell anybody.

1047
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:03,510
Oh, okay.

1048
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,810
At present, on the Bernal Equinox,

1049
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:11,270
when the sun costs the celestial equator from south to north

1050
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,610
around March 20th to 21st,

1051
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,790
the sun rises against the constellation of Pythagoras,

1052
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,350
Pisces, as it has done for about 2,000 years.

1053
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,810
And devours the dragon Shemash,

1054
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:25,010
which had plunged the earth in the age of deep darkness.

1055
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,870
This is a distant future within the next couple of centuries.

1056
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,950
No, it doesn't work.

1057
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,350
Almost there.

1058
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,570
The sun will rise against...

1059
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,610
Are you sure, Doctor?

1060
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,710
I can't keep up with it anymore.

1061
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,830
So we're at the foot end of the millennium?

1062
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,590
Well, let's just call it the footnote.

1063
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,210
That's what happens.

1064
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:46,390
That's what happens.

1065
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,590
That's what happens.

1066
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,790


1067
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,790


1068
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,790


1069
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,790


1070
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,790


1071
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,790


1072
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,270
Let's call it the foot gland.

1073
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,450
Now, I see you're opening up a big bag...

1074
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,010
Let's call it a football.

1075
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,150
A bag of Slaco chips over there.

1076
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:59,590
I wanted to ask you if you are trying to create a food riot here with that large...

1077
00:56:59,590 --> 00:56:59,990
Food?

1078
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,970
There's food?

1079
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,470
I can't see this since there's duct tape over my eyes.

1080
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,710
Don't be too ready to believe everything you hear already.

1081
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:12,270
You're all so weird.

1082
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,730
If it walks, I can...

1083
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:20,090
If it's all about you, then it's all about me.

1084
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:24,170
It's always about you.

1085
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,230
I gotta go see my friends.

1086
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,430
It's all about me.

1087
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,790
Sound like willfully disobedient boys.

1088
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,930
Boys are a bad lot and these boys are disobedient.

1089
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,370
And disobedient lads must be punished.

1090
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,350
Old Dr. Hal found us.

1091
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:41,650
Yes.

1092
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,110
Gentlemen, choose a switch.

1093
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,710
A spanking is a good thing.

1094
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,710


1095
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,710


1096
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,710


1097
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,710


1098
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,710


1099
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,170
spanking.

1100
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,250
It's like a spanking

1101
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,650
wrapped in a weapon

1102
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,490
inside of an enigma.

1103
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,250
And now,

1104
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,170
if you're ready for your enigma,

1105
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,190
bend over and throw the switch.

1106
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,730
You don't feel so cocky now, do you?

1107
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,650
Whatever he's paying you,

1108
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,190
I'll double it right now.

1109
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,350
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?

1110
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,210
We could have been friends.

1111
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,290
But you wouldn't go through proper channels.

1112
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,810
You went over my head.

1113
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,730
That hurt.

1114
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,470
But life goes on.

1115
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,390
It's an old story,

1116
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,350
the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?

1117
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,210
It helps if you think of it as a game, Bob.

1118
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,430
Every game has a winner.

1119
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,650
And a loser.

1120
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:59,670
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

1121
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,550
God.

1122
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,550
What's up with you, huh?

1123
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:20,550


1124
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,590
There's a TravelPod member

1125
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:25,590


1126
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,950
Hobbit probably didn't use Rob to guten journal

1127
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,950


1128
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,230
We realized the world is a movie

1129
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1130
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1131
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1132
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1133
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1134
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1135
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1136
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1137
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1138
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1139
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1140
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1141
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1142
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1143
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1144
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1145
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1146
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1147
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1148
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1149
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,230


1150
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:27,210
