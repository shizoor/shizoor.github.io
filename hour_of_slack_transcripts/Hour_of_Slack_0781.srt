Ah, yes, dear friends, it's the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, but this week

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm so tired, I'm so tired from moving into the new offices, it's going to be a rerun

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,200
of a beautiful Suzy the Floozy show from WREK in Atlanta.

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,300
So friends, you just sit back and enjoy this incredible barrage edit and some great music

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,760
on the subject dear to the heart of every subgenius, stupidity.

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,400
I don't know, but I've been told that Jerry Lewis never wears the same side play.

7
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,580
I don't know, but I've been told that Jerry Lewis never wears the same side play.

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,880
Ah, ha, ha, hey, yes, let's drop Reverend Suzy the Floozy.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,620
The most dependable subgenius for hour of Slack reruns.

10
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,620
No love, take a buzzer, big time.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,180
No love, take a buzzer, big time.

12
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,120
No love, take a buzzer, big time.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,520
No love, take a buzzer, big time.

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,640
I don't know, but I've been told that Rock Hudson's named Jimmy Hoffa.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,980
I don't know, but I've been told that.

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,260
Wrecking Ball, Wednesday with Jerry?

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,060
The First Blues, Saturday with Jerry Ho宝.

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:45,720


20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:45,720


21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:45,720


22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
He did star as the designer for a film called the öğrenco qui ne somse.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,320
Michael Dickson, as the proposṣio.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:50,720
He's absent because of his disability.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,460
Project cooking guy, Hugh burdens has good taste.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,840
He's in a five-year probationary depression.

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Welcome, seekers, to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse, the April Fool's Stupidity Spectacular.

28
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm Reverend Susie the Floozy, manning the switches here for an incredibly stupid evening.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,920
So watch out for those plummeting IQs, kids.

30
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,960
I'll see you next time.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,980
I'll see you next time.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
I'll be it for me to question your stupid civilization or its dumb customs.

33
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,000
But is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything?

34
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:29,820
I'll see you next time.

35
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll see you next time.

36
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
I'll see you next time.

37
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,920
I'll see you next time.

38
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:29,200
I'll see you next time.

39
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,540
I'll see you next time.

40
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
I'll see you next time.

41
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,460
I'll see you next time.

42
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:29,440
I'll see you next time.

43
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,020
I'll see you next time.

44
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,680
I'll see you next time.

45
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,920
accept the fact that you're probably stupid but don't feel bad about it friend almost everyone

46
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,380
else is too in fact the studies have shown that 95 percent of the population consistently behaves

47
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:54,080
in a manner that can be described as is stupid of the remaining five percent two percent are in

48
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,420
hiding two percent are incarcerated in mental institutions and the final one percent is

49
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:08,040
actively engaged in stealing everyone else blind oh i'm sorry the phrase is kbbl is gonna give me

50
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,180
something stupid let's try one more number

51
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,860

52
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,860

56
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,760


57
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
If he made right of me

58
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,280

59
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,180
no

60
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,360
more

61
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,740
Cost

62
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,060
It on

63
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,060


64
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,060


65
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,060


66
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,080
E

67
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:37,080
I told the teacher that I thought it was insanity for me to try to pretend,

68
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,420
one, that these people were living human beings in the first place,

69
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,600
and two, that the man who wrote them was anything but a demented idiot.

70
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,960
And I couldn't understand why in the world I should take my mind

71
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,240
and try to get my mind to follow the labyrinths of ridiculous reasoning

72
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,020
of non-existent minds of creatures of absolute fiction

73
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,360
made up in the mind of what I thought was an idiot.

74
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,340
Now, maybe Shakespeare was not an idiot.

75
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,520
My apology to anyone who really believed Shakespeare was a marvelous writer

76
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,400
and really a great, a great literate, and so on, which he may well have been.

77
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,360
I didn't really study him all that much.

78
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,820
Matter of fact, that was my only acquaintanceship with Hamlet.

79
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,340
And as you can probably well understand, I read very little of him.

80
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
I received a D in that court.

81
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,980
If your land looks very far

82
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,680
Sitting in your house afar

83
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,140
And your brains ain't up too far

84
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,840
And your ears stick out too far

85
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,960
I don't care how I look

86
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't care what you think about me

87
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,220
I don't care what you think about me

88
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,500
I don't care how you respond

89
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,140
I may look foolish or some folk

90
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,660
But I'm made up in my mind

91
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,660
You, she-man

92
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,180
Well, I've been to one world fair, a postage in a rodeo,

93
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,100
and that's the stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones.

94
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,860
I'm too stupid, I thought you'd call

95
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm too blind, but I saw you wave

96
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,060
I'm too sick, and I get sick shows

97
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm too gross, I should go home

98
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm too old, and I fight down the constantly

99
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:22,960
And do things the only way

100
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,340
Cause you make me so creepy

101
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,160
You make me so creepy

102
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,120
You make me so creepy

103
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,820
You make me so crazy

104
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,400
I see an ihmispicable cone of ignorance.

105
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,540
What turmoil filled my heart?

106
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,220
I'm sick and tired, I toarn, I am real

107
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,220


108
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,220


109
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
I saw myself so stupid and so ignorant.

110
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,660
I must seem like an animal to you, oh God.

111
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,880
You know, let me ask you this, and you may not even want to answer it.

112
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
I don't know. I didn't get much education myself.

113
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,400
Did you go to school? How far did you get in school?

114
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,900
Well, I went seven or eight years, but didn't get into sixth grade.

115
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,440
Oh, you went seven or eight years, didn't get into sixth grade?

116
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,100
Didn't learn too fast.

117
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,700
Oh, you didn't learn too fast?

118
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,220
Well, I wonder, was there any reason, I reckon?

119
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,680
He's a little slow.

120
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,400
Huh?

121
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,500
Huh?

122
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Something was said. Not good. What was it?

123
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,480
Don't yell at Homer.

124
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,100
No, that's okay.

125
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,080
What was it?

126
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,040
Slow.

127
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,220
They called you slow.

128
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,940
How dare you call me that?

129
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,120
Hey, Homer, you still here?

130
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
Oh, hey, you are slow.

131
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,980
Which one of these is the salt?

132
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,840
Too bad I'm an idiot, because my school closed.

133
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,620
Oh, well.

134
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,020
No, that's the red poison.

135
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,400
That was great.

136
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,380
You know, humor is a sign of innocence.

137
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,540
I wish I had those miracles smart pills.

138
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,700
I met a girl the other day in the most unusual way we were introduced.

139
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,560
Now, very unusual girl.

140
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,320
As a matter of fact, I might mention she was sort of stupid, too.

141
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,900
She thought a dry dock was a thirsty physician.

142
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,500
She fell in love with these two sailors down in San Diego.

143
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,360
She didn't know which one she loved, so she put out to sea.

144
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,940
Or took her voyage someplace.

145
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,740
And really, she doesn't appreciate it at all.

146
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Understands not a word that I say, really.

147
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:20,900
Really.

148
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,960
I think she may understand bone, if I say that in a conversation.

149
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,160
She understands the word sick.

150
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,120
But really, very limited.

151
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,840
This baby's wasted on an idiot like you.

152
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,220
She's a head.

153
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,020
Spun down at night.

154
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,100
Come on, get a plate.

155
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
Say, lost in space.

156
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,180
And she's a head.

157
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,540
Bars of interest.

158
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Cost precarious.

159
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,940
Get serious.

160
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,020
And she's a head.

161
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,480
Tend to contact.

162
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,180
Don't change the fact that rock is black.

163
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,820
And she's a head.

164
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,520
Why I'm in class with the length of those legs.

165
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,200
She's nothing intellectual, Jordan.

166
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,380
I'm a whole lot of idiots.

167
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,080
Don't you see?

168
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,760
So don't say a word.

169
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,220
Believe me.

170
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,880
My mother's a fool.

171
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:20,880


172
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,300
Music is pretty like gloves.

173
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,960
It's comfy.

174
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,800

175
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,960

You're mentally gone, mentally dead.

181
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,560
Let's go.

182
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,820
brochure. Here, buy the order now. The body will follow soon. The mind is already in the grave.

183
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,560
It's like the definition of an idiot. That's the guy who rips a girl's brow off and invites her on

184
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:26,320
the ear. Hey, moron, you got your clothes on backwards. Oh, God, this is fun. Hi, stupid. Hi, ugly.

185
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,260
Hey, I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but this is kind of stupid.

186
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,760
Oh, daytime TV is muy estupido. Come on, Homer, act all stupid like you do on TV. Yeah, come on,

187
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,380
dumb, dumb, do something unintelligent there. Now let's get stupid with our first contestant,

188
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,800
the human garbage disposal. Unbelievable. We're rewarding people for acting like buffoons.

189
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,860
Get him some slack. We are a town of no brows, no brows, and ignoramai. We have eight malls,

190
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,360
but no symphony. Thirty-two bars, but no alternative theater. Thirteen stores that

191
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,540
became a city of the dead. We have a town of no bars, but no alternative theater. Thirteen stores

192
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,540


193
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,560
that became a city of the dead. I begin with le sex. I write this letter not to nag or whine,

194
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,200
but to prod. Nice stupid and whining. Where do we live in a town where the smartest have no power

195
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,520
and the stupidest run everything? Maybe we should just move back to Alabama. No, we should fix

196
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,180
things here. If we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish.

197
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,440
Nice.

198
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,320
Thank you.

199
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,420
Thank you.

200
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,740
Thank you.

201
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,880
Thank you.

202
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,420
Thank you.

203
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,540
Thank you.

204
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,400
Thank you.

205
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,040
Thank you.

206
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,180
Thank you.

207
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Thank you.

208
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,800
Thank you.

209
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,040
Thank you.

210
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,440
Thank you.

211
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,120
Thank you.

212
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,060
Thank you.

213
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,900
Thank you.

214
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,500
Thank you.

215
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,500


216
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,100
Thank you.

217
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:39,920


218
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,360
Thank you.

219
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,380
Thank you.

220
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,380


221
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,320
Thank you.

222
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,220
The only people I knew as the people I had formally worked with and provisions.

223
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,440
Think.

224
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,520
And they're all not too bright.

225
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,080
Come on.

226
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,680
I can say I love them all.

227
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,180
I think they're great people.

228
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,040
They're just a little slow in some areas.

229
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,280
And I can honestly say that because we showed them all the business and none of them got in.

230
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,100
I can say I love them all.

231
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,820
with angry calls and letter bombs.

232
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,300
And it's all your fault.

233
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,460
Yes, it is, ma'am.

234
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,960
This is the DJ-3000.

235
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,400
It plays CDs automatically, and it has three distinct varieties of inane chatter.

236
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,220
Hey, hey, how about that weather out there?

237
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,420
Whoa, that was the caller from hell.

238
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,620
Well, hot dog, we have a wiener.

239
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,040
Man, that thing's great.

240
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,480
Don't praise the machine.

241
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,600
Come on, you idiot.

242
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,860
Let's take it back.

243
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,440
This is tough.

244
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,060
Yeah, let's make litter out of these litter-otties.

245
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
That's too clever, you one-eyed-ass.

246
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,560
What do you think of the children?

247
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,560
Are these morons getting dumber or just louder?

248
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,800
Dumber, sir.

249
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,280
Hey, you're so dumb.

250
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,740
You're stupid as can be.

251
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,920
You are only more than you mean nothing to me.

252
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,160
Hey, for your mother, who's not avoiding you.

253
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,280
Hey, it's just boring, and I don't like you.

254
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
Hey, yeah.

255
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,740
You're so dumb.

256
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,380
Hey, you're so dumb.

257
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,240
You're so dumb.

258
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,300
Hey, it's for your dad, because he don't know you.

259
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,600
Hey, it's for your ugly suicide, I want it, hey.

260
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Hey, it's for your mouth, because it never stops.

261
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Hey, it's for your brain, you're as dumb as a rock.

262
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,840
Hey, hey's-a-sort-of-a-money.

263
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:22,840


264
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,440
KUFB, you're so dumb.

265
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,000
KUFB, you're so dumb.

266
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:05,240
KUFB, you're so dumb.

267
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,600
There's some other way that's really not a valid part of the economy.

268
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,940
It's not my nature to complain, but so far today, we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of magazine time.

269
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,380
I just don't feel challenged.

270
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining,

271
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,300
furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation.

272
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:36,900
It peeks out of the cracks of its cave, brow furrowed in mock consideration of the pulverized remains of a rat.

273
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,040
It's memory, peering out into the lumbering forest of gods.

274
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,000
Its lips twitch prayers past the racket of evolution, just a cat gorging on garbage.

275
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,980
Its eyes glaze and fade away from simian mandates to a clear and concise expose upon the subjects at hand,

276
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,520
being those which have dogged the inquisitive mind from the occasion of its inception.

277
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,280
And it may appear that way to you, but you're an idiot.

278
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,800
You don't know what you're talking about.

279
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,980
I'm 16, and I'm going to live for 16,000 more years.

280
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,660
Now those who have stupid children are safe enough.

281
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,720
Those children will laugh at evolution and be happy fools all the days of their lives.

282
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,140
But to those who have bright, intelligent children, the day will come when those children will come home and say,

283
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,600
You can get some people's attention with a two-by-four, whop, you know, and you've got his attention.

284
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,700
Other people just make him mad, and you won't get his attention.

285
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,160
You can knock him completely out, and just make him madder and madder and madder.

286
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,980
You could bring him back to consciousness, knock him out again, and you never will.

287
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,020
You'll get him to like getting hit with that two-by-four and to listen to what you're going to say.

288
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,020
Nobody home.

289
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,420
Nobody home.

290
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,000
Nobody home.

291
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,320
Nobody home.

292
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,480
I don't do what I want to do.

293
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,800
No, I don't, I don't gotta do.

294
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,340
I don't do what I want to do.

295
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,660
What I do, I don't wanna do.

296
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,820
Baby, baby, I'm a drug.

297
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,300
My mind is blown.

298
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,420
I'm all alone.

299
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,840
So give me a call.

300
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,480
I'll telephone.

301
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,980
I'll be there if I don't need you.

302
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,020
Nobody home.

303
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,420
Nobody home.

304
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,900
Nobody home.

305
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,060
Nobody home.

306
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,360
Yeah.

307
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,200
Yeah.

308
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:32,940
Yeah.

309
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,020
Yeah.

310
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,280
Yeah.

311
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,500
Yeah.

312
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,440
Yeah.

313
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,880
Yeah.

314
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,380
Yeah.

315
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:36,660


316
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:36,780
Yeah.

317
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,980
I don't want to know.

318
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,780
Nobody knows.

319
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,120
Nobody knows.

320
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,840
Nobody knows.

321
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,300
Nobody knows.

322
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,040
Nobody knows.

323
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,880
The students who show more aptitude end up as bigger cogs.

324
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,800
But damn few of them show any sort of creative cognition.

325
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,340
Those who do have, have developed this on their own.

326
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,720
Sometimes by accident and sometimes through sheer defiance of a system

327
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,460
that promotes unthinking passive conformity.

328
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Well, good for them.

329
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,200
Unfortunately, many more never even conceive of such a notion

330
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,520
and the educational system can't be held entirely responsible.

331
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,980
It only holds its victims for a limited time before they're released to produce and consume.

332
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,700
From that point on, the mass media entirely takes over the job of intelligence suppression.

333
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,700
Or rather, it's injection into the...

334
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:06,880
...this rock.

335
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,040
But sleep bears down with the pressure of the oceans

336
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,440
and these fragile epiphanies evaporate outside of their natural environment.

337
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,740
But what are you going to do?

338
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,580
It's my own fault.

339
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,940
There's an abundance of data on the subject.

340
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,320
But to be honest, for a change, I thought I could just muscle through it as I do most situations.

341
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,480
I underestimated the effect of my prolonged self-imposed isolation up there.

342
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Nothing could be absolutely more stupid...

343
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,920
...or obtuse...

344
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,960
...or ridiculous if you look at the statistics of anti-gun laws in New York City and Washington, D.C.,

345
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,100
where crime has continued to rise.

346
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,200
The mayor of a candid town

347
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,560
Fly on green balloons

348
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,540
Falling up, never come back down

349
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,960
Red and yellow boots

350
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Purple shoes

351
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,320
Hey, Murph!

352
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,100
You're not talking right

353
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,380
Stop!

354
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,220
Talking dumb again

355
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,740
Murph!

356
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,500
You're not thinking right

357
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:03,800
Stop!

358
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,560
Thinking dumb again

359
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,040
Murph!

360
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,620
Blowing your mind again

361
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,640
Be a winner

362
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,700
Not a loser

363
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,340
Take a minute or two

364
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,400
Sort it out

365
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,540
Sort it out

366
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,440
Prior to life, you just can't take it

367
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,800
Now who's not to cry?

368
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,800
Life can be anything you make it

369
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,260
Why not make it fly?

370
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,540
Real life is out of sight

371
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,500
Out of sight

372
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,900
You guys telling me I'm talking dumb?

373
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,500
You're talking dumb.

374
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,500
Sort it out?

375
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,340
I got it sorted out.

376
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,300
Make it right?

377
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,780
Who's right?

378
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,640
Real life's out of sight.

379
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,740
Everything's out of sight.

380
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,600
His name?

381
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,800
Albert Einstein.

382
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,020
The gentleman is a dope

383
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,840
A man of many faults

384
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,720
A clumsy Joe

385
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,560
Who wouldn't know

386
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,000
A rumba from a waltz

387
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,540
The gentleman is a dope

388
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,400
And not my cup of tea

389
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
Why?

390
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,540
You're getting a divvy

391
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,060
He doesn't belong to me

392
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,940
The gentleman isn't bright

393
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,900
He doesn't know the score

394
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,760
A cake will come

395
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,920
He'll take a crumb

396
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,660
And never, never ask for more

397
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,060
The gentleman's eyes are blue

398
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,680
He doesn't know the score

399
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,580
But little do they see

400
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,380
Why am I beating my brains out?

401
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,380
He doesn't belong to me

402
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,760
You don't see any Homer is a dope t-shirts, do you?

403
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,780
We sold those out in five minutes.

404
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,400
Dope!

405
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,020
Arch, how could you?

406
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,400
T-shirts are 100% common.

407
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240
And look at the fine stitching on dope.

408
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,060
And look at the fine stitching on dope.

409
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,660
The gentleman is a dope

410
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,340
The gentleman is a dope

411
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,520
Stupid?

412
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,620
Well, I can assure you it happened organically.

413
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,440
Can't win it, everybody.

414
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,420
He's about to do something stupid.

415
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,640
I know I stand in line

416
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,300
Until you think you have the time

417
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,900
To spend an evening with me

418
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,400
To spend an evening with me

419
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,880
And if we go someplace to dance

420
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,120
I know that there's a chance

421
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,660
You won't be leaving with me

422
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,920
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place

423
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,480
And have a drink or two

424
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,400
And then I go to spoil it all

425
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
By saying something stupid like

426
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,140
Me, me, nah, nah, nah, no, no, no

427
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,300
Have a week, have a week

428
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,240
Have a week, have a week

429
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,880
Have a week, have a week

430
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:36,080
Have a week, have a week

431
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,200
Have a week, have a week

432
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,360
I don't wanna be a freak

433
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,280
No more

434
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,920
I just made a guess that I could go far

435
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,600
I don't wanna be a freak

436
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,500
No more

437
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,380
I just made a guess that I could go far

438
00:37:53,360 --> 00:38:06,220
I don't wanna be a freak

439
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
No more

440
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,580
I just made a guess that I could go far

441
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:30,600
I don't wanna be a freak

442
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,340
No more

443
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,100
I just made a guess that I could go far

444
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,680
I don't wanna be a freak

445
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,220
No more

446
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,360
I just made a guess that I could go far

447
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:06,220
I don't wanna be a freak

448
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,180
No more

449
00:39:36,220 --> 00:40:05,260
I just made a guess that I could go far

450
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:34,440
I don't wanna be a freak

451
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:49,900
No more

452
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,600
I don't wanna be a freak

453
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:08,600


454
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,700
What kind of fool am I?

455
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,560
No more

456
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:14,620
What kind of fool am I?

457
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,920
What kind of fool do you think I am?

458
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,320
What kind of fool do you think I am?

459
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,460
What do you gotta go see?

460
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:30,200
What kind of fool do you think I am?

461
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,520
Do you think I am a Jew?

462
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,860
Do you think I am a God?

463
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,240
Do you think I am two?

464
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,520
What kind of fool am I?

465
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:46,220
What kind of fool am I?

466
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:35,140
What kind of fool am I?

467
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,900
What kind of fool am I?

468
00:42:41,360 --> 00:43:05,200
What kind of fool am I?

469
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:35,220
What kind of fool am I?

470
00:43:51,680 --> 00:44:01,400
What kind of fool am I?

471
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,320
What kind of fool am I?

472
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:07,600
I am

473
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,740
What kind of clown am I?

474
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,420
What do I know of life?

475
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,720
Why can't I cast away

476
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,780
This mask of play

477
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,080
And live my life?

478
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,160
Why can't I?

479
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,180
Fall in love

480
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,540
Till I don't give a damn

481
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,240
And maybe then I'll know

482
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,620
What kind of fool I am

483
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,960
And maybe then I will

484
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,940
They're

485
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,800
They're

486
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,000
fun

487
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,180
theически

488
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,160
What kind of fool am I?

489
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,160


490
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,220
Smartest person in the world

491
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,300
I know.

492
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,000
I was worried that they don't fit in.

493
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,120
When everyone's running this way, they're always running that way.

494
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,780
The smartest person I know was worried about their career.

495
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,500
Their work was once important, now it's empty and redundant.

496
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,620
I wonder if I'm up on something about a fifth wheel.

497
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,880
I told the smartest person I know, big wheels turn real slow.

498
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,060
When you finally get a bone to throw, there's no dog around to catch it.

499
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,140
The trouble with you is your life.

500
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,760
You're awkward because you're normal.

501
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,580
You're worthlessly overqualified and hopelessly hopeful.

502
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,260
The trouble with you is your life.

503
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,580
You're the smartest person I know.

504
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,600
That's why you feel like a fifth wheel.

505
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,240
The trouble with you is your life.

506
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,760
Isn't that most inspiring?

507
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,280
Really such a comfort.

508
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,500
Useful and encouraging.

509
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,860
The trouble with you is your life.

510
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,500
And the smartest person you know also probably feels like a fifth wheel.

511
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,120
Your mind is a tree to wander on.

512
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,860
You can be thinking around you.

513
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,640
But your body works without the theory of what you're ever trying.

514
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It knows what to be.

515
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,380
There's no guidance.

516
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,000
Sometimes, you're right.

517
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,580
But things you do not know are a deceitful version.

518
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,380
You're a process of self-explanatory steps.

519
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,040
The way you do this is what you do to yourself.

520
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,020
You're the smartest person I know.

521
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,840
I feel the smartest person I know.

522
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,500
Big wheels turn real slow.

523
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,560
When you finally get a phone to throw, there's no dog around to catch it.

524
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,780
The trouble with you is your life.

525
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,180
You got value, so you're immoral.

526
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,280
You struggle because you work too hard.

527
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,960
Not cool because you're too real.

528
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,520
The trouble with you is your life.

529
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,460
Like this other person I know who says,

530
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,500
I'm the smartest person they know.

531
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,020
And be glad that I know.

532
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,020


533
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,020


534
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,320
I feel like a fifth wheel.

535
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:22,180
I mean, I know they're there to stop stupid people running into the street and killing themselves.

536
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,380
But we're not all stupid.

537
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,300
We don't all need nursemaiding.

538
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,000
I mean, why not just have a stupid...

539
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,980
Stupidity tax!

540
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,300
Just tax the stupid people!

541
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,460
Die!

542
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,060
Why didn't someone tell me?

543
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,820
Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself.

544
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,480
I'm so slack.

545
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,940
I'll never ever do another stupid thing.

546
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,700
Good night.

547
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,680
Did you die?

548
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,380
No.

549
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,640
guys, please stop sleeping.

550
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,620
You, just lay there and read your books,

551
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:18,620


552
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:18,620


553
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:18,660
Oh, hey, guys, I know everyone is there forever and working out.

554
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:18,800
Police officers were the ones about to ép the ب stocklines.

555
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,660
They cubed the habits of some toi anti- Bie hour.

556
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:19,980
It's like, no longer care English navigation policy.

557
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,000
You pinch me?

558
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,000


559
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,020
You let me go?

560
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,020


561
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,640
I'm enjoyable.

562
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,640


563
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,640


564
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,640


565
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,640


566
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,120
You never, well, always be in the right spot.

567
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,200
The bigger they come, the harder I fall

568
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,580
They look till we're done and they're out in the hall

569
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,660
I like them big and stupid

570
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,760
I like them big and real dumb

571
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,480
I like them big and stupid

572
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,040
When I need something to help me unwind

573
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,640
I find a six-foot baby with a one-track mind

574
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,900
Smart guys are nowhere, they make demands

575
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,560
Give me your moron, talented hands

576
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,060
I go bar hopping and they say last call

577
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,740
I start shopping for a Neanderthal

578
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,500
The bigger they come

579
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,180
The harder I fall

580
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,540
They look till we're done and they're out in the hall

581
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,600
I like them big and stupid

582
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,740
I like them big and real dumb

583
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,620
I like them big and stupid

584
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,980
What kind of guy does a lot for me?

585
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,500
Superman without the bottom knee

586
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,340
My father's at a harbor, my brother's at a Yale

587
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,880
Well, the guy I took home last night just got out of jail

588
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,440
The way he grabbed and threw me through it really got me hot

589
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,960
But the way he growled and bit me, I hope he had a shot

590
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,500
The bigger they are, the harder they'll work

591
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,820
I got a soft spot for a good-looking jerk

592
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,920
I like them big and stupid

593
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,020
I like them big and real dumb

594
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,980
I like them big and stupid

595
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,480
I like them big and stupid

596
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,760
I like them big and stupid

597
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,380
The bigger they come, the harder I fall in love

598
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,020
Till we're done and they're out in the hall

599
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,040
I like them big and stupid

600
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,200
I like them big and real dumb

601
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,140
I like them big and stupid

602
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,260
I like them big and real dumb

603
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,200
I like them big and stupid

604
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:54,000
I like them big and stupid

605
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,360
America!

606
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,800
Who drives a truck?

607
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,000
He can't tell time, but he sure can drive

608
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,620
I asked his name and he had to think

609
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,120
Could I have found him the same way?

610
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,300
He's so stupid, you know what he said?

611
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,160
Well, I forgot what he said, he's so stupid

612
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,600
The bigger they come, the harder I fall in love

613
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,260
Till we're done and they're out in the hall

614
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,360
I like them big and stupid

615
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,400
I like them big and real dumb

616
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,320
I like them big and stupid

617
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,420
I like them big and real dumb

618
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,980
I like them big and...

619
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,160
Oh, Seagull!

620
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,120
Ah, slap me!

621
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,020
Get me breathing again!

622
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,480
Oh, I think we made it to the end!

623
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,400
Yes, it's the end of the April Fool's stupidity episode

624
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,340
of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

625
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,800
and it was my pleasure to serve up the following dishes

626
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,880
We heard Little Grunt Pat starting out with Bozo Big Time

627
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:25,040
and the Uh-Oh song by I think it was Robert Earl Orle

628
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,340
who was the first to sing the song about the world

629
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,500
Oh, what a name. How could I forget it?

630
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,760
Marty Feldman Eyes by Bruce Babyman Baum.

631
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,440
Woody Woodbury popped in with a little lounge act shtick there.

632
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,980
Alan Sherman.

633
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,680
Oh, that nee-nee-noo-noo-na-na thing was by Dickie Do and the Don'ts.

634
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,520
Oh, I swear to Bob I didn't make that up.

635
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,700
And then You Make Me Feel Creepy was by Tom Owen.

636
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:59,500
Oh, yeah, the same label that puts out Little Grunt Pack puts out Tom Owen's serious records in Baltimore.

637
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,720
I'm quite enchanted with them.

638
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,360
Oh, and then we heard Little Thomas Dolby with Airhead.

639
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,620
Had to put it in.

640
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,380
Diva with Social Fools from the Troublemakers comp.

641
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,680
And the Jackie Papers with Everything I Know Is Wrong.

642
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,860
Mickey and Sylvia hopped in there.

643
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,660
D-U-N.

644
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,160
M-B.

645
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,320
That was a different version of the song by the Nobodies.

646
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,460
By the Nobodies.

647
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,040
Speeding this one up a bit.

648
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,060
A little Orson Scott card with a secular humanist revival.

649
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,680
Nobody Home was by Scratch Bongo Wax.

650
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,960
Oh, and I know one of my seekers is having seizures

651
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,240
because I played a little bit from the folk rock musical about Jesus.

652
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,400
Natural High.

653
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,120
Ooh.

654
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,400
Man, that can cause flashbacks.

655
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:56,700
Oh, and there was even a little bit of Edie Gourmet in there somewhere.

656
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,140
And some Stang and a little Doc P. Ellis popped in.

657
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,060
And then I had to do things with Frank Sinatra.

658
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,500
That's okay.

659
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,760
I cleaned up after him with the Ramones.

660
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,440
Oh, and then there was Robert Goulet and Steve Lawrence.

661
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,460
Both of them in the same show.

662
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:21,300
Fool Mule was by Dossie Thunderbird Terry and his orchestra.

663
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,600
Oh, Reverend Such and Such had all the fool stuff.

664
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,080
I can't remember his name.

665
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,940
Damn it, they used so much of him.

666
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,560
Oh, Ron Ball had the Art of Being Stupid stuff.

667
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh, a lot of Garner Ted Armstrong's raving.

668
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,900
Three Amway tapes.

669
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,360
Oh, little Pastor Arnold Murray.

670
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,880
The Waitresses were the smartest person I know.

671
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,780
And I had to cut in.

672
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:57,840
And Dr. Notov, Denmark, talking about attaining that spiritual balance through washing dishes.

673
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:03,100
He is the slackest, smartest guy I can think of offhand.

674
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,020
Oh, and Julie Brown.

675
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,460
I like him big and stupid.

676
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:17,520
Oh, and yes, I guess I'll follow it up with Zilch Fletcher doing catatonic stupid.

677
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,120
Oh, but let's go through the background.

678
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,440
Let's see.

679
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,120
We're listening to Ken Thorne and his orchestra right now.

680
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,860
We've heard the Hollywood Strings.

681
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,920
Richard Marino and his orchestra.

682
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,720
Paul Moriarty and his orchestra.

683
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,380
The Hollywood Strings.

684
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,840
Holly Ridge Strings again.

685
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,980
And then Arthur Greenslade and his orchestra.

686
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,600
And Andre Costellan.

687
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,300
It's Robert Maxwell, his harp and orchestra.

688
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,780
And Roger Williams and his damn piano.

689
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,740
And Floyd Kramer with his damn piano.

690
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,320
And Robert Maxwell.

691
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:49,680
Yeah.

692
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,040
Yeah.

693
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,180
Yeah.

694
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:50,380
Yeah.

695
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,460
Yeah.

696
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:50,620
Yeah.

697
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:50,660


698
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:50,760
Yeah.

699
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,760


700
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,760


701
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,760


702
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,760


703
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,760


704
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:50,920
Yeah.

705
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,740
and the harp and then the ventures and the living strings and Norman Percival and his

706
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,280
orchestra.

707
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,440
Arthur Fiedler's super star with manama.

708
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,900
Claude Don John and the Moog synthesizer.

709
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,440
Percy's faith strings.

710
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,980
A little of the sleepwalk guitars of Dan and Dale.

711
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,000
I'll be bringing them up in a moment.

712
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,760
Oh, Susie, you have brought us everything.

713
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:20,760


714
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,740
all up. But you won't be bringing them up

715
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,360
because now it's time to end the

716
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,080
Hour of Slack. Dear friends,

717
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,080
thanks especially to

718
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,000
Reverend Susie the Floozy

719
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,400
whose stupidity show

720
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,320
we've been playing as a rerun

721
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,500
on this Hour

722
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,980
of Slack because
