Giant.

26
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,640
Perfect.

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,400
Cool.

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,900
Special.

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,460
Cheered.

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,140
Elaborate.

31
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,420
Easy.

32
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,900
Ultimate.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,340
Best.

34
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,820
Natural.

35
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,280

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,740
Special.

37
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,400
Nice.

38
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,340
Quicker.

39
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And much more.

40
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,500
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

41
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,220
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

42
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,880
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
that actually it's not.

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,360
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,720
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,100
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

47
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Selling.

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

50
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

51
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,380
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
It's cool, man.

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Cool.

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,840
And praise Bob and the whole world.

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,480
Oh.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


59
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:57,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas.

60
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:18,000
Borg participated in a meeting with Billy Gee and Sepdin Juhlman who had died from gastric

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000


62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,300
They said he couldn't match up to a kid like me when Berger was 18.

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,500
He watery profiles out to me, selfish Brookshot Allen and his brother Freddy Skinner.

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,360
He's a Aberdeen insider.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,260
Did you know him?

66
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,180
He was one of our favorites.

67
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,100
He was a mÃ¼sste Shawn Kardel.

68
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,780
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

69
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,240
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

76
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop

77
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,140
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,920
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Too tight, too tight

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,900
Too tight, too tight

82
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,600
And I'm gonna say to you

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits

88
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,460
And in the right

89
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,300
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

92
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
Till I get to bed

93
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

94
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Apple mango pie

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
You ain't no good of a child

97
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you do something about that, boy?

99
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
No!

102
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,220


103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
No!

104
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,560


105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
No!

106
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


107
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


108
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


109
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


110
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


111
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


112
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


113
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


114
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


115
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


116
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


117
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,600
No!

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,600


119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,940
No!

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,340
No!

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,500
No!

122
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,820
No!

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,440
I've got it all now

124
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,000
Gotta fix it

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,940
I knew the oldie would figure it out

126
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,680
You're Ð½ÐµÐ³Ð¾

127
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


128
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


130
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:20,680


131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,520
The 19th century

132
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,680
What!

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,680


134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,260
Ah- gonna do this

135
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,260


136
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,280
Yeah, without these

137
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,480
We tried

138
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480


139
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480


140
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480


141
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,840
He's like a cowboy Santa.

143
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,440
How jolly.

144
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit though?

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,340
I need the show bath.

147
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

148
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,860
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,940
That's enough of that.

150
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

151
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,360
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

152
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

153
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,580
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

156
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

157
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

158
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

159
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,120
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied...

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,120


161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm shocked by the...

162
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

163
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,560
I like to take the red one and the blue one at the same time.

164
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

165
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,820
The warp mix is easy.

166
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Angels we have heard on high

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Singing about mountains high

169
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,520
And those mountains in reply

170
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,480
Saying we wish we had some too

171
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

172
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,900
Wario in excelsis Deo

173
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

174
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Wario in excelsis Deo

175
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,660
Barbie Dolls

176
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie

177
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,460
Barbie Dolls

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,180
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

179
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
It will empower the students.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:56,860
Yes, sir.

181
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:05,640
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

182
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,240
It will be called Bobber for Kids.

183
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,740
But how?

184
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:22,760
How will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

185
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
Good has a lot of muscle.

186
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,580
Good.

187
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,380
Good!

188
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,400
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:42,840
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires,

190
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,420
latent,

191
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:54,680
and children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called Farmer-Columbia-Split Church.

192
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,980
Batteries not included.

193
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,440
She's new from Kenner.

194
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

195
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
We must buy our toys!

196
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

197
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,160
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme recorded there at Dockstock.

198
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,040
In 1984, Amin Palmer Veedees.

199
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,520
Angels We Have Heard on High.

200
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,740
It was by the Philistines.

201
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:32,200
The collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album,

202
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,640
which you can get for free.

203
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,560
Get this.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,700
Check out this website.

205
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Obtuse.iuma.com

206
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,560
That's Obtuse.

207
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,500
Excuse me.

208
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,380
My yes and next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

209
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,420
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

210
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,940
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

211
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,120
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

212
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,780
And he wanted his two front teeth.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,720
And he got McDonald's.

214
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,820
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

215
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,300
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

216
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,820
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

217
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,720
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

218
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,340
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't.

220
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,580
He wanted 10s and 20s.

221
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,140
10s and 20s.

222
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,440
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

223
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,720
And he wanted his three wise guys.

224
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:44,720


225
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,300
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

226
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,880
And that's the real story of Christmas.

227
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,420
The Real Story of Christmas

228
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,100
Take the halls and vines of holly

229
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,040
It's yet a season to be jolly

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,820
Don't we know how to get a barrel

231
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,100
Don't we know how to get a barrel

232
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,460
Only in Chimney, I care

233
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,720
La la la la la la la la la

234
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,300
La la la la la la la la la

235
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,480
So separate, so separate, so separate

236
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,200
You from Tunga

237
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob

238
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal

239
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
Shut up, pink boy!

240
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,060
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy

241
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,100
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien fool

242
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,480
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, all I got is a fighting Jesus and other action figures sold separately

243
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,320
Some assembly required, batteries not included, this toy falls apart in three days

244
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,980
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe

245
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,400
Too much is always better than not enough

246
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,640
So Bob Dobbs and I can douse so separately

247
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,540
Gorgeous secrets can blow from head to toe

248
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,760
Like Connie

249
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,280
Can douse so separately

250
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,180
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message

251
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,940
Santa Claus

252
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,020
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas

253
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,180
He wanted an electric train

254
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,320
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up

255
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,540
He had a picture of the whole thing, and he would dream so far that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes

256
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,920
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe

257
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,740
God!

258
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


259
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


260
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


261
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,740


262
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,360
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and great cars

263
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,840
hacks, gets through the walls

264
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
In the station and the gateways

265
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
Federides, basement

266
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
The mortar tower and all kinds of nice equipment and accessories

267
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,300
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist

268
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,240
Rotom Heart

269
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
Every day in the-

270
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
Let raven

271
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:41,800


272
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:41,800


273
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:41,800


274
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:41,900
The code have of spades

275
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:41,900


276
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

277
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,680
It is turnover.

278
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

279
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

280
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,580
Oh, yeah.

281
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,380
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

282
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,220
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

283
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

284
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

285
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:26,560
But the present subgenie tried to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

286
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh, yes.

287
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,580
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

288
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

289
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,240
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season.

290
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,200
It wasn't.

291
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,680
It wasn't something else.

292
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,440
But I think they started a war over it.

293
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,780
Yeah.

294
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

295
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,900
There you go.

296
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,120
A two-woman car.

297
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,680
All that noise and go.

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,460
When you touch the heart.

299
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,140
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

300
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,840
There you go.

301
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,580
A two-woman car.

302
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,060
You're a sinner's car.

303
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,700
All that noise and go.

304
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,740
Oh, oh, oh.

305
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,120
All that noise and go.

306
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,080
Oh, oh, oh.

307
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,960
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

308
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,920
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

309
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,780
Oh, oh, oh.

310
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,640
But it was fun.

311
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,640


312
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,640


313
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,080
It was fun.

314
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,620
Oh, oh, oh.

315
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:29,960
Oh, oh, oh.

316
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,500
Oh, oh, oh.

317
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,860
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

318
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

319
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,140
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

320
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

321
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,340
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

322
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

323
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,200
My hub is coming back.

324
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,200


325
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,020
Friends, try to imagine

326
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,440
somewhere in the snowy north

327
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,400
the Santibob trudging mindlessly

328
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,480
through the Himalayan snows

329
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,940
driven by strange forces

330
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,920
to complete his nameless errand

331
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,660
and he may show up at your house, my friend,

332
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,920
if you've been a bad subgenius

333
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,760
or a halfway subgenius

334
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
or if we keep getting tangled up

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
in these other shows

336
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,480
and having strange microphones.

337
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,620
How did that paternity suit ever turn out

338
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,220
between Dobbs and Santa?

339
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,360
And who?

340
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,460
His dad.

341
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,540
Santa dog.

342
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know.

343
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,120
I don't think it was...

344
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,160
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,

345
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,500
St. Nicholas,

346
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,500


347
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,900
St. Nicholas,

348
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,740
punched another bishop in the nose

349
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,280
and bloodied his nose.

350
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,120
Really?

351
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,580
The historical St. Nicholas?

352
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,640
Over the trinity of God.

353
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,620
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

354
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,740
Who the hell is God?

355
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,400
Who the hell is God?

356
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,100
Ask Dobbs one day.

357
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,900
That's the question.

358
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,900
That's the question we should be asking.

359
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,040
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere

360
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,700
on that bright, sunny day.

361
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,660
Bob did a backflip

362
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,080
and from that day on,

363
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,460
he too was a believer.

364
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,080
And from the snowdrift truck,

365
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,600
a little child bearing flowers emerged.

366
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,080
And Chip, Chip, what else is on the table?

367
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,040
Each one a dirty flower.

368
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,940
It's the St. Nicholas.

369
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,360
Sip, sicken.

370
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,860
The historical Santa Claus

371
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,680
is originally lived,

372
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,640
as the caller knows,

373
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,580
as a bishop in...

374
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,280
Was it Constantinople?

375
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,100
Yeah, like one of those...

376
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,500
It was an ancient Byzantium.

377
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,640
Yeah, Asia Minor in general.

378
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,420
Yes, he was...

379
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,720
And he was known for

380
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,720
sneaking into the rooms of young women

381
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,680
and leaving gifts.

382
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,480
Light-sized lumps of coal

383
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,820
complete with a fake beard

384
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,980
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

385
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,900
A saint he was,

386
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,440
the girl said.

387
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,140
He was the one who protected the CIA.

388
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,240
That's good.

389
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,720
You got it, brother.

390
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,920
He snuck into people's houses

391
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,700
through the chimney.

392
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
You got it, brother.

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,320
He knew when they were sleeping.

394
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,260
He knew when they were awake.

395
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,020
You got it, brother.

396
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,060
But like the CIA,

397
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,000
he was protecting them.

398
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,500
He knew that St. Nick

399
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,680
was a creeping, stinking spy.

400
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,180
What?

401
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,720
He knows when you've been sleeping.

402
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,280
He knows what you've been eating.

403
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,100
Hey, man, my kids still believe

404
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,160
in St. Nicholas.

405
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,220
And who keeps that belief alive

406
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,180
in their fevered, sick little brain?

407
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,300
Madison Avenue, of course.

408
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,560
No, the surveillance community

409
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,960
under your direction.

410
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,860
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

411
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
Miller Bear.

412
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,580
If you're bad, he punishes you.

413
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,340
If you're good, he rewards you.

414
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,900
He's probably the closest thing

415
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,860
to Jesus walking the earth.

416
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,840
He's the closest thing

417
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,760
to Big Brother there is.

418
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,180
He rewards those who knows

419
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,840
when they are smiling

420
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,460
when they're awake.

421
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,060
I think, really,

422
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,360
if you want to make a deal,

423
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,400
you have to do it with, you know...

424
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,380
Could Dr. Claus, in fact,

425
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,520
be the wandering, quote,

426
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,360
milkman rumored

427
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,560
to be the most dangerous man in the world?

428
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:06,680
Could he be the one

429
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,280
who would have fathered

430
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,900
our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

431
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,660
Well, we find it a very likely possibility

432
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,600
from the falsified documents

433
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,380
we have here.

434
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,360
And also the fluffy beard

435
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,180
that often grew on Bob's feet.

436
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,000
You better watch out.

437
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,440
You better not...

438
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,320
You better not...

439
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,800
You better not tell anyone.

440
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,180
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

441
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:04,180
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

442
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:33,900
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

443
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,780
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

444
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:39,780


445
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:39,780


446
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:39,780


447
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:39,780


448
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,940
Do you think I'm psycho, Mama?

449
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,580
I seen my ex last night.

450
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

451
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,700
Mama?

452
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,500
We all saw X-Mas last night.

453
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,780
At a dance at Miller's.

454
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,860
A vision of Christmas

455
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,000
that was dancing in Stank's head.

456
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,580
It would not lay for them

457
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,320
little sugar plums and berries

458
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,920
dropping toxic things.

459
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,640
Those little sugar plums

460
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,200
are the secret that plums need.

461
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,240
The poison in the plums.

462
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,080
But they're real plums.

463
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,560
Don't say that.

464
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,260
It's biological agents

465
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,540
who only take 15%.

466
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,040
You...

467
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,720
It came to the past

468
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
in boxes or bags.

469
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,740
And now...

470
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,560
And now...

471
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,020
And now...

472
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,600
And now...

473
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:35,940
And now...

474
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:36,560


475
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,220
And now...

476
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,820
And now...

477
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:46,820


478
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,900
It's a great day, all right.

479
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,680
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. Iron.

480
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,780
Shop as usual.

481
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,060
Shop as usual.

482
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,340
Shop as usual.

483
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,680
And avoid panic buying.

484
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,140
That's two days old Christmas, a million things to do

485
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,760
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due

486
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,460
Where are my relatives, why haven't they showed up?

487
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,480
I bet they're at the airport, I forgot to pick them up

488
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,420
Christmas, almost here

489
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:42,840
Christmas, almost here

490
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,340
Santa Claus is real

491
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,660
Santa Claus is real

492
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,980
Santa Claus is real

493
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,300
Santa Claus is real

494
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,120
Who's the hitman?

495
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,560
Santa Claus.

496
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,460
Santa Claus.

497
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,320
He was a huge, beastly,

498
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
bulging man.

499
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,060
He was so real,

500
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,020
how come we didn't get squat last year?

501
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,920
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan

502
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,820
on July 4th.

503
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,160
And now you can have it all,

504
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,700
all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

505
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,680
The birth of our baby Satan

506
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,740
as told by various authors

507
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,400
and acquaintances.

508
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:25,980
And by eclectic scholars

509
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,740
from around the globular unit.

510
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,440
Including that announcer.

511
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,960
This announcement has not been

512
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,020
a perfunctory announcement,

513
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,740
but an announcement of the blessed

514
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,220
anointment and birthday of our Lord

515
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,440
Zinu.

516
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,080
Zinu.

517
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,080


518
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,980
Zinu.

519
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,160


520
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,680
Zinu.

521
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


522
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


523
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


524
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


525
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


526
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


527
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


528
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


529
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


530
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


531
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


532
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


533
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


534
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


535
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


536
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


537
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


538
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


539
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


540
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,680


541
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,960
One bright Christmas morning.

542
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,320
Zinu.

543
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,780
Zinu.

544
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,060
Zinu.

545
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,060


546
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,400
Was born in a cradle.

547
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,240
You can imagine the rave Jesus.

548
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,560
To a rich man's family.

549
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,020
The rave Jesus.

550
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,820
Oh, I know the rave Jesus.

551
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,600
I farked with the rave Jesus.

552
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,880
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

553
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

554
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
Let yourself have.

555
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,300
From now on

556
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,360
our troubles will be

557
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,900
out of sight

558
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,440
Have yourself

559
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
a merry little

560
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,180
song

561
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,400
From now on

562
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
we're miles

563
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
away

564
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,680
Once a day

565
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,540
as in olden

566
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,760
day

567
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,220
happy golden

568
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,780
be miles

569
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,160
away

570
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,820
Let your heart

571
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,460
be out of sight

572
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,080

00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,240
Out of sight

575
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,100
Out of sight

576
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,440

Out of sight

579
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,180


580
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,280
Out of sight

581

Out of sight

582

Out of sight

583
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,140
From mutated Christmas

584
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,660
friends

585
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,360
Have yourself a merry little

589
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,160
Before that some year old ESO

590
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,980
and Michael Shelley did that

591
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,320
real story of Christmas

592
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,200

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,040
extravaganza.

595
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm playing a lot from that.

596
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,140

For that one also

599

And now

603
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,940
The Jethro's

604
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,160
Go!

605
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:44,200


606
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,540
Zoggo fun!

607
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,260
Just kidding!

608
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,440
Bet affections are

program room

610
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:00,560
No way kids

611
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:00,640
I can't see

612
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,500
I'm in a wreck

613
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,500


614
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,760
You just show me

615
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,380
I am in an accident

616
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,820
I brought my aunt

617
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:10,860
Mine and yours

618
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,680
on a horse

619
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,260
I am still dead

620
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,500
I laugh about

621
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,480
The weird bobs and I'm a,

622
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,600
those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob or,

623
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:42,800
or,

624
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,800
or that they're Santa Bob by night and they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless,

625
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,120
hideous errands.

626
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,520
The grin of Bob and the spirit of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

627
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,320
They stopped using the locks through their,

628
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,780
of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

629
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,220
Oh,

630
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,560
friends,

631
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,240
it's tough.

632
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,620
And you know,

633
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,280
you just,

634
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,140
just going to church ain't enough.

635
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,360
You got to send your money to the Santa,

636
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,580
Santa Bob.

637
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,400
As a matter of fact,

638
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,500
I,

639
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,100
the people across the street from me told their kids that,

640
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,760
that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

641
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,700
Can you believe that?

642
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:22,900
They,

643
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,620
they asked,

644
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,720
the kids were asking if their parents,

645
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,520
if maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

646
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,860
And the mom said,

647
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,080
no,

648
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,420
no,

649
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,220
he won't because he bills us.

650
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,240
We can't afford that.

651
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,260
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

652
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,560
Yeah,

653
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,980
but at least he totes the note.

654
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:58,120
They say that it's,

655
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,160
that's Luca.

656
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,800
He is Santa.

657
00:31:59,960 --> 00:31:59,960


658
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,120
It's...

659
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,860
I can't even understand that.

660
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


661
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


662
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


663
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


664
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


665
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


666
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


667
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


668
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


669
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


670
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


671
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:01,860


672
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,420
Hi,

673
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,180


674
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,820
Don't follow me around.

675
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,540
It's my sub,

676
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,160
my sub.

677
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,260
Oh,

678
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,140
my sooner,

679
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,340
my sooner,

680
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,980
Oh boy.

681
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,800
I have no kids.

682
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,380
That's fair to give our kids a rub-a-bum-bum.

683
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,500
Rub-a-bum-bum.

684
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,560
Rub-a-bum-bum.

685
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,120
And amazing.

686
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,820
Amazing.

687
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,860
More from Corporal Blossom.

688
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,520
I am really impressed by their editing work.

689
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,200
And that's on...

690
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,540
Corporal Blossom and the Mutated Christmas is on the Illegal Art label.

691
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,280
That's www.detritus.net

692
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,380
slash illegal art.

693
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,920
www.detritus.net slash illegal art.

694
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,160
And now, more Jethro's.

695
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,080
Jethro's.

696
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,700
Jethro's.

697
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,940
Jethro's.

698
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,580
Jethro's.

699
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,020
Now you're blaming Jesus.

700
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
You're blaming our Lord.

701
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,420
I sort of understand, because...

702
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,800
I understood the way any old fool would understand.

703
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,960
There was no Jesus.

704
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
No flatulent old woman waving her...

705
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,100
pennies on the hill. It's not that

706
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,380
you don't want to.

707
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,720
It's that they won't let you.

708
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,000
No, they're just a crime

709
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,540
in the wilderness. They're ashamed.

710
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,080
In the hot pursuit of wolves

711
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,820
everywhere in the background. I'm ashamed

712
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,520
of them.

713
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,780
It's cold.

714
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm leaving

715
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,580
that city life behind

716
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,040
and radio people are crazy.

717
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,900
I can't get my

718
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,060
noodle back in the pan, Jan.

719
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,160
Come on, cowboy.

720
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,380
I was trying to hear a tune against this here tree

721
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,660
and it started whispering to me, man.

722
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,120
You've been drinking.

723
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,240
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

724
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,800
There's the face of Virgin Mary. I swear to God, look at it.

725
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,860
Isn't it?

726
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,160
What?

727
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,280
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

728
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,880
A Christmas witch?

729
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,900
I'll be whole.

730
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,440
She's beautiful.

731
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,080
Her breasts are so cold.

732
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,320
I know she must be a true witch.

733
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,340
I guess you could call her that

734
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,740
if that's what she's talking about.

735
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,600
She's spread by hovering

736
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,880
Christmas ornaments.

737
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
It's like a radar device.

738
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,560
What?

739
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,760
Yo.

740
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,820
Yo?

741
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,260
It's her.

742
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,140
What up?

743
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,020
Nothing.

744
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,020
What's up?

745
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,860
What a deep voice.

746
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,380
What's up?

747
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,500
First Christmas witch.

748
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,180
Ha ha ha.

749
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,900
Well, if it weren't where I'm now,

750
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,420
database could never call a bowls and beì¤„.

751
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,420


752
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,420


753
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,420


754
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,420


755
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,460
It has the power to abnormalize a brain.

756
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,460


757
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,460


758
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,260
Henry serves before others.

759
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,260


760
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,400
G Ñ€Ð°Ð·Ð»Ð¸Ñ‡.

761
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,580
That?

762
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,940
Thank you.

763
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,080
My credit card makes me high.

764
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,300
My, oh my, until I die, die, die.

765
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Swing, swing, swing.

766
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,740
Who wants the diamond ring?

767
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,340
Bye, bye, bye.

768
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,060
Hail Mother Mary,

770
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,560
your blessed lady.

771
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,640
Hail Mother Mary,

772
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,300
I fell in love with your son.

773
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,920
Hail Mother Mary,

774
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,680
turn me on and on and on.

775
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,280
Hail Mother Mary,

776
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,940
thank God for you and your son.

777
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Right on, right on,

778
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,580
right on.

779
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,860
Right on, right on.

780
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,860
Right on, right on.

781
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,840
I am yours truly,

782
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,220
Rudy Ray Moore,

783
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,380
bold and still beautiful.

784
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,820
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas

785
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,800
because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

786
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,740
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

787
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,580
I can remember me and my brother

788
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,360
when I was about six years old.

789
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,300
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece

790
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,340
and the health department made us take them down.

791
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,220
I remember my father well, you know.

792
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,100
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

793
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,980
He used to have,

794
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,220
you know what caused it then?

795
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,680
He used to put a stocking cap on his head

796
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,320
and put a knock light in front of it.

797
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,820
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache

798
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,840
and he said,

799
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,740
the kids are saying my head's hurting so bad.

800
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,840
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas

801
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,960
but he's going to bring you something.

802
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,000
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside

803
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,280
and shot up in the air

804
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,180
and come back inside

805
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,220
and told us the biggest lie ever heard.

806
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,300
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

807
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,280
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

808
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,160
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle

809
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,080
but Satan Claus?

810
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,340
Whose father, Paul Bunyan

811
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,260
and whose mother, Big Sister

812
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,580
created the conspiracy?

813
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,260
Before there were malls,

814
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,680
there was no such thing as Christmas.

815
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,100
Yes, there was a down-home

816
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,820
Norman Rockwell style

817
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,720
it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

818
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,040
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,

819
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,580
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

820
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,460
When your little brother

821
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,960
fell through a hole in the ice

822
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,540
and slid,

823
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,260
he fell through a hole in the ice

824
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,400
and you went and saved him.

825
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,040
You didn't laugh at him

826
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,200
and huff some more glue.

827
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,340
It was a wonderful life back then.

828
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,060
But today Christmas has lost its meaning.

829
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,200
Scott, you made your choice.

830
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,780
When you rejected my word, you reject.

831
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,580
You rejected me.

832
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,260
And to your eternal soul,

833
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,760
you have found that only could you afford

834
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,580
to give to God that which was his.

835
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,580
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

836
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,840
The Senate still stands.

837
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,080
Frosty, the snowman

838
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,320
in the outer darkness

839
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,220
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

840
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,560
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

841
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,800
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

842
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,920
Sir, no, no.

843
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,080
I don't want to go to hell.

844
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,660
No!

845
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,660
No!

846
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,560
As alive as he could be.

847
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,700
And the children say

848
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,080
he could laugh and play just the same.

849
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,440
You and me.

850
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,700
The tail-bearer will be at the judgment.

851
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,900
But if you speaks to me now,

852
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,700
I will make your head tremble.

853
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,340
You may say.

854
00:40:59,340 --> 00:40:59,900
But you will never do yourself and me laundry.

855
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,000
You will be fine.

856
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:00,560
You will manage.

857
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,500
Why, I don't know.

858
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,280
I only cry when death comes.

859
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,560
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

860
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,360
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

861
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,480
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

862
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,260
Dare I ask it? Yes.

863
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,960
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

864
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,560
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

865
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,560
The answer? Yes, definitely.

866
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,100
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,

867
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,260
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

868
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,540
Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!

869
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,960
The night Santa went crazy

870
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,540
The night Saint Nick went insane

871
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,080
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

872
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,420
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

873
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,580
Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it

874
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,520
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet

875
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,460
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage

876
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,280
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage

877
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,500
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger

878
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,540
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

879
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,180
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer

880
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,400
And he took a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer

881
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,240
And he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken

882
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,540
The night Santa went crazy

883
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,180
The night Kris Krankle went nuts

884
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,440
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole

885
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,940
Without stepping in reindeer guts

886
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,380
There's a National Guard and the FBI

887
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,520
There's a van from the Eyewitness News

888
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,400
And the National Guard and the FBI

889
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,480
And helicopters circling round in the sky

890
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,320
And the bullets are flying

891
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,580
The bodyguards rising

892
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,160
And everyone's dying to know

893
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,020
Who's Santa why?

894
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,180
My, my, my, my, my, my

895
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,160
You used to be such a jolly guy

896
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,620
He knows when you're sleeping

897
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,780
He knows when you're awake

898
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,740
He knows when you're feeling bad or good

899
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,900
So be good for goodness sake

900
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out

901
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,060
You better not cry

902
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,500
You better not pout

903
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm telling you why

904
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,060
Santa Claus is coming to town

905
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,380
Santa Claus is coming to town

906
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,600
Santa Claus is coming to town

907
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:22,520
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coot.

908
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,300
ElectricElf at loop.com can tell you more about that but now

909
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,180
Who gave the Lord the Claptrap?

910
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,660
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

911
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,540
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind my one and only?

912
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,400
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

913
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,920
The time of the Lord, of the fact and of the craft.

914
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limit?

915
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:47,880
Jesuses?

916
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,980
Yeah, how many can you bag?

917
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,840
How many messiahs can you bag?

918
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,700
If you're doing it in season, if you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

919
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,520
Oh, you never do that.

920
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,280
And you can only take one.

921
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,560
You never bag the Lord in C. You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

922
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,140
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

923
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,280
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

924
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,420
Obviously.

925
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,240
We are between a rock and a hard place.

926
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,180
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?

927
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,440
And he got elphantiasis of the rectum.

928
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,720
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.

929
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,620
Messy, messy, messy disease.

930
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,100
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was

931
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,180
Well, I like the story.

932
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,460
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and...

933
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,900
and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.

934
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,780
I like when he moves into a trailer park and...

935
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,360
I like the cowboy job with his dog.

936
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,520
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

937
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,700
The ranger. I like the...

938
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,160
The Texas ranger. Jesus, Texas ranger.

939
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,340
Johnny Ripple was a Jesus.

940
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,600
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.

941
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,980
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

942
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,600
Man.

943
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,420
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

944
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:03,440
Billy Jack. What about...

945
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,340
Well, what about old peacemaker, the...

946
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,260
the Jesus of the Iroquois who was actually Huron?

947
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,940
A Huron.

948
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,380
You didn't know that, did you?

949
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:10,980
I got you!

950
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,360
Thin Ron.

951
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,820
Jesus.

952
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:13,980
Elron.

953
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,140
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

954
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,100
Oh, it tastes like butter.

955
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,040
A new Jesus. A different Jesus.

956
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,300
It tastes like a few chocolate pie children.

957
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,540
A few crappies.

958
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,240
A pipe-smoking Jesus.

959
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,600
Hey.

960
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,740
Dave, you know where it is.

961
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,920
Go kick that window open.

962
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,120
I already kicked it. I'll kick it again.

963
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,380
You know.

964
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,940
Kick it good this time.

965
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,200
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

966
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,000
We hope that...

967
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

968
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,440
Clap it.

969
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,020
We appreciate all that.

970
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,920
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

971
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,500
That's all.

972
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

973
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,660
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

974
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,120
Right.

975
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,380
I could hear him say that.

976
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,640
Praise God and Bob.

977
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
And Jesus.

978
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,100
Next topic.

979
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,240
And Connie.

980
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
And Carly.

981
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,300
And The Devil.

982
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,860
And the atheists.

983
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:08,920
And The Atheists.

984
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,660
The simple consulted Jesus.

985
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:09,740
I show spices.

986
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:09,740


987
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:09,780
The devil and the atheist.

988
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,080
And a theist.

989
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,220
And science.

990
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:10,840
And the atheist.

991
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,100
That's the life of Bryan isn't it?

992
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,820
And Greek mythology.

993
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,540
And Norse mythology.

994
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of Hell.

995
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
Jingle, jungle, jingle.

996
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,100
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

997
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,260
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

998
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Rap and rap and pana.

999
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1000
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1001
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1002
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1003
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1004
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1005
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:32,840


1006
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:43,800
We're gonna break our necks, got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

1007
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,480
Sleigh ride to heck.

1008
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,080
Sleigh ride to heck.

1009
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,840
Sleigh ride to heck.

1010
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,480
Sleigh ride to heck.

1011
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,920
The elves are full of cheer, the kids are tucked in bed.

1012
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,620
Santa ain't coming, we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

1013
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,700
Their dreams are filled with toys, but they're out of luck.

1014
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:25,460
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to fuck.

1015
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,020
Sleigh ride to heck.

1016
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,680
Sleigh ride to heck.

1017
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,540
Sleigh ride to heck.

1018
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:50,260
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey, James Kochalka, Superstar.

1019
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:07,220
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

1020
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,640
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

1021
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,360
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

1022
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:23,820
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes, but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy.

1023
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,720
Is holy compared to the evil.

1024
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:44,900
Is holy compared to the evil of so, not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general, of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc., if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

1025
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,980
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

1026
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,620
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say, are old drinking buddies.

1027
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,960
Got nothing against Jesus.

1028
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,860
It's just his fan club.

1029
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,140
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

1030
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,600
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

1031
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,660
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

1032
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,800
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

1033
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,540
He doesn't even sneeze.

1034
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,940
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us, and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.

1035
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,640
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

1036
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,500
Oh, and he's male.

1037
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,000
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do, because we sin.

1038
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh, yeah, we all sin.

1039
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,380
We're bad.

1040
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,180
We're worthless.

1041
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,080
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

1042
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,180
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

1043
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:47,880
We turn.

1044
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,840
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

1045
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,900
Thank you.

1046
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,940
Thank you.

1047
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,120
Thank you.

1048
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,760
Thank you.

1049
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:43,820
I'm dreaming about the kaÅ¼Ø¯ÙŠ GaS command and everyone can convite.

1050
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:44,580


1051
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,680
Make your days a living.

1052
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,400
Shh!

1053
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,760
and short.

1054
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,060
And may all

1055
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,600
your

1056
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,260
dogs spend

1057
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,220
you right.

1058
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,560
By

1059
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,140
Fernandan and Nellie Moore.

1060
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,660
Oh, holy

1061
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,500
night, the stars are

1062
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,140
brightly shining.

1063
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,800
It is the night

1064
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,240
of our dear Savior's birth.

1065
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,580
Long lay,

1066
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,280
long lay the world

1067
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,880
in terror and

1068
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,640
fighting.

1069
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,620
The pit and the stone

1070
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,820
on its worth.

1071
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,160
A thrill of hope,

1072
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,600
the weary world rejoices

1073
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,540
beyond our grace.

1074
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,200
A new and glorious

1075
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,820
dawn. Fall

1076
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,760
on your knees.

1077
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,200
Oh, hear

1078
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,040
the angel voices.

1079
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,560
Oh, night

1080
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,400
divine.

1081
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh, night

1082
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,600
when Christ was

1083
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,560
born. Oh,

1084
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,740
night. Oh,

1085
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,120
night

1086
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,560
divine.

1087
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,380
Have yourselves

1088
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:23,480
a

1089
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,880
groovy little solstice.

1090
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,680
Mithras won

1091
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,380
his fight.

1092
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,260
Oh, ho, ho.

1093
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,820
Oh, ho, ho.

1094
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,320
Come on, come on.

1095
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,580
It's he-bomb. Hey, kids, you can help

1096
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,220
the mighty subgenus rice overthrow

1097
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,560
the evil normals with new Bob-Dob's

1098
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,860
action figure with rock and pie.

1099
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,260
What I wouldn't do from Bob-Dob.

1100
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,700
Get no more chocolatey pebbles from you, no?

1101
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,180
Ooh.

1102
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,380
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

1103
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,620
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

1104
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,740
Feeling free.

1105
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,280
I need to have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

1106
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,900
Now so trumpety.

1107
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,860
Mmm, smells cocoa.

1108
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,420
What is this?

1109
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,740
This cocoa lipid.

1110
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,480
Blue.

1111
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,520
Hello, friends.

1112
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,080
What do you think? Is it the

1113
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,220
nativity of Santa Claus that we're

1114
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,220
trying to celebrate here?

1115
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,820
Or is it the

1116
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,860
horrible death of the Santa?

1117
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,600
Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

1118
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,460
as he's been referred to in some early

1119
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,240
prescriptures.

1120
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,260
We're getting so separate.

1121
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,360
We're getting so separate.

1122
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:30,780
We're getting so separate.

1123
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:51,680
We're getting so separate.

1124
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,320
We're getting so separate.

1125
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:58,460
We're getting so separate.

1126
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,500
The Jethro's, friends.

1127
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,780
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

www.subgenius.com

1172
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,680
It's all Christmas-y right now.

1173
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,640
It's all Christmas-y right now.

1174
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,540
Green bob in the window and Christmas-y lights.

1175
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,160
Is there a light out there?

1176
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,960
Is DJA out there?

1177
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,720
And devilish artwork that's Christmas-y.

1178
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,820
No, that's something just left for DJA.

1179
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,960
It's all Christmas-y.

1180
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,280
It's all wrapped up in

1181
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,700
perfumed, ribbon-wrapped

1182
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,280
present.

1183
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,800
Under the tree.

1184
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,500
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1185
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,420
And those sugar plums.

1186
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,720
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's, isn't it?

1187
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,440
Yeah.

1188
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,180
Santa.

1189
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,280
I mean, otherwise.

1190
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,360
Gosh.

1191
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,340
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1192
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, beloved Santa.

1193
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,380
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

1194
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,820
It's always so ready to let him be.

1195
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:06,620
Santa.

1196
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,420
For so long.

1197
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,120
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

1198
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,680
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

1199
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:16,720
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

1200
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,600
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

1201
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,820
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

1202
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,520
Hi, Bob and Mary Xmas!

1203
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:47,080
For so long, I've been having those eating dare this.

1204
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,080


1205
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,080


1206
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,080


1207
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,660
You're gonna make a mistake over there.

1208
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,020
You're gonna make a mistake over there.

1209
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,120
You're gonna make a mistake all around this place.

1210
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,500
I don't understand why you came back here like that, Mike.

1211
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:52,500


1212
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:52,500


1213
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:52,500


1214
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,380
Lone cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1215
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,020
Don't despair just because it's Christmas

1216
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,300
Children there are so gay at Christmas

1217
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,320
All the children on the street

1218
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,140
Hope they get something good to eat

1219
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:32,260
But for me it's not so great

1220
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,160
Fuck Christmas!

1221
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,080
What a night!

1222
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,740
Right before Christmas and all through the house

1223
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,880
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

1224
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,060
The stockings were hung by the tree

1225
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,520
Merry fucking Christmas

1226
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,220
Merry fucking Christmas

1227
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,060

SHOOT YOU!

1230
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,980
Merry fucking Christmas

1231
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,900

Merry fucking Christmas

1235
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,280
Merry fucking Christmas

1236
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:55,860
Thank you.

1237
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:29,780
Thank you.

1238

Thank you.
