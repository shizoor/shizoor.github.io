1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,200
Ah, yes dear friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number 1030.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,580
Again, brought to you this time entirely by Reverend Susie the Fousey

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,160
and to WREK, the greatest station of Atlanta, Georgia.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,700
And now, some of you may still remember Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,880
and the horror and stupidity that made it such an exciting TV show for people who weren't there.

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:51,900
Well, Reverend Susie the Fousey did four episodes of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse on Hurricane Katrina,

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,640
of which this is the second, Hell and High Water.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,640
In which Susie actually does take us to Hell.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,460
Louisiana's got fun and fun people, like in the mouth of the river.

11
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,720
We've got probably the most fun people of the state.

12
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,540
Before you go farther, be aware that now you are in this, the second ring.

13
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,140
Look well, for here one sees things which in words would be incredible.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,880
No way. You were just kidding.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,340
Right?

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,020
I am where all light is mute.

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,820
With a bellowing like the ocean, turbulent in a storm of warring winds,

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,820
the hurricane of Hell in perpetual motion torments them.

19
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,500
And now, I can hear the notes of agony in sad crescendo beginning to reach my ear.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,860
Now, I am where the noise of lamentation comes at me in blasts of sorrow.

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,160
Long before the Superdome.

22
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,140
Long before the Superdome.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,800
Where the saints of football play.

24
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,460
Lived a city that the damned call home.

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,440
Here their hellish Rondelet.

26
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,380
New Orleans.

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,180
Home of pirates, drunks, and whores.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,800
New Orleans.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,020
New Orleans.

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,480
Taki, overprice, souvenir stores.

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,520
If you want to go to Hell, you should take that trip to the Sodom and Gomorrah on the Mississippi.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,480
New Orleans.

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,380
All right, I'll go to Hell!

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,600
For a starter, I'll steal Jim out of slavery again.

35
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,600
And if I can think of something worse, I'll do that too.

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,220
Because as long as I'm in, and in for good, I might as well go whole hog.

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,260
I think we're like big.

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,020
Oh, it's real.

39
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,080
It's real now.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
It's real.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,420
Yee!

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,360
I said hey, hey, hey, yeah.

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,420
I said hey, hey, hey, yeah.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,500
Well, come on everybody, take a trip with me.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,600
Hey!

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,160
All right!

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,740
Down to Mississippi, down to New Orleans.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,880
Hey!

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,220
Hundreds of them growing on a hundred-cell plant.

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,880
Oh, yeah.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
And I know it's growing there all the time.

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,400


53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,040
All right, all right, all right, all right.

54
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,100
Every southern belle is a Mississippi queen.

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Down to Mississippi, down to New Orleans.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,340
Hey!

57
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,900
Yeah!

58
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,660
All right!

59
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

60
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,460
All right!

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,460
Hey!

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,120
Hey!

63
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,500
Hey!

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,500


65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,500


66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,580
Hey!

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:56,640
Yeah, all right.

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:05,500
See you, Clark, burn down lots of entreprises.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:05,780
Today will be an all-nighter for somezers, nighties, da Zhin.

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,220
We can't, exactly.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,320


72
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
What kind of videography are we doing tonight?

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,340
I don't know.

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,260
I don't think it's going to be any better.

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,380
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

76
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,100
President Adolf Bush.

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,360
Eptom horrible bone-chilling news!

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,140
What is it?

79
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,960
Nothing.

80
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,220
New Orleans is a full-blown disaster.

81
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:30,720
Yes.

82
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,860
A terrible thing's happened.

83
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
Oh my God!

84
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,740
Call a brief!

85
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,360
There's no point in acting all surprised about it.

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:47,420
All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,360
So you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaints.

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,060
For the sake of mankind.

89
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,500
But it's part of the latest part making a fuss about it now.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,780
I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs, that's your own problem.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
Well, this was a great stop to me.

92
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,660
Wednesday morning.

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,200
In the middle of the sea lies a wasteland.

95
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,060
A wasteland.

96
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,160
I wonder if it comforts him.

97
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
I appreciate that a lot.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,120
But now must lie deserted like some worn thing by time decayed.

99
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,260
We have 22, 24, 26 feet of water in the metropolitan area.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,960
Oh my God!

101
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,060
Ah, heck.

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,400
Where am I going to get a Danish?

103
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,740
Brandt!

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,200
No organ.

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:52,260
Come on, came to be heard?

106
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,000
Give me a hand.

107
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,800
Was there anything he might want to wonder about?

108
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:02,800


109
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:02,800


110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:02,800


111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:02,800


112
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes, I know it is.

113
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,940
Additionally, you guys went on a vuelo on 01 August.

114
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,360
It seems there would be some kind of technology about that.

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,300
You fairy fucking martians game?

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,180
I'll call for martial law in the city of New Orleans.

117
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,760
This thing was going to blow wide open last night.

118
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,000
It's awful down here, man.

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,020
This is ridiculous.

120
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,540
I got a headlock, brother, and my life is a mess.

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,820
It feels like behind the door is poking through my chest.

122
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,920
Oh, baby!

123
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,160
And we don't have the manpower to adequately deal with.

124
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,760
We can only form a perimeter around them and hope to God that we're not overrun.

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,380
You know it looks like, tastes like, smells like, babies like hair tie.

126
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,620
So right now it's pretty much like New Orleans right now has just wiped off the face of the earth.

127
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:35,240
Therefore, I judge it best that you should choose to follow me, and I will be your guide away from here and through an eternal place to hear the cries of despair and to behold tormented spirits as they lament in chorus the second death they must abide.

128
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,400
Oh, baby!

129
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,840
But these were of a mode more bitter, for among the river were flames on every side bathing her borders.

130
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,200
Smoke them if you got them.

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
Oh, my.

132
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,040
You know, man, let me tell you something.

133
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,840
But it feels good, do it.

134
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,640
Burn the place to the ground.

135
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,280
Smoke on the water.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,660
Fire in the sky.

137
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,740
Smoke on the water.

138
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:13,980
Hit it.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,440
They burned down the gambin' house.

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,880
It died with an awful sound.

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,040
A funky chicken was a-runnin' out.

142
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,580
Pullin' kids out the ground.

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,280
Pullin' kids out the ground.

144
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,280


145
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:44,640
When it all was over, we had to find another place.

146
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,420
A Swiss town was runnin' out.

147
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,200
It seems that people lose the race.

148
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,680
Smoke on the water.

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,360
Fire in the sky.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,260
Smoke on the water.

151
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


152
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


153
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


154
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


155
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


156
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


157
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


158
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


159
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


160
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


161
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260


162
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,880
The Warhead!

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,260
Help! Help us!

164
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,460
God dang old die man, this is old die!

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,040
Great!

166
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,040
Everything was going wrong.

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,560
So with slow steps we perverse that place of night.

168
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,660
Through rain and shades commingled once or twice beginning in the future life.

169
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:53,700
And so I said, Master these torments tell me will they increase after the judgment or lessen or nearly endure burning as much as now?

170
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,440
He said, I don't know.

171
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:04,420
Well I've been down to the pain and sorrow of good tomorrow's coming in.

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,020
Well I've been down to the pain and sorrow of good tomorrow's coming in.

173
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,900
But I put my pole to the river bottom.

174
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,040
And I've got to hide some place to find myself again.

175
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,720
So look out for me, oh muddy water.

176
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,200
You're Mr. Freeze, Parky Batwise.

177
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,860
And I've got a need for throwing some fish.

178
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,080
And I've got a need to climb upon your back and ride.

179
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,020
Meanwhile, far below the earth's surface,

180
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,760
422 are confirmed dead as federal hazmat teams force to clear the area.

181
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,440
While I was ruining myself, back down to the deep, someone appeared.

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,240
Okay, who's the head honcho here?

183
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,420
Huh? Who are you?

184
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,340
Me? Why I'm just a gun-toting weather girl.

185
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,360
What are you doing here? This is a climate control station.

186
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,220
What do you want from us?

187
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,980
I want you to make it rain.

188
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,960
Rain? But why?

189
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,340
Let's see.

190
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,340
You know, she became so hostile.

191
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,880
You couldn't depend on her just to pull off a job and then split.

192
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
You know, she'd always have to stick around and rough them up.

193
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,040
But she didn't used to be such a monster.

194
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,500
Lots of fun inside.

195
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,260
That's what she said! Woo!

196
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,100
Dark, accursed torrent eternally poured with changeless measure of nature.

197
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,400
Enormous hail and tainted water mixed with snow are showered steadily through the shadowy air of hell.

198
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,940
The soil they drench gives off a putrid odor.

199
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,820
You're not exactly smelling like roses either.

200
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
The water was purple black. We followed its current down a strange passage.

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:09,220
This dismal watercourse descends the grayish slopes until its torrent discharges into the marsh whose name is Styx.

202
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,000
Styx? I just heard them on the King Biscuit Flower Hour.

203
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,600
This club better be worth it.

204
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,340
Soon their course shifted and the merciless weather battered them towards us.

205
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,420
I called against the wind.

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,960
Oh, wearied souls, if another does not forbid, come speak with us.

207
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,260
Bob, I'm all turned around. Can you tell me how to get back to the road?

208
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,520
No way. It's fun because it's true.

209
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,620
Well, I'm so low, I want to fly the sea.

210
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,540
Crying for your kiss.

211
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Oh, darling, must it end?

212
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,380
Like this, like this, like this, the lonesome waters.

213
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,720
Keeps reminding me that my arms are empty.

214
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,240
By the Lord.

215
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,240


216
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,920
By the Lord.

217
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,220
By the Lord.

218
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,260
You can stay here alone and watch what happens to this purgatory.

219
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,600
I'll be at the bridge that links earth to the heavens.

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,260
What did you mean by this?

221
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,140
I don't know.

222
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,060
Where is he taking me?

223
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,080
To his underwater palace. Just kidding, it's a lagoon full of bugs.

224
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,520
He's truly mad.

225
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,440
Where in the world did he come from?

226
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,960
Beast.

227
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,080
Beast?

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,920
These are the souls in anger over Canaan's son.

229
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,880
You know also that under the water are found others whose sighing makes these bubbles come

230
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,200
that pop the surface everywhere you look.

231
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,400
What we don't see is what's scary because of what's in the water, the metals, the poisons.

232
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Under the water, you can't see it.

233
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,220
They have no idea where it's going, have no idea what's going on.

234
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,100
Any scientist will tell you he has no idea.

235
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,060
Lodged in the slime, they say,

236
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:02,140
Once we were grim and sullen in the sweet air above that took a further gladness from the play of sun.

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,220
Hey! Hey!

238
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,360
They can't see you. Conserve your energy.

239
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,980
I'm getting so tired. I'm just gonna close my eyes for a minute and stay awake.

240
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,620
Hey man, I did it, man. I broke off a dang old propeller, man.

241
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,620
Why'd you do that?

242
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,960
There's gasoline everywhere.

243
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,960
I don't know, man.

244
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,140
Well, smoke them if you got them.

245
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,940
Let's smoke on that water, man.

246
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,860
If anybody's gonna do it, Fernandez is gonna fight it.

247
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,600
Smoke!

248
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,900
Smoke!

249
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,660
Smoke!

250
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,260
Smoke!

251
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,440


252
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,500
Smoke!

253
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,220
Hey guys, there's an island!

254
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,400
Holy crap!

255
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,500
The island of the woods!

256
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,620
The island of the lands!

257
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,800
The island of the land!

258
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,700
Send me to the sun!

259
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,800
Send me to the land!

260
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,700
What the hell is this?

261
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,040
You've gotta be kidding me.

262
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,760
It's a bad joke.

263
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,680
I'm out on the interstate

264
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,960
No! No! No!

265
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,300
Out in the dusty desert winds

266
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm out on the interstate

267
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,700
She goes looking for a friend

268
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,000
She sees the light around the bend

269
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,020
I'm out on the inner state

270
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,800
I can hear a soft voice calling

271
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,440
Calling to bring my good times

272
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,140
I understand how the anxiety people can grab

273
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,720
So there is frustration

274
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,460
But I want people to know there's a lot of help coming

275
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,360
This is a public service message from people

276
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,060
Well, that's life in the 21st century for you

277
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,400
You just have to learn to accept it

278
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,500
Damn you!

279
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,960
Where I come from we don't hold traditional woman

280
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,820
You're looking to get a nice big cross turned on your lawn

281
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,320
Excuse me

282
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,140
But emotionally disturbed

283
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,860
She's from Alabama

284
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,740
You won't forget

285
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,940
How could I?

286
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,680
I look for the first lawn with a burning cross

287
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,900
Reflect and try and come up with better strategies

288
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,840
My biggest flaw in my opinion was to basically assume that

289
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,940
If I got everyone up to a high place and safe and out of the water

290
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,460
Then the cavalry would come in two to three days and they didn't come

291
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,960
And reminding him

292
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,220
You know that a strategy has been the murder of US citizens

293
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,000
How do you know?

294
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,900
Well, he's a f***er, that's how I know

295
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,720
Nobody's coming to get us

296
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,620
Nobody's coming to get us

297
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,100
Try to be patient

298
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,980
Federal and state help is on the way

299
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,700
We'll be ready for you when you're ready

300
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,760
This is the FEMA radio news service

301
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Try to be patient

302
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,720
Federal and state help is on the way

303
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,380
Dead bulls*** man

304
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,280
Whatever

305
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:46,860
Ding

306
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,660
Today was out of sight, out of sight

307
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,200
Temperatures today range from about 56 where you are to 450

308
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,720
Wooo!

309
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,940
That's where I am

310
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,100
Throughout the day we had this green, purplish, diagonal thunder

311
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,060
That was shooting all around here

312
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,120
Well, y'all should have dug it

313
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,660
We're going away this weekend, you know, have a good trip

314
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,480
Wooo!

315
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,140
That's green!

316
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,780
But while we're killing time we might as well soak up some rays and catch some fish

317
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,640
Oh, well alright

318
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,860
Now we must fake the Hulk, see if they bite

319
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,600
Pull them in

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,580
Woke up this morning

321
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,340
I wanted to cry

322
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,160
Then I remember

323
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,080
Yes, I knew why

324
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,320
She a real good one for having the cake

325
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,180
I'm gonna go fishing or jump in the lake

326
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,780
Yes, I'm gonna go fishing

327
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,580
Mmm, that's what I'll do

328
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,680
I'll think about nothing

329
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,300
Not even you

330
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,560
Catch a real big one, a big speckled trout

331
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,540
Snappin' in the water, I'll pull him on out

332
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,940
I wonder if I'll ever see a stream full of fish again

333
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,260
Where'd you ever see a stream full of fish in Ireland?

334
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,300
At the movies

335
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,860
Oh, here in the water

336
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,520
Ooh, look at him shine

337
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,720
There goes a big one

338
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,580
Okay, fish

339
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,460
Mmm, that one is mine

340
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,340
Whoa! Holy mackerel!

341
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,200
Cast out the reel now, I got the feel now

342
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
Snapper goes my fly rod, I'll catch me a trout

343
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,060
Ah, what a fish!

344
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,360
The dead channel one rose a beam coated with mud and addressed me

345
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,660
You!

346
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,000
Are you deaf or what?

347
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,200
His eyes found a man

348
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,860
Who had given himself to the river

349
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,380
Who let the flow of the river carry him away

350
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,180
Hey, what gives?

351
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,220
The general flow pattern is for things that are in the landfill

352
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,200
To become liquefied by rain

353
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,220
And to leave the landfill and go into the nearby water that we all care about

354
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,080
That is true

355
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,060
Woohoo!

356
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,700
Oh my god!

357
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,320
Oh!

358
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,540
We're doomed

359
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,520
Then I could feel the terror begin to ease

360
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,060
That churned in my heart's lake all through the night

361
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,640
Ah, good times

362
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,080
As one still panting ashore from dangerous seas looks back at the deep he has escaped

363
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
Lake George

364
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,500
My thought returns still fleeing

365
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,800
To regard that grim defile that never left any alive who stayed in it

366
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,720
Don't worry, Mr. Ulrich, we'll get you to the hospital

367
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,380
Right?

368
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,200
Oh!

369
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,640
He!

370
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,080
Oh, gee!

371
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,160
Oh, yeah, right

372
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,680
So at once I understood beyond all doubt that this was the dreary guild

373
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,440
Of repellent both to God and his enemies

374
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,540
Hopeless ones, never alive

375
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,460
Their bare skin galled by wasps and flies

376
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,900
Blood trickling down the face

377
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,580
Mingling with tears for harvest underfoot by writhing maggots

378
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,680
I am not especially anxious to mingle

379
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,340
We've been out here for days

380
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,580
So help me, I'm gonna slug you

381
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,640
I'm starving

382
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,540
Dick, y'all gonna have a gassy day tomorrow

383
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,900
It's gonna be sunny

384
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,280
It's gonna be blind

385
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,300
It's gonna start with the sun coming up in the east like a big yellow ball

386
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,860
Then it's gonna get bigger and bigger

387
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,880
And then it's gonna envelop the whole universe with love

388
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,800
Love, y'all, love!

389
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,520
No problem

390
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,720
Oh, my youth!

391
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,600
So while we're killing time we might as well soak up some rays

392
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,800
What a...

393
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,960
That was my very favorite song

394
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,940
So monstrously huge

395
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,020
The sun comes out

396
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,660
Twice a day

397
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,460
I cannot move

398
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,080
I can't get away

399
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,320
Him with his pants on fire

400
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,340
So long ago

401
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
When my life was young

402
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,020
I did not know

403
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,120
The dangers of the sun

404
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,180
And I'm steering

405
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,660
Steering

406
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,460
At the sun

407
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,660
At the sun

408
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,760
At the sun

409
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:32,760


410
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,100
I couldn't breathe

411
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,920
Still today

412
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,040
I can't see

413
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,360
For everyone

414
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,920
I cross all the miles

415
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,720
Facing black and green

416
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
The horizon is so bright

417
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:01,860
icide

418
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,780
A child's call

419
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:02,800
For his mother

420
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,440
What upsets

421
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,020
And shouts

422
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,240
Tens of

423
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,680
Cont案

424
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,520
Tens of

425
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,520


426
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,780
Tens of

427
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,380
A À

428
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,380


429
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,380


430
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Aah

431
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Argh

432
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:17,500
something so beautiful and now uh having a veritable sewer you know what i think i think

433
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,300
this place is jinxed let's get out of here get out of here what's the best way out of here

434
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,840
master i said it seems by this dim light that all of these are eager to cross over

435
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,400
can you tell me by what law and who they are do you know

436
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:47,020
well it might be a lady or a girl with a baby a man on a bike a boy with a kite a kid with a puppy

437
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:55,660
a girl with a bunny a guy with a smile someone running a mile a stranger is anyone whoever you

438
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,560
are i have always depended on the kindness of strangers

439
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,440
i won't look at everything

440
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,340
you

441
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,860
nobody's coming together everybody's probably

442
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,900
i can hear yourself

443
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,520
nobody's coming everybody's probably for god's sake shut up and send me somebody

444
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,980
children are laughing

445
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,380
in the city

446
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,220
i count their voices one by one

447
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,080
the bridge that links earth to heaven that's great i need to get out of here

448
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,980
well there's my ride then came skimming across the water

449
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,460
skiff guided by a single boatman of the house

450
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,840
welcome aboard the ship of lost souls

451
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,780
the name in the bag is honey bunch yeah i've been meaning to paint over that

452
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:32,640
take me in the lifeboat take me in the lifeboat it will stand raging storm

453
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,440
take me in the lifeboat

454
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,380
take me in the lifeboat

455
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,280
it won't fire my spirit home

456
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,420
you'll have us in your boat only as long as it takes to cross the bend

457
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,080
oh whatever

458
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,980
she boarded the boat it bobbed without a sign of being laden until it carried my weight

459
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,080
as soon as we embarked the ancient crowd turned swiftly from shore

460
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,660
made a deeper cut into the water than it was worth to do with others

461
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,140
then when i turn my eyes farther along our course i could make

462
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,960
making out people upon the shore of some great river.

463
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,920
We are hard beset by the enemy whose power grows ever mightier.

464
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,740
Only the river now lies between us and the dark powers of Mordor.

465
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,640
Now come and meet the rest of the dam.

466
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,580
Did I mention their lost souls?

467
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,220
Well, actually you did.

468
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,180
Truly, I should like to see that spirit pickled in this swill

469
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,160
before we've made our way across the lake.

470
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:34,900
Hear, hear!

471
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,680
Before we see the shore, you will be satisfied.

472
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,620
For what you seek is pity.

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,840
Come, stranger. Join our circle of infamy.

474
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,360
Tell us your story of ennui.

475
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,380
Water, water everywhere.

476
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,960
Another drop to drink.

477
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,400
What's that?

478
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
It's a poem.

479
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,700
The first poem you learn in high school.

480
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,120
What's high school?

481
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,580
It's where you should be.

482
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,020
It's where you learn things.

483
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,160
Say what?

484
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,460
How bogus.

485
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,560
You're disgust even me.

486
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,540
Well, yeah, I know.

487
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,200
The last time I trust the strangest people on earth.

488
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,160
He sobbed and he sighed

489
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,500
And a gurgle he gave

490
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,240
Then he plunged himself into the billowy wave

491
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,880
And an egg he ate

492
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,880


493
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,880


494
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,880


495
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,880


496
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,880


497
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:34,880


498
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,760
And an echo arose

499
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,960
From the suicide's grave

500
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,080
Oh, willow, tit willow, tit willow

501
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,480
Swept to the bottom of the briny deep

502
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,360
Swallowed whole by the treacherous, unforgiving sea

503
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,760
Sank, I guess, would be the one thing to take away from this part of the seminar.

504
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,880
It's much too early to determine...

505
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,300
What happened out on that lake.

506
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,960
Just the people that were out on the boat were taking as many people they could out of the water.

507
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,820
And they were even some of the people who were rescuing the people out on the lake were very shaken and crying and stuff because of what they had seen out there.

508
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,820
What's going on?

509
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,660
What's going on?

510
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,260
My old man always used to say,

511
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,400
When a ship goes out to sea, either it keeps sailing or it sinks.

512
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,180
There's nothing else.

513
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,480
Ain't that ironic?

514
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,880
Ain't that ironic?

515
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,700
Uh-huh.

516
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,040
Well then, laugh.

517
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,300
Laugh a little more.

518
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,040
It's nothing to laugh about!

519
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:54,500
It progressed into the deep, dug moats that circled near the walls of that bleak city which seemed cast of solid iron.

520
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,720
Lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, a whole array of toxic chemicals.

521
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,480
Chemical plant across the street

522
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,380
Leaves of steam that colors our white sheets

523
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,360
It's been happening for years

524
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,400
Now I'm crying rainbow tears

525
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,080
One day my dog went out to play

526
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,040
He said, I was gray

527
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,220
He came back colored yellow

528
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,480
The chemical man said, stay mellow

529
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,860
It happens all the time

530
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,880
Now Scotty's skin is slime

531
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,280
We focused in our report, at least on kind of the southern Louisiana coast,

532
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,680
the Mississippi Sound, dredge material, and sewage sludge.

533
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,160
We looked at a lot of sewage sludge, farm runoff, something else.

534
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,960
Oh, that is funny.

535
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,460
Let's wampum!

536
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,340
Attention jet skiers, I have a court order here requiring you to vacate these waters.

537
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,500
No court order is gonna tell me what to do.

538
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,700
Oh, man, it's notarized.

539
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,440
Let's boogie!

540
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,500
Okay.

541
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,600
We journeyed on to complete an immense circuit before we reached at last a place where the boatman shouted...

542
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,980
And if you look off the left side of the ship, you'll see a bunch of homosexuals.

543
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,780
How awful.

544
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,740
Not at all amusing.

545
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,440
I'll have to leave if this package raid continues.

546
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,720
Fanny bandits.

547
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,740
In such poor taste.

548
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,940
Now get out, here is the entrance.

549
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,420
Come on, get out of here.

550
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Graham, on your way.

551
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,020
We came to a tower's base.

552
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,160
Now the fun begins.

553
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,040
Through me you enter into the city of worlds.

554
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,360
Through me you enter into eternal pain.

555
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,320
Through me you enter the population of loss.

556
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,540
Abandon all hope, you who enter here.

557
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,240
Okay.

558
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,300
Well, that was worth the eight year boat ride.

559
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,680
Probably should ignore that.

560
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,760
It's in Revelations, people!

561
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,180
Sounds like a wager to me.

562
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
I'll take a piece of that.

563
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,040
Look!

564
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,360
Watch a broken and living,

565
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,180
Obey, obey,

566
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,060
Who was there to save you?

567
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,800
Who was there to save you?

568
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
Come on in!

569
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,400
Well, I guess this story has a happy ending after all.

570
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,900
Just like that last one, son.

571
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,200
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho, and a couple of tra-la-la.

572
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,740
And through the gate entering without delay,

573
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,060
there was a great dispute.

574
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Uh, see, uh, reverend,

575
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,480
are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?

576
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,760
Oh, I'm afraid not.

577
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,300
Yeah, I'm leaving.

578
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:06,660
Me too.

579
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,260
Come on!

580
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,640
Hey!

581
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,840
Where do you think you're going?

582
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,640
To Baton Rouge.

583
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,520
Gracious!

584
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,380
I should bust a cap in your ass.

585
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,000
Sometimes you made me enter within this dome,

586
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,020
which is the lowest and darkest place ever.

587
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,400
Do you know where it is?

588
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,660
No idea.

589
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,780
Excellent.

590
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,840
It's all going to place.

591
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,740
you'll backpedal to the lower depths of the travesty

592
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:44,220
getting the hard-won treatment and my own orders i command you to see for yourself

593
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:55,580
a seething string of torment and revulsion hangs over you an orgy overweight with immorality

594
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,600
will scandalize you yeah what's the matter with that by giving this country over to them

595
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,120
what's had no hand in the fighting for it why because they come off a boat crawling

596
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,860
with lice and begging you for soup oh my anyway

597
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:21,240
and then i heard them nailing shut the door into that fearful tower a pounding came from the

598
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,540
barber hearing that noise i stared into my

599
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:34,120
children's faces not speaking to them beside me i was turned to stone so hard i could not weep

600
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,540
the children wept

601
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:47,780
and my little anselma peering at me inquired father what ails you

602
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:55,400
and still i did not cry nor did i answer all that day and night

603
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:02,840
until the next sun dawned stay tuned for an urgent public safety message from fema

604
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,500
pets are not allowed into emergency shelters this has been a public service message from fema

610
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,860

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


636
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


637
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


638
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


639
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


640
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


641
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


642
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,060


643
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:55,600

down

653
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,020
in

654
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,020


655
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,480
Brotherhood from sea to shining sea

656
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,500
Hi kids, this is Fishbone Fred.

657
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,920
We live in America, the land of the free,

658
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,240
but that doesn't mean that we're free to do anything we want.

659
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,080
We all have rules to live by.

660
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,020
Listen closely to these safety rules I'm going to sing about

661
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,580
so you can live safely in our land of the free.

662
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,540
The songs you're about to hear will help keep you safe

663
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,700
by giving you knowledge to spot dangerous situations

664
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,880
and teach you where to turn for help.

665
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,360
America, America

666
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:07,900
From sea to shining sea

667
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,720
This is a public service message from FEMA.

668
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,700
I'd be a doggo.

669
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,800
Yeah, that's what you'd think.

670
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,900
Wednesday was

671
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,680
Wednesday was

672
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:22,680


673
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,200
Thursday

674
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,960
is also safe

675
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,200
Remember that stuff we used to eat a long time ago?

676
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,960
Oh, I don't know, man.

677
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,780
What'd they used to call it?

678
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,380
What did they call it?

679
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,460
I don't know.

680
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,280
Oh, yes, I know.

681
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,720
Food.

682
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,700
Do you like oysters?

683
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,240
What the hell are you talking about?

684
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,440
No, that's food for four.

685
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,680
This must be Thursday.

686
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,820
I never could get the hang of Thursdays.

687
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,340
On this particular Thursday,

688
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,520
things were moving quietly through the ionosphere

689
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,920
many miles above the surface of the planet.

690
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,220
That, uh, anybody who...

691
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,740
Great one.

692
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Who lies disdainful?

693
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,280
And scowling.

694
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,820
Seeming to pay no heed.

695
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,740
President of an Eastern land syndicate.

696
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,520
It's great.

697
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,180
Just great.

698
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,940
A couple of million dollars in oil under that lake

699
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,120
and you stand by and let your stupid brother raise fish in it.

700
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,580
We all know this is an agonizing time for the people of the Gulf Coast.

701
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,180
Yeah.

702
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Boy, I think they really miscalculated.

703
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,180
So word for word my master spoke.

704
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,920
And I asked him for the food to fill the appetite with these words in his spine.

705
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,960
And of course, it answered,

706
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,680
God the Creator has by his mercy made me such that I cannot make you suffer.

707
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:52,680


708
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:52,680


709
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,900
that I cannot feel what you suffer.

710
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,640
None of this fire assails me.

711
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,220
Probably not much of it.

712
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,180
Why can't you be a little more supportive?

713
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,320
Because I don't care, okay?

714
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,120
I can't make an interest in this,

715
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,060
and I'm an expert at making an interest in your kooky project.

716
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,520
What kooky project?

717
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,060
You know, the first date thing.

718
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,600
Oh, this is an outrage!

719
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,360
Truly cruel you are.

720
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,140
Uh, that's reality.

721
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,420
George sneered and attempted bravery.

722
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,680
And if not now, then when do you shed a tear?

723
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,600
The children wept.

724
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,160
I would have done everything in my power to kill the American people.

725
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,740
I thought he was going to die laughing.

726
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,880
And you heard what we have been hearing for 15 months.

727
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,600
Now you know what we're up against.

728
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,200
But you tell me over and over and over again,

729
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,680
my friend,

730
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,400
how you do.

731
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,400
I don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

732
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,900
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?

733
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,600
Can't you feel the fears I'm feeling today?

734
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,440
If the button is pushed, there's no running away.

735
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,640
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave.

736
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,120
Take a look around you, boys.

737
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,760
It's bound to scare you, boy.

738
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,940
And you tell me over and over and over again,

739
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,620
my friend,

740
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,240
how you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

741
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,120
The issue isn't whether you're paranoid, Lenny.

742
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,880
The issue is whether you're paranoid enough.

743
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,320
Huh?

744
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,480
Hey, nothing means nothing, man.

745
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:47,980
You know that.

746
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,220
Look around.

747
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,480
The whole planet's in total chaos.

748
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,960
The day of reckoning is upon us.

749
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,560
You gotta get what you can, while you can,

750
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,880
because some few curtain come put a 22

751
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,820
in the back of your head any second.

752
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,200
Meanwhile...

753
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,060
Take your glasses off.

754
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,020
Oh, no, you haven't.

755
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,160
How do you like that quick thing?

756
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,860
You're on her side now for all I've done for you.

757
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,760
Who the hell's one of you done for me?

758
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,080
I warned you.

759
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,620
I didn't vote for Bush.

760
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,900
Well, I'm not...

761
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,940
I'd be grateful for that.

762
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,720
Oh, I'm true.

763
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,420
We are getting nothing back here what you deserve.

764
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,940
And one of the girls a dick goes to death.

765
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,720
I hate you.

766
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,560
I hate you.

767
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,240
I hate you.

768
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
I hate you.

769
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,920
I hate everybody.

770
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,540
I hate you.

771
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,120
And I can't emphasize it enough, man.

772
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,140
This is crazy.

773
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,360
I've got 15 to 20,000 people over at the convention center.

774
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
It's bursting at the seams.

775
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,260
We...

776
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,860
It's...

777
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,800
It's awful down here, man.

778
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
Anxious to learn what their condition was,

779
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,260
we populate a fortress so guarded.

780
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,960
I cast my eye around as soon as I was there.

781
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,220
And saw a great plain filled with woe and torment.

782
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,060
Sounds of woe so great,

783
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,660
those within surely suffered horrible pain.

784
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Master, I said,

785
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,060
who are these people that are shut and separated

786
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,780
within these coffins of stone,

787
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,100
making their sounds anguished from inside?

788
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,800
He answered,

789
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,900
know much about purgatory.

790
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,780
What?

791
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,580
It's a place between heaven and hell

792
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,100
where those who are not purgatory are.

793
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,920
Where those who are left behind,

794
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,700
unable to get into heaven,

795
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,440
continue to suffer.

796
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,980
A place of struggle and pain.

797
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,940
In other words,

798
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,000
the world that we're in now.

799
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,540
Wow.

800
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,680
That's it?

801
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,740
There are 30,000 inside this sphere alone.

802
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,480
Open it up and they start to replicate.

803
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,320
I was raised in a very similar establishment myself.

804
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,940
Now everything you see belongs to me,

805
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,060
for one degree or another.

806
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,860
The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in paradise,

807
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,540
the sailor dives and gym mills and blind tigers on the waterfront,

808
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,280
the anglers and amusers,

809
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,680
the sheehees and the chinks.

810
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,740
Everybody owes, everybody pays, because...

811
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:57,860
What?

812
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,240
That's how you stand up against the rising of the tide.

813
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,640
That right boy is a pair of the thread.

814
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
That's bulls**t, man.

815
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,160
You can't scare colored peoples no more.

816
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,660
Yeah!

817
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,340
Times changing.

818
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,660
Colored peoples took enough horse s**t already.

819
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,720
You ain't pounding no more on.

820
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,460
These people, you know, who have been called refugees,

821
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,000
on TV are not refugees.

822
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,160
They're Louisianians, they're Americans of cities.

823
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,800
They're American citizens.

824
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,740
And it's gonna require American response.

825
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,520
It's gonna require the federal government and the American people

826
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,280
to step up to the plate and allocate resources to do this.

827
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,860
Louisiana isn't a state in isolation.

828
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,880
The last time I checked, we were partied.

829
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
It's all undertaken from you.

830
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,200
Get back here, you jackals!

831
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,380
It smells awful.

832
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,520
My stomach is beginning to churn.

833
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,020
You wanna go back on the street?

834
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,680
Thank God my mustache filters out some of the stench.

835
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,440
My olfactory is all over the place.

836
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,180
It's already beginning to send out stress signals.

837
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,020
This was not supposed to be a shelter.

838
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,260
This was the last thing we had.

839
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,800
We don't have anybody but the red front.

840
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,900
This is police.

841
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,520
We're running this whole operation.

842
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,840
What we got in here, they started treating us like we was inmates.

843
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,060
You know what I'm saying?

844
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:10,020
We got rifle guns, passing out food with guns on the side of them.

845
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,120
They had...

846
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,020
We trying to go through the pay phone.

847
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,660
They're telling us we can't use the pay phone.

848
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,680
We can go one by one.

849
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,000
You got about 50 million people in here and you're telling us one by one we gotta go to the pay phone.

850
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,880
It's kind of difficult with people who don't understand that there is no place to go.

851
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,080
They wanna go home, but there is no home for some of these people.

852
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,680
This is stagnation of the masses.

853
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,260
We got revenge no questions asked.

854
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,820
This is stagnation of the masses.

855
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,380
We got revenge no questions asked.

856
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,120
To pay out.

857
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,760
We got revenge no questions asked.

858
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,000
All these questions and aspirations.

859
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,020
God's increasing desperation.

860
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,660
In a breathing stigma of rock and roll.

861
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,940
Bramble of dead and faces of living souls.

862
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh vengeance of God, how much should you be feared by all of those who read what my eyes saw.

863
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,180
It was a great assemblage of naked souls in herds.

864
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,740
All of whom mourned most miserably.

865
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,660
No!

866
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,000
The old man and people living on your ceiling, and the people living underneath your feet.

867
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,200
People living to the left and to the right, they're all watching different television channels at the same time.

868
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,580
This tribune is breathing back.

869
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,900
Master, what people are these whose pain has overcome?

870
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,560
I will make brief answers.

871
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,760
They have no hope of death

872
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,160
For the blind life so abject

873
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,400
They envy any other fact

874
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,060
To all memory of them

875
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,320
The world is death

876
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,860
Mercy and justice disdain

877
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,960
Let us not speak of them

878
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,880
Look and pass on

879
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,360
It looks like

880
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,420
Tastes like

881
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,520
Smells like

882
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,600
Weathers like

883
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,880
It's my

884
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,960
It looks like

885
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,140
Tastes like

886
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,160
Smells like

887
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Weathers like

888
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,380
Hell time

889
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,660
You know it

890
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,660
Look and like

891
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,580
Tastes like

892
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,500
Smells like

893
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,920
Weathers like

894
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,440
Hell

895
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,620
Some lay upon the ground

896
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,240
Super

897
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,120
Some sat hunched up

898
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,200
While others walked restlessly about

899
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,020
But it was they

900
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,860
Who breathed

901
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,140
With joy

902
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,080
In the tunnels most loosened by pain

903
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,260
What do you mean you lost him?

904
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,440
Oh my god, that's his lucky red hat!

905
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,980
He's a bug!

906
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,420
My boy's a bug!

907
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,940
Damn you!

908
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,480
A bug!

909
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,900
If you need any help with the coffin, call me

910
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,100
FEMA will be ready for you when you're ready

911
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,720
I'm a knuckle, what a lie!

912
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,360
What do you really mean by that?

913
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,320
I don't know!

914
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,760
I don't know!

915
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,780
I don't know!

916
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,620
I don't know, I'm just a little confused!

917
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


918
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


919
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


920
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


921
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


922
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


923
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,420
Hey, is that your sister?

924
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,460
Ahhhh!

925
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,380
Wow!

926
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,860
Hey, you want to keep her in the league, man?

927
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,840
She's crazy!

928
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,060
She's crazy!

929
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,880
It's like a M of pain

930
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,040
But with more dirt and rain

931
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,820
Check out the tombstone bullet to the young blood stain

932
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,320
It's a shame but nobody ever loved me

933
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,880
Nobody ever cared for me

934
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:03,340
I said it looks like, tastes like, smells like, it feels like hell

935
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,300
What's happening?

936
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,280
What's happening?

937
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,260
The country stands with you.

938
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,200
What a bad joke.

939
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,500
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

940
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,640
You're wrong on that.

941
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,680
He was almost totally unaware of their presence.

942
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,260
Are black people invisible to you, you racist bastard?

943
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:41,880
Yes.

944
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,520
He looked straight through them.

945
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,200
They went unnoticed for all these years.

946
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,320
Gracious.

947
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,840
Hey, now you get me.

948
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,400
Whoa.

949
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,660
I see that you've wisely decided to hire a particularly terrifying negro

950
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,400
to protect you against your enraged and cheated customers.

951
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,960
What's this?

952
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,940
I see a mouthful and I can't hear a word you say.

953
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,380
Look at those dark glasses.

954
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,720
All his system is swimming in dope.

955
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,980
I wasn't swimming yesterday.

956
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,740
Diving from my gun.

957
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,640
I got a little water in my ear.

958
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,420
You, uh, you guys know I have no problem with black people, right?

959
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

961
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

962
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:15,840
Oh, I don't know.

963
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,260
You did say you hated Crookland.

964
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,300
Hey, you.

965
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,820
Get me out of here.

966
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,000
Get me the hell out of here.

967
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,540
Get me out of here.

968
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,180
Get the hell back in there.

969
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,220
Ah!

970
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,220


971
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,680
So well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?

972
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,440
What am I going to do about it?

973
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:45,340
Laments at first were so loud, resounding through starless air, I began to weep.

974
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,620
Strange language, horrible screams, words imbued with rage or despair.

975
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,600
Cries as of troubled sleep or of a tortured shrillness.

976
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,480
They rose in a coil of tumult.

977
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:06,160
Along with noises like the slap of beating hands, all fused in a ceaseless flail that

978
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,320
frenzies that dark and timeless air like sand in a world.

979
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,480
Trap!

980
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:12,960
I'm trapped!

981
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,420
Trap!

982
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:15,960
I'm trapped!

983
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,460
Trap!

984
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,840
I'm trapped!

985
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,180
Trap!

986
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,700
I'm trapped!

987
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,660
What did I do to deserve this?

988
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,940
Painted myself into a corner.

989
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,200
What did I do to deserve this?

990
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,000
Painted myself into a corner.

991
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,780
No windows, doors or a ladder.

992
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,160
Trap!

993
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,500
I'm trapped!

994
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:40,940
Trap!

995
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,520
I'm trapped!

996
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,760
Trap!

997
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,540
Trap like mice or rats.

998
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,700
Ah!

999
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,320
Ah!

1000
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,460
This is a public service message from FEMA.

1001
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,860
I hope the media isn't making it a bigger thing than perhaps it is.

1002
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,200
Every time they see something and they go out and say,

1003
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,200


1004
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,200


1005
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,200


1006
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,200
I'm glad they started filming it and that's what we get to see.

1007
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,740
I hope this isn't being created beyond what it really is.

1008
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,300
This is the FEMA Radio News Service.

1009
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,480
This is the FEMA Radio News Service.

1010
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,380
That's right. Don't hurt them right away.

1011
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,600
We'll let them think about it a little first.

1012
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,920
Trap!

1013
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,780
I'm leaving.

1014
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,120
Your henchman has terrified me completely.

1015
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,360
I shall never make the mistake of even passing by this vile pigsty.

1016
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,860
Oh no you won't!

1017
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,820
You're gonna stay here!

1018
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,320
I have no idea what they're doing, but I will tell you this.

1019
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,900
You know, God is looking down on all this.

1020
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,040
Ah, this sure ain't no good.

1021
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,800
And if they are not doing everything in their power to save people,

1022
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,960
they are gonna pay the price.

1023
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,040
Whatever it costs, we will pay.

1024
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,100
No, for that heavy period between the lines.

1025
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,100


1026
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,100


1027
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,020
We will die in the time it's found out.

1028
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,280
Because every day that we delay, people are dying.

1029
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,440
See, I believe out of this terrible evil can come some great good.

1030
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,700
And they're dying by the hundreds, I'm willing to bet you.

1031
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,200
Mourn for the dead, and forget when they hung up.

1032
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,860
It was the voice of a man to whom history will give enormous credit.

1033
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,580
That's good satire.

1034
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,540
God, we're lucky in this country.

1035
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,820
We've had so many blessings.

1036
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,080
President Nod.

1037
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,100
Away from me, loser.

1038
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,120
Meanwhile, far below the Superdoll,

1039
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,620
called hunger's tower after me, where yet others will be closed up.

1040
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,440
It smells terrible in here.

1041
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,260
Well, what do you expect?

1042
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:53,980
The human body, when confined, produces certain odors which we tend to forget in this age of deodorants and other perversions.

1043
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,000
I woke up before dawn, hearing the complaint of my own children,

1044
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,000
who were with me there.

1045
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,520
Funny, funny smell.

1046
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,160
Whimpering in their sleep, and asking for bread.

1047
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,680
That's what she said!

1048
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,040
You grieve already,

1049
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,280
for truly cruel you are.

1050
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,420
As you think of what my heart began to dread.

1051
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,500
The children,

1052
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,160
they were awake now.

1053
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,540
The hour when food was usually brought us drawing near.

1054
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,040
When one speaks,

1055
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,300
a small ray found its way into our prison,

1056
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,780
and I made out in their four faces the image of my own.

1057
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,040
I bit my hands for grief.

1058
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,840
When they saw that,

1059
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,980
they thought I did it for my hunger's pain,

1060
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,900
and suddenly rose,

1061
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,900
Father, our pain,

1062
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,400
they said, will lessen if you eat us.

1063
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,340
You are the one who clothes us in this wretched place.

1064
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,660
We plead for you to be the one

1065
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,120
who strips it away.

1066
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,600
I calmed myself to grieve them less.

1067
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,220
We stayed silent through that,

1068
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,100
and then the following day.

1069
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,600
Leave on Friday.

1070
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,040
I get down on my knees.

1071
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,840
And I pray,

1072
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,060
and I pray,

1073
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,800
showing up.

1074
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,140
Lord, I pray.

1075
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,020
I pray,

1076
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1077
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1078
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1079
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1080
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,020


1081
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,260
I pray,

1082
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:28,640


1083
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:29,820
I pray,

1084
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,020
Lord!

1085
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,100
You've been eating my legs!

1086
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,100
Yes, see, now this is why I didn't say anything.

1087
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,440
I knew you were going to get like this.

1088
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,920
What the hell is wrong with you?

1089
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,300
You've been eating me!

1090
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,440
Okay, you know what, let's just agree to disagree.

1091
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:56,540
degree. When we had reached the fourth day, Gado lay stretched at my feet where he had fallen down.

1092
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,220
Dying tickles.

1093
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:32,900
It is a field where Spidey used to play until on the warden number 42 was dumped in it one day.

1094
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:44,660
I think it's so funny. I laugh until I cry. Just me and I.

1095
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,940
But we'll need some liquid persuasion.

1096
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,180
Do a puppy cook. I never. I never eat canned food. Canned food is a perversion.

1097
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:12,880
I suspect that it is ultimately very damaging to the soul. Where'd you get it? Well, I acquired

1098
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,260
it legally. You can be sure of that. Oh, yeah, right. Come on. Who's this?

1099
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,860
I'm glad you get it. Don't make me come over there. This wretched bush.

1100
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:29,900
Snacks. Hey, is it just me or am I picking up some negative vibes out there?

1101
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,540
He didn't touch it, did he? No. Great. I did once and I could feel my intestine starting to atrophy.

1102
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,420
God's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding. Fine, I will.

1103
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:45,960
Father.

1104
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,160
Why don't you help me, said Luke, and died.

1105
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,820
We have a place for babies like you. The box.

1106
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:05,880
One by one I watched the others fall till all were dead. And I, already going blind,

1107
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:14,960
groped over my brood, calling to them, though I had watched them die. And then the hunger

1108
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,420
had more power.

1109
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1110
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1111
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1112
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1113
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1114
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1115
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1116
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1117
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1118
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1119
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1120
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1121
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,420


1122
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,360
Ah, and even sorrow had to over me.

1123
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,360
Ow!

1124
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,460
Die!

1125
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,300
It's too doggone late.

1126
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:38,220
Yeah, my butt's so mad, it feels like coagulating. I'm sitting here just contemplating. I can't

1127
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:46,720
twist the truth. It knows no regulation when human respect is disintegrating. And you tell me,

1128
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,580
that you're in pain.

1129
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,340
I bleep.

1130
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,380
I Yep, now you feel the pain when you think,

1131
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:55,380


1132
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:55,380


1133
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:55,460
Where we at?

1134
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,640
We on the prairie.

1135
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,940
That ain't our county.

1136
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,200
What's your Аnes, man?

1137
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:07,340
I've been looking for you you eitherлен air of business or schools.

1138
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,420
We're not talking about anything.

1139
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,640
All the mysenizers' business.

1140
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:16,560
I'm afraid I'm there.

1141
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,420
We're quick to say the least. All this truth period. We won't give you drama. We're running. I was in the PH from cow. A lot of cotton flies into my sewage간.

1142
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,200
Sounds like a...

1143
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,180
So do it.

1144
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,160
Either f*** or get off the pond.

1145
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,100
And f*** he did.

1146
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,460
Sitting in the morning sun.

1147
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:31,880
Where is the beast?

1148
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,240
I'll be sitting when the evening comes.

1149
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,080
There is nothing happening.

1150
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,040
Watching the ships rolling in.

1151
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,580
And these goddamn ships that are coming.

1152
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,520
Then I'll watch them roll away again.

1153
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,500
I don't see them.

1154
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,840
They're not here.

1155
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,420
Sitting on the dock of the bay.

1156
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,520
There is BS.

1157
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,100
Come on, man.

1158
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,900
Watching the tide roll away.

1159
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,260
And they're feeding the public a line of bull.

1160
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,840
Sitting on the dock of the bay.

1161
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,980
And it's spinning.

1162
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,700
Wasting time.

1163
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,600
And people are dying down here.

1164
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,480
I left my home in Georgia.

1165
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,320
I am just...

1166
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,240
I'm at the point now where it don't matter.

1167
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,420
Nothing to feel for.

1168
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,580
People are dying.

1169
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,580
Look like nothing's gonna come my way.

1170
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,520
They don't have homes.

1171
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,720
They don't have jobs.

1172
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,200
Sitting on the dock of the bay.

1173
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,020
The governor's problem?

1174
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,900
I don't know whether it's the president's problem.

1175
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,840
Watching the tide roll away.

1176
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,220
But somebody needs to get their ass on a plane.

1177
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,760
Sitting on the dock of the bay.

1178
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,040
And figure this out.

1179
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,220
Wasting time.

1180
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,140
Right now.

1181
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,520
Lickety's Quick.

1182
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,080
You have been listening to Hour of Slack number 1030.

1183
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:56,260
Which this particular time was really a two-month-old Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

1184
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,200
By Reverend Susie the Flusy on Atlanta's WREK.

1185
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:07,480
Which is always on and streaming from WREK.org.

1186
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,800
For morons of the Church of the Subgenius.

1187
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,720
