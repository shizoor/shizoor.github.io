1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:11,520
Okay, now, show begins when base show time reaches the main show time, in case of the base show time or the stop show time.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,440
And when the second show time reaches the... wait a minute, wait, that's this switch here. Okay, I think we're ready to go.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,220
Let's go!

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,980
Let's go!

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,220
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of...

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,140
What?

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,140
Ah, so nice out here in the little studio.

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,080
But that's a very funny reading on the scope. It's turbulent, it looks like a...

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,120
Anything wrong, Bobby?

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,180
It's spiral. What is that? You can identify it.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,340
It's a local control panel sending out the wrong image to the show here.

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,880
Can we correct it for the...

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,220
Sure.

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,840
Long distance?

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,240
We've got to beef the energy up. You see, the entire show deadline caught me napping.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,060
All right, we'll read it on the e-scope here.

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,540
Perfect concentration.

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,300
No distractions.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,060
No anxiety.

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,860
No fear.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:28,880


22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,760
Greetings, my friends.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,780
We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,980
And remember, my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,320
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,340
That is why you are here.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,680
So in this violent city, Philadelphia, full of derelicts and drugs, just realize we're going to take it from you right there on home turf.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,920
Which means that these tape recordings I'm making are for the sake of future history.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,820
You're turning.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
Future history, you said.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
Future history.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,380
I don't mind rerunning old shows, because they're good.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:40,140
And they kind of go with the subgenius documentary movie that's out now on Amazon, YouTube, Roku, Voodoo Hulu, Netflix, etc., etc.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,740
Or about to be.

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,880
See subgenius.com for details.

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,920
But I wish I didn't have to resort to reruns so many shows in a row.

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,860
You wouldn't think that sitting at a desk editing sound with a keyboard and mouse would be so easy.

38
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:58,860


39
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,220
You'd think that sitting at a desk editing sound would be so easy.

40
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,820
And it wouldn't.

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,480
Unless said back was injured and compromised to begin with.

42
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,960
By arthritis, in this case.

43
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:18,860
I've found in myself that, by Jove, I'm going to do only the bare necessities until the arbitrary date of November 10th.

44
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,880
Just the bare necessities.

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Like filling salvation orders and processing reruns.

46
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,640
That requires plenty.

47
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,240
And I'm going to do it as much desk time as it is.

48
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,220
The rest of the time, I'm living a dog's life.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,840
Literally.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,260
With my two dogs.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,680
Which is actually really slackful.

52
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,400
Because dogs sleep for 18 hours a day.

53
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,120
That poor Princess Wee is having to do all the stooping and toting.

54
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,760
For now.

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,960
I'll heal up.

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,260
But in the meantime, here's hour of slack number 65.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,860
Digitized from the master tape from late 1980.

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,900
1986.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,520
There's a note on the label that says, quote, good typical show, unquote.

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,880
I may remove some bits that were used in previous recent shows made from even older reruns.

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,980
These old shows, like the movie, are a real gas for me personally.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,540
Because I was in the room when a whole lot of these events were recorded.

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,100
And they feature some of my oldest closest friends.

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,320
Most of whom are, strangely enough, still alive.

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,360
Praise Bob.

66
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,580
The world grows ever stranger.

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,820
And our traditional values seem to lose their meaning.

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,920
Thousands of Americans have rushed into the arms of bizarre religious cults to find a sense of spiritual security.

69
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,100
Perhaps the strangest of these cults is a little known group called the Church of the Sub-Genealogy.

70
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,760
It began in the heart of the Bible Belt in Dallas, Texas.

71
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,720
But its membership is spreading across the nation.

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:15,740
We at What's Up America, though not given to making predictions, feel that the Church of the Sub-Genius is surely the church of the future.

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,320
Or at least what's left of it.

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,280
We want God! We want God! We want God!

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,860
That's right.

76
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,260
Doug and his friends sell their particular brand of comedy.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,980
In the form of pamphlets and magazines to anyone who has a buck or two.

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,200
The faithful.

79
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,040
When you first look at it, some people go, oh, I get it.

80
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,540
This is a take-off on weird cults and conspiracies and poops in general.

81
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:51,480
Then they look a little bit deeper and if they're really an attuned sort of person, then they realize, oh, I get it.

82
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,600
This really is a weird cult with cosmic wisdom and dogma.

83
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,240
But I've been reading all my way through it.

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,480
And I've been reading it for a while.

85
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:08,080
And that's when they're, usually when they write their first check to the Sub-Genius Foundation, that's when their luck begins to change, their finances improve and that kind of thing.

86
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,800
That's my friend, and he's leading me somewhere.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,100
Oh, yes, Bob.

88
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,920
And where is Bob leading them?

89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,900
Right now, it acts like it's going to make me weird.

90
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,220
Doug's been standing out in the sun for a while.

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,220


92
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm going to be a marvelous time for people to put their hands on the radio.

93
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,480
Or if you have a stereo.

94
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,260
Ah, yes.

95
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,600
If you have a stereo, you could go out and put your hands on maybe one speaker.

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,960
Lay your hands down.

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,640
Lay your old lady, put it on another speaker.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,940
On that radio or that tape recorder if you're listening.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Because that's where the real edge comes from.

100
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,860
Really, really sit close to it.

101
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,660
Feel those little molecules coming right out from Bob.

102
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,240
It's really marvelous.

103
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,380
Well, you're all done.

104
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,460
It's almost out of jack time.

105
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,220
And there's only one more.

106
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,960
There's only one Gary here.

107
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,540
It's a dramatic.

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,280
Two Dougs.

109
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,960
Eighteen dogs that everyone needs, right?

110
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,880
And the show with its own tuned out generation.

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,940
Yes, they're here too.

112
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,360
What's going on here?

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,800
I don't know.

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,340
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

115
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,780
Well, let's hope for better flocking.

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
And there.

117
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,600
We're centered.

118
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,340
Oh, okay.

119
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,280
We're on lock.

120
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,140
Oh, okay.

121
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,740
We're all here.

122
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,820
We're all here.

123
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,200
We're all here.

124
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,520
We're all here.

125
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,800
We're all here.

126
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,220
We're all here.

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,080
There's got to be something we can do.

128
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,380
Now someone figure out what we're supposed to do.

129
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
On an interview show.

130
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,480
Hey, I don't want to listen to a recording.

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't want to talk to somebody who's needed onions in the show.

132
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,240
Well there once was a man.

133
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,020
The world's greatest salesman.

134
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,440
And he had two thousand plans.

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,200
To give us that big of a deal.

136
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,200


137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,200


138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,920
I am on my feet

139
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,740
I am on my feet

140
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,420
He's gone

141
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,160
A martyr for the cause

142
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,420
For the fall

143
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,700
And he's coming again

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,100
Who knew that the first shot

145
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,920
Was gonna be the last shot

146
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,280
But he's got a hard drive

147
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,480
The gas won't go through the night

148
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,920
And although he may be hurt

149
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,300
He's gonna sweat

150
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,220
And it's coming again

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,360
He can save us from the many in black

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,800
With just a shot from his mighty side

153
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
If only he could make it sound

154
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,560
From the land of the dead

155
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,960
But until that happy day

156
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,680
We can only drink and say

157
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,720
For this my Lord

158
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,640
And he's coming again

159
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,780
I know he can make it

160
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,920
With a hit we can take it

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,100
We'll lose a piece of our lives

162
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,300
And sue the big boys and the whims

163
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,720
Until the day that he goes back

164
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
It'll be over

165
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,360
With no shot

166
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
For this my Lord

167
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,160
And he's coming again

168
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,780
For this my Lord

169
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,740
For this my Lord

170
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,040
For this my Lord

171
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,820
For this my Lord

172
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,340
And he's coming again

173
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,740
If we don't want the answers upon us

174
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,180
Then we need Bob to be honest

175
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,060
For this my Lord

176
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,520
For this my Lord

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,360
For this my Lord

178
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,380
And he's coming again

179
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,680
Great God Almighty

180
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,940
Great God Almighty

181
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,280
He's coming again

182
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:53,960
Whoo!

183
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,800
It's like Master Cleve in a spurious jive

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,780
You can win a date with this man

185
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,680
I'm gonna start all over again

186
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,260
I've got to start this damn show all over again

187
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,960
Hold on just a second

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,760
I can't leave this mobile studio out here with the lights on

189
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,800
There's always a light to the station

190
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,840
Light, light, light

191
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:21,920
Light, light, light

192
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:21,920


193
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,000
late late at least i've got this little portable thing so we can start the show whether i'm in the

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,720
studio or not and uh here we have the uh here we are finally in the uh canoen studios as you can

195
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,880
see oh oh the guard dog's trying to to get out um as you can see here i would be able to see if the

196
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,940
camera was working um this huge bank of uh cassette and reel-to-reel decks that are brought

197
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:05,040
in each night for the hour slack um by the the zombies by the very will o'dobbs um but uh tonight

198
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,360
i wanted to do a thing where i uh a little how-to bit you know a lot of people go how do you do this

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,660
hour slack thing man and uh

200
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,760
are going to make our Intro

201
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,960
we're going to show you these cidade

202
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,620
movies

203
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:24,760
we well

204
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:33,020
in the

205
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,060
we

206
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,580
in the

207
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,620
in

208
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,380
This booger has a 40,000K RAM and a 50,000K U.

209
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,580
Essentially, we just type in the script and fine-tune the machine

210
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,980
until we get the desired lifelike effect of human speech.

211
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,740
And we can program in the voices of any subgenius ranter.

212
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,320
We've got about 25 people in the files.

213
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,180
Well, we've been doing this for so long that we've built up quite a library of human-like vocal utterances.

214
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,220
And I will show you all...

215
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,560
Oh, shoot, we're going to have to tune this guy out here.

216
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,480
Hold on just a second.

217
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,580
And I'll show you how we do a sample hour of Slack show

218
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,580
without having to fly in people from all over the country.

219
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,920
Let's see.

220
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,140
We've got the...

221
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,880
First, we type in.

222
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,200
The message here on the computer.

223
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,040
I'll just show an example here.

224
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,060
And then we have to...

225
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,760
Hold on, I'm going to hurt your ears as I move you to the back of the computer

226
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,540
where you can hear the pre-processed sound.

227
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,200
This is what it sounds like before we actually add the human vocalizations.

228
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,960
This is the sole database, and we are converting it onto online data.

229
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,080
Convert to sub-entry mode.

230
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,520
And the database is transferred to the district memory by a general-plus computer.

231
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,800
And retrieve the line of radar by special-plus hardware.

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,480
These computers are the ones that can actually think.

233
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,540
So some experts still prefer to use the word mimic to human brain.

234
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,140
There. There we go.

235
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,720
Let's see.

236
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,160
See?

237
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,200
That part is easy.

238
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,460
That's the easy part.

239
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,420
Next, then, is select this little portion here.

240
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,160
And call that one Doug.

241
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,060
That will be the puzzling evidence voice.

242
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,660
And this section here will be the howl voice.

243
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,260
And now, see, we have these voices, digital samplings of these people's voices

244
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,460
in a huge database of syllables.

245
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,800
The tricky part is to...

246
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,280
Let's see.

247
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,060
We add here the human emphasis simulator.

248
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,940
With a pleasant and informative vocal tone.

249
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,900
And that'll take care of them.

250
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,980
See, now we add sound effects with fractalization.

251
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:32,060
And set the extemporaneous spinoff mode on at 75% speed.

252
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,060
Use the general knowledge access file for...

253
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:37,920
Now, this...

254
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,180
That is where we get the metaphorical bounce.

255
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,080
We call it.

256
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,420
So the voices appear to actually be interacting with the sound effects before they say it.

257
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,660
And so, let's...

258
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,140
Here, turn it on.

259
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,800
Listen to this.

260
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,840
You heard what it sounded like at first.

261
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,820
And here's the final version.

262
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,360
This is the show database.

263
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,820
And we're converting it onto online data.

264
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,000
Convote to sub-entry mode.

265
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,900
Then the database is transferred to the district memory by a general purpose computer.

266
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,060
And retrieved along a radar sweep line by...

267
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
Special purpose hardware.

268
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,640
These computers are the ones that can actually think.

269
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,280
Though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic.

270
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,520
The human brain.

271
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,580
That means this bird is in your brain.

272
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,200
Or, contrary-wise, that large brain is now inside a bird.

273
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,660
Some birds are little more than nature's flying brains.

274
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,500
Bowing me.

275
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
Bowing away.

276
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:50,480
Virtually nothing else exists in these organisms except a large brain and a pair of wings to steer it about through its environment.

277
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,580
How fun.

278
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:58,280
Natural selection has reduced this creature to its present-day grotesque appearance.

279
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:09,100
But a perfect example of adaptability and evolutionary speciation in the marvelous Darwinian tapestry we call life.

280
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,140
Awesome.

281
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,940
Total

282
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,100
We get the brakes and I stab

283
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,080
God is always superstar.

284
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,660
Now what would you like?

285
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,700
Or a 72ullenbagai

286
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:39,700


287
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:39,760
For some reason here, I want to watch the FJ yangal quer iker

288
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,060
like a pianist

289
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,060


290
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,060
You just heard from Puzzling Evidence,

291
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:55,320
and this garage here is the Tri-Centennial Drag by Patrick Vian.

292
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,640
Thanks to Doug Vinsel out there, our only listener in Nebraska.

293
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,020
Nebraska.

294
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,620
Nebraska.

295
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,780
Nebraska.

296
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,040
Oh, boy.

297
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,480
Well, that's life in America with the Tri-Centennial Drag, Patrick Vian,

298
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,860
whoever that is.

299
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,360
Yes, yes, yes.

300
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,520
Sirens, emergency sirens and parades.

301
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,620
Only cost $1,000.

302
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,620


303
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,000
Only cost $5 per second to live in America.

304
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,820
Captain Spock, side 8453.

305
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,980
What?

306
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,220
Don't you grab your next time.

307
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,940
Are you going to ask us for guys?

308
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,040
Well, we don't want to go that direction, man.

309
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,800
Let's, uh...

310
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,080
The following tape,

311
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,080
Doctors for Wotan compilation album number 2,

312
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,780
is copyright 1981 by the Subgenius Foundation.

313
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,320
For the best quality music, visit the link in the description.

314
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,640
I'm out of tape.

315
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,940
I'm out of tape.

316
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,700
I'm out of tape.

317
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm out of tape.

318
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,520
This has been, Puzzling Evidence, tape number 137.

319
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,860
The Momentary Relief Facility Answering System.

321
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,980
A delusion of opco.

322
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,260
We can help you out.

323
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,460
We can help you out.

324
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,460
If y'all ever wondered what a Doctors for Wotan album sounded like,

325
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,040
that's what you're listening to.

326
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,980
This is the end of Doctors for Wotan for tonight.

327
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,060
We're glad you came tonight, and we really hope you enjoyed the show.

328
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,500
Come back next week and bring all your friends

329
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,160
and bring lots of money with you because we're going to have lots of drugs,

330
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,280
and we're going to have lots of subgenius paraphernalia to sell you.

331
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,640
We've got T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons, everything you can think of.

332
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,600
Anything you want to spend your money on, we've got it.

333
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,140
It's got Bob's face on it, so send your money right now.

334
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,500
And anything with Bob's face on it, we know you want

335
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,560
because you want to put it to your collection.

336
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
You know you're going to be wanting so much money someday,

337
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,660
and you really want to add to everything.

338
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,400
You've seen how the collector's out of status might be having some money.

339
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,580
And if you send your money now,

340
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:05,200
we'll give you lifetime honorary overman status for only $1,000 today.

341
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,780
So, really, that's a bargain at half the price.

342
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,960
And I want you to know, you know, even if you wanted to pay $500, it would be really good.

343
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
But, if you want to...

344
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,740
.

345
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:15,740


346
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,300
.

347
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,800
.

348
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,640
.

349
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,000
.

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,460
.

351
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,600
.

352
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,600


353
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,420
.

354
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,920
.

355
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,780
.

356
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,000
.

357
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,060
Drs. for Wotan was the band that Philo and Drs. for Bob and I formed.

358
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,180
At first, we only used children's toy instruments.

359
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,480
That was our rules for play.

360
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,800
It later evolved into, after Philo left town,

361
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,260
. . .

362
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,620
for Dinosaurs started up, which was Butt Naked's anti-music doctor band.

363
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,520
Listen to that.

364
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,800
The Wonderful Den.

365
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,320
Like a million tormented souls in hell, dear friends.

366
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,840
We were really mad when we first heard The Residence.

367
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,240
The Residence.

368
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,740
Remember, Wilbur, I got this call from you.

369
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,660
We often find that we're able to, once they join up,

370
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,560
we're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

371
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,660
change their diet, start feeding them propaganda,

372
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,400
repeating the same thing over and over again until they forget who they are

373
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,220
and start responding only to our dogma.

374
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,580
Marvelous.

375
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,120
The smell of success is never too sweet.

376
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,940
I think we're being sold a bill.

377
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,820
Big bill of good.

378
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,520
Oh, yes.

379
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,420
Odin.

380
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,240
Oh, Odin.

381
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,140
Yah.

382
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,040
Oh.

383
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:16,560
Oh.

384
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,720
Yah.

385
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,560
I was then told by this man to play this music on a piano

386
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,880
and bring it to the attention of the people here on Earth.

387
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,260
I never before knew how to play the piano

388
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,700
and yet it seems that some strange force guides my fingers

389
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,980
to play the music that I heard in the cavern.

390
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,540
And that's how a doctor band went, right?

391
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,380
What is that noise?

392
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,000
It's anti-music.

393
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,860
Really?

394
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,580
I'm going to end up at these doctors for low-tan things.

395
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,580
God, man.

396
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,060
I hate this.

397
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,160
On an interview show.

398
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,500
Hey, I don't want to listen to a recording.

399
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,640
I want to talk to somebody who's doing an onion show.

400
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,700
Who am I speaking to?

401
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,800
Am I speaking to another TV recording, or am I speaking to the real McCormick?

402
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,420
Hello?

403
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:15,900
Hello?

404
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,180
Hello?

405
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,260
Am I talking to a tape-recorded voice, or am I talking to a real flesh-and-blood-breathing human being?

406
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,120
Yes, you are.

407
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,880
Are you talking to a recording of yourself?

408
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,280
This is me?

409
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,020
Yes.

410
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,080
We're all you.

411
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,580
I never sound like this.

412
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,000
I am.

413
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,800
You are asleep.

414
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,020
But I'm using the puzzling evidence voice because it saves on batteries while I think with your brain.

415
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,840
Well, I've seen that so-called puzzling evidence before, and it may be puzzling where it comes from,

416
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,400
but as far as I'm concerned, it's just a lot of the same hoopla.

417
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,260
I don't know if they've been feeding us all these years.

418
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,780
I agree.

419
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
The philosophy of the church is all the same.

420
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,440
Somebody ought to do something about this business before it gets completely out of hand.

421
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,300
Well, you did something. You bought a radio.

422
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,800
Yes, I...

423
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,460
It's so hard to tell which is real and which is false here at the studio. I know.

424
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,080
Well, that kind of thing doesn't bother me. What I want to know is, when I talk to somebody, is he real when I'm talking to him?

425
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,820
Only when you're talking to him is he real. When he tries to answer, he becomes tape again.

426
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,820
You must be in the Twilight Zone, or the listener zone.

427
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,340
I'm just trying to get a better reception here, but, uh...

428
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,760
It's a little late for that, don't you think?

429
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,780
Well, that's a little bit better, but it's still nothing to write home about.

430
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,600
I've been trying to fix this TV machine for the past half hour, and I can't get a better reception.

431
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,520
I'm hoping you won't write home about this.

432
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,000
It's too late. The weather is already getting late.

433
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,480
I understand. Electronic transmissions and the speed at which our world moves.

434
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,080
Well, I'm sorry to tell you, then, but your whole family has been destroyed, and now you're...

435
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,460
Oh, Joel!

436
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,560
Yes, we had to intercept that message on the way there, and this was the only way.

437
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,660
Yes, well, I think it's about time that we discontinue this conversation.

438
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:01,140
I know what I'm being made a fool of, and I, for one, don't intend to stand for it one more time.

439
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,960
Just tune me out. Me neither.

440
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,080
That's the way you're going to go about it. I suppose that's all that can be said.

441
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,940
And how many dinosaurs did he represent in those thoughts tonight?

442
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,760
Yes!

443
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,460
For those who understand implicitly the confusion...

444
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,360
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

445
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,980
The yes involved in the show.

446
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh, my God. Is this for real?

447
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:31,220
No, no, no. This is just a tape. Relax. It is not the day before or the week between. It's just the show.

448
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,700
Yes. Yes.

449
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,260
If we could get back to Bob, I think...

450
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,620
Oh, Bob.

451
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,720
Bob is the more important...

452
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,520
I tend to forget that so many people are still unsaved, and still don't even know who they are.

453
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:43,520


454
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,000
who have never heard the first mention of the divine word of Bob.

455
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,700
All right.

456
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,420
Bob was born, I guess we're not sure of his age.

457
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,140
He's as old as the mountains and yet as young as the hills.

458
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,340
River deep and mountain high.

459
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,660
Yeah.

460
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,980
Bob was born with a gift for sails, a mystic sails ability,

461
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,880
and has always had an intuitive grasp on that essence of relaxation we call slack.

462
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,180
But at the age of six, Bob was a millionaire.

463
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,860
He sold condoms to high school students.

464
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:29,440
He was an alcoholic at the age of eight, lost everything, and then built it back up again.

465
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,120
He's been in the shoes of the prisoner.

466
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,460
He's been in the shoes of the junkie, the drug addict, and the politician.

467
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,120
The adulterer.

468
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah.

469
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,780
He's definitely been in the shoes of the adulterer.

470
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,340
We're constantly being barraged by,

471
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,680
people threatening to sue us, claiming that they're bastard sons of Bob.

472
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,720
Fraternity suits against the church, huh?

473
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,020
Right.

474
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,380
Well, against Bob, not against the church or the foundation,

475
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,780
but against Bob, his holy self.

476
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,840
His holy bad self.

477
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,460
Yeah, there's a good Bob and there's a bad Bob.

478
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,820
That's an important thing to remember.

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,220
People mindlessly follow Bob at times without realizing that they're opening themselves up to forces

480
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,940
that they may not have complete control over.

481
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,700
So, right in your own home.

482
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:15,700


483
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,540
Right in your own home.

484
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,500
And now!

485
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,300
.

486
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,660
Now you can have.

487
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,880
Now you can have.

488
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,820
Now you can have this amazing new symphony.

489
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,860
.

490
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,340
You cannot! You cannot!

491
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:41,820
.

492
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,340
.

493
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,380
To create a mighty symphony of prosperity.

494
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,420


495
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,760
Oh, prosperity, dear friends.

496
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,120
That's, uh, what is this?

497
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,620
I'll have to shut it off to check it.

498
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,520
A snake oil symphony by Daniel Stevens Cra...

499
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,140
Steven Crafts.

500
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,780
Daniel Steven Crafts.

501
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,840
And I don't think you can get that one on record either.

502
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,140
I think it's just a tape.

503
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,320
.

504
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,720
.

505
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:11,720


506
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:11,720


507
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,200
.

508
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:16,920
.

509
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:16,920


510
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:16,920


511
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,440
.

512
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:24,840
.

513
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,160
.

514
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,240
.

515
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,260
.

516
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,280
.

517
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,300
.

518
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,380
.

519
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:39,720
. . . .

520
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:54,580
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

521
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,980
which destroyed the Earth and sparked the Great Migrations.

522
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,220
No longer in control, but fighting desperately to regain their lost empire.

523
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,160
House Wellman, headquartered on the man-made planet of Ease,

524
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,060
but with most other worlds partially dependent upon their scientific and technological works.

525
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,000
This is a civilization of secretive technocrats

526
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,100
who alone possess the profitable mechanics of time reversion.

527
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,400
House Drummond and the Paysar and Armat legions,

528
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,760
a culture based on the red planet Mars and dedicated to war and domination.

529
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:34,160
Baron Philo von Nege is the jaded dictator over an uncountable army of sadists,

530
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,060
all driven by a survival of the fittest philosophy

531
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,960
which gives them absolutely no compunction about meeting out the, quote, slaughter of justice.

532
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,180
Painful waking surgery performed by these priests

533
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,440
can render anyone a mindless zombie in their power.

534
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,380
The Benes.

535
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,140
Planet Tevisit.

536
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,940
Conspiracy of female witches dating back to pagan times.

537
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,880
Controlled by a siren-like, all-powerful female intelligence, or ooze essence.

538
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,300
Sex guild of house kickhavers.

539
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,640
Venus is inhabited by this race of sensualist entities.

540
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,940
Once human, they now are mutated creatures consisting primarily of a brain, mouth, and sexual organs.

541
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,160
Their powers of psychic infiltration threatens the downfall of the other planetary kingdoms.

542
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,400
The drones of this Venusian master race pilot space-bending interplanetary craft called heads,

543
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,560
upon which all others except House Wellman depend on space travel.

544
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,600
Myorites, an unpredictable sect of athlete sorcerers,

545
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,500
also called the Brothers of the Pipe, famed for their skills in the arts of love.

546
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,720
They have prehensile penises with a literal third eye on the tip.

547
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,060
Mercury is inhabited by titanic creatures called Halrabasaurs.

548
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,220
Mindless reptilian dragons that were once human fraught priests in distant antiquity,

549
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,820
but after the migrations gradually self-mutated into the monstrous heat monsters of today.

550
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:12,060
Their internal metabolism, however, is such that they excrete the fraught essence as a waste byproduct.

551
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,160
This is harvested at great risk by the Gabrogfranians,

552
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,440
a primitive but incredibly daring race of space nomads.

553
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,380
The Duncans, all cloned from the same era, are the only ones who have the ability to do so.

554
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,440
The same men for the last three thousand generations.

555
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:32,700
This small but powerful clique of born criminals are lords over a huge armed force of female Amazons,

556
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:40,220
feared for their quasi-magic sexual abilities, and also shunned for their legendary perversions.

557
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,560
Trevenists, descendants of the few remaining normal humans who managed to escape the Harvest,

558
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,980
a genocidal war shortly before the Great Cataclysm.

559
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
These are a set of creatures that have been killed by the Great Cataclysm.

560
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,580
They are sinister devil-worshippers who use black magic and conjure up demons called Jizai.

561
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,500
The story concerns a strange young man called Ba-Dods,

562
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,680
born a lowly Trevenist, but later adopted by a band of Gabrogfranian warriors,

563
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,960
and later sold to the Paysai Anarmat army.

564
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Almost retarded in his innocence, he seems to possess a vague memory of limitless past lives.

565
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,060
This gives him a power of clairvoyance and a form of luck-shell,

566
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,120
which brings him to the attention of the competing Great Houses.

567
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,020
He becomes a pawn in their vicious conflicts,

568
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,940
until he discovers a power undreamed of by the evil ones who seek to control him.

569
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,760
Dear friend,

570
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,140
If you will all leave the explains this evening,

571
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,280
do you plan on then leaving this beautiful studios from being forgotten

572
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,360
to the night of the Supreme,

573
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,360


574
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,360


575
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,120
law in which his wealth of curriculum once winded your free will to buy pot Tahiti

576
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,460
which is now bringing theổi

577
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,600
to the Ain Yinaあ

578
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,360
and avis

579
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,660
Library, 1515 Young in Dallas, will take place during regular library hours from January 12th

580
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:39,620
through February 22nd, 1987. The exhibit documents cases of censorship of books in libraries in the

581
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,860
last 10 years. Copies of the banned books will be available for everyone to page through at their

582
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:57,820
leisure. For more information, call 749-4100 to see those banned books, dear friends, and see what

583
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,420
was so ugly and scary and evil that they had to be taken from the shelves so that people couldn't

584
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,800
look at them. Evil, evil books like Huckleberry Finn, Catcher in the Rye. Oh, there's some nasty,

585
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,780
nasty stuff in there that we better be afraid of because Jesus might not like us reading it.

586
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:24,100
But how would we know Jesus isn't around anymore? We have to just look deep into our hearts and

587
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:34,440
yes, I think I hear him coming. Jesus, he's coming up from below. He should be coming from above. I

588
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,880
don't understand. This is...

589
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,660
With the key of imagination. Now, 25 years later, join us for the Twilight Zone Silver

590
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,680
Anniversary Special.

591
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,280
Also tonight, many merchants in Brooklyn suddenly find their goods piled up in the street and

592
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,980
explorers discover a tribe on the other side of the world its members thought they were the only people

593
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:02,080
on earth. Tom, we already have bacon for extra sizzle. First of all, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania has

594
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,160
one of the key telephone centers in the Northeast. You knock that out, you knock out all the telephones

595
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,380
in the Northeast. We've been having telephone blackouts all over the country for the last

596
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,320
three months. They're going totally on public signs.

597
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,180
Yes, we're having a little difficulty with this line. One of our guests here made the suggestion. I think he's being a little

598
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,640
facetious, but I'm wondering what you thought about it.

599
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,820
He claims that maybe the...

600
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,640
Thanks for the introduction, Mr. Anderson. You can stay with us for right now.

601
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,820
Now, Doctor, I think we should return to the basic finances of the church and just who owns the church and what we can do with what's left of the church.

602
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,040
Right. Well, Ivan's staying no longer owns the church. Bob still has the foundation, but we've got papers on there.

603
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,260
All right. Hold on here. Hold on. Wait a minute. What we also can talk about, of course, is...

604
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,880
What we can do with the church now that what's left is still here and breathing.

605
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,620
Well, we can give it away or we can just let someone take the church.

606
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,020
See, what I think is the people don't realize that the church takes two rooms to keep and grow in your house.

607
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,700
At least two.

608
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,260
And the maintenance involved takes up most of the week anyway.

609
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,680
And it does not run on unleaded. I'm sorry.

610
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:04,800
So...

611
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
Made a big noise about wanting to know the truth.

612
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,460
I'd probably get in and say you want the church. If you don't have at least two good-sized rooms in your house...

613
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,080
Yes, at least two good-sized rooms and a lot of money.

614
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,740
And a lot of...

615
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,840
And neighbors that don't mind Wotan showing up in the middle of the night.

616
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,680
Right. And you need stamps and gummage.

617
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,140
Get the idea?

618
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,760
Or kill me! Or kill me! Now!

619
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,040
And the guy, he got to the point where the guy he was bothering pulled out a .32 and let him have it.

620
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,960
And at which point the bullet hit him square in the chest and went through his lung and came out his back.

621
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,720
But instead of falling on the ground, he walked back in the bar and ordered a drink.

622
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,060
And he got the idea.

623
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,380
Or kill me!

624
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,700
Now! Now!

625
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,560
Let's have a body count!

626
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,200
Let's have a body count!

627
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,720
None dead! It's a miracle! Friends, it's a miracle!

628
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:06,640
Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

629
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,220
Bob!

630
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm having a baby!

631
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,140
She's having a kid baby!

632
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,880
There's dollar bills in their mouth!

633
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,880
They're puking up dollar bills, doctor!

634
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,380
Where are those dollar bills coming from, doctor?

635
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,320
What's going on?

636
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,600
My key won't fit!

637
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,580
I lost my key!

638
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,660
My tire's flat!

639
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,040
My tire's flat!

640
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,680
Well, hello, cats and kitties out there in subgenius land.

641
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,640

643
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,180
Why don't you do the same, too?

644
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,100
Thanks, Bob.

645
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,020

a very difficult vasectomy, it seems,

696
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:11,720
because, well, the doctor said his vas deferens was elusive.

697
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,380
And I've heard the same thing from some of the other subgenius males

698
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,820
who've been fixed like this, and it makes us wonder.

699
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,660
You know, somebody ought to do a study on this,

700
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,220
a careful scientific study.

701
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,420
Do we Yetinsen, we descendants of the noble Himalayan Yeti,

702
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,700
is our vas deferens?

703
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,660
Is our vas deferens really that different from the humans?

704
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,220
Is this one way that we can, say, check a body

705
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,000
to see whether it was of human or subgenius origin?

706
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,840
Well, we'll see. We shall certainly see.

707
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,660
The vast difference, friends.

708
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,620
The vast deferens.

709
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,140
Stamps and gummage, yes.

710
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,460
Lots of stamps and gummage.

711
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,240
Sign here, please.

712
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,560
Okay.

713
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,500
Sign here.

714
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,060
I don't have any stamps and gummage.

715
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,440
Wait a minute.

716
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,100
Thank you very much.

717
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,180
The world is over now.

718
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,980
You can return to your van.

719
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,580
Wow!

720
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,640
We're trying.

721
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:17,740
Well...

722
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,540
We're not trying hard enough.

723
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,360
Send us more money.

724
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,600
Yeah, more money.

725
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,720
How much would you like?

726
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,460
Uh, well, $50,000, would you say that would do it?

727
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,500
Uh, check for the math.

728
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,700
All right, thank you.

729
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,440
You're welcome.

730
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,620
You can expect yours.

731
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,060
Go.

732
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,420
Put it on the automatic.

733
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,000
Willie Nelson.

734
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,700
Put it there.

735
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


736
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,640
The automatic Bob Nelson.

737
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:34,760
Turn myself on.

738
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,760
Yes, okay.

739
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,060
Where's my thesaurus?

740
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,320
Ricky, let's see.

741
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,160
Here, Bob, here's your hat.

742
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,080
Put this part on.

743
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,380
Here we go.

744
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,600
Now, get...

745
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,160
Drive this station down Shattuck Avenue.

746
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,580
We're gonna stop.

747
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,700
Ain't got no spare.

748
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,880
We haven't got a spare for this program.

749
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,840
We don't have a jack for this program.

750
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,300
We don't even have any hydraulic foil for this program.

751
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,160
We're just gonna drive until this program caves in.

752
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,060
Go and go.

753
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,380
Welcome.

754
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,080
I just wanted to say that Bob absolutely saved my life, and I'm so glad you're here.

755
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
And I'm pregnant with golden youth clout.

756
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,600
Hoped my baby would never need anything to hear.

757
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,720
Let me ask you something size, prepare yourself.

758
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,340
We're gonna do it again when we have time.

759
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,500
We're gonna get the 51s.

760
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:40,800
6, 5, 6, 5.

761
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,900
Go ahead.

762
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:41,240


763
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,140
Stop the car.

764
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,020
and subgeni.

765
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,240
And yes, I'm proud to say

766
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,820
that I'm a proudful bastard

767
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,180
compared to most of these pink boys,

768
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,260
and so should you,

769
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,700
the true mutants out there, also be.

770
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,280
What's ironic, friends,

771
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,280
is that the ones who most appreciate Slack,

772
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,900
us,

773
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,140
are actually the hardest workers.

774
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,060
And that sounds odd,

775
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,020
because, you know,

776
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,020
your true subgenius is into Slack,

777
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,700
but we are always game

778
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,760
to go the distance.

779
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,320
Whereas your pink boy,

780
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,720
they only care about money and status,

781
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,780
and generally, believe it or not,

782
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,640
are actually lazier than us,

783
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,220
in a certain way,

784
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,200
in the way that they're comfortable

785
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,040
with bland work and bland relaxation.

786
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,660
Their range of feeling, dear friends,

787
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,280
is limited.

788
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,620
And when they see either fun or anger

789
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,480
unleashed at a subgenius level,

790
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,020
it scares them to death.

791
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,960
That's why J.R. Bob Dobbs

792
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,280
said, and I paraphrase,

793
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,880
act like a dumbass

794
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,340
and they'll treat you like an equal.

795
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,620
They can't really understand Slack, friends,

796
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,020
because they also can't understand real work.

797
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,880
The only time they're called upon

798
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,020
to stretch their abilities

799
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,740
is when they're forced to work

800
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,920
with the subgenius.

801
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,080
Because the subgenius is always looking

802
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,620
for ways to improve things,

803
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,220
or, you know,

804
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,780
to somehow cut through the trivial crap

805
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,240
and add a bit of excitement,

806
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,940
if possible,

807
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,340
to anything in any way possible.

808
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,860
He is compelled, dear friends,

809
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,540
to customize the world around him.

810
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,800
Now, pigs can't learn the way we can.

811
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,000
They actually want to be told what to do

812
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,020
as a result,

813
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,820
but only by somebody with

814
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,440
quote,

815
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,160
authority,

816
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,320
unquote,

817
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,960
meaning, in their case,

818
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,380
somebody with more money or status than them.

819
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,280
Now, they're the ones that are compelled

820
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,780
to measure IQs,

821
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,980
but they really do so in monetary units,

822
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,480
and not in the depth of meaning

823
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,080
and fun and slack

824
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,600
and great squirts like we do.

825
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,240
So the idea of modifying the world around them

826
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,260
is an alien concept to them.

827
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,900
Though they'll modify things

828
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,640
according to the plan of a rich subgenius,

829
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,460
but they'll never take such a thing upon themselves

830
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,120
because they fear responsibility.

831
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,340
Now, your subgenius will take the rap like a man,

832
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,960
but a pig will go to the,

833
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
trouble a joinin',

834
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,820
a lynch mob,

835
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,260
just to avoid admittin' that he might've goofed.

836
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,780
Now, where that becomes a bit dangerous

837
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,300
is when the safety of the entire planet is threatened,

838
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,720
such as it is now.

839
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,360
They can't feel responsibility for their own actions,

840
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,520
much less the planet,

841
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,220
so they call us kooks

842
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,060
if we dare to so much as cry out

843
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,580
about how bad things really are.

844
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,800
Now, your pink boy believes in positive thinking.

845
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,220
Ooh, positive thinking.

846
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:40,960
They don't.

847
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,760
They don't want to ask questions.

848
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,120
They don't want to face the possible problems.

849
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,480
And they get really upset, dear friends,

850
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,520
if you ask them to double-check something,

851
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,480
because that implies that they might be doing something wrong.

852
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,140
They call us paranoid.

853
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,100
And then when our dire predictions

854
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,880
and unheeded warnings come true,

855
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,380
oh, they very conveniently forget you ever said it.

856
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,560
And when you ask them to speak a little louder,

857
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,240
well, that's when they kind of mumble a little more softly,

858
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,400
because they live in fear, my friends,

859
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,940
in ulcer-ridden fear.

860
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,620
Fear of what others might think.

861
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,040
Now, subgeniuses are themselves into blowing things off.

862
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,740
Praise Bob.

863
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,300
But we do so before telling everybody we're going to do it.

864
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,060
With your pink,

865
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,640
well, they'll tell you they're going to do something first

866
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,860
and then blow it off.

867
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,480
And I hope some of the video disco folks are listening.

868
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,880
Now, I'm aware that even couched in polite language like this,

869
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,540
what I'm saying may sound unbelievably nasty and arrogant.

870
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,960
Once again, I'll reiterate,

871
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,880
that a subgenius can be dumb, very dumb.

872
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,880
But the ways we apply what little brains we have

873
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,620
is vastly more beneficial, friends,

874
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,300
than the jealous pursuits to which the terrified pink rabbit boy people

875
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,280
apply their boundless intelligence and sophistication.

876
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,540
So, your pinks are always good.

877
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,520
They're great at acting smart.

878
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,940
They can impeccably do things.

879
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,140
They can impeccably imitate styles that a subgenius would never bother with.

880
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,780
Pinkness especially lends itself to that grim, concerned, intellectual facade.

881
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,060
That's one of the easiest poses in the world, friend.

882
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,540
Let your rude, humorless behavior imply that you're brilliant

883
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,500
without ever actually doing anything to prove it.

884
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,400
And this works for them because their fellow pinks fall for it so easily.

885
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,760
Now, subgeniuses can be,

886
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,040
what are called geniuses.

887
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,140
Albert Einstein was undoubtedly a subgenius.

888
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,620
He could barely tie his shoes till he was ten.

889
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,000
The guys who invented nuclear power and the nuclear weapons were subgeniuses,

890
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,680
but the ones who deployed them were pinks.

891
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,260
And you notice that those subs took the blame willingly.

892
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:08,260
They were the biggest opponents to the bomb once they found out what the pink bureaucrats,

893
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:08,940
politicians,

894
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,460
and club owners had in mind for it.

895
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,640
How can I be so mean and vengeful, dear friends?

896
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,040
Well, it's my job to verbalize common subgenius feelings where possible,

897
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,980
and I'd rather pee off a bunch of pink boys

898
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,980
than let my less confident fellow subs go on feeling vaguely guilty

899
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,320
because they have the fairness to be a little unsure if maybe the pinks aren't right.

900
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,640
And I'm just reminding you, friends, they aren't.

901
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,880
There just happens to be more of them.

902
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,300
So the best way to look at them is as an unfortunate fact of life,

903
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,560
a force of nature like a drought.

904
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,260
You can't teach a pink boy to think.

905
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:54,900
My wife is a teacher, and she's been trying to do that for years to her utter frustration.

906
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,640
Personally, I feel like they're better swayed through entertainment.

907
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,200
Their lives are dedicated to imitating the characters they see on TV.

908
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,620
We can only try to feed them.

909
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:07,620


910
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:13,660
We can only feed these poor creatures new myths that will sink into their minds.

911
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,460
Not only is it a safer way to do it, but it's more effective and profitable.

912
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,080
Pinks worship entertainers, dear friends.

913
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,980
Their status system is remarkably easy to manipulate if you apply yourself to doing so.

914
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,420
The Subgenius Foundation, in the service of Bob, does this,

915
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,600
but only in an IFR game.

916
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,500
Because it's a little distasteful.

917
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,440
Because it's so easy, dear friends.

918
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,160
It's false slack.

919
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,320
And that's seductive.

920
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,980
Their idea of professionalism is to stick to what they know works.

921
00:53:54,340 --> 00:54:01,320
The subgenius idea of professionalism is to see what else might work.

922
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,940
Bold surrealists we are, dear friends.

923
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,060
Bold surrealists.

924
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:16,180
It could be a classic beautiful world of pure slack and hedonistic pleasures for all of us.

925
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,920
Instead, it's a jumbled mess of pink poop.

926
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,380
Let there be slack.

927
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:38,340
Just the way I did when I tried my first smoke.

928
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,940
I thought I'd seen everything.

929
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,440
We're stuck up here. We ain't moving.

930
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,300
It only seems that way. Matter of fact, we're traveling thousands of miles per hour.

931
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,680
Cut out your gyros.

932
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,820
Hey, but it's okay. Go ahead, Oit.

933
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,440
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

934
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,480
Okay.

935
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,160
Go ahead, Oit.

936
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,700
Okay.

937
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,340
The people of the world congratulate you for your epic making achievement.

938
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,220
Oh, thank you.

939
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,100
Good afternoon, dear.

940
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:09,380
You're welcome.

941
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,800
And well be for a couple more days.

942
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,840
It's nighttime here.

943
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,160
This is great and wonderful news for the people of the earth.

944
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,020
All right.

945
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,420
That's a standing rule for everybody.

946
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,320
Yes.

947
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,760
No beer, no babes, no baseball.

948
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,660
Yes.

949
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,280
Meanwhile, we go back to the ship and strip off everything we can.

950
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,220
What? Tell us that. We're stripped.

951
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,240
No. Anybody, anything in his pockets?

952
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,100
We're stripped. Absolutely.

953
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,420
Got it.

954
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,620
Are you all right?

955
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,140
Whoa. That was, oh, thanks to Gary Waller for that little piece there.

956
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,780
I'm from San Francisco, California, and we don't know how to kill presidents there.

957
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,180
We sure as got to kill Bob.

958
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,400
Those San Francisco guys.

959
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,140
You think you have his corpse here?

960
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,660
We think we have his corpse there.

961
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:06,720
We have definite proof that we have Bob's corpse still within Berkeley city limits.

962
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,040
I know you're used to Narnini, New New, Bob.

963
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,100
We have different deities in California.

964
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,760
We worship little green deities.

965
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,920
We worship little green deities.

966
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:42,240
We worship little green deities.

967
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,600
Several peace offers from Bob.

968
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,780

982
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,380
on the stage with your audience?

983
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,680
For instance,

984
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,540
you know, is it really

985
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,620
spoon bending and guitar bending

986
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,900
or is it a trick?

987
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,760
Just simply a

988
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,220
trick, a magician's

989
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,080
trick, props,

990
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,520
special effects.

991
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,860
Well, you know, we...

992
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,620
Where do you really claim to have superhuman

993
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,460
powers, like your fans say?

994
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,440
We invite those people to

995
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,600
totally open their minds

996
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,300
and to allow

997
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,020
themselves to experience

998
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,800
Open your minds, friends.

999
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,080
Open your minds

1000
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,120
like the swinging love corpses do.

1001
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,840
See where we are here.

1002
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,360
Yes, we're coming near

1003
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,080
the end of an hour, one

1004
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,120
hour of slack.

1005
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,360
Oh, yes, the sex pistols

1006
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,660
here.

1007
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,520
I guess that's Sid Vicious'

1008
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,260
version of My Way.

1009
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,560
I came in peace

1010
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,820
of winter and

1011
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,380
certain

1012
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,840
I live

1013
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,100
a life that's full

1014
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,180
of

1015
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,080
a voyage

1016
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,780
and every

1017
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,720
highway

1018
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,600
and more

1019
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,280
much more than

1020
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,020
this

1021
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,700
I will admire.

1022
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,780
I will admire.

1023
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,300
Regrets

1024
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,560
are better few

1025
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,460
but then again

1026
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,720
to give

1027
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,680
some rest

1028
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,180
to

1029
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,300
a debt

1030
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,260
for I had to do

1031
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,680
and so it

1032
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,180
proved

1033
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,280
that I'm not

1034
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,400
