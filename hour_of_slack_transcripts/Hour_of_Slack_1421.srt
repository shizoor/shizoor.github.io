1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello there!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Haha, flying saucer.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,780
Flying saucers.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,060
Now, am I crazy?

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,680
Yeah, something like that.

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,840
So I'm crazy? Yes!

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,620
Okay.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,280
I am crazy. Yeah.

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,960
Flying saucer.

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,000
Flying saucer.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,520
Flying saucer.

12
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,320
I thought I was going crazy!

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,820
Yeah, why not?

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,540
Okay.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,640
Within five years,

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,580
the United States, as we know it, will

17
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,960
cease to exist. We're living in

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,860
terrible, perilous,

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,940
chaotic times.

20
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,320
Praise the Lord.

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,840
And these times are not

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,460
going to get any better, my friend.

23
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,120
Amen. They're going to get worse

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,340
and worse.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,120
What love

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,000
you

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
can bring.

28
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,900
People from this

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,640
earth have already

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,420
seen some of their spacecraft,

31
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,660
which they call

32
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,680
flying saucers.

33
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,000
And other

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
flying objects which they

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,460
cannot describe.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,120
These objects

37
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,780
are real,

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,920
and are spacecraft.

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,140
Total collapse of world civilization.

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
July 5th,

41
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,620
1998, at 7am

42
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,900
to be exact, the men from Planet

43
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,860
X, as the news media will

44
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,740
call them, will arrive to

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,260
rupture the subgeniuses,

46
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,320
the true believer subgeniuses,

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,780
up into the escape

48
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,940
vessels of the sex goddesses.

49
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,820
Even to carry a few

50
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,060
fixed survivors of our doomed civilization

51
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,740
to a new life on

52
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,420
another world.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,820
It's let's have a party.

54
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,080
Battle of the

55
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,900
planets! Battle of the planets!

56
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,900
Is it time for that big operation?

57
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,360
And uh,

58
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,580
you know, even if X doesn't work out,

59
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,600
that will go for sex day!

60
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,140
We want you to have a dance

61
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,580
into the new century!

62
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,040
Screw into the new century!

63
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
Sleep and eat your

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,140
way into the new century!

65
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,560
And that the very, uh,

66
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,360
the very door of

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,160
the day of the wrath of God

68
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,440
is at hand! And that if you

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,000
plan to get saved,

70
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,040
you'd better do it now!

71
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,460
In this temple lodge of the church

72
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,200
of the subgenius of Little Rock, and

73
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,120
before we begin this sacred

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,420
spouting, I think that

75
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,580
we should all bow our heads

76
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,720
and let's all have a minute of noise.

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,680
AHHHHHH!

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,080


79
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,180
AHHHHHHHHHH!

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,600
AHHHHHHHHHH!

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,580
AHHHHHHHHHH!

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,960
AHHHHHHHHHH!

83
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,480
AHHHHHHHHHH!

84
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,200
AHHHHHHHHHH!

85
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,940
Okay, I know you all think, uh,

86
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,340
you want to know what's going on.

87
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,540
That's okay.

88
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,160
So I saw this thing coming...

89
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,680
So I saw this thing coming...

90
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,940
I saw this thing coming to me!

91
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,180
I saw this thing coming to me!

92
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,800
I didn't know what it was,

93
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,320
I didn't know what it was, but, uh,

94
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,300
it looked funny!

95
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,720
It looked funny!

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:12,940
It looked funny!

97
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,680
There were deceptions

98
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,200
which have surrounded our space program.

99
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,300
If this was indeed

100
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,980
an extraterrestrial spacecraft

101
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,080
with living occupants,

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,340
it must have been very disconcerting

103
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,040
for them to cross millions

104
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
of miles of space, only

105
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,060
to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

106
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,460
Ah, yes dear friends!

107
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,700
Your host and prayer partner,

108
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,340
Reverend Ivan Stang here,

109
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,640
and at this recording time,

110
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm driving through

111
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,360
Akron, Ohio,

112
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,820
in the pouring rain,

113
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,600
on the way back to

114
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,980
Wisteria Campground in Southern

115
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,000
Ohio for the start

116
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,720
of the Starwood Festival,

117
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,720
after having come

118
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,580
home from the

119
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,960
16X Day Festival.

120
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,560
Now, last weekend,

121
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,760
Dr. Hall and I came back to Cleveland

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
and did some radio

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,820
talking about the

124
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,120
wonders of 16X Day,

125
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,840
actually the 18th

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
X Day Drill,

127
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,460
and now

128
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,940
for this and future shows,

129
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,680
we're going back

130
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
to the start, before

131
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,780
16X Day, and we'll play

132
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,300
over the coming weeks,

133
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
the many wonderful

134
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,280
recordings that were made there,

135
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
bands and shows and ranting

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
and just

137
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,020
spouting

138
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,580
off stage,

139
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,860
behind the scenes,

140
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,860
in the pouring rain, spouting.

141
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
So we're going to start

142
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
with a show recorded by

143
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,740
Dr. Hall and myself,

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,740
Princess Wee and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

145
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,560
at WCSB Cleveland,

146
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
on June 30th,

147
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,780
before X Day happened.

148
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,580
That will

149
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,060
give me time to begin editing

150
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,460
and cleaning up all the

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
fabulous location recordings.

152
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,040
And so, here we are,

153
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,560
back in time, with

154
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,200
what turned out to be

155
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,440
hour of slack number

156
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,600
1421.

157
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,780
Praise Bob.

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Spacecraft entered the Moon's

159
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,700
gravitational field in the sixth

160
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,340
segment of the flight.

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,200
The gravity of the Moon is one-sixth

162
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,500
of that on Earth.

163
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,280
The orbit around the Moon

164
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,900
was flown 66 miles

165
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,320
above the Moon's surface,

166
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,300
at 6,000 miles an hour.

167
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,940
At 10 after 9,

168
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,400
the beeping began.

169
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,420
Went down to the

170
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,740
reserve fence, watched through

171
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,660
binoculars, and we did see this thing.

172
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,940
Now it's about the size

173
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,800
of the Moon, with a small

174
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,060
crescent at the bottom that's well lit

175
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,020
like starlight. The top is

176
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,040
a dark gray mass.

177
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,840
It came down through the trees, whatever

178
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,820
it was. Have you ever heard of one?

179
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,000
Have you ever been in

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,940
one? Have you ever seen

181
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,820
one? Have you, but television,

182
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,900
ever seen one? If you

183
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,860
haven't, it's the greatest sight this

184
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,640
side of Heaven.

185
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,160
Two months ago, the Observatory issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end.

186
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,120
Now that's the same story

187
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,060
the cult of the Book of Revelations had been

188
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,000
preaching. Now when a scientist

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,260
backs that up, it's news. Our conclusions

190
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,520
have nothing to do with the cult.

191
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,800
Well, today we deal with Bible

192
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,040
prophecy. But the Word of

193
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,000
God tells us we can expect

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
nothing but trouble and turmoil

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,820
in the Middle East until

196
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,880
our Lord returns to be

197
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
the Prince of Peace.

198
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,220
Bob?

199
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,160
It's been noticed.

200
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
Yes, dear

201
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
friends, when our Lord

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,900
returns to become the Prince

203
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,880
of Peace, and I think this might be him now.

204
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,980
Yes, here he comes. Hello?

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Hello? Lord? Hello? Is that

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,960
you? Oh. No, it's me. Is it the

207
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,120
Prince of Peace? It's Lonesome

208
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,380
Cowboy Dave.

209
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Or Swine Boy.

210
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,740
Swine Boy is neat.

211
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,380
The Lord of something.

212
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,020
The Lord of Swine.

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,040
Lord of Swine. Remember in the Lord of the

214
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Flies when they had that wild pig

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
head and they danced around it?

216
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, I just got

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,980
done a little bit of that myself.

218
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh, blasphemy.

219
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,160
We're gonna have a pig head to dance

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,880
around at Ex-Dagger Street.

221
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,100
That's right. The pig will be

222
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,940
killed and we will drink his blood.

223
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,060
What?

224
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,580
I thought we were just gonna eat of his flesh.

225
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,020
I didn't know we were gonna, like, have communion

226
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,880
that way. It's all in the, uh,

227
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,120
manual. Yeah, I thought

228
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,080
we were just gonna eat

229
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,140
his flesh. The manual has

230
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,840
just been published. In this way, he will

231
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,780
live again through

232
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,140
us. That happens

233
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,440
on July 4th. Make this world

234
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,180
what, uh, he would have wanted

235
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,580
it to be. Porcine transubstantiation.

236
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,200
Oh, Dave,

237
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,060
you'll be honored to know that

238
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,080
the pig this year has been named

239
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
Dave.

240
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,480
By some strange coincidence.

241
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,260
Well, I don't feel

242
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,720
affected by that, my friend.

243
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,340
I feel rather honored.

244
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,540
Yes, well, all will share

245
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,400
in Dave's bounty.

246
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,420
Except vegetarians,

247
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,560
if there are such benighted creatures.

248
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,600
And except Dave, unless somebody

249
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
shows up to give him a ride.

250
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,220
Hmm, that could be.

251
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,460
And he wouldn't

252
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,300
need a ride back, because we'll be

253
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,320
we'll have spaceships of our own.

254
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,020
Yes, they really cut the distance.

255
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,460
Or I'll be back in a crate full of packages.

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Hmm, but such

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,340
peanuts as, uh,

258
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,520
no one ever dreams of on this plane

259
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,440
of existence. Little bit of

260
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,320
jelly and little bit of toast and

261
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,580
mmm, mmm, you're out of this world.

262
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,220
Yes,

263
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,500
part of this nutritious breakfast.

264
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,320
The good packing peanuts are

265
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,360
edible, aren't they? Yes,

266
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,900
they're made of corn something.

267
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,500
Corn starch. They're made

268
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,680
of corn starch? The good ones.

269
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,320
If you, yeah, if you lick them,

270
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,460
they dissolve. But if you

271
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,140
you mean like ethically good or their

272
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,420
their taste? They taste like

273
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,240
cardboard, I can tell you that.

274
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,660
But, but they won't kill you.

275
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,100
Probably. So they just have a

276
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,420
high standard to high moral. They can pass through

277
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,620
your entrails.

278
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,740
And do little damage.

279
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,220
Unless you've got a tail or two?

280
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,820
A little pig tail.

281
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,380
That would have to be a whale of a tail.

282
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,540
Now, you know,

283
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,020
uh, we're not just

284
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,260
barbecuing the pig

285
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,320
and having turducken

286
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,020
inside the pig. I don't know if we have to tell

287
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,700
the radio audience everything,

288
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
reference day. Well, ideally

289
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,140
what we're hoping to have is

290
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,820
blue whale

291
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,460
elephant hippo

292
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,760
cow turducken

293
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,260
sparrow

294
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,880
mingbird

295
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,280
mesium. With, uh,

296
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
uh, century plant, uh,

297
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,620
and whooping grain

298
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,600
heart salad.

299
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,180
Well, that's just to go with the blue whale.

300
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,520
Oh. We only need one blue whale.

301
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,200
We're not gonna deplete the world.

302
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,420
I mean, there's at least five more of them left, right?

303
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,740
Yeah, well, this one is

304
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,360
Brombo, though. He's been around for a long time.

305
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,140
And he's already been blown

306
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,120
quite a few times, so I wouldn't worry about him

307
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,980
being blue anymore. He's, uh,

308
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,740
rather pallid now. He's

309
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,160
kind of a lighter shade of gray, or whatever

310
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,380
they used to say. He's more gray

311
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,220
than a, a blue. It all depends

312
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,860
on the lighting, uh, conditions.

313
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,080
If we were really brave, we'd have

314
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,980
old sequoia

315
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,820
lion

316
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,100
turducken mesium.

317
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
Well, I don't know if old sequoia

318
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,460
would voluntarily give himself

319
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,440
up for such a

320
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
holy purpose as that.

321
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,200
And come to think of it... You're going to splice

322
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,140
some animals? Is that, am I correct in

323
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,180
understanding you're gonna splice up a few newies?

324
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,360
You're gonna take old, um, old turtle

325
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,100
and mix him, mix

326
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,360
his genes with, um,

327
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,080
some stone-washed genes from

328
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,520
another animal and perhaps

329
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,240
create a new kind of bacon or some kind of

330
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,380
meat. Now, you're giving me ideas.

331
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,080
I hadn't thought of that, but we

332
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
certainly have that option.

333
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,840
Yes, the so-called

334
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,940
Moreau option.

335
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,220
It's part of our biological program

336
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,380
still in development.

337
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Well, I...

338
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,880
...to talk about on the radio, but

339
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,840
there you go. So, uh,

340
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,800
the whole idea is that the

341
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,060
genetic code need not be,

342
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,140
um, etched

343
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
in brass, uh, but is actually

344
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,240
malleable and, uh, changeable.

345
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,360
Like any formula, or...

346
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,340
...uh...

347
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,160
...like a string of snot or

348
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,260
DNA. I have been making

349
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,880
plans to

350
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,140
create a world

351
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,120
and populate it with monsters.

352
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,260
In fact, I'm

353
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,940
going to make my favorite

354
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,760
video game come to life.

355
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,140
As soon as I have the opportunity

356
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,280
to do so, with the help

357
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,220
of the men from Planet X and their

358
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,360
supercomputer, Mwom...

359
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,600
Mwom. Mwom. Mwom. Mwom.

360
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,660
...I will cause to be manifested

361
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,060
the world of my video game,

362
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,860
Monster Hunter. And I

363
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,880
will be the... I won't be

364
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,380
running some tall

365
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,560
brute of a hunter

366
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,060
through his paces. I'll be doing it myself.

367
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,040
I'll be...

368
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
...slaying literal,

369
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,440
live, real

370
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,220
giant lewdroths.

371
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,420
Man, I could see you in a loincloth,

372
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,220
like, stabbing those monsters

373
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,820
with thermonuclear

374
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,240
spears and stuff. No, you won't see me in a loincloth.

375
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,680
You'll see me in elaborate

376
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,380
armor.

377
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,860
All kinds of elaborate armor.

378
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,640
It's a rough-and-tumble existence

379
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,000
that requires some personal

380
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,560
protection.

381
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,860
Next I see a rollerball spin-off,

382
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,920
a monster dome

383
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,360
type of thing. Monster dome?

384
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,320
Probably in Texas, of course,

385
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,560
where all those places are.

386
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,160
Well, there kind of already is a

387
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,140
monster dome in Texas. It's

388
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,580
called the Capitol in Austin.

389
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,020
The Capitol building, Rotunda,

390
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,240
and it is full of monsters.

391
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,120
And monster hunters,

392
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
such as the great new subgenius saint,

393
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,340
Wendy Davis,

394
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,840
Texas state senator, who

395
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,520
stood there

396
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,980
as Mr. Sister

397
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,800
said, when Republicans do that,

398
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,700
you call it obstructing.

399
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
And when she does it, she's

400
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,900
a hero, because

401
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,780
she was fighting for the

402
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,400
abortion rights, essentially,

403
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,540
the Texas Republican

404
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
lawmakers were about to

405
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,120
change the rules

406
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,840
so that pretty much all the abortion

407
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,180
clinics in Texas would have to close down.

408
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,820
And she

409
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,920
filibustered, like

410
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,460
Mr. Dobbs goes to Washington.

411
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,400
She didn't

412
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,500
quite make it, but the

413
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,140
witnesses took up a chant

414
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,160
that extended, that

415
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,060
prevented the vote from happening until

416
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,220
it was too late.

417
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,460
Of course, they're

418
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,880
coming back to do it all over again.

419
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,820
Rick Perry vowed that they would

420
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,600
push it through the next time.

421
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,120
But that's ridiculous, isn't it?

422
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,060
Controversial public appearance.

423
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,940
So, once again, the news

424
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,700
cycle must recycle

425
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,320
through for

426
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,160
us to be clear of it thirty hours later.

427
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,960
They want us to row

428
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,060
and wait backwards.

429
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,660
I'm sorry, with hot dogs in front of our noses.

430
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,020
What's going to happen next? Well, stick around,

431
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,340
we'll be back in five,

432
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,520
four, three,

433
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,180
two, one. Well, we're back.

434
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,080
It looks like the problems

435
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,340
in Texas are continuing to be problems in Texas.

436
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,380
My fellow Texans,

437
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,660
we have,

438
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,680
we want,

439
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,080
we want a small government.

440
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,360
To quote Senator Baby Bear,

441
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,140
we want a government small enough

442
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,680
that it can be forced into a vagina.

443
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,440
Not only will it fit,

444
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,680
it will be forced in.

445
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,300
That's what we call

446
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,560
small government.

447
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,100
Operating the

448
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,240
small government.

449
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,040
We're a woman's control

450
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
from the inside out.

451
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,200
And we'll make friends with that little

452
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,120
fetus in there. We're not going to raise it

453
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,580
or pay for it, but we're going to

454
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,780
protect it.

455
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,140
While we're doing that, however, I would

456
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,020
like to celebrate the execution of the

457
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,940
500th female in Texas.

458
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,220
That's an adult female who's

459
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,140
guilty, probably, or of

460
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,980
something. Certainly

461
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,000
of something. Maybe not what we're

462
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,220
executing them for, but by golly,

463
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,580
this is Texas. That's what we do.

464
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,960
My God.

465
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,620
As long as Rick Perry's governor.

466
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
Now, when Wendy Davis is the new Ann Richards,

467
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,180
then things gonna change. My God.

468
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm gonna move back to Texas and become

469
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,560
mayor of Stainesville, and

470
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,700
we'll wage war on Stephenville

471
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,640
and Granbury

472
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,920
and Cleburne.

473
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,760
Well, that's certainly enough for

474
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,040
vigorous retirement full of

475
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,960
events and adventure.

476
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,420
Right. Raising the

477
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,600
I was gonna name a couple of other Texas towns.

478
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,080
I was gonna name some other Texas towns,

479
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,040
but they're racially, they have racially

480
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,900
offensive names, still.

481
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,980
And they're still out there, eh?

482
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,180
Well, I did, they're not on

483
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,260
There's one on an old

484
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,100
map, and there's still

485
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,200
signs in a couple of places.

486
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,860
Drowned

487
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,100
Subgenius Creek was one. I found

488
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,260
that to be really offensive.

489
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,260
Oh, wow, man. And Rick Perry's

490
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,180
ranch was originally called Subgenius

491
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,760
Head. Yes, I knew that.

492
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,900
I think that was

493
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,400
generally known.

494
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,320
I forgot about Subgenius Dry Gulch,

495
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,260
where they took all those poor guys down there

496
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,360
and let them smoke to death.

497
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,460
Yeah, the

498
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,240
owl hoots and dry gulchers

499
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
and bushwhackers.

500
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,840
Yep.

501
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,640
Get on, get on, you doggies.

502
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,460
Let's ride on.

503
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,480
Let's ride on down.

504
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,980
This piece on the air

505
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,600
you've got right now is perfect for

506
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,720
calling the devil, I think, or something like that.

507
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,500
Grand Theft Palomino.

508
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,060
Let's

509
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,360
ride into Deadwood.

510
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,640
Show that owl swearing to a thing or two.

511
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,060
Okay, but...

512
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,780
Come on after me, you

513
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,380
Yankees and dirt worshippers,

514
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,020
celestials, and

515
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,340
good-for-nothing

516
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,980
speculators, lawyers.

517
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,320
This legend

518
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,980
spread across the land,

519
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,120
blazing like a burning

520
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,560
brand.

521
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,600
A burning forehead,

522
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,000
a mountain of steel around his

523
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,680
tawny body, and his

524
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,120
knees all buckling from the weight of

525
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,260
having to carry the universe around in his

526
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,940
back teeth.

527
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,200
And I carry the universe under

528
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,340
my chaps, partner.

529
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,060
Yep. And to keep it warm between

530
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,380
you and the saddle.

531
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,200
That water's... I can make

532
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,780
cheese with that there, saddle.

533
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,080
Yep, on the old

534
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,320
Rennet Ranch,

535
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,120
where renegades would gather for

536
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,920
cheesy fun outside

537
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
the law.

538
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,960
Back in the old wild

539
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,400
days,

540
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,340
the devil took the

541
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,840
hindmost.

542
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,280
But this group of bangity-bang

543
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,540
honchos didn't care, firing off

544
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,240
their guns in the air

545
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,220
right outside the church.

546
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,040
Of a Sunday morning,

547
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,540
these hooligans didn't care

548
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,020
whether they rattled the pastor

549
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,940
and the congregation

550
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,620
with their wild

551
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,140
buck hijinks.

552
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,680
Let's rob them subgeniuses, boys!

553
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,560
Who's with me?

554
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,320
Hey, let's go to the gambling

555
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,940
joint there and find us some

556
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,380
fillets, some cheroots,

557
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,680
and some

558
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,380
woman.

559
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,840
Let's find an engine and string them up!

560
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,780
Wide open town.

561
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
Hey look, there's somebody who ain't

562
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
related to me. Let's kill them.

563
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
Let's find a fetus and protect it at all

564
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,940
costs, while killing

565
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,800
all the women and children in town.

566
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,660
Hee-haw!

567
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,280
We're continuing to force-feed her with all we've got.

568
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,240
Mountains of mush and pieces of

569
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,960
little cowboy cheese.

570
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,660
They say

571
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,680
that was defeatist?

572
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,820
Somewhere over near Mush Mountain.

573
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,280
You can still get cowboy

574
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,100
toes? You can get that

575
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,260
by walking across a shower floor

576
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,100
where some guys who keep

577
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,280
their boots on a little too long

578
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,080
have been there before you.

579
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
On that long cowboy

580
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,460
trail through the...

581
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,660
What a delicious aroma.

582
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,940
Yes, well, it soon proves

583
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,100
itself. As it

584
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,940
is.

585
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,340
Uh, yes.

586
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
A self-pruning aroma.

587
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,240
I love this talker.

588
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,240
Cowboys in Texas is making me

589
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,180
feel right at home.

590
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,640
Well, that's good.

591
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
On the saddle.

592
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,140
Did you string anybody up today, Stanks?

593
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,200
I just strung

594
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,460
them along, is what I done.

595
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,920
You know, God almighty,

596
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,740
a day without a lynching

597
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,240
is a day without sunshine.

598
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,380
Orange sunshine.

599
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:20,740
Orange sunshine.

600
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,100
From the blue sun,

601
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,880
compadres.

602
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,280
Yes.

603
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,060
If I'd have been born under a blue sun,

604
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,380
I'd have super powers.

605
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,720
Unfortunately, this yellow sun

606
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,300
weakens all of non-Kryptonian

607
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
parentage.

608
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,460
Makes your teeth green, too.

609
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,180
Green teeth are just

610
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,140
what'll take away

611
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,820
our powers.

612
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,920
If you just don't want to spin

613
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,300
that color wheel too fast.

614
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,720
Red teeth, on the other hand,

615
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,540
turns you into a bizarro.

616
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,700
Me bizarro subgenius.

617
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,100
Me not like slack.

618
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,360
Yes. Me bizarro subgenius.

619
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,040
Me hate Bob.

620
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,260
Me bizarro subgenius. Me have good job,

621
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,840
make money.

622
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,340
Be responsible citizen.

623
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,380
Not be art bum.

624
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,500
The bizarro subgenius

625
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,900
world.

626
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,920
Well, that is

627
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,480
the bizarro subgenius world.

628
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,940
This world is what we would call

629
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,120
the bizarro subgenius world.

630
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,580
There are indeed many icons

631
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,360
of Bob as a bizarro man.

632
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,320
Yes.

633
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,140
With that square jaw already built into his mug,

634
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,560
I would say he's perfect

635
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,540
for the part.

636
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,280
Well, we now know that his jaw

637
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,060
was not quite as square as is commonly depicted.

638
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,120
That's the one

639
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,320
place that the

640
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
actual physical

641
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,780
Bob differs from. Don't remind me.

642
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,880
Hal is bringing up a point of

643
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,780
doctrine that I've been successfully

644
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,720
avoiding for almost two years now.

645
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,780
A very painful point of doctrine.

646
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,020
Do you know what we're talking about, Princess?

647
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,220
I don't believe I'm aware of this point of doctrine.

648
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,740
Nor am I.

649
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,540
Are you aware of the

650
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,380
photograph clip art

651
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,880
found by

652
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,220
Paul someone?

653
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,420
Yes.

654
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,300
There are two or three different bits of clip art

655
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,120
from the 40s that show

656
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,260
Bob.

657
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,920
And it's the same Bob that's in

658
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,520
the famous halftone

659
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,480
True Dob said,

660
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,500
But it's a photograph!

661
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,540
It's a photograph from life!

662
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,540
It's a halftone.

663
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,600
Like Pickman's model, it proves

664
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,780
the ultimate horror is an absolute

665
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,660
reality.

666
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,080
That Bob exists?

667
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,460
Is real?

668
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,540
Yes, this was the actual flesh and blood

669
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,700
basis of the famous Bob

670
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,580
glyph, with only very

671
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,820
slight change in the contour

672
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,640
of the lower jaw.

673
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,660
And the ears.

674
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,120
What happened to this personality?

675
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,120
It drift somewhere in Chinatown out there on the west coast?

676
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,780
Well, that's the mystery.

677
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,620
We prayed

678
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,480
to know someday

679
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,620
where that original piece

680
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,540
of graphic came from.

681
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,780
The portrait of Bob.

682
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,320
And

683
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,500
watch what you pray for, friend.

684
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,160
Yes, this is the most disturbing

685
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,040
appearance in the news.

686
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,500
The atmosphere.

687
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,080
We got an answer,

688
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,680
and it just raised a more profound

689
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,460
mystery.

690
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,900
Well, it turned out to be exactly the way

691
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,980
the sacred scribe

692
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,180
Ivan Stang wrote,

693
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,800
a model for a series of advertisements

694
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,200
in the 1940s

695
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,080
and 50s.

696
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,520
Just exactly as written

697
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,980
in the original book of the subgenius.

698
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,960
Yes, friends, it's a mystery, but we will

699
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,440
pierce the shroud

700
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,560
around this mystery. We show

701
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,380
it to the world.

702
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,000
We find our way to the golden secret

703
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
at the heart of the mystery

704
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
of the heart of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

705
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
If we have to cut his heart out

706
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,920
and hold it up to the

707
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,520
sun gods atop some

708
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,360
pyramid.

709
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,080
We'll cut his heart out at its side

710
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,760
to make it feel both cold and heat.

711
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,660
... a testament to a race that came

712
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,940
before all other races on planet Earth.

713
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,160
It's difficult to ascertain

714
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,180
for certain, but one thing

715
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,100
is clear. But I tell you, we should!

716
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,720
We shall have Dobbstown

717
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,000
in our hearts. We shall not just

718
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,940
in our hearts. We shall be

719
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,880
at Dobbstown. We will

720
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,940
be there this week

721
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,800
when the saucers land,

722
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,780
my friends. And Bob

723
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,740
himself steps down that

724
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,820
ramp, welcoming us on board.

725
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,680
Okay, what's this? I didn't know

726
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,360
we had to stop at Dobbstown.

727
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,020
This is the first time I've heard of that.

728
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,320
That we have to stop at that

729
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,040
place? Dobbstown?

730
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,420
This is the cosmic

731
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,040
Dobbstown. Not the place we had to

732
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,800
shut down in Malaysia, or the place they

733
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,220
ran us out of in Brazil.

734
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,400
The one in Bolivia that was so

735
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,040
diseased. And the one full

736
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,860
of monsters in the Mongolian desert.

737
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,360
Nay! This is the real Dobbstown,

738
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:00,780
my friend!

739
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,800
For Dobbstown

740
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,740
is a

741
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,960
true place. A place of

742
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,640
the mind, a place of the heart.

743
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,580
A place of the groin!

744
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,740
A place

745
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,040
you can eat! A place you can

746
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,260
move into! A place you can sit on!

747
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,860
Where the mortgage rates

748
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,900
are low and gasoline goes for two

749
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,580
bucks a gallon.

750
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,860
Yes, your Dobbstown.

751
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,960
Dobbstown. With a mall on every

752
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,900
corner. Great architecture.

753
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,160
One place for the entire

754
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,860
family.

755
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,580
Lowest sub-basement.

756
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,840
And now that that

757
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,060
Ennio Morricone music is over, I don't

758
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,680
have to yell.

759
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,680
When I hear that piece

760
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,960
there, it's something, something

761
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,060
of gold from Good, Bad and the Ugly.

762
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,860
Right. Arch Stanton

763
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,840
and Eli Wallach running around going

764
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,560
Blondie!

765
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,740
Whose

766
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,820
Arch Stanton was the grave that was

767
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,900
the actual grave in it? Well, that has nothing

768
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,940
to do with it. Oh, really? Was that the name on

769
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,040
the grave that was supposed

770
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,460
to have the gold in it? Oops.

771
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,260
Spoiler!

772
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,760
Oh, well, you don't expect this

773
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,740
radio audience will remember.

774
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,560
That movie is

775
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,040
so old! Or even have ever seen any of these films or will see any of these

776
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,080
films because most of the listeners

777
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,980
to all radio, and myself included,

778
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
are severely

779
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,440
mentally handicapped.

780
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,300
Well, there you have it.

781
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,040
That movie is so old that

782
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,840
when Eli

783
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,420
Wallach yells at

784
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,780
Clint Eastwood writing off, he goes

785
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,040
Blondie, you son of a

786
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,860
boi-wee-oh!

787
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,700
Wah-wah-wah!

788
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,920
Because you couldn't say

789
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,760
Blondie, you wo-wo-wo-head!

790
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,000
If we were on a commercial radio

791
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,500
station, I'd go ahead and say that.

792
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,040
Yes, it's still the 60s here on this

793
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,460
radio station. Yeah.

794
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Well, a bitch is a female dog in here.

795
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,080
Well, it's 1984.

796
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,860
That's not a dirty word, it's just a statement

797
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,980
of... It's a... Knock it at your door.

798
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,060
It's 1984

799
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,700
at the KPFA

800
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,920
radio station. Yes, it's true.

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm not trying to

802
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,960
sound critical in

803
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,100
this regard. Simply noting

804
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,080
a fact. They got more cameras in there

805
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,100
than a post office does. That's true.

806
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,040
We are under constant surveillance.

807
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,400
The slightest

808
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,060
motion is observed

809
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,120
by a secret body. Doesn't that make you feel

810
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,180
violated, Dr. Howell? Doesn't that make you

811
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,140
feel like your underpants are being sniffed

812
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,180
by a large mastiff with very large

813
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,080
teeth? Well, you

814
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,420
know, I had nothing to do with

815
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,300
these changes. You got used to it.

816
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,320
And after all, we have adapted,

817
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,340
which is the ultimate

818
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,600
evolutionary strategy.

819
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,700
We've drawn gills in the third eyeball.

820
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,740
Now we cower

821
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,560
submissively in the parking lot

822
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,220
outside

823
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,900
to enact our ancient ritual

824
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,000
rather than relax on

825
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,100
lawn furniture on the

826
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,200
spacious patio.

827
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,640
No more rocketing away.

828
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,640
Now they just crawl away.

829
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,880
Tails between their legs.

830
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,920
Like four reptiles crawling

831
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,420
on the bosom of the ground.

832
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,860
No more pre-pita for the third

833
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,940
collar in a row, whatever that means.

834
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,100
In a row, I suppose the third

835
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
collar is different than if they were to line up

836
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,140
in a row. The collars are always getting in a row

837
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,920
as if there was anything to fight about.

838
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,000
But they do. That's

839
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,020
just what they do. That's like the internet.

840
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,580
Trolls, flame wars,

841
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,760
pyroflatulation.

842
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,760
And when the daytime

843
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,040
comes, they don't turn to stone.

844
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,940
There

845
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,860
is a pyroflatulation channel.

846
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,560
There's a blank lighting

847
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,580
secrets channel on the,

848
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,760
not the internet, but on cable TV

849
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,980
now in a last effort to keep

850
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,100
cable afloat. Hmm. Well, who's the

851
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,740
one who cares if you like blanks? They're not

852
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,860
going to go off. They're blanks. Oh, you

853
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,320
meant crepitations.

854
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,880
Yes. Excreted inflations

855
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,360
as they used to say in French.

856
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,960
Dr. Sinister has just strolled

857
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,920
into the radio station. Oh, how delightful.

858
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,560
Join us for this

859
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,140
marathon run.

860
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,040
Now we can see Sinister

861
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,900
throw open the

862
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,840
discussion to

863
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,820
more topical concerns.

864
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,480
I remember Sinister when he had mountains and mountains of hair

865
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,980
on his head like a young man.

866
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,080
Mountains.

867
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,100
Mountains. Give me

868
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,400
men to move my

869
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,960
mountains.

870
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,800
The mountains

871
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,900
fall.

872
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,780
I cringe and hide

873
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,820
my head.

874
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,820
I never sent

875
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,980
in my thirty-five

876
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,740
bucks. My soul

877
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,200
is thrilled

878
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,720
with dread.

879
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,880
The saucers

880
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,760
are coming. The saucers are coming.

881
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,040
The end of the world is nigh.

882
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,920
Pucker your lips for

883
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,900
apocalypse and kiss your ass

884
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,260
goodbye.

885
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,920
It looks

886
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,040
like doomsday in the apocalypse

887
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,820
got married and had a baby

888
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,920
and it's damn ugly.

889
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,980
Ugliest infant

890
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,020
you ever saw.

891
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,640
Squalling and mewling

892
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
and puking and

893
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,920
as red as a beet. Why do

894
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,140
people think babies are cute?

895
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,540
Well, some of them are.

896
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,880
They are not cute.

897
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,060
If anything, they're vile and handsome

898
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,000
and full of robust flavor, but there are

899
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,340
no cute subgeniuses.

900
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,980
Well, yeah, I guess there are.

901
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,100
There are a couple cute in that way, but...

902
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,240
You can't eat them before at least

903
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,880
their first birthday

904
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
because you gotta give them at least a year to

905
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,800
ripen. Not without pickles, for crying out loud.

906
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,640
Or you can render them into the

907
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,780
always valuable commodity of

908
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,200
baby oil. Delicious.

909
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,000
I mean, well, it works for sunburn sometimes.

910
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,100
Makes good popcorn, too, but

911
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,880
uh... Is that where baby oil

912
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,500
comes from?

913
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,860
What about baby powder?

914
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,340
Yes, I know.

915
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,920
Well, baby powder is a separate...

916
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,740
I did a few lines of that New Year's Eve

917
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,860
and I tell you, I ain't been

918
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,720
the same since. Some babies did

919
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,700
take a powder. They were seen making

920
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,780
a break for it, crawling out of the

921
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,960
nursery on hands and knees down the

922
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,860
corridor on the security cam

923
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,740
film that we have

924
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,400
and wear these

925
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,380
malfeasor juvenile

926
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,840
infants have crawled to

927
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,900
is still not known to the

928
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,780
The malfeasor? Yes.

929
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,240
What the hell is a malfeasor?

930
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,020
It's a little miniature malefactor.

931
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,800
An infant criminal,

932
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,160
as it were. It's a shame

933
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,040
that such a category has to exist.

934
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,620
They're the opposite of a benefusor.

935
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,760
They say the Cleveland subway

936
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,960
tunnels, the abandoned subways

937
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,660
and sewers are crawling,

938
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,800
literally crawling with feral

939
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,000
babies. Feral infants with unchanged

940
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,960
diapers and weird glowing

941
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,160
eyes that you sometimes see by the side

942
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,620
of the road in your car's headlight.

943
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,240
And they are radioactive as well, yes.

944
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,280
But if you clean them and cook them properly...

945
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,320
They are active on the radio even as we are,

946
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,700
but fortunately their infantile

947
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,860
chatter is hardly

948
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,000
effective for the time

949
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,860
being. Much like what you're hearing

950
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,880
now. Yes. Well, you know.

951
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920
Infantile chatter is highly

952
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,120
ineffective. I did have it correctly

953
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,020
that you can, if you know

954
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,540
how to get rid of the ducts and glands,

955
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,820
you can prepare them, you can

956
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,920
cook them up like any other form of

957
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,580
feral vegetable that you find in the

958
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,140
basement. Well, you're

959
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,860
right. You have to be very careful to remove

960
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,080
the scent glands. And the fat

961
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,940
carries an especially

962
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,980
high price on the market if the

963
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,900
baby has not been baptized yet.

964
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,440
Oh, I didn't know that.

965
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,660
Baptized, you mean, don't you?

966
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,100
Some of our more traditional

967
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,840
communicants

968
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,940
follow the old ways and

969
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,080
they have to drink the blood

970
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,720
of the unbaptized, the

971
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,660
unbaptized. But, you know,

972
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,300
everybody says today,

973
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,780
we have got to accept

974
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,600
them into the human family, understand

975
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,220
they have a condition that makes them

976
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,900
different from the rest. The old days

977
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,860
of pounding stakes through the

978
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,300
heart and all that stuff are

979
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,800
simply not

980
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,520
what anyone would

981
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,540
do today in an area

982
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,940
of understanding.

983
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,980
No, it is far beyond

984
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,640
understanding. It's totally beyond

985
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,760
comprehension. But what they're doing

986
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,200
is basically deep down in the tunnels

987
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,120
below the earth in these labyrinths

988
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,720
of stone and steel. The sunlight's

989
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,820
bad for them. They have to be in the

990
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,220
subterranean realm. Yes, yes.

991
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,120
Yes, yes, yes. As you said.

992
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,140
And they must be tended to. They must

993
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,860
be cattle prodded occasionally

994
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,740
if they don't move in the right direction.

995
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,480
They must be kept in large, large

996
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,140
compound. I wouldn't recommend doing that.

997
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,980
Like salt is a compound,

998
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,000
I believe. See, what is this music

999
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,960
in the background? It's Ghost Babies

1000
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,000
in the Sky. It's about a, uh,

1001
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,100
hardened cowboys riding along

1002
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,040
and seeing a

1003
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
herd of mad

1004
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,260
slobber mouth

1005
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,260
ghost babies climbing through that

1006
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,020
Just like he's doing

1007
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,580
in the sky.

1008
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,120
They whip them doggies along, you know,

1009
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,860
for the long time they're going to San

1010
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,600
Antonio. When they're

1011
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,840
whipping them doggies along,

1012
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
there's some genius babies

1013
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,060
and they are liking it every step of

1014
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,080
the way. Hey, shut up for a minute. Let's listen to Dick

1015
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,020
Dale for just a second.

1016
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,780
This is Dick Dale.

1017
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,840
When's it gonna stop?

1018
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,180
Never.

1019
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:38,880
...

1020
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,660
...

1021
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,500
...

1022
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,200
...

1023
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
...

1024
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,820
...

1025
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,440
...

1026
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,440


1027
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,440


1028
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,440


1029
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,160
I predict it will stop in

1030
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,040
uh, 41 seconds. How do you do that?

1031
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,020
You're so accurate.

1032
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,580
Brian Jones Color

1033
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,900
Deuce

1034
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,620
such fantastic

1035
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,980
deductibles. I think it's

1036
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,840
the third nostril giving it all away.

1037
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,960
I think that's where he gets his information from.

1038
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,760
You would not believe

1039
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,040
the booger I picked out of my third nostril

1040
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,500
this morning.

1041
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,340
It's always in the morning, too.

1042
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,840
Dr. Drummond pointed out today

1043
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,000
in fact that every time you

1044
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,740
pick a booger, a devil gets

1045
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,040
its wings. I like

1046
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,220
that.

1047
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,420
Oh boy.

1048
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,560
Have I created minions of

1049
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,480
hell or have I created minions

1050
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,300
of hell? Plenty.

1051
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,060
Everybody's doing it.

1052
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,420
Picking it and chewing it.

1053
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,600
Pick a booger.

1054
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,080
Not full-blown devils.

1055
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,700
They're imps. They grow to

1056
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,600
devils. They can become devils eventually.

1057
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,260
You don't get a full

1058
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,480
size impressive devil

1059
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
from some incredibly petty

1060
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,600
crap like that.

1061
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,180
Dr. Sinister, do you hear that noise again?

1062
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,300
The ocean in the background?

1063
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah.

1064
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,060
Our phone lines have had this problem for over a month.

1065
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,460
That's still... Line 1 is still

1066
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,340
doing that. It's not just Line 1.

1067
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,280
We hear problems when you get other people

1068
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,860
on the other lines as well. Oh, right.

1069
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,260
Yeah, no, we've had this problem

1070
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,820
with our phone lines for over a month now and

1071
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,480
who knows what's causing it.

1072
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,120
Listen, you hear the grating roar

1073
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,240
of pebbles. You know, my office

1074
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,500
phone died

1075
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,300
last, of course,

1076
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,080
people are desperate to find out

1077
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,460
how to be saved.

1078
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,260
This

1079
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,700
subgenius office phone dies.

1080
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,200
And I

1081
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,280
learned in the

1082
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,920
course of trying to get it repaired,

1083
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,700
I learned that AT&T's

1084
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,280
phone

1085
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,700
robot

1086
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,000
is in need of repair

1087
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,140
and out of order.

1088
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,680
Their repair

1089
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,340
robots are

1090
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,740
dead. So even the phone

1091
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,840
company's phone is messed up.

1092
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,420
Their repair robot

1093
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,740
needs repair.

1094
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,000
Why can't you just

1095
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,240
settle back and give in to

1096
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,180
reluctantly, of course,

1097
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,760
grand mal paranoia and assume

1098
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,580
that it's not only the

1099
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,860
SPT and the STP and all

1100
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,820
those different name groups and stuff,

1101
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,720
those anagrams. I'm the opposite

1102
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
of paranoid. I think people actually like me.

1103
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,860
But they like

1104
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,440
you in what way?

1105
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
No, not really. It's delusional.

1106
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,500
Yeah.

1107
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,640
I don't want so many.

1108
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,480
That's part of the fun is Rob's delusional.

1109
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,660
So drop

1110
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,320
the telephone and go back to the

1111
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,980
heliograph. Problem solved.

1112
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,440
Drop the helium bag and get out

1113
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,620
on the backyard and

1114
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,980
moak some fish with grandma and grandpa.

1115
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,140
That's right. You can shuffle off to Buffalo.

1116
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,280
And we'll be shuffling

1117
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,640
with them pretty big shoes.

1118
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,540
They do. They do

1119
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,660
it, but that's because

1120
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,040
they can be buffalo. To their own kind.

1121
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,080
Uh-huh. That's what

1122
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,160
the syllogism says. Yeah.

1123
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,940
That's true.

1124
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,200
Uh,

1125
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,600
but you have to be willing to be

1126
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,760
buffaloed, to be buffaloed

1127
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,960
by buffalo, buffalo.

1128
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,600
All you have to do is be shaggy

1129
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,620
and horny and big.

1130
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,060
And you're buffalo arch.

1131
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,900
You're forgetting the hump, I think.

1132
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
I never forget the hump, my friend.

1133
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,800
I feel like hanging up after you said that.

1134
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,160
Well, no, no, no.

1135
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,440
Keep your shirt on there.

1136
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,360
That's, uh, no problem.

1137
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,960
You touched a nerve there, pal.

1138
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,640
Well, I guess a lot of us

1139
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,420
have gotten nervous in the

1140
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,560
service.

1141
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,260
Well, I've had more humps

1142
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,720
since then, so I don't

1143
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,160
really care. Well, uh, that

1144
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,140
was the source of the, uh,

1145
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,220
best part of the buffalo

1146
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,200
critter. You know, the hump was

1147
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,220
good. Also, the tongue was good. Tongue, yeah, I was

1148
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
gonna say, the tongue. Tongue was good. Well,

1149
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,980
uh, you, you know, buffalo

1150
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,140
is, is, is quite good, really.

1151
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,380
I recommend it. And the soul is small,

1152
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,040
but it's, mm, mm, mm.

1153
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,400
Buffalo, buffalo have souls?

1154
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,280
Yes, very small soul.

1155
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,380
The buffalo, the buffalo

1156
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,760
had a horrid snuffalo,

1157
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,240
and not a single Indian

1158
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,300
chief would lend the beast a

1159
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,180
handkerchief, which goes to show

1160
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,000
how very far from courtesy

1161
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,180
some people are.

1162
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,420
I've heard that

1163
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,320
the Indians used to call buffalo

1164
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,060
Tishue.

1165
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,480
Which Indians?

1166
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,840
The Ukabala Pongas.

1167
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,880
No, no, no, the European.

1168
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,060
No, that's what their enemies called them.

1169
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,240
It meant snake in the grass. They called them

1170
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,200
themselves the true, the one true race

1171
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,100
of humans, like

1172
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,800
every tribe called themselves

1173
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,040
since my ancestors

1174
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,080
in England and Germany.

1175
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,180
You have

1176
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,660
ancestors in Germany?

1177
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,720
They were, yeah, they were, they were native,

1178
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,980
uh, natives of that place.

1179
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,120
They wore the, the grass skirts

1180
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,280
and the fig leaves and the coconuts

1181
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,900
on their breasts and everything? Yep, built

1182
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,940
teepees and everything. And then God

1183
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,160
asked them, who told you you were naked?

1184
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,160
Oh, and then the Romans came.

1185
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,860
Came in and made them wear real

1186
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,880
clothes. Yes, woven

1187
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,240
by, uh, looms of, uh,

1188
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,300
slaves in Brundisium.

1189
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,760
Brundisium.

1190
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,820
A great place for the garment

1191
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,300
trade.

1192
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,360
The invention of work.

1193
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,780
Around Mare Nostrum, our

1194
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,560
ocean, the whole Mediterranean.

1195
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,800
It belongs to Rome, don't you know?

1196
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,100
Yep, it certainly was at the time.

1197
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,920
Now it belongs to

1198
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,980
old Grandfather Smacky, better known

1199
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,020
as Uncle Stan. Yes, there

1200
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,300
are messing with Gibraltar.

1201
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,040
If you look at the screen here, you can see the, uh,

1202
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,020
several Romans, or Italians anyway,

1203
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,400
running around, uh,

1204
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,860
crazy, dressed up in clown suits.

1205
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,640
Oh, yes, they're chasing the

1206
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,000
Palpatini, which was another evil tribe

1207
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
which grew in the backs of

1208
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,560
their throats.

1209
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,040
And I, I'm not saying that the tribe grew

1210
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,160
in, never mind, it

1211
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,740
was a disease that killed

1212
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,960
many, many humans.

1213
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,180
I was just thinking of this,

1214
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,920
uh, that movie by that famous

1215
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,780
Italian director, Peach Bellini.

1216
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,220
And which movie was it?

1217
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,520
Uh, uh,

1218
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,620
Eight and, uh, a Third.

1219
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,340
Oh, yeah, right, exactly.

1220
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,740
A prequel. They, you know, it was a rip-off of

1221
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,300
Eight and a Half, but they had to do a prequel.

1222
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,000
There have been a number of Johnny-come-lately,

1223
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,640
uh, comments

1224
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,660
on that movie.

1225
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,000
Have there? I'd be interested.

1226
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,460
Dave and I were discussing

1227
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Eight and a Half a couple of shows back.

1228
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,860
Because he was in love with that, uh,

1229
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,900
that giant prostitute that lived

1230
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,520
on the beach.

1231
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,720
No, I liked the song, and I could play it on the accordion

1232
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
with my teeth. It didn't mean that I liked

1233
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,600
Sarandina. She was scary to me

1234
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,580
because I was young enough to hear it.

1235
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,660
It all fails before the Fellini sequence

1236
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,140
in Boccaccio 70.

1237
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,760
I missed that one.

1238
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,780
You, you must know

1239
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,920
the one with the giant, towering

1240
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Anita Ekberg?

1241
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,340
I've heard of it, and I've never seen it.

1242
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,500
It's the best thing ever. I bet.

1243
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,560
It's, it's quite wonderful.

1244
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,060
You should Netflix it or

1245
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,480
whatever. It's only about half an hour

1246
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,220
to watch. You should watch it.

1247
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,420
It's good. Yeah.

1248
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,180
I'll have to Netflix it then.

1249
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,520
I'll have to get Netflix.

1250
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,220
It's in the weird

1251
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,360
category of men

1252
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,320
being sexually tormented by

1253
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,300
giant women.

1254
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,520
Uh, more explicitly than in

1255
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,600
say, the 30-foot Bride of Candy

1256
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,960
Rock with, uh,

1257
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,520
Bud Abbott and Luke Costello, with just Luke

1258
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,240
Costello, uh, and, uh,

1259
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,360
the attack of the 50-foot... I've always wanted to see that.

1260
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,040
...50-foot woman, uh,

1261
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,380
both, uh, original with

1262
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,560
Alison Hayes and the Daryl Hanna, uh,

1263
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,660
remake, but this, uh,

1264
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,640
features a giant, uh,

1265
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,860
Anita Ekberg, you know,

1266
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,840
who grabs the squirming

1267
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,920
anhedonic, anti-sexual

1268
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,840
protagonist and actually

1269
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,740
forces him between her

1270
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,840
gigantic, uh,

1271
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,500
uh...

1272
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,380
Yes, exactly.

1273
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,840
I was seeking a euphemism, but I wasn't

1274
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,720
fascinated. No, this, this is a

1275
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,700
fascinating movie, and he tries to get the Vatican

1276
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,860
to condemn the, uh, giant

1277
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,880
billboard of Anita Ekberg that

1278
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
faces his house, but...

1279
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,980
Right as a Vespa zips by and some

1280
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,480
more cool music starts.

1281
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,900
The Nino Rota music, which plays again

1282
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,860
and again through this segment, is actually from

1283
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,940
a milk commercial, which,

1284
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,680
uh, is the reason that giant

1285
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,400
Anita Ekberg is there.

1286
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,960
But it comes a nightmarish time when, during

1287
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,780
a thunderstorm, she steps down off

1288
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,720
the, uh, billboard

1289
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,960
and pursues the scuttling,

1290
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,740
moralist, uh, through the street

1291
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,660
with giant steps. I remember the song.

1292
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,080
Uh, uh, you know, every, uh,

1293
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,600
everyone should see this

1294
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,400
film, but, uh,

1295
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,680
anyway, what more... It's got

1296
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,640
subtitles, though. I ain't gonna watch that much

1297
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,940
subtitles. It's probably not even

1298
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,100
3D. It's, it's

1299
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,660
nice because it's not from

1300
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,740
planet America. It has a different

1301
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,340
outlook.

1302
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,240
Drink your milk every day.

1303
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,340
Every day, drink your milk.

1304
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,220
Something like that.

1305
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:02,820
Yeah.

1306
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,280
Well, we were driving through Little Italy on the way here

1307
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,380
and all the Italians were very little.

1308
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,180
There were no giant women.

1309
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,140
Not drinking their milk, you see.

1310
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,900
That's the thing. There's no large Swedish

1311
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,100
bread to dissolve.

1312
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,720
Giant, hulking, corn-fed Americans,

1313
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,540
you know, are also

1314
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,380
subsisting on a dairy diet

1315
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,260
and they grow enormous

1316
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,000
because of the large amount of

1317
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,840
growth hormones they secondarily

1318
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,800
accumulate.

1319
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,820
From America's grain-fed

1320
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,660
belt-busting interior.

1321
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
Uh, and that's why

1322
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,540
these huge, doughy specimens

1323
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,920
are recognizable across the

1324
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,660
terraqueous globe as true

1325
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,960
Americans. That, that is correct.

1326
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,160
A race of milk-fed giants

1327
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,220
with tiny little pituitary

1328
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,920
glands and little teeny

1329
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,100
pineal glands and teeny teeny

1330
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,820
teeny teeny tiny tiny tiny tiny

1331
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,900
It's an...

1332
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,020
Americans, we are the cream.

1333
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,040
That's right. We are plump and...

1334
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,760
oily and we rise to the top.

1335
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,840
You know, it's a condition of being

1336
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,240
exceptionally well fed as well as

1337
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,320
getting all those, uh...

1338
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,200
Isn't that what freedom means?

1339
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,520
Freedom means getting fat.

1340
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,160
Is getting the resources of all

1341
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,000
the rest of the world and consuming them

1342
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,980
in front of the starving rest

1343
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,220
of the world which is watching it all on TV.

1344
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,640
Well, they can't...

1345
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,920
They got an off button. Oh, that's right, they don't.

1346
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,240
No, that's right, they don't.

1347
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,700
In Russia, TV turns you off.

1348
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,040
And those factories, they keep TV on. All the time.

1349
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,660
All the time.

1350
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,780
So, uh, there is

1351
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,680
that, but, um...

1352
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,920
things will

1353
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,260
shortly change.

1354
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,000
We are hours away from the end

1355
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,280
of it all.

1356
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,060
The very, very end?

1357
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,000
Yes. The final slate? Recess is about

1358
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,840
to be declared.

1359
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,040
You can all put down your papers and examination

1360
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,840
books and race outside

1361
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,960
screaming and

1362
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,760
giggling to run and play

1363
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,280
on the endless meadows.

1364
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,720
And the flowers on the

1365
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,220
sidechamber.

1366
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,100
School's out forever?

1367
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,520
Yes.

1368
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,300
It's the end of the term.

1369
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,020
Except for the pinks.

1370
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,940
Well, they have to be

1371
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,600
educated. The pinks are just about to start getting

1372
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,860
their education. They're really gonna have it

1373
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,700
pounded into them.

1374
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,800
Because they have been neglecting their

1375
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,040
studies. You see, the rest of us will graduate.

1376
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,720
Magna cum laude.

1377
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,260
Oh, yeah.

1378
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,480
And everybody else is gonna...

1379
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,760
Well, we could call it interning.

1380
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,920
Yes, the new world will be

1381
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,260
exceptionally kind to subgeniuses

1382
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,020
and fellow travelers. Those who have

1383
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,880
smiled on us will

1384
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,080
be rewarded a thousandfold.

1385
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,040
While, unfortunately, those who

1386
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,020
have made life difficult in even

1387
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,320
the slightest degree

1388
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,900
shall have endless grief and

1389
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,840
woe hammered on

1390
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,380
their skulls by the wrath of an

1391
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,020
insane, senile god. But it will be good grief.

1392
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,280
That's why I can't pay my bills?

1393
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,760
I'm making a list and checking it twice.

1394
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,700
I'm gonna

1395
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,720
rise from the dead, those

1396
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,740
who were naughty and not nice.

1397
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,760
This is all done automatically, too.

1398
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,980
It's not a question of we'll do this

1399
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,840
or we'll do that. We have gotten with

1400
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,880
the program. We are simply going to slide

1401
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,140
along on its effortless

1402
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,780
curve. Exactly.

1403
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,700
The computer knows who you want to wreak

1404
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,980
revenge on before you even think of it.

1405
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,800
Yes, the gigantic brain

1406
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,840
has every bit of information

1407
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,640
on everything you ever did.

1408
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,940
You can ride around on the shoulders

1409
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,940
of that giant Anita Eckberg

1410
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,860
while watching your fifth grade

1411
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,640
teacher be tortured by devils.

1412
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,660
Mrs. Darden,

1413
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,360
are you listening?

1414
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,300
I think she heard you several times.

1415
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,040
You remember that?

1416
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:47,940
Wow.

1417
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,240
Yes.

1418
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,280
That's what she must die for.

1419
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,840
My one chance at the national spelling bee,

1420
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,680
she asked me to spell the word

1421
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,640
serval, which

1422
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,620
I was, I was

1423
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,780
I spelled S-E-R-V-I-L-A

1424
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,040
and then later they corrected me

1425
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,240
and said C-E-R-V-I-L-A.

1426
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,820
Just like we said, serval. S-E-V-E-R-A-L.

1427
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:08,800
Serval.

1428
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,860
Like in, I have serval puppies

1429
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,740
with me at home.

1430
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,980
This is another reason why

1431
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,520
Texas will get special treatment.

1432
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,840
And that's why they had so many problems

1433
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,720
with the serval-cocoon cancer bill

1434
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,240
because everybody was going around

1435
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,960
excommunicating 16-foot tall

1436
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,620
Swedish women. And the thing about

1437
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,460
Texas, and like they're talking about

1438
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,540
the big abortion filibuster that

1439
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,440
happened there this past week.

1440
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,440
Praise Wendy.

1441
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,240
I will take fetal pain

1442
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,020
laws seriously

1443
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,400
when they start mandating

1444
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,000
anesthesia for circumcision.

1445
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,640
Well Cleveland should know about these

1446
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,240
these uh,

1447
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,320
in vitro fertilization laws when

1448
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,180
the guy who kidnapped all those girls

1449
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,280
isn't he still charged with committing

1450
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,540
adultery or something?

1451
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,200
Or grand mal seizure?

1452
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,720
Are you conflating several news stories?

1453
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,960
We don't want to talk about

1454
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,260
Philo like that. He's not here

1455
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,400
and he can't defend himself.

1456
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,880
He wouldn't be able to defend himself anyway

1457
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,740
even if he was here. What we say is

1458
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,580
it's just his way. You know?

1459
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,680
It's just his way.

1460
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,560
No we can't say that. Oh we can't?

1461
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,060
You know who said that once.

1462
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,740
So that means we can't say it.

1463
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,200
Yes well I would like to, there's something

1464
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,880
I've been meaning to mention but I guess

1465
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,040
since it concerns that person we can't

1466
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
mention it here? Oh go ahead. I don't care.

1467
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,480
Go ahead and talk about it.

1468
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,100
This person that we're talking about called

1469
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,400
Paul while I was off, maybe

1470
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,920
while we were both off performing

1471
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,060
in the Chicken John

1472
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,140
unauthorized cacophony

1473
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,540
uh, show. I wondered where he

1474
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,240
was when that was going. He called

1475
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,440
Paul to say that he

1476
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,020
had tried out for

1477
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,580
uh, some reality

1478
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,580
show. America's Got Talent. America's Got Talent

1479
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,760
and been booed out of the audition.

1480
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,280
Yes. Out of the talent audition

1481
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,500
and it was on TV and it would be on

1482
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,680
on Tuesday night so please watch it.

1483
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,680
But it wasn't. Well I never saw it

1484
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,700
but I'm busy on Tuesday night.

1485
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,260
Yeah we would have heard about it.

1486
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,460
The way Phineas Narco

1487
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,840
told me uh

1488
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,120
the uh, the over

1489
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,520
cleats one was

1490
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,880
walked into the audition

1491
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,700
and this is according to him.

1492
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,680
He told Phineas that he walked into the audition

1493
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,660
and they said now don't do your

1494
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,640
shtick yet. We just want to talk to

1495
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,520
you as a regular person first then you can

1496
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,860
do your shtick. Well he

1497
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,660
of course immediately went into

1498
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,480
his shtick. Of course.

1499
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,460
And they had to make him

1500
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,520
leave. As we

1501
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,600
all have had. It's like how do you get him

1502
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,620
to shut up? You have

1503
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,480
to push him out the door and

1504
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,080
slam it and lock it.

1505
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,580
And he'll still be out there going

1506
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,500
you call

1507
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,260
me a boy? What do you mean a boy?

1508
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,740
Who do you call a boy?

1509
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,580
A boy. Oh well.

1510
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,640
That's a shame. Terrible.

1511
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,520
It is. I mean because I

1512
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,660
think everybody would have enjoyed seeing him

1513
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,260
on television. Really I

1514
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,560
I was afraid I was going

1515
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,480
to miss it actually but I guess since

1516
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,500
it didn't happen I missed nothing.

1517
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,420
He was beaten with his own

1518
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,420
shtick. No you missed it anyway. It may have happened in

1519
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,600
another dimension and you'll find that out

1520
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,660
pretty soon next couple days. On an alternate

1521
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,200
earth. Yes.

1522
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,840
Wouldn't that be frightful to discover

1523
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,580
that they somehow put

1524
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,540
him in charge as being more

1525
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,420
subgenius than the rest of us and

1526
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,620
we must all serve him.

1527
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,980
And worse than

1528
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,600
Billy Moomy subjugation.

1529
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,280
He might be

1530
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,480
more of a subgenius

1531
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,020
than we are. It is possible.

1532
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,420
As Onan pointed out

1533
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,140
it's

1534
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,480
were Philodrummon and me

1535
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,600
the best people to help Bob

1536
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,260
get his cult off the ground?

1537
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,660
Maybe not. But we were the ones

1538
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,960
that showed up.

1539
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,760
Yeah. Well there you go.

1540
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,520
Just like Woody Allen said you know

1541
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,620
that's the most important

1542
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,300
thing is showing up there and you guys

1543
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,180
did make the scene so to speak.

1544
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,200
I meant that you actually

1545
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,500
fashioned an ideograph in your

1546
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,960
mind of a social

1547
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,380
cultural scene.

1548
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,480
Well

1549
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,540
and look what came

1550
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,740
to pass. Really?

1551
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,900
Yeah.

1552
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,520
This radio

1553
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,860
show. This

1554
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,260
benighted radio show which comes

1555
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,360
to an end in less

1556
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,840
than five minutes.

1557
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,880
This bleeding piece of earth.

1558
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,740
Five minutes?

1559
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,420
This radio show.

1560
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,380
The hour of slack number

1561
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,120
one thousand four twenty one.

1562
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,500
This has been hour

1563
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,480
of slack one thousand four twenty one.

1564
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,580
However I believe that we

1565
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,340
are planning with

1566
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,360
Dr. Sinister's permission to

1567
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,240
hijack radio

1568
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,600
synesthesia as

1569
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,500
hours of slack number one thousand

1570
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,080
four hundred twenty one and twenty two.

1571
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,160
Double or triple because I get two hours.

1572
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,340
It's so hard to keep all these programs.

1573
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,500
As I said yeah there would be two more.

1574
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,240
Yeah. Which would triple

1575
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,660
the hour. Oh make mine

1576
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,440
a triple too.

1577
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,260
Yeah we're all in need of a triple right now.

1578
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,300
I was born on third base and thought I'd be the triple.

1579
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,760
Okay

1580
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,420
sure that's the trifecta.

1581
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,540
Well we've enjoyed serving you

1582
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,660
haven't we? Etherettes

1583
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,760
and rocket rookies.

1584
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,540
Just like one of those little subgeniuses.

1585
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,840
It's a phone book!

1586
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,080
It's a phone book!

1587
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,280
Yes now they

1588
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,400
will have your number for

1589
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,040
all infinity.

1590
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,940
That's five five five five five five five.

1591
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,460
Bob! Bob!

1592
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,400
Does not count!

1593
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,400
Because he's already got your number.

1594
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,780
How about that?

1595
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,620
How about them apples?

1596
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,100
Yeah I mean repent.

1597
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,600
Jesus may have to count how many prayers

1598
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,780
he's getting every day.

1599
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,300
Mohammed has to count how many virgins

1600
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,240
he's gonna dole out to each martyr.

1601
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,540
But Bob does not count

1602
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,960
because he's already got your number.

1603
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,320
Buddy.

1604
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,140
I believe that

1605
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,420
new line was

1606
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,640
channeled by a relatively

1607
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,060
new minister.

1608
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,420
I think Reverend

1609
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,540
Howard. A relative eh?

1610
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,660
Yes I think I might have

1611
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,220
heard that on the hour of slack about

1612
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,320
three years ago.

1613
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,440
Oh really? Well then if I said it

1614
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,100
then you better pick up on it.

1615
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,380
Well I'm saying you're going through your temporal

1616
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,340
dysfunction thing again right now. You know what's

1617
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,120
recently this happened? No it

1618
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,940
happened twelve years ago.

1619
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,440
And time often gets out of joint.

1620
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,480
This is nothing that

1621
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,620
isn't covered by the warranty.

1622
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,740
Oh it's an LSD flashback again.

1623
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,720
Oh it's an

1624
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,380
LSD flashback again.

1625
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,280
Oh it's an

1626
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,620
LSD flashback again. And another locust

1627
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,640
came and carried away a grain of wheat.

1628
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,600
I don't know why that struck me

1629
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,180
funny but

1630
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,220
I could just see like

1631
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,000
piles and piles of locusts

1632
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,180
consuming everything.

1633
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,180
The idea of the LSD flashback is a bizarre thing.

1634
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,300
Because an LSD

1635
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,160
trip in and of itself is a series of

1636
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,120
flashbacks. Another locust

1637
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,600
came and carried away a grain of wheat.

1638
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,960
Now how do you know about

1639
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,140
things like that Dr. Sinister? You don't

1640
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,920
look like some sort of hippie type.

1641
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,840
I have ways of knowing things.

1642
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,060
LSD. I have ways of

1643
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:21,600
knowing things.

1644
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,020
When you take the LSD it is a

1645
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,700
super conscious state.

1646
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,800
Infra dignitatem.

1647
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,040
Marijuana is the gun

1648
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,920
and LSD is the

1649
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,340
Bob.

1650
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,820
You might even hear that soon.

1651
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,100
We all know that Bob has killed far more people

1652
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,820
than all the guns that ever were put together.

1653
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,040
That's right and he's

1654
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,720
an object too. Many of your

1655
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,760
conservative sociologists like

1656
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,900
Jumbo Reality and SimGar and

1657
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,580
Slappy and all those guys like that

1658
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,280
they contend that

1659
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:55,600
they're not just

1660
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:55,600


1661
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,760
Okay, the show's over.

1662
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,620
You have been listening to the Hour of Slack from the

1663
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,500
Subgenius Radio Ministry,

1664
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,660
Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118,

1665
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,060
subgenius.com.

1666
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,360
Thank you.

1667
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,660
Well I suppose I should call back

1668
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,360
here in a brief moment.

1669
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,200
Welcome futurists,

1670
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,320
cyberphiles and the rest of you

1671
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,160
shapeless wonders.

1672
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,500
And now to push this convention into hyperspace,

1673
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,420
the man who put

1674
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,500
Star Wars, a real bird in the Darth Vader's

1675
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,620
saddle, Bob.

1676
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,300
Bob. You still got it Bob.

1677
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,860
Hello and welcome.

1678
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,340
Our topic today is UFOs.

1679
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,220
Of course that's just the start.

1680
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,840
Throughout recorded history,

1681
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,080
human society has been haunted by

1682
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,320
reports of unidentified flying objects

1683
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,100
in our skies. Many of

1684
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,920
which have defied all attempts

1685
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,020
at scientific explanation or

1686
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,080
understanding. What are these phenomena

1687
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,800
and how can they be explained?

1688
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,280
With me today is Terence McKenna,

1689
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,420
a philosopher and thinker of note

1690
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,460
in the area of altered states of consciousness

1691
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,600
and alternative realities.

1692
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,940
Yes, well the ordinary approach

1693
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,080
to the UFOs has been to

1694
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,700
view them as visitors

1695
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,080
or intruders from a nearby

1696
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,920
star system that have

1697
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,900
come in metal ships

1698
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,020
for reasons of trade

1699
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,040
or scientific investigation

1700
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,140
or military conquest

1701
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,560
or missionary activity.

1702
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,040
Or missionary activity. Let me tell you,

1703
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,100
you're not the missionary type. You never last.

1704
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,040
And incidentally, you want to do mankind

1705
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,580
a real service? Tell funnier jokes.

1706
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,800
And therefore

1707
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,380
it is threatening.

1708
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,920
This is one of the reasons that

1709
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,120
I think it relates to the psychedelic

1710
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,060
experience. Because the psychedelic

1711
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,580
experience is like a

1712
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,900
UFO encounter on

1713
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,380
demand.

1714
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,300
Whoa,

1715
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,340
another acid flashback.

1716
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,740
Whoa,

1717
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,600
another acid flashback.

1718
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,860
Whoa,

1719
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,860
another acid flashback.

1720
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,080
Whoa,

1721
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,620
half your yellow

1722
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,300
will lift you into orbit.

1723
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,940
Real rocket man.

1724
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,960
I'll take two.

1725
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,240
That would probably chill a horse.

1726
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,040
I said I'll take two.

1727
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,700
Whatever.

1728
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,180
They decide to have this curious

1729
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,180
symmetry breaking kind of experience.

1730
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,880
What I have tried to say

1731
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,820
to the UFO community is

1732
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,160
I know, I know what I'm doing.

1733
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,360
I'm after God.

1734
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,640
Hey mister, do you need some help?

1735
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,140
Let him go, Ralph. He knows what he's doing.

1736
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,940
We will not really have a deep

1737
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,700
understanding of what the contact

1738
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,940
experience is until we

1739
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,160
include data from the psychedelic

1740
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,220
experience as a legitimate

1741
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,760
data

1742
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,880
to be included when looking at

1743
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,640
the problem. The UFO

1744
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,460
phenomenon is a modern

1745
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,420
manifestation of pixies,

1746
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,720
elves, fairies,

1747
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,000
sprites, demons, whatever you

1748
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,920
wish to call them.

1749
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,140
Angels.

1750
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,900
I love you.

1751
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,980
I love you.

1752
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,960
I do.

1753
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,180
Angel baby.

1754
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,000
My angel baby.

1755
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:38,760
My angel baby.

1756
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,820
My angel baby.
