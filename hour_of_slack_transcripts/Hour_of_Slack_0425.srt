1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,420
Listen to In Our Neighborhood Thursdays here on Trino to be a show up going on in your neighborhood.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,400
Looks demanding change.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,980
Yeah, I know it's a night of change.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,560
Spooky show.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,680
And sick. I've got a fever. I'm delirious.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,500
You'll forgive me.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:37,460
This background music, by the way, is from our good friends Jay Condom and Gary Panter from their picture disc, One Hell Sound Witch.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,740
And speaking of that generation and comic books and so forth, there's a...

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,560
I just wanted to mention, too, Out There. It starts...

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,200
Well, it's supposed to start.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,380
Yeah, hold on.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,260
Sorry, we had a slightly different button pushed on here. We'll just do that again.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,340
Let's start from scratch. Let's do it a nice show this time.

14
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,220
It'll be a nice subgenius radio show.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,560
Yeah, there we go.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,680
Something... none of that ugly music anymore. Sorry, Jay.

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,440
Yeah, let's just lay back. Let's just...

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh, sorry. I guess it is going to be ugly after all.

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm going to tell you a story about a man named Bob.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,900
How I feel for him.

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm going to tell you a story about a man named Bob.

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,400


23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,220
Hey, look, this radio works all right.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,140
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,340
The radio audience is listening.

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:12,080
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,960
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,260
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,880
That you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,520
And only in the city of...

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,280
It's not that we need the money. It's just that to destroy the concept of money, totally.

32
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,300
It's going to take money, my friend. It's going to take a lot of money.

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,060
There are some interesting details relating to all this. Now listen.

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,240


35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
I predict we will travel...

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,460
By means of non-gravity, a set of a personal wings.

37
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,500
Moving platforms which float through the air.

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,720
We will also take a pill which makes us lighter than air.

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,700
Nothing will travel on the ground.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,440
Freeways and streets will vanish and be replaced by small landing fields on the very roof of your very home.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Jump in bed and cover up your hat because Santa Claus comes home tonight.

42
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,480
Here comes Santa.

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,660
Santa Claus. Here comes Santa Claus. Here comes Santa Claus. Here comes Santa Claus. Here comes Santa Claus.

44
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,580
Right down Santa Claus Lane.

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,440
There he is. We got somebody here. All right.

46
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,200
State chart question please.

47
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,480
How the hell is life going on?

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, it happens.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
We can't answer that but not until 6 AM.

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,040
Mankind will endure.

51
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,640
Thank you. Okay. Right on.

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,340
Yeah. Okay. Go ahead, Carlos.

53
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,360
Oh, oh, there it is again. All right.

54
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,580
Do I... Why did you get that one in August?

55
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,700
Oh my God. It's all the phones in the world.

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,000
The phone.

57
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,980
There's no phone ringing. You got it?

58
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,720
All right. Calm down. You know, what's so terrible about a telephone ring?

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,540
There is no home.

60
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,860
But Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,960
But I'm telling you...

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,620
Thank God. It's almost dark.

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,040
No, not God. I tried to make that distinction very clear.

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,420
Thank God you know what the phone is!

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,640
All right.

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,200
When he got it, kids like you didn't mind it?

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,620
I tried talking to dad the whole time.

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,620


69
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,620


70
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:48,260
So here's one more thing.

71
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,260


72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,900
Go through Google looks.

73
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:59,860
Bob Dobbs might give my life, but when I see your slack-jawed grin, you know it more than makes it up to me.

74
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,820
For even so, I still remain your servant for eternity.

75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,020
Bob Dobbs was all my joy, and oh Bob Dobbs was my delight.

76
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:29,800
Bob Dobbs, you wrecked my life, but I still praise Bob Dobbs.

77
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,800
For Bob I will always be your servant, and I will always be your servant.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:38,800


79
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,680
I'll launch the bleeding head, for Bob I kill, for Bob I steal.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,980
I'll serve Bob Dobbs until I'm dead, or till I find a better deal.

81
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:05,140
And then when X-Day comes at last, and we escape from these pinks that we hate,

82
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,640
we'll get paid off in...

83
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,120
And then when X-Day comes at last, and we escape from these pinks that we hate,

84
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,820
we'll get paid off in...

85
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,260
Bob Dobbs was all my joy, and Bob Dobbs was my delight.

86
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,340
Bob Dobbs, you wrecked my life, but I still praise Bob Dobbs.

87
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,320
Bob Dobbs.

88
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,420


89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Bob Dobbs was all my joy, and Bob Dobbs was my delight.

90
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,480
joy

91
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,620
and oh Bob Dobbs

92
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,520
was my delight

93
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,880
Bob Dobbs

94
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,040
he wrecked my life

95
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,640
but I still

96
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,080
praise Bob Dobbs

97
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,340
I'll kill you

98
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,900
someday

99
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
Bob Dobbs

100
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,000
but I still

101
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,720
praise

102
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,500
Bob Dobbs

103
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,540
Bob Dobbs

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:23,200
oh Bob

105
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,380
I feel for you

106
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,960
I would do anything for you Bob

107
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,820
I'd sit over backwards

108
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,260
and kiss my own fat butt

109
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,900
for you Bob

110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,040
I predict that your television set

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,480
will come

112
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,800
and cover one side of your wall

113
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
and the figures there will be three dimensional

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,220
and almost walk out

115
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,140
into the room

116
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,700
in natural color

117
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,060
breathing living

118
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,020
with odors to match

119
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,720
you will enjoy the bracing air of the northwest

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,300
the warm enchantment of the south seas

121
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,040
or the swill of the jungle

122
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,400
I predict education

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
will be given children through the television screen

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,620
no personal teachers

125
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,760
but there will be a warden

126
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,460
on duty to see that 100%

127
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,780
interest is sustained

128
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,740
later

129
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,140
yeah there's gonna be one of these in every kid's living room

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,540
looks like it's underwater

131
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,500
are we underwater

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,740
that's the ripple

133
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,540
oh I see

134
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,020
there we go

135
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,600
there we go

136
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,200
I think we're pumped

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,300
bring the picture up out of the bottom of the ocean

138
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,920
it's getting a little sharper

139
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,320
yeah

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,000
look at these amazing creatures

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,960
budding like plants

142
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,160
they hop frantically about a frenzied landscape

143
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,680
operating at a metabolic level vastly superior

144
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
in speed and efficiency

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,380
That of all creatures on the planet earth

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,480
Qué más rapidez

147
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,800
La personalidad es...

148
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,360
Speechless

149
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,220
Music

150
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,000
Thanks for watching

151
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,580
Subtitles provided by путs

152
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:03,600
Thanks for your time

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,040
Me and Eda message team

154
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,260
I've got some minimal stress

155
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,720
I've got some minimal stress

156
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,020
I've got some minimal stress

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,380
I've got some minimal stress

158
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,960
I thought that I could just close myself off from the pink world

159
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,640
and, as Bob tells us, relax in the safety of my own delusions.

160
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,740
But, dear friends, history shows us that sometimes even Bob himself

161
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,100
has had to put down his pipe, wade into that primordial slime,

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,300
and kick some monkey boy butt.

163
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,940
Oh, Bob, rewind my life into a world without pinks!

164
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,820
Oh, I'm not talking about the boys and the girls in the pink triangle T-shirts.

165
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,860
You know which pinks I'm ranting on here.

166
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,340
The pink boys with a conspiracy to rip away our slack

167
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,500
like a begrudged teat from a desperate infant.

168
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,280
But them, the Poe Buckers,

169
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,080
the normals.

170
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,620
Hello, friends, and welcome.

171
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,420
Would you believe there are still some people out there

172
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,420
who deny the existence of the conspiracy?

173
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
It seems impossible, doesn't it?

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,080
Despite all the evidence and common sense that point out the obvious,

175
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,780
there are still those who believe the world is flat

176
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,740
and the conspiracy is a myth.

177
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,880
Allow me, then, to offer yet more empirical evidence

178
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,480
that the conspiracy not only exists,

179
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,140
but exists everywhere and with one goal in mind.

180
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,760
To steal away your slack.

181
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,340
Those in the know know that the conspiracy prioritizes its assaults

182
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,900
against mankind's most enableable human rights.

183
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,340
This makes sense.

184
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,840
They only have until 1998 to completely subvert all humanity,

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,980
so they have to go for the jugular.

186
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,900
Now, there are four things that every subgenius enjoys.

187
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,360
Sleep, food, taking a dump, and having sex.

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,560
Some people combine the last two activities,

189
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,580
but that's another sermon.

190
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,440
These pleasures are among mankind's most basic instincts,

191
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,900
and without them, he, she, or it cannot truly have slack.

192
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,660
Some may try to add other activities to the list,

193
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,840
but these are the classic pleasures in which everyone enjoys

194
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,940
and nobody can become completely tired of.

195
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,200
Just think about it.

196
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,600
You spend almost a third of your entire life asleep,

197
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,920
yet you never get tired of it.

198
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,280
You do it almost every single night,

199
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
yet you still look forward to it.

200
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,340
Now, this is a very important point.

201
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,360
Now, that's entertainment.

202
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,140
Those with insomnia enjoy sleeping even more than others.

203
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,400
It's the not sleeping part that they dread.

204
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,020
The same goes for eating.

205
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,600
Even Karen Carpenter loved eating.

206
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,180
She loved it so much, she wanted to cough it all up

207
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,880
and start all over again, hopefully with a different meal.

208
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,540
And, of course, sex needs no explanation.

209
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,200
Now, up until now, the conspiracy has only attacked

210
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,840
three of those four basic human rights.

211
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,820
They add stress to everyone's lives so they have difficulty sleeping.

212
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,320
Then they go to sleep.

213
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,540
They turn right around and try to sell you sleeping pills

214
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,080
so you can do what you used to do for free,

215
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,500
only now for a small profit.

216
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,580
Next, they market this image that being attractive

217
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,440
can only happen if you're slim.

218
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,940
Now, any student of history knows

219
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,920
that up until movies and television came along,

220
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,880
being skinny was considered gross.

221
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,180
Being pleasantly plump was the ideal

222
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,720
from the 19th century all the way back to the orangutan days.

223
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,140
It was considered healthy, which it is.

224
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
It was considered fun, which it is also.

225
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,380
It was considered sexy, which it most definitely is.

226
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,020
But, not according to the conspiracy control media,

227
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,220
no, sir, anything over a mouthful is wasted.

228
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,500
Can you believe it?

229
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,300
Of course you can, because you're probably programmed to.

230
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,500
Now you've got to be skin and bones to be attractive.

231
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,300
Go figure.

232
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,840
They also jack up the prices of food,

233
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,840
the cheapest thing in the world to make.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,240
It's on solar energy and grows in dirt.

235
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,740
But now you've got to pay big bucks for it.

236
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,540
And all for the packaging and commercials.

237
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,780
One tastes bad, the other has no taste,

238
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,180
yet they cost the most.

239
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,160
That's the conspiracy for you.

240
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,320
And, of course, sex.

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,760
I think I love you

242
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,980
I think I love you

243
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,980
I think I love you

244
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,040
I think I love you

245
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,060
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel for you

246
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,860
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel for you

247
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,080
I'll have to be the first to admit

248
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,940
I've done a mess of sinning myself.

249
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,520
I had to to get into the position I'm in in this ministry.

250
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,660
But I never feel so filthy dirty

251
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,000
as when life compels me to get involved in the affairs of mere humans.

252
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,400
But this latest conspiracy mortar shell

253
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,880
hit a little too close to home to ignore.

254
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,140
See, my church, the holy disorder of St. Rhonda,

255
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,980
fast living and no consequences,

256
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,520
happens to be located right smack dab

257
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,700
in the center of the hive right now, Cobb County, Georgia.

258
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,400
A sleepy little bedroom community.

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,000
Or it was until they started looking into everybody else's bedrooms.

260
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,580
Now it's become American Gothic horror.

261
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,540
Oh, the county commission said,

262
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Oh, why, if you're not a white Fred, God-fearing, cross-burning normal,

263
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,060
well, we don't want you living in our community.

264
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,500
Now, that good old lady,

265
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,280
that old southern trailer park painting place wife-beating,

266
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,180
booze-guzzling, child-abusing lifestyle,

267
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,260
well, that's A-OK with us,

268
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,020
but we think you homos is going just a little too far

269
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,740
with this love business.

270
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,560
No offense now.

271
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,240
Well, dear friends, not being a flower of the South myself,

272
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,680
am I missing something in the translation here?

273
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,320
They got all bent out of shape over something as mundane

274
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,000
as mere human sexuality?

275
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,700
Oh, I guess that's what you get for only using 10% of your brain.

276
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,280
Oh, I guess they haven't heard about the subgenius concept of sex hurt.

277
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,080
What about the polymorphously perverse pansexuality of Connie?

278
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,980
Why, they had any idea about what goes on at a typical initiation ride

279
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,540
into the bovoid mysteries of Connie Dobbs?

280
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,040
Why, they just spontaneously combust right there on the spot.

281
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,540
Oh, we here in the church think that if you want to de-beak your prairie squid,

282
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,160
uh, a consenting prairie squid, of course,

283
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,240
well, we personally think that's a matter between you, the squid,

284
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,860
the Stolson Ranch, and the WD-40.

285
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,620
Here in the Church of the Subgenius, we welcome, nay,

286
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,940
we get down and wallow like hogs!

287
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,800
We're the Stolson or Diversity!

288
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,720
This is the one religion that will take you as you are!

289
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,900
The others want to take you and smush you and fold you and twist you up into a little wad

290
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,700
and try to ram you around to fit in their little template.

291
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,240
Their idea of goodness and worthiness.

292
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,440
Ha! Diversity! That's a lifeblood of this church!

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,280
Two subgeniuses are exactly alike. One has to die!

294
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,540
If you're gay, we think your head's in the right place.

295
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:59,040
Bob says to seize the slack that's rightfully yours by not denying what makes you happy,

296
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,420
by not living their lie, by looking your in the eye like a true yeti.

297
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,460
Ugh!

298
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,560
Whoo! Boy, I've got a hate on here!

299
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,520
You can't stick your neck out without some backbone to push it,

300
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,320
but thanks to Bob and Connie, I've got some extra help.

301
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,140
I know it's still five years until those sweet angels of Bob

302
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,500
come swooping down to take us away.

303
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,640
Oh, five years to go till X-Day.

304
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,300
But until the X's hordes arrive, we've got to keep a death grip on the precious slack we still have left.

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,780
These normals here are committing grand theft slack right on my doorstep,

306
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,120
and Reverend Flues ain't standing still for it.

307
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm serving notice. You try to steal my slack and I'll rim-slap you inside out, pink boys!

308
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,380
I'll kick and scratch and bite!

309
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,280
I'll fight like a girl to save my slack!

310
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,640
The low blow and the cheap shot are sacraments in my church, Buster!

311
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,000
I like getting three dollar bills in my change!

312
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,500
You ought to pick on someone your own size, and do they make human women that small?

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,420
I feel, I feel, think, think, think, think I love ya!

314
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,520
Love you, Bob. Love you, Bob. Love you, Bob.

315
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,340
What's that?

316
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,240
Took a dawn?

317
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,880
What?

318
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,120
Took a dawn?

319
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,780
Hey!

320
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,460
Took a dawn?

321
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,580
Hey!

322
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,240
Took a dawn?

323
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,040
And of course, sex.

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,860
You used to have as many wives as you wanted.

325
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,180
They took that away first.

326
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,160
They claim it was immoral, even though it's in the Bible.

327
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,340
Now you can't even have sex without fear of dying from it,

328
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,700
and don't tell me the conspiracy's got nothing to do with AIDS.

329
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
But, taking a dump.

330
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,320
That one, that's the one thing they couldn't fool with.

331
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,600
All their marketeers and media mongos combined,

332
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,480
couldn't come up with a way to ruin the most simple pleasure.

333
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,380
Oh sure, they created paid toilets,

334
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,460
and that became a minor inconvenience in public places,

335
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,000
but try as they might, they still couldn't figure out a way to ruin the fun in your own home.

336
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,640
Until now.

337
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,220
A camera eye will follow you from the day of your birth,

338
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,540
until the day of your death,

339
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,160
and if you go to the right place, beyond.

340
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,940
But the cowardly caller shrunk back.

341
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,400
Hello, hello, hello.

342
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,020
Oh, there, there we go.

343
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,060
Much better.

344
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,760
What are you doing?

345
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,980
We're doing show.

346
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,560
What is it called?

347
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,320
Strangers and Wonderful Words?

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,880
It has a specific function.

349
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,060
It is a wonderful word.

350
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,040
It's an amalgam of many talents.

351
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,500
A wonderful world of weird, whirling words.

352
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,860
Oh, that's wonderful.

353
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,540
You always come on this time?

354
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,660
Yes, it's a really wonderful world.

355
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,580
Of whirling words, yeah, okay.

356
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,900
Is this something new?

357
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,540
Yeah, this is something new, and you're speaking to Reverend Howe.

358
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,420
It's new, it's snazzy.

359
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,260
And he can tell you what you were in a former life.

360
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,760
Dabby, wacky, fluffy, puffy.

361
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,160
You know, a dinosaur in a plastic bag.

362
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,140
And it's been going on for more than ten years now.

363
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,880
You're in a lonely location.

364
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,820
So, how come we couldn't move up to the other hours?

365
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,920
How would you tune into her and tell her what she was?

366
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,420
Well, we broadcast from a rock-bound island on the icy Atlantic.

367
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,560
Well, how come the other part of the station in the afternoon doesn't carry your thing?

368
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,940
The afternoon is too mellow a time.

369
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,100
That is the question, isn't it? You have to write them and ask them about that.

370
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,040
Yes, have us played in prime time.

371
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,400
Why they don't have us on at a better time than 5.13 a.m.?

372
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
But, my friend is only being polite.

373
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,180
Everyone knows that if we were broadcast at prime time, civilization as it is known would come to an end.

374
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,620
That would be a good thing.

375
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,120
Some think otherwise.

376
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,300
Yes.

377
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,960
There are sinister forces who even now, behind the scenes, plot your doom and mine.

378
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,840
Ah, ha, ha. Strange and peculiar.

379
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,700
Now, me, I was going to take a dump the other day and do some reading.

380
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,300
That's where most subgenius do their reading and thinking, for that matter.

381
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,600
We call it extra meditation.

382
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,660
Anyway, I'm sitting there enjoying one of my favorite activities, thinking how great it is that you never get tired of taking a dump.

383
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,520
No matter how many times you've done it in the past, you still enjoy doing it almost every single time.

384
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,340
If only sex were as good.

385
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,080
And maybe sex would be as good, except they've taken all the fun out of the variety it used to offer.

386
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Some people think that they're tired of sex, but what they're really tired of is sex with the same worn-out partner.

387
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,360
Because sex is like eating.

388
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,940
You get tired of it if you had the same thing every single day.

389
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,740
You gotta get out there and taste the world.

390
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,440
History shows the next step is herding the subgeniuses into the wet stadium.

391
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,040
And mowing them down with automatic weapons fire.

392
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,060
We've seen it happen before.

393
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,460
It's apparently all too ironic that Linz, Germany is Marietta, Georgia's sister city.

394
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,180
Linz, Germany. The hometown of Adolf Hitler.

395
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:08,160
The pinks will kowtow to whichever bond has the word family values printed the biggest across its swastika.

396
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,280
This is turning out like a bad Criswell prediction.

397
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,420
Oh, they didn't go after the subgeniuses first, because they didn't want to.

398
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,420


399
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,280
Because we're just so dang hard for them to pigeonhole.

400
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,260
We don't fit anywhere on their slide rule.

401
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,980
They couldn't nail down the legalese for just plain weird.

402
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,600
For one thing, it feels good to use the same toilet.

403
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
Like an old shoe.

404
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,140
No matter how many times you use the same one, you just kind of grow more fond of it.

405
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,540
Even in a public place, you'll find yourself instinctively returning to that same old John every single time.

406
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,040
So, so what could they do?

407
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:53,360
Well, I discovered to my horror the other day, when, as I completed what up to that point had been a perfect excremeditation experience,

408
00:22:53,860 --> 00:23:02,120
I reached around behind, no pun intended, for the toilet paper, and guess what those bastards had printed on my T.P.?

409
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,320
They had pictures of seashells.

410
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,880
Seashells!

411
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,520
I mean, come on, what's next?

412
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,280
Pictures of razor blades?

413
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,580
Barbed wire?

414
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,960
Food graders?

415
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,700
Wake up and smell the coffee, friends.

416
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,560
Accidents like this do not happen accidentally.

417
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,620
There is a conspiracy, and it is not adverse to punching you below the belt.

418
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,160
Open your eyes.

419
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,040
See it, believe it, and know they are out to ruin your slack.

420
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,600
And nothing is too sacred to them.

421
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,660
Anywhere, anytime.

422
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,140
Expect it, pal.

423
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,260
And don't be caught with your pants down, because they're not.

424
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,560
Because believe me, even paranoids have enemies.

425
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,260
And nobody is safe until July 5, 1998.

426
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,800
Hear the thro' of Bob.

427
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,480
Praise Bob!

428
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,360
Amen.

429
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,580
Crouch in this hellhole, have nowhere to go.

430
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,920
Crouch in this hellhole, have nowhere to go.

431
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,340
I've got some minimal stress.

432
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
I've got some minimal stress.

433
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,120
I've got some minimal stress.

434
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,520
I've got some minimal stress.

435
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,420
It's a short step from sex crime to thought crime.

436
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,620
And they'd better lock me up for what I'm thinking now.

437
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,700
Because we can think, we do think.

438
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,620
At least those two of us with higher brain functions.

439
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:33,780
And we won't just lie back snoozing while those conspiracy bumpers hounds steal our Thanksgiving turkey of slack right off the table under our noses.

440
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,640
They'll not find us easy prey.

441
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,640
We've got this dark Mr. Bob backing us up.

442
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,640
We're not complacent sheep.

443
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,720
sheep it's pronounced bob not we will not be let into the slaughterhouse of our slack by the

444
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,840
opinions of a few jerk water politicians mere human ones at that i see okay if you have these

445
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,500
multi-million dollar projects in the works why are you still doing shows at places as uh hellish

446
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,440

450
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,100
will really you know fall prey to this bob scam well i can't help it if uh you know the younger

451
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:39,120
people are into uh other drugs that don't uh require uh an id or you know they're selling a

452

alcohol at the middle east cafe okay just want to interject that i always have to bring in the

ageist thing ageism um so is fame and fortune what you are seeking well not really i just want to be

454
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,520
well known enough to where i would have heard of me if i weren't the person that was doing this in

455
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:06,900
the first place oh my friend how far have you progressed from the stone age how far have we

456
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,400
progressed are the present doctors really miracle men of medicine what have they cured what have they

457
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:24,040
controlled in the next few minutes you will be shown a special example my friend this is not

458
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,820
the 10th century but the 20th century i firmly suggest that if you are squeamish

459

docs okay a final score touchdown while he's talking to us mentally on the foos board downstairs

470
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:31,720
i think look at the board line up this is a great score but uh the interroger seems to get a little

471
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,280
fuzzy again here oh don't worry about it i told you well you're gonna regulate this screen we'll make

472
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,160
it smell that way

473
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,940
the wiring burned out solenoid yeah it's the female plugs in the wiring we use okay

474
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,100
yeah well inhibiting factors here with us right now and then over on the other side

475
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:59,220
this is a four-way connection which is really my voice i just decided to call in at the right time

476
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,260
you know we hooked it up i feel like he was here yesterday and he recorded that

477
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,860
oh everything gets recorded in the akashic records recorded twice

478
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:18,080
oh yes yes no no stop the theme of doc stock stock for those who weren't uh who didn't suffer

479
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:26,920
through it last week is the uh subgenius re-indoctrination uh education camp uh that's

480
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:34,980
held out in the woods for the noble subgenius doctors and uh musicians those who operate to

481
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,880
rip and tear into each other um creatively

482
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:47,680
it was uh i think this was doc stock number 46 or 0.01 101 something like that and uh it was as

483
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,820
important as the post-ritual instructions with saint byron werner at the temple of the big

484
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:00,860
blue cylindrical life force that seemed friends to emanate the true essence of dobs and his fusion

485
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:09,320
from aleph to yoma mama perhaps not but how can we beat how can we

486
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:18,920
express the ineluctable modality of our sodality dear friend no we can't that's the problem we just

487
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,940
can't uh but we can give credits uh right now at this half hour point you've been listening to well

488
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:32,800
at the top of the show we have that lovely song what bob is this uh by reverend g i believe his

489
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:39,360
name is g stafford in tokyo japan yes that came from tokyo now the

490
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:50,420
general barrage as there's been some uh ugly music by saint joe riley chriswell predicts and

491
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:58,940
predicts and uh kpfa with dr hall of course um i think there was a band called nude gangsters

492
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:06,200
doing minimal stress but mainly the great ranting of reverend suzy the floozy from one show in

493
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,420
atlanta intercut for very serious reasons and i think that's the thing that's been going on for a

494
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,680
long time is that the people who have been doing the ranting have been doing the ranting for a long

495
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,680


496
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:19,320
reasons with uh rant by uh papa joe mama from alabama i believe is where he is now he's hard to

497
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:27,080
track so we've had joe riley joe mama and suzy the floozy all chopped up because either of those

498
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,100
taken as a whole would have gotten us into a great deal of trouble we would have ended up in the hole

499
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:39,420
they'd never get out of that hole friends we'd never get out because well somehow we thought that

500
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,420


501
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:46,880
if we spread it a little more thin we could get away with it and uh that's just what we have to do

502
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,640
sometimes so praise uh uh father joe mama reverend suzy the floozy there may be still some more of

503
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,000
that and a little bit of jayner hyper cleats there but what have they controlled what have they cured

504
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,940
have the doctors fulfilled their great promise well you can find out by writing the doctors

505
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,500
i just address that to bob

506
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,640
at this post office box number i'm about to give p.o box one four zero three zero six

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,660

00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


512
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,680
so

513
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,280
you

514
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,420
you

515
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,040
you

516
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,060
you

517
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,080
you

518
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,100
you

519
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,100


520
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,100


521
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,100


522
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,560
And that happened at Dockstock.

523
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,280
But that wasn't nearly as...

524
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,980
See, I'm delirious, for instance.

525
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,400
This Dockstock virus has just got me...

526
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,880
It's got me just wearing down.

527
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,340
Batteries, batteries, just all...

528
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,180
I need a recharge.

529
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,140
I need to sap into the power of some listener out there.

530
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:31,780
Hmm.

531
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,480
Let me whiff.

532
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,440
Yes, I smell a new one.

533
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,680
They're easy to recognize.

534
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:37,940
Guys?

535
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,480
Oh, yeah!

536
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,720
That's special.

537
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,180
Yes, I'm sure you know by now that we have all of your...

538
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,440
I do, and that's all there is to it.

539
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,020
Well, there's been several times I definitely could say that I just...

540
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,160
Once I decided to.

541
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,160
Yes, sir, right off, just quit talking.

542
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,140
And I did...

543
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,300
I searched in vain for Janer,

544
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,660
only to find out...

545
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,720
Later, he's in his mini-tent practicing sexual deprivation.

546
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,200
All of his groupies have gone to call Buck naked.

547
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,300
And where is Buck?

548
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,780
Oh.

549
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,880
Later in the day, the night, what was it?

550
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,180
I found myself trying to sing along with Bob.

551
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

552
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,260
Everyone but Stan was sound asleep in the back of the helicopter.

553
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,520
And as usual, he was lying next to someone else,

554
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,300
and vibrating several thousand times a second.

555
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,180
But autonomic overload has always been Stan's lot,

556
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,980
ever since the Hinky Commission concluded he was totally uninvolved

557
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,560
with any conspiracy whatsoever.

558
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,640
And furthermore, he only had one-third of a soul anyway,

559
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,820
so what could he really know about the hellish,

560
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,040
unhuman, bloody rights of the rest of the doctors,

561
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,560
and what it was they were really doing

562
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,020
while he was busy trying to tape everything?

563
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,200
I always remember,

564
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:08,800
you know,

565
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,460
Ok,

566
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,320
you know,

567
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,840
Ok,

568
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,800
I know.

569
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,580
I know.

570
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,940
I know.

571
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,820
So no solving for Bob.

572
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:32,800


573
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:32,800


574
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:32,920
is that as long as we top of the left agreement,

575
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:32,920


576
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:32,920


577
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:32,920


578
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:32,920


579
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:32,920


580
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:32,920


581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,140
I did and he kept him busy.

582
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,660
But I never really bettered him around because reinvigilizing was his campaign.

583
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
Bye.

584
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,000
As you continue listening to this tape,

585
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,020
you will learn why it would be impossible for you not to see results.

586
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,660
And as you continue with the Mindpower program over the next several months,

587
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,720
you will see that you can create for yourself the kind of life you've always wanted.

588
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,460
Call now, won't you?

589
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,880
For more of what you've come to expect from us.

590
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,860
Star.

591
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,740
Mood.

592
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,360
A certain...

593
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,640
A certain...

594
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,500
A dependable kind of image.

595
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,440
An image of the way you like people to be.

596
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,620
Passive.

597
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,060
Pretty.

598
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,480
But...

599
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,380
As wide as the complexion of our finest women,

600
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,720
grown right here by our special process.

601
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,080
As wide as the hair of God,

602
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,960
wide as it was in life.

603
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,980
As wide as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

604
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,120
Who are we?

605
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,160
We're the happy people.

606
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,520
We are professionals.

607
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,380
Do not attempt to do this show at home.

608
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,620
Have the fan running in the room when you start the show

609
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,960
because it'll leave that sludge all over the place.

610
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,740
Oh!

611
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,260
Dump.

612
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,980
Those things you do to me, Bob, you freak me out.

613
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,980
That's not Bob.

614
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,280
Ah.

615
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,620
Nothing.

616
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,720
Ah.

617
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:08,940


618
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,720
Wet brain, wet brain.

619
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm in wet brain.

620
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,340
Wet where?

621
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:24,860
Get in here.

622
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,840
Wet brain's in.

623
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,600
There we go.

624
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,140
The puzzling evidence program changed up again.

625
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,820
Wet brain's in.

626
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,340
Dry brain's out.

627
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,760
Oh.

628
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:34,760


629
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,160
Oh.

630
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,880
Wet brain, you know, touching them is fatal to them.

631
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,180
You know, we've told you before how you can see your own brain.

632
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,480
Well, at least you're important.

633
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,720
And tonight, if the time permits,

634
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,780
I'll give you tips on how you can see inside your own eye

635
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,220
with your unaided naked eye.

636
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,900
My brain is actually in the command module.

637
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,400
Remember, the brain must be firmly in control.

638
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,500
And I'd love to.

639
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,720
Seeing back into one's brain is not for everyone.

640
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,780
The procedure?

641
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,920
The procedure can be dangerous.

642
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:13,500
And in some circumstances, can cause violent and hideous death.

643
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,000
All right.

644
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,520
So punch up your home computer for brain scan.

645
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,220
Oh.

646
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,260
Ow.

647
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,160
Ow.

648
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,440
Ow.

649
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:18,980
Take that.

650
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,420
Ow.

651
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,640
Ow.

652
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:19,960
Oh.

653
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,480
Oh.

654
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sorry.

655
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,460
I didn't hurt you, did I, compudo?

656
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,960
Oh, I did?

657
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Well, I'm sorry.

658
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,960
Hey, don't be that way.

659
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,520
Oh.

660
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,580
Oh.

661
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:30,820


662
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:30,880
Ah.

663
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,200
Who's there?

664
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,420
The dream of plummeting sunlight into the eye.

665
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,480
Oh.

666
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,780
There it goes.

667
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,240
Up below.

668
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,540
Up.

669
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,680
There goes that plummeting satellite into the envelope again.

670
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,560
Dr. Holmes.

671
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:39,920
Radio.

672
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,400
Micro.

673
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,160
Three.

674
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,600
Five.

675
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,640
Forensic results in a moment.

676
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,740
But first...

677
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,040
Insane?

678
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,320
Yes, insane.

679
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,980
My enemies called me insane.

680
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,720
Yet they are dead now while I yet live.

681
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,280
How then shall we redefine the term sanity?

682
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,240
Who is more sane?

683
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,840
Who is more in control of the present?

684
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,540
The person who suffers the torments of torture?

685
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,160
Or he who deals it out?

686
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,100
Yes, from a world of strife and turmoil, I bring and offer slack.

687
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:18,000
Only the mind of a genius backed by the savage fist of relentless brutality can bring about the decision on the side it favors.

688
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,580
As long as a single member of the Church of the Subgenius is able to draw breath into his lungs, he shall continue to fight for slack.

689
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:32,160
For the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs, there will be no peace in the land until a normal person's body hangs from every lamp post and tree.

690
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,520
Yes, people used to point at me and say,

691
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:34,900
I am a smile.

692
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,640
And they are still smiling, for as the flesh decomposes around the mouth, a certain macabre, grim parody of a smile is formed.

693
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,060
The normals used to push and shove me around, and now it is I who push and shove them around in boxcarves.

694
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,940
Let history therefore decide if I am a genius or a madman.

695
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,200
And if I am to fail, perhaps in a thousand years a man with a genius similar to my own shall arise.

696
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,580
It will be easy for him, for I have laid the groundwork.

697
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,960
I have shown the way.

698
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,400
Insane.

699
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,660
Well folks, you be the judge.

700
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,880
And I told the judge.

701
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:30,100
Um, no wait, somewhere in the middle of that rant, I heard you use the word genius without the prefix sub to it.

702
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,400
What's going on with that?

703
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,260
Well I get confused sometimes.

704
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:46,520
I mean, I do realize that I'm a genius, but then as soon as I start thinking of myself as a genius, I'll do something like lock my keys in my car, and Bob will remind me that I'm a sub-genius.

705
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,260
Have you ever thought of pressing suit, lawsuit against the label Sub Pop for cashing in on this whole sub thing?

706
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,800
I've never thought at all.

707
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,460
Well I, I decide, I consider...

708
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,080
Sub Pop.

709
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,520
I feel for you Bob.

710
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,720
I love everything about you.

711
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,000
And no, I'll do it with my mouth.

712
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:28,580
Why the other day, I saw a sign in front of East Cobb Baptist Church that truly said,

713
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,000
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.

714
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,760
No kidding, not as I count it.

715
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,600
Not too blatant, is it?

716
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,560
I wonder what the real fighting Jesus would have to say about that.

717
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:51,180
Sex, sex, sex, sex, crime, crime, cra, cra, cra, cra, cra, cra, cra, cra, cra, cra, crime.

718
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,480
Never about an hour.

719
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,920
Here we go, here we go.

720
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,620
I'm in New Design, here we go, here we go.

721
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,860
I still

722
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,620
The Chef looses his appetite.

723
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,380
The magician loses his mystery.

724
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,760
The film director hates going to the movies.

725
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,420
The teacher despises poetry.

726
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,580
The preacher is an atheist, agnostic existentialist.

727
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:33,520
existentialist. The neurologist ridicules his stumbling patients. The veterinarian thinks he's

728
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,040
allergic to cats. The daycare worker can't stand one more minute with these damn noisy kids. The

729
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,780
psychologist knows someone is out to get him, but just isn't sure who. Zim, zam, there it comes.

730
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,720
Complacency has knocked ass over tea kettle, and down goes all established order. Respect for

731
00:43:50,720 --> 00:44:02,060
authority, harmony, beauty, the mysteries of the unknown. Hello, friends, and welcome.

732
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:17,880
And that was indeed. But yet, where do we find, uh, how come I don't have negative land on here,

733
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,700
friends? Well, I'm just gonna have to...

734
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,280
To, uh, stop and tell you what exactly... Well, we never want to tell you exactly what's been

735
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:34,780
going on, but, uh, you have heard just now, in order, uh, a little bit of Doc Stock recordings

736
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:43,260
of Mark Mothersbaugh doing Bob Spangled Banner, a tiny, a short moment of, uh, Reverend Michael

737
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:50,140
Pepe, the song Three Things, Death, Taxes, and Bob, by Don Truby, and, uh,

738
00:44:52,140 --> 00:45:02,620
some more KPFA, Dr. Howland, puzzling evidence, and, of course, the, uh, uh, Janer there on sanity.

739
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:09,960
Good old Janer on sanity. What a frightening thought that is. And, uh, it, and then finally,

740
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:17,800
their Reverend Microphone, I believe, at the very end. And I'm having to switch machines here. For

741
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,700
some reason, we just had a little funny...

742
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,240
Odd, uh, technical thing. Let's see what happens if I punch these buttons.

743
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:37,440
And now, Crosley Bendix, cultural reviewer and director of stylistic premonitions for the Universal Media

744
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:47,560
NetWeb, with today's Arts Review. And now, this morning's Cultural Review.

745
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,320
Cultural Review.

746
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,560
Cultural Review.

747
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,220
Catalyst Norman

748
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,360
madrid

749
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,080
い

750
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,720
FAO

751
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:59,040
ashtrays at Dummyland, was built on the shifting, whispering sands of time, and could not support

752
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:07,820
the increasing weight of all the scholars crossing in search of old ideas forever. Unquote.

753
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:19,440
And now the atomic conductor passes among us. He's oriental. Tickets, please. Do you have yours?

754
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:28,500
Do you know how to operate a computer? Well, there's a computerized ticket dispenser at every

755
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:36,420
station. You can get one if you know how to operate a computer. My advice is, don't bother.

756
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:44,440
This iron horse only goes around and around a man-made duck pond in Dummyland now,

757
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,620
and those sheared bolts on the plate that held the breadbasket under the Bible,

758
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:58,580
just a matter of physics and chemistry, missile strength, pressure points,

759
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:11,100
uniform smelting procedures, oxidation, age. Now we use computer robot steel from Japan,

760
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,760
and there's a Japanese electric train that goes 200 miles per hour around the base of your

761
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,640
Christmas tree.

762
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:27,480
However, their Dummyland is smaller than ours, but theirs is open all night.

763
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:36,740
These contrasts may never be ironed out, not even with steam. The whistle stops here.

764
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:50,600
You've been listening to Culture.

765
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,600
We'll see you next time.

766
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,140
And social critic, Crosley Bendix.

767
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:09,660
Oh, yes. Brought to you actually by Negative Land, dear friends. That's from the Crosley

768
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:16,820
Bendix material, which keeps intruding there. Yes, indeed. What is that Negative Land record

769
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:23,760
called? This is from their own Sealand Records. It's old over-the-edge radio show.

770
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,860
Excerpts. The Crosley Bendix Radio Reviews.

771
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:37,000
And, well, I had a choice here of playing either a yet another Papa Joe Mama rant or

772
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,220
starting tonight to play an old tape that I dug out of a dresser drawer that I recorded

773
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:53,040
in 1974. It's Captain Beefheart and his magic band live in a club in Dallas.

774
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
The Erogant.

775
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:02,600
The Erogant Ballroom. Why, all them years ago, could it really be 20 years ago? And

776
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:09,700
I think it could. I recorded this myself with a Nagra tape recorder, and it doesn't sound

777
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:17,540
bad. But before we go into that actual Captain Beefheart service, I'd like to give you one

778
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,960
more time the address you can write to for more information on the Church of the Subgenius.

779
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,820
Yes, you've been listening to the...

780
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:32,640
Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack. Originating here in beautiful Dallas,

781
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:39,620
Texas. And, yes, there is actually quite a bit more besides the radio show that you can

782
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,160
get your hands on. All you have to do is write for that free information. We tell you about

783
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:52,140
all the books and stuff, but we can't. So we'll... You just ask old Bob. Write to Bob

784
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,120
or Subgenius.

785
00:50:54,140 --> 00:51:06,520
Subgenius or whatever. At. But it has to be the specific address. Box 140306. 140306.

786
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:12,520
That's it. Box 140306. Got that hammered in your head enough in Dallas, Texas. And the

787
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:23,280
zip is 75214. That zip code, once again, 75214. This music in the background is... I don't

788
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,500
know.

789
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:23,680
I don't know.

790
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:23,680


791
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:23,680


792
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:23,680


793
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:31,880
But it is the NERC Twins. They sent us some tape. And they're the NERC Twins. They're

794
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:38,980
coming right up to, I guess, to take us on out, as they say in professional radio. Captain

795
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:45,040
Beefheart live, May 8th, 1974, in Dallas. Good old Captain.

796
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,680

How'd you get your voice to go low like that?

845
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,100
We're trying to get all crazy

846
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,380
Break things down lower than they could be

847
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,600
Break things up higher than they should be

848
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,140
Oh, oh, oh

849
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,720
Yeah, yeah

850
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,240
You got the answer to the answer

851
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,700
Oh, my only question is

852
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:04,440
Girl, girl, how old, how old can you be?

853
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,840
If you don't find out still

854
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,660
You know you're gonna be the drug

855
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,740
Well, they say I'm crazy

856
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,120
I'm hot, she's cold

857
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,540
Crazy little thing, crazy little thing

858
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,340
How old, how old, how old can you be?

859
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,300
Crazy little thing

860
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,980
Just gonna race you

861
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,360
You'll have to get a seat

862
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,940
I'm crazy little thing

863
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,020
I'm in the name of the truth

864
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,780
You're crazy all along

865
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,120
You're crazy all along

866
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,680
Oh, how'd you get a walk?

867
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,800
How'd you get it all to move?

868
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,420
No slow, no pace

869
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,700
How'd you get your voice to go low?

870
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,700
We're trying to get all crazy

871
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,540
Crazy little thing, you're just gone crazy

872
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,160
Girl, how'd you get a seat?

873
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,720
Crazy little thing

874
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,060
How'd you get a seat?

875
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,480
You're crazy all along

876
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,520
Yeah, yeah

877
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,580
You're crazy all along
