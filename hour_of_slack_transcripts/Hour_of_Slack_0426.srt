ðŸŽµ

3
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,520
Are you agitated?

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,440
Bored?

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,920
Confused?

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,960
Lonely?

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,400
Unloved?

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,240
Are you weird?

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,200
Are you bad?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,500
Are you not exactly a team player?

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,160
Every time you go to work, do you feel that a horrible joke is being played on you?

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,040
An evil betrayal of cosmic proportions?

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,480
Had enough?

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,880
Have a nice...

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,520
day?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,080
Tired of all that touchy-feely cosmic sweetness and light crap?

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:20,220
Again, nearly irresistible urges to pound spikes into the eyes of namby-pamby gibbering religious nuts?

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,660
Do you...

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,180
hate everybody?

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,620
Have you always known that there is something going on that they won't tell you about?

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:39,360
Do you wonder what force is actually driving your car when you zone out on the road?

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:49,380
Do you sense a nameless dread that hangs over this sickened society like some strange cloud?

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,040
Do you find yourself questioning if existence is relevant?

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,320
If God believes in you?

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,960
If it's normal to be normal?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:01,600


27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,520
If reality should be what it is?

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,420
If it's wrong to be happy?

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,100
If health is a sin?

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Do impure thoughts literally assail your very being?

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,980
Are you more than ready to confront the dark side of your personality?

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,920
Constantly feeling the urgent need...

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,500
to abandon your hold on everything rational?

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,580
To abandon your hold on everything rational?

35
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,140
And indulge unstoppably your abnormality?

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,500
And indulge unstoppably your abnormality?

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,680
Ever wanted to have crazed sex with beautiful alien beings?

38
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,880
Then this may be for you!

39
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,440
Yes, this radio show may be for you!

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
But, on the other hand...

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,360
Is it...

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,720
Are you one of those people who still think you can reason your way out of this holy mess

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
Yes, this radio show may be for you!

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,500
But, on the other hand...

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:31,540
Is the surface scared to death when how do you think you've got that

46
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:31,540


47
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,460
driven in short to the very brink of sanity by the conspiracy's false reality and the pressure

48
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:48,340
of a crumbling world then you may be in for a hell of a pratfall on a cosmic banana peel

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:55,740
slack off while you still know how time is running out

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,000
looked at it Mike sure I had a surprise look in my face turned to Bob and I said

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,560
do you know what I'm thinking Bob says yeah I know what you're thinking I was really excited

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,380
Bob and I were both really excited but we were in a rock shop and in rock shops they sell things

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,720
and so we were trying really hard to get the money out of the bank and I said I'm gonna go

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:38,040
and I thought to myself something's here I got to know about and Bob picked up a little

55
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,620
dentary with teeth in it he looked at it and his mouth fell open I said you are about to

56
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,080
experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the so genius

57
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,180
watch

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,520
sponsored by the church

59
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,140
I feel for you Bob and

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,020
I think I love you

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,460
I feel for you

62
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,920
I feel for you Bob and you can feel it

63
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,620
so hoist high the bilge water bonnets of perspicacious persnegatives

64
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,360
blow it out your ballast with a low slow flap doodle square off your neck inside a steel

65
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,960
restraining colors of calibrated insinuations dredged from the back alley slime of a leftover

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,100
thrown out carted to the landfill and strewn about dream scheme unseemly preening up the lips across

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:48,380
the sharp unscabbard edge of an arabic vision of a forgotten schematic scimitar of pure sun

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,700
flung across the heaven and earth and hell and mirth and seven smells from 17 trillion oyster

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
shells slung across the dung colored sky and the earth and the sky and the earth and the earth and

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:10,720
the void so deeply deeply paranoid and the sand so hot it runs in rivers of gold down your back all over your slacks across your toes and who knows how many times this has all happened and unhappened and de-happened so very happenstance wise and

71
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:25,440
wiseless and wishless and fishless careening uncontrollably amid the incontrovertible mutually exclusive opposites that imply the sundering of all existence into precisely opposing and perfectly annihilating particles that are mostly empty space and spasms of time that have highest

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,580
probabilities of never having known you or your family or anything or anyone you know or could possibly know so get lost

73
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,300
yeah get the hell out of here boy we don't need you

about the book and also i think you can read from that self same book you know because i look at

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:14,080
these pages and i i see you yes i see you my dear dear friend my and listener uh walking across

90
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:24,480
those uh beehive honeycomb streets with buildings labeled fear flesh heat gold

91
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,840
water sleep some just have dollar signs or a big question mark

92
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:42,020
at least that's what i'm looking at and you're a little stick figure you don't even have headphones

93
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:50,240
on they've already rounded us up like cattle herded us into slave labor gulags and replaced

94
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,420
our names with urine test result numbers but most of us didn't know that we were going to be in the

95
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,620
woods because at the end of the day they still let us clock out go home to our cell blocks and

96
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:08,260
punch in again for a few minutes of quality time with the spouse and kitties or the drugs and tv or

97
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:16,960
all four and the takeover the domestication we believe they call it happened so gradually so

98
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:24,920
quietly and so thoroughly that even if you happen to know who bob dobbs is you might not

99
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,420
really know who bob dobbs is you might not really know who bob dobbs is you might not really know

100
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,920
who bob dobbs is you might not really know who bob dobbs is you might not really care

101
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,600
who bob dobbs is you might not really care of course they they keep you from caring whether

102
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:43,500
you care or not and it's so much easier to just quit fighting just just listen to the radio and

103
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,300
let the others do the fighting for you you're used to it you can take it i mean it's a living you'll

104
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,560
go on about your job doing as you're told

105
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:06,160

115
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,420
oh i don't know there's a nice picture of a of an octopus here covering the globe

116
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,620
there's a picture of jesus praying to a car with a spike through it surrounded by flying tvs and

117
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:41,420
pipes there's a barcode that says that spells out the beast is watching you there's a conspiracy

118
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,560
butthead boy drawing with a little halo over his head and a blindfold and a steering wheel stuck

119
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,120
in his rump with the hands of the conspiracy steering him along is that you my friend is that

120
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,840
you and that's the guy who's going to be the next one to die in the next episode of the show

121
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,380
this little picture i'm looking at are you thanking them for that spiritual castration

122
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,620
the amputation of your abnormality gland which is illustrated here by a little paul mavridi's

123
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:17,100
fake clip art drawing of a butcher chopping a baby in half oh there's a hell all right but

124
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,100
you're already in it of course you've already heard those gags you've been listening to this

125
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,840
show for five years and uh you still think that we're going to die in the next episode of the show

126
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,980
when the demons tell you that this is just the top floor of hell the hell where you don't even

127
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,480
know you're there you think we're being satirists something like that don't you yeah

128
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,960
yeah actually it's hard to uh know what to read from you you know from this material because um

129
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:50,180
uh many of you have already heard quite a bit of it uh over the but it's been i mean this

130
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,140
particularly that's chapter one i started working on that a year and a half ago

131
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:05,080
it's probably 100 shows ago dear friends and meanwhile the normals the smug nutsy's and

132
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,240
poe buckers who were seemingly shopping all around you and blissful self-sustained ignorance

133
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:19,880
still form a vast conspiracy against you yes you that's right you pal uh honey

134
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,840
yeah listener it wouldn't be quite so bad if this conspiracy was true

135
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,460
i'm trying to sell your soul only to the devil but they're bargaining with the anti-satan too

136
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,400
they gave me this cough there's this terrible cough but i'm gonna keep preaching anyway

137
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,620
i ain't gonna let that virus demon stop me because the stakes are getting higher by the

138
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,700
minute as x day approaches the big nose dive is already in progress friends and we're gonna be

139
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,840
needing parachutes if we plan to bail out in time and we've reached the end of the show

140
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,240
that juncture in history when two opposite the previously impossible things have suddenly

141
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:10,200
become technologically feasible those two things the destruction of all higher life on earth or

142
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:20,380
infinite slack for everyone forever and we can only pray friends that those are two different

143
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,020
things

144
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,500
don't be disheartened because it's no myth there still exists this underground resistance force this

145
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:38,780
army of idiopathic deviance and angry mutations ready to help you lash out indeed

146
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:54,840
to to make you lash out and well we pretending as we do pretending to obey by day like gorillas in the zoo but garriloves amÃ¤ÃŸ havas

147
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:54,840


148
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:54,840


149
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,740
by coffee break. We freedom fighters won't sell our obedience for nice cars, VCRs, furlough

150
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,380
vacation trips, or fantasy entertainment. Nay, nor will we trade it for a warm carge

151
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:14,800
or cage and three squares a day. Nay, nay, nay. They continue. We continue to fight for

152
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,480
what was taken away when we were born. Our slack. Our slack, friends. Our thought slack.

153
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:34,840
Our sex slack. Our medicinal slack. All the slack. All of it. All of it. We demand, friends,

154
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:43,560
as subgeniuses, we demand the freedom to fail, freedom from work, and the freedom of religion.

155
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,460
Ah, yes, our religion, of course. While the obedient Christians are content to drink from

156
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:59,960
the symbolic blood of their quitter god at the altar, our warrior priests demand the

157
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:11,580
real thing. And guess whose blood it is this time. They call us fascists when we say things

158
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,800
like that, and they're perfectly right. The conspiracy has hogged fascism for too long.

159
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,100
We're taking it back by God for the people.

160
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,680
Fascism for the individual. Fascism for the people. Join the party that is the rejection

161
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,380
of all parties. Patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

162
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:42,940
Every yard a kingdom and every child and dog a serf, dear friends. Every dad a duche. Every

163
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:50,380
mom an Imelda. And all the dinners on time. Abandon the corporate nation states.

164
00:16:50,380 --> 00:17:00,020
Won't you please? And shop black market only. It's cheaper. Because, let's face it, in an

165
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:06,780
age when American corpo-merger capitalism, practically the same thing as the old Communist

166
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:13,700
Party nowadays, is in a blinding dizzying tailspin, the time is obviously ripe for a

167
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:20,360
new faith, a new paradigm, a new prophet. One whose methods both prove to be the same.

168
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:20,360


169
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:20,360


170
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,480
A new religion, a new culture, a new world. A new world that can be parallel and parasitized.

171
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,500
The monolithic econo-culture of the West. A religion. A base on pure capitalism. On the

172
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:39,880
divine logic of supply and demand, but unfettered by conspiracy-implanted neuroses about what

173
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:47,940
will sell. For as J.R. Bob Dobbs said, offer it and they will buy. And that real religion,

174
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,860
friends, is.

175
00:17:50,380 --> 00:18:00,540
The Church of the Subgenius and the Prophet is J.R. Bob Dobbs, Avatar of Slack and Immaculator

176
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,400
of the Age.

177
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,980
Oh, yes.

178
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,760
And, well, hey, I tell you, it'd take something out of a preacher to do that. Well, we got

179
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,300
a little, look at some of these cool illustrations. Here's a devil, a pentagram devil head with

180
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,720
a little pipe. See, that little pipe, for those of you who've never seen any of the

181
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,080
illustrated subgenius materials, printed materials, I mean, I know some of you just,

182
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:38,360
hey, radio show's free. I ain't gonna go to a bookstore and look around, no. But, yeah,

183
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,480
we're, I'm happy, man. I'm real happy because I've been working on this book with many of

184
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,820
us, about a hundred of us, but about four of us mainly have been working on this book,

185
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,020
mainly me, really.

186
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,000
For two years now, more than two years, and finally, finally, I'm getting to the point

187
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,080
where I can hold pages in my hand and see the art sitting right next to the text, and

188
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,700
the art is so sick, it makes the text even sicker, and it gives it a little twist sometimes.

189
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:17,500
You know, at times, subgenius materials can run the risk of sounding mayhaps, yes, even

190
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,240
preachy.

191
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,400
And, uh,

192
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,940
and we know, I was right to let myself get away with that, because when you lay this,

193
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,820
these pictures, this butt-faced angel blowing this trumpet,

194
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,200
it just, it takes the curse off, and puts the curse on the reader, dear friends. But,

195
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:44,020
in the meanwhile, I don't want to let the, uh, sacred babble of Bob be, uh,

196
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,140
drowned out by the pathetic peep, peep, peep of pinkness. No, uh,

197
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:02,140
this, so, what, what, what was I, oh, we got a, an interesting new tape here, from, uh,

198
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:09,800
a band, we, we'll call it a band, called Vavum, and, uh, actually, the individual is

199
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:17,720
Reverend Scott Orsi, an old subgenius, and, uh, no, I'm not going to do it to you, uh,

200
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,360
but I will, I will play this, this particular piece, and, uh, I'm going to play it to you,

201
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,600
this particular piece, uh, which is, uh, called Lies, All Lies. I'd like to dedicate this to my

202
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,560
friend, Palmer Vredes. I got a recording of the President of the United States, and here's what

203
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:46,000
he said. Read my lips. Don't read my lips. Tell the truth. You don't have to believe that. Great

204
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,180
men must keep their word.

205
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,760
Trust. I'm interested in what we can trust them to do, what you can trust me to do.

206
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
They can't put their trust in me.

207
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,340
Insanity is just doing the same old thing over and over again, and expecting a different result.

208
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,980
It's word against the President. It's word against the President. It's word against the President.

209
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,820
It's word against the President.

210
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,280
Read my lips.

211
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,480
The economy is strengthening. The economy continues to grow.

212
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,160
I experimented with my own time.

213
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,420
You can't take what's Carradine as an example.

214
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,640
I am writing to you.

215
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,040
You didn't inhale.

216
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,520
Don't read my lips and didn't inhale.

217
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,760
I have said I don't believe that the proper course of action is to have me run as President.

218
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,660
I do believe the proper

219
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,500
course of action is to run me as the

220
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:37,840
candidate.

221
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,740
Tell the truth.

222
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,080
It's word against the Presidents. It's word against the Presidents. It's word against the Presidents. It's word against the Presidents.

223
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,260
Thirty million jobs in the next eight years.

224
00:21:50,260 --> 00:22:14,820
I'm here. Promise and forget. Promise, promise and forget. Our policies have not failed. Tell the truth. The kind of guy who will say anything, do anything for political gain. I have laid up my mind and I've told you what my position was. I am not going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. Tell the truth. When I get up in the morning, I say a little prayer that I won't make any stupid little mistakes.

225
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:22,120
It's word against the president. It's word against the president. It's word against the president. It's word against the president.

226
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,020
We have heard the trumpets.

227
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:36,040
This administration is committed to a balanced budget and we will fight to the last blow to achieve it by 1984.

228
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:43,320
Governor Clinton hopes to exploit the darker impulses of this uncertain age.

229
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,320
Fear.

230
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,740
Fear of the unknown.

231
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,380
One day I'm a hayseed, the governor of a small southern state.

232
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,300
The next day I'm an Oxford man who has an enormous advantage in a debate.

233
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,100
If they ever put this guy in Mount Rushmore, they'll have to have two faces for it.

234
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,820
People have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.

235
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,440
Well, I'm not a crook.

236
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:13,120
Every four years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and they go back to business as usual.

237
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,300
It's said that politics is curated for this.

238
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,420
Tell the truth and I make no apologies for that!

239
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,720
It's word against the president's. It's word against the president.

240
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,520
It's word against the president's. It's word against the president's.

241
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,120
It's word against the president's. It's word against the president's.

242
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,860
It's word against the president's. It's word against the president's.

243
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,580
Ð±ÑƒÐºle

244
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,000
It's word against the president's.

245
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,000


246
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,000


247
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,900
You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore.

248
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,020
rz

249
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,260
and welcome. The sermon tonight is one of the most horrifying sermons ever spoken.

250
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,760
I'd like to apologize in advance for its shocking contents because I feel compelled to deliver it

251
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,920
simply because as the end times approach, it becomes more relevant now than ever before.

252
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:09,220
I call this little treatise Meditation 17, Why All Humans Must Be Euthanized.

253
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,860
Not too many years ago, psychologists conducted an experiment on a group of average American

254
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,940
college kids. They wanted to discover what would happen if these fine young men and women were put

255
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,120
in control of other men and women. This young group of volunteers were given the power to

256
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,180
inflict pain on their colleagues as punishment for not answering trivial questions correctly

257
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,200
or disobeying instructions in some minuscule manner. Now what happened?

258
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,200


259
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,000
What happened was that the experiment had to be aborted because it quickly got out of hand.

260
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,200
The psychologists found out that they literally had a group of monsters on their hands.

261
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,400
These college kids, the cream of the American crop, the future movers and shakers of society,

262
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,460
the managers and corporate presidents of tomorrow demonstrated with undeniable repetition their

263
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,180
ability, no, no, their pleasure in torturing the world.

264
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,180


265
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,180
They were able to turn on the electric shock on the other side of one-way glass.

266
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:19,360
Hard to believe but true. These young kids were provided machine dials that they could

267
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,740
turn to increase the electrical shock to fellow students on the other side of one-way glass.

268
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,420
They turned those dials up so far that if the actual voltage on the meters had been

269
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,440
delivered, the other students would have been fried like bacon.

270
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,580
Well the psychologists, they were aghast.

271
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,200
They had no idea that something this dramatic and severe would or could happen.

272
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,480
After all, these kids were just, well, kids. Most of them had been pampered all their lives

273
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,360
and had everything handed to them on a silver platter.

274
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,700
There was no reason for them to punish their victims like that.

275
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,940
Yet with very few exceptions, they delivered as much pain to their peers as possible.

276
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,560
Now we, the subgenius line, come from a different school of thought than the psychoanalysts.

277
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,740
We're not liberal humanists. We do not feel that human beings are, at their core, good

278
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,120
and kind-hearted.

279
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,980
No, no, we've been observing the human race far too long to make that mistake.

280
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,300
Indeed, our entire faith is based on one principle of human behavior.

281
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,000
That principle, simply stated, is thus.

282
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,900
Humans exist to either hurt or be hurt.

283
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,260
Yes, it's a sad fact.

284
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,540
But an unmistakable one.

285
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,220
The entire history of mankind is an eternal testament to this simple, universal truth.

286
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,560
How many poets have we heard lament over the tragedy of man's inhumanity to man?

287
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,180
Why is it, they cry, impossible for man to learn from his evil ways and change this dreadful practice?

288
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,480
Alas, we respond, man has learned from his evil ways.

289
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,560
And the dreadful practice has, in fact, changed.

290
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,540
It has evolved into a more sophisticated form of human behavior.

291
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:15,740
It has been replaced with a drawn-out and carefully cultivated pain, an institutionalized

292
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,340
torture we call the conspiracy.

293
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,860
Why these ivory tower types need to go and set up experiments to quantify the degree

294
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,080
in which humans will stick to one another is the joke of the 20th century.

295
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,220
One need only open their eyes to see the same experiment conducted every single day through

296
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,480
the auspices of the conspiracy.

297
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,780
Just sit back and watch millions of humans march stoically to their daily jobs, where

298
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:49,500
they suffer hour after hour as their boss routinely cranks up that dial full blast, making

299
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,100
them dance like ducks on an electric grid in some sick conspiracy carnival sideshow.

300
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,700
And you know what, friends?

301
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,380
For the most part, they cease to exist as thinking human beings.

302
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,940
They do.

303
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,520
For why else would these pathetic creatures return to work the very next day for the same truth?

304
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:08,840
For the treatment.

305
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,760
Certainly not for those little pieces of green paper.

306
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,560
No, sir.

307
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:20,320
Either they are brain-dead lobotomized zombies incapable of thought, or else these sickly

308
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,380
souls have some other, more sinister motive of their own.

309
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,660
Yes, dear friends, there's no sense in us denying it any longer, the horrible truth

310
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,680
we've said all along, yet psychologists have refused to acknowledge, yet deep down know

311
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,080
is true.

312
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,500
That a certain percentage of these so-called...

313
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:46,060
humans, if not the vast majority of them, tolerate their incredible pain with one goal

314
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,200
in mind.

315
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:56,360
To succeed, so that they may be promoted to position where they can inflict the same pain

316
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,720
on someone else.

317
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,160
Oh, they won't admit it.

318
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,940
No, sirree.

319
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,480
In fact, most of them not only will deny it, they'll claim the only reason they really

320
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,420
joined the system was so that they could change it.

321
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:16,500
But, put them on the other side of that one-way glass, and just see how many of them don't

322
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,440
start fondling that dial.

323
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,680
Here endeth the word of awe.

324
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,960
Amen.

325
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,420
Oh, oh, amen!

326
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,300
Oh, Father Joe Mama, the great, the Father Joe Mama.

327
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,140
Wonderful sermon there, and oh, what next?

328
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,240
I don't know quite what to tell you, except that you know, with the church, with the

329
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,720
church of the subgenius, friend, you can turn crap into gold.

330
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,740
Yes, your money woes, they'll be solved instantly.

331
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,120
Why work?

332
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Harness your eccentricities for your own gain.

333
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,580
Make $200 an hour, lying flat on your back.

334
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,580
For Bob.

335
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:19,100
Yes, Bob will let you stretch that third nostril opening.

336
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,580
You'll whiff-read the weaknesses of your business foes.

337
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,740
Now, other cults say it's better to give than receive.

338
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,140
But in Bob's philosophy, it's much better to take than to receive.

339
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,220
Note the subtle difference.

340
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,380
So, move over, Scientology and Masons.

341
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,700
Here comes the new ruthless business cult.

342
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,900
And friends, if you urinate, you're sure to be interested in this.

343
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,580
It's a must for all TV lovers.

344
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,120
Experience the lounge chair transformation.

345
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,840
The transcendence of slack.

346
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,920
It lines stomach walls with a natural anxiety damper.

347
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,200
Subdues violent spasms.

348
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,860
You'll love it.

349
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,480
Your mom will too, kids.

350
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,520
Well, it's almost time for me to flip show.

351
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm going to let the Rudy Schwartz Project take us a little bit further along here.

352
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,340
It looks like the thunderclouds are getting closer and closer.

353
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,240
Ah, yes.

354
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,740
SO MUCH UNFUN

355
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:44,740


356
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:44,740


357
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,080
DIAMOND

358
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,320
THE WITNY PLY

359
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,340
VerbÐ¾Ñ‡ek

360
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm sorry.

361
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm sorry.

362
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,300
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,320
I'm sorry.

364
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm sorry.

365
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm sorry.

366
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm sorry.

367
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,560
I'm sorry.

368
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm sorry.

369
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,040
An extra bonus pineapples

370
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,380
Creamy good coleslaw

371
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,220
The commendation's for two

372
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,920
Just Pia and you

373
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,080
At the Howard Johnson's out on highway two

374
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,620
Swirly birdie do

375
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,100
Two corndogs special at Bugs

376
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,080
Two corndogs special at Bugs

377
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,920
Shazam!

378
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
It's good!

379
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,520
Oh, yes, dear fans.

380
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,200
That was Joe Newman

381
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,480
undergoing the name Rudy Schwartz Project.

382
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,840
That's a CD that one can actually find in places.

383
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,540
And, you know, some of you are...

384
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,820
You never know what you're going to hear on this show.

385
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,820
I mean, one minute it's almost socially relevant protest material

386
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,540
and then suddenly...

387
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,400
It's a silly corny dog stuff.

388
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,400
And, well, I just wanted to point out

389
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,120
So Frank Zappa's dead.

390
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,860
Big deal.

391
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,520
You know, there's more stuff out there.

392
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,060
You don't need to stay in mourning for Zappa.

393
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,760
There's Joe Newman.

394
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,800
There's Zoot's Riff.

395
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,920
There's all kinds of people.

396
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,240
I may be able to pack some more ancient Captain Beefheart

397
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,900
who is sort of no more from what I understand.

398
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Anyway.

399
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh.

400
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,800
Where am I? Where am I?

401
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,820
Oh, I know where I am.

402
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,440
We'll just...

403
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,840
I'll just lean back here in the church

404
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,460
where, you know, friends, you can live with your sins.

405
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,360
Yeah, because we use promises of sex

406
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,120
to lure converts.

407
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,220
So come and get it.

408
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,380
It's not pornography, officer.

409
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,140
It's just empowerment.

410
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,840
Because through Bob,

411
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,020
you can learn to masturbate without going blind.

412
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,880
You'll learn to perform astral sex

413
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
with anyone you want.

414
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,000
You'll be able to have intercourse

415
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,900
with beautiful, live, nude,

416
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,100
why mine,

417
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,300
or damn near anything else,

418
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,140
Mystery Babylon the Great,

419
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,440
the Mother of Harlot said.

420
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,020
Abominations of the Earth.

421
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,520
Abominations of the Earth.

422
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:03,520


423
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:03,520


424
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,260
I'm not sure if you've watched some P5

425
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,160
because Bob is a sex god

426
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,480
and he's come to rationalize your sins.

427
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,360
Mm-hmm.

428
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,320
Through the Master Bob's patented techniques

429
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,840
of astrochemistry

430
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,100
and BP Wow's amazing tantric deviational technology,

431
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,660
you'll learn the real secret

432
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,220
behind magic and Freemasonry.

433
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,360
Sex hurt.

434
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,920
Sex hurt, yeah.

435
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,520
Until it feels...

436
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,400
so good it hurts.

437
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,960
You know, the restrained fury of fornication

438
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,000
can be rechanneled to release hidden energies

439
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,900
which allow communication

440
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,380
with higher intelligences from the stars.

441
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,380
And your orgasmonic radiations

442
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,480
or etheric fallout from any sex

443
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,620
not for procreation

444
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,520
will affect the DNA,

445
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,540
the genes of the normals around you,

446
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,440
causing their kids to be born subgeniuses.

447
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,600
You now not only have a right, friend,

448
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,640
but a duty,

449
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,800
that's right, a duty,

450
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,980
to do anything you want

451
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,940
with any consenting partner

452
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,100
and we'll help you to find at least one.

453
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,240
Free blessing cloth with every orgasm.

454
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,940
Our women are screaming to meet your love.

455
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,320
We're lonely lads and lassies

456
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,160
and our men are dying to ravish

457
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,360
you subgenius gals and guys.

458
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,820
We honestly don't care what you look like.

459
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,300
Really.

460
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,600
Don't fall for the bashful act.

461
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,440
Just politely state your intentions.

462
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,520
Politely is the key word here.

463
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,740
And then sit back and watch the action begin.

464
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
It's that simple.

465
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,060
You'll be able to quit or start doing it

466
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,360
in a matter of days.

467
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,500
Don't bother with old fashioned dowsing rods ever again.

468
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,800
Plus, baldness will be cured with new beard migration techniques.

469
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,520
Growth.

470
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,080
Smaller, firmer, larger, beautiful breasts.

471
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,060
The church applies directly to the wound.

472
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,660
Just like this radio show.

473
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,800
No digging.

474
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,940
It stripes the cerebral circuit

475
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,600
with easy one-handed operation.

476
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,460
Satisfied?

477
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,900
I'll say your every fetish.

478
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,140
Your sweetie will never even know you used it.

479
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,840
It's a real subgenius.

480
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,500
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

481
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,940
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

482
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,760
Ego, ego, ego.

483
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,440
There you go.

484
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,580
Plugging into the MeeGo system,

485
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,220
the subgenius inflates to an amazing size.

486
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,300
Water spatula,

487
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,940
water filter implemented.

488
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:23,880
Ener wipnoc RyEM Dont put it into theÐ¶Ðµik

489
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,480
So long, you rock.

490
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,400
Am I on? Where's the rest of me?

491
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:32,820
Oh, man.

492
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,220
It works.

493
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,840
And so, once again, good...

494
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,980
Oh, what happened there?

495
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,360
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and stop bothering me.

496
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,880
People born under the sign of the rutabaga are...

497
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,360
They tend to crouch in the dirt and absorb nutrients from the soil.

498
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,520
I can't believe you could do anything with those things.

499
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,360
They are down to earth, earthy, and of the soil.

500
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,060
They are open soiled, soiled and soiling the earth,

501
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,940
earthy and squat down in the dirt.

502
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,200
Are you film, all right?

503
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,780
Yes, this show is...

504
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,960
Why would we fake it?

505
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,280
Because this is the show.

506
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,480
That's what they do.

507
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:16,760
Why would you fake it to make me talk?

508
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,080
What other reason to make me talk?

509
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,940
Talk! Talk about what?

510
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,680
Grant, come on. It's the show.

511
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,660
Now, the rutabaga is not the common parchment,

512
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,360
but it was the most...

513
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,000
The most subtle vegetable of the field.

514
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,280
Well, I don't want to get punished.

515
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,480
Said Eve.

516
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,120
But the rutabaga tempted her.

517
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,020
That's rain on the rooftop.

518
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,240
It's my sonic specialty, number 23 in the catalog.

519
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,540
Mike's outside now.

520
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,660
Oh, yeah, Mike's out there, but we're not going to let him in

521
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,560
because I'm satisfied to be doing it.

522
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,880
Well, Mike will have to remain outside

523
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,140
until we get this audio representation of what's happening.

524
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,540
And this killer video of the guy shivering in the rain.

525
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,080
Now you see the pulsing evidence troops.

526
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,280
Coming down over the hill in front of the Xandoid Monument.

527
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,940
Phantom warriors swirling over a blasted landscape.

528
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,220
Their jaws gape and their eyes blaze

529
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,280
in their eye sockets like coals.

530
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,380
I'm picking up an Echo 3 band search radar from a Dano.

531
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,380
I saw pale kings and princes too.

532
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,520
Got a Barlock search and intercept radar,

533
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,800
probably from a Sam 5.

534
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,980
Pale warriors, death pale were they all.

535
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,940
Okay, I'm picking up Hotel Band Square Fire,

536
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,340
Fire, Fire, Fire.

537
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,520
Control signals coming in from that guy.

538
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,680
I saw their star glitz in the globe

539
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,860
with horrid warning gaped wide.

540
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,000
Too early to get an ID on the missile,

541
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,900
but the bearings from...

542
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,220
And then I woke

543
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,660
and found me here on the cold, cold side.

544
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
I'm guessing a Sam 5 system.

545
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,540
I took my eyes out of the CRT

546
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,840
and called up the missile launch control page

547
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,900
for the AGC MADC HARM.

548
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,460
On the right side of this multi-functional display,

549
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,940
we have your...

550
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,260
Your X-ray Delta-1 on vector Niner Niner 575,

551
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,980
mark two.

552
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,280
Read you how.

553
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Oh, yes.

554
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,680
Yes, I'm gonna switch out Dr. Howell to another deck here.

555
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,620
That's a howlingly hilarious Dr. Howell.

556
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,060
Robin's there and puzzling evidence on the,

557
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,420
the, well, subgenius show.

558
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,280
Used to be a subgenius show,

559
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,140
but I don't know, puzzling evidence.

560
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,820
Now it's a puzzling evidence show.

561
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,480
I see, yeah.

562
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,100
Well, I'm gonna move that down to another deck here.

563
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,780
They do that in Berkeley.

564
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,300
One of many spewings that come forth

565
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,540
from other radio stations besides this one

566
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,620
here in Dallas, Texas.

567
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,620
Of course, this is where we synthesize all our stuff

568
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,440
and mix it all together and make a big mess of it.

569
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:47,840
Let's see how it goes.

570
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,520
Well, as you know, it was Popeye's Angels.

571
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,460
Wait, what?

572
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh, you gotta, this is, Howell,

573
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,920
I think for, we'll just let Howell go for the rest.

574
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,040
I think for the rest of the show, I believe.

575
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,100
I've had enough reading this, this lovely book,

576
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,480
which by the way, if the first book,

577
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,240
the book of the subgenius, Simon & Schuster,

578
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,340
if that first book of ours opened the wound,

579
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,880
made the first paper cut, so to speak,

580
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,480
then this new one, man, it, it rubs salt in it.

581
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,720
And of course you'll never be able to regain the pain rush

582
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,780
you got from reading the book of the subgenius the first time

583
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,060
because,

584
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,480
the key was turned then, you know,

585
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,240
and the door was at that moment opened forever.

586
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,080
The seed has been planted

587
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,620
and all that's left for us now

588
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,580
is to turn the volume down and water and nourish the sprout

589
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,640
for all that really matters is the harvest.

590
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,600
Ha ha, yes, the harvest.

591
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,200
And because the basic elementary message of the word of Bob

592
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,720
can never seem so new again,

593
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,540
but then, you know, it never was new.

594
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,420
It was always there waiting.

595
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,460
Only when it became comprehended by you,

596
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,040
did it then become a new thing.

597
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:15,240
Because that was when the logos bound itself to you forever

598
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,580
and forced you to become that which it is.

599
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,060
That which this show is.

600
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,640
Oh yes.

601
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,800
And by the way,

602
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,820
if you need more information about the church of the subgenius

603
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,400
and its many spin-offs and coloring books and so forth,

604
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,980
just send us, drop us a postcard or a free,

605
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,660
or a self-addressed stamped envelope would be even better.

606
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,880
I'm going to give you that address in just a second

607
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,860
for those of you listening for the very first time,

608
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,960
all two of you.

609
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,340
I'm waiting for you to pick up that pencil

610
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,420
because it's worth it.

611
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,480
It's worth it.

612
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,940
It's not, I know you have to go to the trouble

613
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,440
of writing it down now,

614
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,980
and then you have to write it on an envelope

615
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,680
and you have to write your own return address.

616
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,420
Not only that, you have to get it right.

617
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,540
Would believe me for subgeniuses.

618
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,360
That is, that's not exactly rare, but well.

619
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,540
Okay, here's that address.

620
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,020
Write to Bob, just Bob.

621
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,620
That's right.

622
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,780
Where you can address it to our Slack,

623
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,300
Reverend Ivan Stagg, Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius,

624
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,460
the Subgenius Foundation, Incorporated,

625
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,600
they know us here at Post Office Box, and this is it.

626
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:45,880
Post Office Box, 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

627
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,420
I know you didn't get it all then.

628
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,280
I'm going to give it again.

629
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,080
That's Box 140306.

630
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,800
Dallas, 75214.

631
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,400
And now I'm going to go back to this lovely,

632
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,840
I hope this bottom deck works better than the top one.

633
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,280
Sounds kind of muddy.

634
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,720
This lovely series of bits by Dr. Howell

635
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,320
and also puzzling evidence, and also the ranting.

636
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,780
You'll hear some ranting from Reverend Microphone

637
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,460
from the Atlanta Subgenius.

638
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,840
And Sister Susie, the floozy, yes.

639
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,480
And also some sort of music coming up by Otgothpul.

640
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,840
And maybe we'll even get to Jane Earl.

641
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,160
Dinner 575, mark two.

642
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,280
For Bluto, as you know, was Popeye's angel.

643
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,700
Mark, oh ye gods, how dearly Popeye loved him.

644
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,560
But when he plucked his cursed fist away,

645
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,460
Mark, oh ye gods, how dearly Popeye loved him.

646
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:54,540
But when he plucked his cursed fist away,

647
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,560
Mark, how the blood of Bluto followed it,

648
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,060
as squirting out a can of spinach way

649
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,320
to be resolved if Popeye so unkindly knocked or no.

650
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,040
Yes, it's sad as the rain pours down

651
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,240
and we think of the inglorious ends

652
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,380
of all our favorite, lovable, floppy, blobby

653
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,100
cartoon characters of yore.

654
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,480
There, when everything moved and sometimes jerked up and down

655
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,440
to the overt rhythm of some piece of cake,

656
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,800
tin pan alley trash,

657
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,240
we never knew the great and glorious mastery of the medium

658
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,780
which would be totally eclipsed in the blasphemous work

659
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,300
of the troglodytic hannah barbarians.

660
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,820
Oh, what a fall of animation was there, my friends.

661
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,300
Then you and I and all of us fell down

662
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,400
whilst bloody mediocrity flourished over us.

663
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,660
Get way lost.

664
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,480
You cross Little Boss Hop up on your horse

665
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,640
and play your little-tiddled-piddled ring-toss.

666
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,380
Nobody wants to cry about stuff anymore.

667
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,400
Stuff sung so slow,

668
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,960
the spaces between the notes and word stretch

669
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,320
so far across moments of mindlessness

670
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,560
that spinning quarks of thought threaten to crumble

671
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,580
into gravediggers on your quantum kitchen floor.

672
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,460
Sweep up your weepy deeps and know the color of the insides

673
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,600
on your sideboard side.

674
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,060
Slip off your shoes, slip your hand inside your head,

675
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,640
pull out whatever you find and dangle it in front of your own face.

676
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,680
Voices bubble up and speak to us.

677
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,280
Test the water, dive, learn to breathe,

678
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,840
and learn all that was ever forgotten.

679
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,480
Learn to live all the lives of all the life that ever lived,

680
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,460
systematically, sequentially, and profoundously,

681
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,080
but most stubbornly, backward,

682
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,120
until you manage to undo every do, every done.

683
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,020
Having undone...

684
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,080
Turn left, uh, turn left on the virtual show there.

685
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,780
That's what you need.

686
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,740
It is a veritable virtual show.

687
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,260
In fact, it is something of a pervertual reality.

688
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,720
A pervertual reality.

689
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,700
Yeah, we're on the air right now.

690
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,980
Okay, now we're checking in with the, uh, parallel universe show.

691
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,400
There's, see, there's a hell.

692
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,760
It's just like a hell on this side.

693
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,200
Yes, it's a...

694
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,780
Except everybody over there is backwards.

695
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,980
Get away from me, you cyberpunk.

696
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,380
You're not me.

697
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,660
It won't be confusing for you if you just follow along

698
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,040
in your show coloring books.

699
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,140
Gee, is that Gobi?

700
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,500
That must be the opposite Gobi over there.

701
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,640
Yeah, nice, huh?

702
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,400
Inside out.

703
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,440
And there's Aunt Bertha further on over.

704
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,860
Yep, and there's Billy and Timmy before they were born.

705
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,140
Oh, my God, what ugly embryos.

706
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,920
It's amazing the vantage point this gives us.

707
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,320
We can see side...

708
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,440
Uh-oh.

709
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,780
Yep, little caller stuck in the echo box.

710
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,340
Well, so there is a caller after all.

711
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,320
You know, I often debated the existence of this mythical beast.

712
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,120
Since one is never actually privileged to hear them speak.

713
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,600
Like the unicorn of classic fable, it is a shy creature,

714
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,800
which often conceals itself behind sound effects

715
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,980
while performing what it likes to think of as a show of its own.

716
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Here I am, and there you are, and let's all get together.

717
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,820
Nobody gets it together like the short but sweet,

718
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,840
sweet but short sick,

719
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,520
as here they are with their latest swinging single,

720
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,860
I'm Just a Clown Who's Feeling Down.

721
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,380
Suicide.

722
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,120
Suicide.

723
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,000
Suicide.

724
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:34,860
Suicide.

725
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,840
I'll tell you the truth, I'm really miserable.

726
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,600
I wish I knew where I could go to find my happiness.

727
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,040
Commit suicide.

728
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:48,860
Commit suicide.

729
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,100
Hey, give me a gun or I'll shoot myself.

730
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,240
The next sentence is a very important one,

731
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,800
and I'd like you to listen extra specially hard.

732
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,700
Having undone the sun and all that circle it,

733
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,280
and every sun equally undone,

734
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,760
then life and strife and the pipe fittings of every possible sexual, non-sexual blueprint

735
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,640
becomes the purest bubbling essence of brilliant unthinking sloth.

736
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,180
So, so sadly unthinkable to so, so many of us,

737
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,540
in all the ways and all the hows that we profess

738
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,280
are a suitable test for adequate wrestling referee guidebook handbook,

739
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,480
procedural proposals for nourishing traditional community brain bashing

740
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,000
on page three of last week's spotlight on troglodyte piss testing

741
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,980
for the greater glory of menstrual cramping of the style of Hammurabi

742
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,460
from sea to blinding sea,

743
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,240
and the grain crimsoning, sometimes like fire,

744
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,080
consuming all.

745
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:59,880
Oh, Mike, we are all tingly and a-quebber with those nuggets of slack wisdom.

746
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,520
Oh, why can't people think?

747
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,420
Oh, what are they afraid of?

748
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,840
Something like the switch hitting redneck melody?

749
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,900
We don't mean to think.

750
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,980
Thinking is not important.

751
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,980
This old boy walked up with a big possum grin

752
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:22,020
and he just opened the cargo room and crawled right in.

753
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,180
This is about Bob.

754
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,080
You know the thing that was getting me the most

755
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,060
was the way this old boy seemed to feel his oats.

756
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,560
Man, he was really getting under my skin

757
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,600
and sitting over with that big stupid grin.

758
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,440
And for what kind of deal is it?

759
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,440
I got to wondering about this friend of Liz's.

760
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,640
But I figured every minute she'll tell me who he is.

761
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,380
But as we drove along, I thought, man, oh, man,

762
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,840
because me and him and Liz was all free of holding hands.

763
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,880
I thought, what kind of deal is this?

764
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,160
Now, I ain't too smart, but I could still see it.

765
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,720
This whole deal looked all fouled up to me.

766
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,080
So I thought I'd better stop it, man.

767
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,200
It's going too far, because she was hugging me and he was hugging her.

768
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,840
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

769
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,840
Well, I knew it wasn't right, but what could I say?

770
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,900
I thought I'd just kind of let it go along that way.

771
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,940
But pretty soon I seen I was out on a limb.

772
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,140
I couldn't kiss her without kissing him.

773
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,140
And now I thought, what kind of deal is this?

774
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,040
So I stopped the car and I said, look here, Liz,

775
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,160
you'd better tell me who this guy is.

776
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,180
She said, I don't know.

777
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,720
I thought he was your friend.

778
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,300
I said, well, if you don't know him, what's he doing here?

779
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,260
Then I thought, what kind of deal is this?

780
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,840
So I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him out of the car.

781
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,740
I said, buddy, I've never seen nobody like you are.

782
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,380
How come you pull these kind of jokes?

783
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,740
He said, well, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

784
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,480
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

785
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,180
Well, I drew back my sword.

786
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,940
I took it out of the car.

787
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,740
I hit him in the head.

788
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:14,840
I hit him in the face.

789
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,120
I hit him in the face.

790
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,000
He broke loose and outrun a snake.

791
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,780
So now, here I stand, just looking at Liz.

792
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,860
And both of us are wondering who this guy is.

793
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,280
Now, what kind of deal do you think this is?

794
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,760
If you find out, I wish you'd let me know.

795
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,340
Man, it's tore me up like a sow's bed.

796
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,180
You ain't never been tore up.

797
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,840
You've been tore up like a sow's bed.

798
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,400
You know what I mean, Liz.

799
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,880
Bow-bow, bow-wow.

800
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,200
Bow-wow, bow-wow.

801
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,340
This is my scene and it freaks me out.

802
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,280
Now, come on, kids.

803
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,540
Shut up and let me think.

804
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,020
Give me a moment to think.

805
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,180
I'll get you a drink of water and I'll find out what happened to Barney.

806
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,100
No, no, no, no, no.

807
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,680
I think Barney's drowned down by the lake.

808
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,840
I think they found him with nine shotguns blasted in the back of his Teflon fabric little back.

809
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,480
Oh, you read that too, huh?

810
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,100
Well, I believe that was planted by the CIA.

811
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,820
It was believed that certain parts of his body were carved away by the hunters and taken.

812
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:27,060
And some primitive peoples believed that the part of the body that was eaten could confer upon the E.T.

813
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,600
some of the strength of this mysterious, mythical body.

814
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,360
And there.

815
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,760
The Mokele Mbembe, the African Apatosaurus.

816
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,520
Look at it.

817
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,840
Look at it.

818
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,080
Look at the length of that animal.

819
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:54,720
That giant monster once roamed the earth millions of years ago.

820
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,860
The Mokele Mbembe

821
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,040
Beep

822
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,880
Beep

823
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:01,880


824
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,120
Beep

825
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,140
Beep

826
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,640
If getting too near, I'll have to fire a ray blast.

827
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,620
That didn't seem to help.

828
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,280
Fire, fire at will.

829
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,240
That's not going to stop a monster with this kind of music going.

830
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:20,840
No way.

831
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,080
Well, you know, the music can ebb and flow.

832
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,440
People can change.

833
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,280
Time goes on.

834
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,660
That's a fan letter from Bozo come in.

835
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,720
What about Jehovah One?

836
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,540
Well, Jehovah One is doing just fine.

837
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,960
He's just kind of moody.

838
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:41,440
And he's unhappy, but he's basically fine.

839
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,520
The points are not coming across clearly enough.

840
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,640
The Brady Bill is a clear sign that Big Brother is strangleholding us.

841
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,840
What about Jehovah Three?

842
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,860
I'm telling you, you know, within years you're going to see

843
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:59,000
just how much more they're going to take and take and take.

844
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,400
Jehovah Three, I tell you all about it.

845
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,020
You're the one that voted Clinton into office.

846
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,700
Don't get me out of this one.

847
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,840
Now, come on.

848
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:07,520
I'm going to get out of this crowd.

849
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,240
A political argument has broken out on the air.

850
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,800
The callers are fighting, throwing radio fists.

851
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,440
The Ross Perot-Rush Limbaugh debate or something?

852
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:15,760
Yeah.

853
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,080
Now, that's one I'd like to see.

854
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:18,720
You know, like...

855
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,580
You might be right, caller.

856
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,900
Frankenstein and the Wolfman.

857
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,760
Firearms control might be...

858
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,520
Who would win?

859
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,180
Who would win?

860
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,560
Would it be Lon Chaney Jr. or Bela Lugosi?

861
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,640
The end of America has come.

862
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,780
Of course, Bela Lugosi made one of the worst Frankenstein monsters ever portrayed,

863
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,020
being a little tiny...

864
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,020
Buckled up guy.

865
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,120
...been more idiotic.

866
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,440
And Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolfman...

867
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,700
Won't let even you talk about it.

868
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,780
...bulkingly hulking over him.

869
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,140
So the Frankenstein monster is this little tiny shrimp.

870
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,940
And then Larry Talbot, the Wolfman,

871
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:54,560
in his bulbous, woolly, tweedy slacks and bulging sweater,

872
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,860
cowers over the tiny, arthritic, drug-addicted Frankenstein monster

873
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,860
as they fight to the death...

874
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,120
Drugs, I need more Franken...

875
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:03,500
...drugs.

876
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,520
...in Dr....

877
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,640
...Mannering's laboratory.

878
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,260
But then the evil villagers dynamite the dam

879
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,140
and a torrent of water races through the ruins of the Frankenstein castle,

880
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,840
washing away tiny Bela Lugosi Frankenstein monster

881
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,520
and huge, obese, giant Wolfman Lon Chaney Jr.

882
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,360
But whenever you're not in the close-ups that show Lugosi,

883
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,080
they cut to stuntman Eddie Parker as the Frankenstein monster...

884
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,440
...who looks totally different from...

885
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,900
...Lugosi.

886
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,600
So it's as if, you know, whenever you get close to the Frankenstein monster,

887
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,200
he shrivels and becomes this little, tiny, old guy with a big Adam's apple.

888
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,900
And then when you zoom back, he's this huge, muscular ape who looks totally different.

889
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,560
But, however it is, they don't make him like that anymore.

890
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,300
And I hope that answers your question.

891
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:54,660
Ooh!

892
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,960
But I'm here to talk about the meanest...

893
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,800
Nah, we can't let Zayner do it right now.

894
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,060
Sorry, friends.

895
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,100
It's...

896
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,300
...end of...

897
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,220
...show.

898
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,560
And we'll just continue those...

899
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:10,800
Oops!

900
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,980
We'll continue...

901
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,180
No!

902
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:12,960
That's...

903
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,280
...this date...

904
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,860
...the next week.

905
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,100
Same...

906
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,960
Oh, God, I hate to do this, but I could say,

907
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,360
same Bob time.

908
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:23,380
Same!

909
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,640
Heh heh heh.

910
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,740
Yeah, well...

911
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,140
That's not, uh...

912
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:29,560
...overdue it.

913
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,020
This is, uh...

914
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,180
We'll let this little...

915
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,420
...atmospheric piece of rain...

916
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,760
...of Raymond Scott music take us out.

917
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,780
Oh, and, uh...

918
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,860
...don't forget to praise Bob.

919
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:12,440
Uh, and, uh...

920
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,680
I hope that he gets on a my dad's good-time.

921
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:19,880
See, because then if you're either a girl...

922
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:19,880


923
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:27,840
...or, uh...

924
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:29,700
...even if you be a man that might fail at your chances...

925
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,700


926
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,700


927
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,700
would seem dippin' to Jim Thiso's eyes with poof-ante spots.

928
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,140
All right then.

929
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,140


930
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,140


931
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,460
Oh yeah.
