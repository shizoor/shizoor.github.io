1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
They'll know you've arrived when you drive up in the 1958 Edsel.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,700
Let's think about registered dietician Heidi Tubbs with the State Department of Drink Enough Milk.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,680
We invite you to start tomorrow.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,100
The Hour of Slack

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,260
The Hour of Slack

6
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,640
Bob?

7
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,400
Because further on in the thickness, there comes the thinness.

8
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,360
But without the thinness...

9
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,380
We would not be able to appreciate the thickness of the pudding.

10
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,620
The pudding which cures.

11
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,640
Of the Antidote Pudding.

12
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:50,140
The pudding which allows one to mold both the thickness and the thinness in accordance with one's will.

13
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Yes, dear friends, this is your old friend, Reverend Ivan Stang.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:08,060
And it's good to be back on the throne of the show of the power of Bob.

15
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,820
In the service of slack.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,040
Flowing and yet stiffening.

17
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,360
Like cornstarch in a colloidal suspension.

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,380
The slack can either ooze freely around us or it can freeze up and congeal.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,420
If we push too...

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,920
Too hard.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
Is it liquid?

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,260
Is it solid?

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,020
Is it liquid?

24
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,820
Is it solid?

25
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,280
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy and I shall give our report...

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,020
On the sinister rights and orgiastic rituals which we witnessed...

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,320
As guests of the Association of Consciousness Exploration.

28
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,180
A CE.

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,740
Esteeming expose.

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
Coming up...

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,460
Of the occult underbelly.

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,980
of the witches and druids and pagan things that go in the night.

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,480
Oh, yes, dear friends, it's a squirting universe.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,580
Howdy, I'm Edelmars, and I'm a pagan.

35
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,800
Ha ha ha!

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,800
Ha ha ha!

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,620
Ha ha ha!

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,200
Oh, yes, dear friends, I've been collecting for some time

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,620
bits and pieces of sound that I could throw together

40
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,080
and do a special on pagans and Starwood.

41
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,920
Starwood is a festival held at Brushwood Campground in New York,

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,260
where we also hold X-Day,

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
that's put on by a Cleveland group called ACE,

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,540
the Association of Consciousness Exploration.

45
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,760
And they first invited me to come preach at Starwood in 1990,

46
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,000
and I was so happy.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,860
I was so happy to see people who knew how to party like that.

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,600
The religious aspects of it I, of course, had already made fun of,

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,040
to my heart's little content,

50
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,200
in a book called High Weirdness by Mail.

51
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,660
But over the years, you know, I've come to become friends

52
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,620
with some of the kooky cult leaders that we made so much fun of.

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,520
And, of course, you know, gosh,

54
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,940
I like to think I'm a contributing part of a fairly large,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,760
what you'd call a kooky cult myself.

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,400
You know, we await the coming of the men from Planet X on X-Day,

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,940
when we, the saved subgeniuses who believe in the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

58
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,180
will be lifted up, ruptured in a state of slack,

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,680
to wreak our vengeance upon all the pinks, normals, and conspiracy dukes

60
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
who have held us, the weirdos and abnormals, down

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,100
throughout the centuries.

62
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,720
For,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,140
uh,

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,600
history,

65
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,360
uh,

66
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
untold,

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,580
and before history,

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,420
back in the day of the mighty Yeti,

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,960
our forefathers and foremoms of the Himalayas.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,780
Ah, yes.

71
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,920
Well, in the meantime, friends,

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,420
we party out at Brushwood,

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,020
and we do it not only at X-Day,

74
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,160
but also some of us at Starwood.

75
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,020
And, um,

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,480
I kind of married into the, uh,

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,160
uh,

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,260
organization.

79
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,960
My, uh,

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,020
I'm the consort of Princess Wee Ardoh,

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,060
queen of all the UFOs,

82
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,460
who was, uh,

83
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,340
has always been a big part of the Starwood Festival,

84
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560
uh, in the background,

85
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,160
and, uh, singing up on stage.

86
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,120
So, anyway, friends,

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,720
uh, praise Ace,

88
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,440
and, uh, uh,

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,880
Saint Stymie de Bergerac at Ace,

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,060
who actually introduced me to the whole thing,

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,640
uh, by paying me money to come and entertain there.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,940
And I've done that almost every year,

93
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,960
uh, some of that will be on this show.

94
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,100
And, friends,

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,440
let us now delve back into the past.

96
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,060
You know, ESO, radio, uh,

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,400
uh,

98
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,020
band members,

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,440
Weinstein Secret Orchestra play at Starwood all the time,

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,500
and live out there at Brushwood,

101
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,700
some of them almost.

102
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,140
And so, uh,

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,640
Professor Chaz, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

104
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,600
and Princess Wee Ardoh will also help me in, uh,

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,920
describing and, uh,

106
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,440
exerting, uh,

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,920
some and all, uh,

108
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,520
that weird world of the neo-pagans

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,100
and, uh, the, the, um,

110
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,100
hipsters of Starwood.

111
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,980
Praise Bob.

112
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,660
Oh, by the way,

113
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,440
this music in the background is by Reverend Angry Larry

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,620
under the guise of automatic robot fish.

115
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Hey, praise Bob,

116
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,900
and hail the Connie Hood.

117
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
We're on.

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,640
It came to my festival all pretty and pink.

119
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,640
You brought your own mirror

120
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,320
and your dream house

121
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,280
and you sink.

122
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,840
I tried to resist falling under your spell.

123
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,980
But when I saw you Barbie, spirituality went to hell

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,540
Pagan fast Barbie, you walk on your toes

125
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,800
Must be the heel, your nails are all polished

126
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,520
A gem in your nose, genuine pearl

127
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,680
I see true magic when I look at you

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,900
Pagan fast Barbie, I love you

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,820
Never dresses in leather, or feathers or fur

130
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
A little girl, she's the best Barbie

131
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:21,820


132
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,460
We perfect your polyester pagan angel.

133
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,400
That's her.

134
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
She's polyamorous.

135
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,720
With anyone true but pagan fest Barbie.

136
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,500
I love you.

137
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,500
You came and you danced by the firelight.

138
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,660
With your small dicks on your face.

139
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,040
It's so plastic.

140
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,580
And all of the girls of the day and the night.

141
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,620
No, no one can ever take your place.

142
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,680
You're unique for a sturdy blue running deer.

143
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Deep crystalline flame.

144
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,200
Wait, there's more.

145
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah, you're watching Mackenzie.

146
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,420
Well, that is her legal name.

147
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,640
I hate to admit it.

148
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,040
But what can I do?

149
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,640
Pagan fest Barbie.

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,260
I love you.

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
She likes to take showers.

152
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,220
Anytime, anywhere.

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,840
On and on.

154
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,600
She may stay there for hours.

155
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,160
With her razor and her hair.

156
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,480
Water's cold.

157
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,080
You can talk conservation.

158
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,760
And she won't have a clue.

159
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,380
Pagan fest Barbie.

160
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,080
I love you.

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,280
You came and you stole.

162
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,920
My heart away.

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,580
Take it, baby.

164
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,920
With your fucking style.

165
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,460
And your charm.

166
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,420
You put a spell on me.

167
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,120
And if we should do the great right tonight.

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,640
I know it'll do me no harm.

169
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,620
And it all, no.

170
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,240
Oh, pagan fest Barbie.

171
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,180
You are the best.

172
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
Good for me.

173
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,280
By each god and goddess.

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,100
Yeah.

175
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,020
Triple blessed.

176
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,940
Blessed Barbie.

177
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,120
So you get your hair done.

178
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,300
I'll get a tattoo.

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,140
Pagan fest Barbie.

180
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,960
I love you.

181
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,100
Pagan fest Barbie.

182
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,720
I love you.

183
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
Dee doo doo doo doo.

184
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

185
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,160
Dee doo doo doo doo.

186
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,500
Dee doo doo doo doo.

187
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,800
Dee doo doo doo doo.

189
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,880
Dee doo doo doo doo.

190
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,300
Dee doo doo doo doo.

191
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,300


192
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,300


193
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,300


194
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

195
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,700
Oh, whoa, I love you.

196
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,340
Hey, I love you.

197
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,420
Reese harvesting the scoop.

198
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,120
But I'm way too scared to dance.

199
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,320
There's nothing I can do.

200
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,320


201
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,320

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,380
pennysandbosskrubby.com

203
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,480
scan, baby.

204
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,020
I know you wanna play a lot online but I don't give a fuck about your life.

205
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,080
as Sister Melodious Chops

206
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,320
with Princess We Are Doe

207
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,240
and M.A.

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,900
And you can download little bits and pieces

209
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,260
of samples of Victoria Ganger

210
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
and Revelry songs

211
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,880
from www.revelrychicks.com

212
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,740
Revelrychicks being one word.

213
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Oh yeah.

214
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh yeah.

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,640
Yes.

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,320
Oh yeah.

217
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,420
Oh yeah.

218
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Oh yeah.

219
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,020
Oh yes, come as fast, senors and senoritas.

220
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,280
Oh yeah.

221
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,180
We're about to do the tequila dance now.

222
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,320
There goes Mr. Sister walking down the street.

223
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,020
Didn't know what to do, so he jumped in front of me

224
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,820
saying, go Mr. Sister, do that thing, do that thing.

225
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,120
Oh yeah.

226
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,400
Go Mr. Sister, do that thing, do that thing.

227
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,680
Now stop.

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,100
Hey, get your hands off of me.

229
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,620
I'm falling for my duck.

230
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
They were peaceful people.

231
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,460
Peaceful people who believed in the Lord.

232
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,160
They believed in Sunday afternoons

233
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,560
and shepherds by the pie

234
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,500
and standing up tall to big things

235
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,900
that were smaller than they could make out

236
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,980
with the naked eye.

237
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,740
Sometimes they dressed up funny and had a party.

238
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,620
They'd think about the guy smiling there,

239
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,420
that guy right there in that picture,

240
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
the guy with the pie.

241
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,540
Here come the naked wiki dancers.

242
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,840
Look at them naked eyeballs dancing around like that.

243
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,980
I paid $25 to get front row tickets.

244
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,740
Actually, it costs more than $20 to see the naked wiki dancers

245
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,960
at Starwood.

246
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,000
Although, they're out there every weekend,

247
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,760
including X-Day out there at Brushwood,

248
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,060
and the drumming never stops.

249
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,920
Drumming around fires or dancing half naked

250
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,000
is a big part of it.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,360
It's a big part of being a proper neo-pagan.

252
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,560
They never, ever stop.

253
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,060
And I believe that the drumming,

254
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,340
rather than the magic or the drugs,

255
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,200
is really what turns the normally staid people

256
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,000
who go out to Brushwood into sex fiends.

257
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,220
Starwood culminates, dear friends,

258
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,880
with this gigantic bonfire,

259
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,080
which is kind of lit ritually.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,220
And it's got fireworks inside of the bonfire,

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,380
as we've heard here,

262
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,920
as we enjoy this widescreen pan

263
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,980
across a vista of topless, fire-juggling youths.

264
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,180
And the drumming, friends,

265
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,780
the drumming never, ever stops.

266
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,460
And he can't take anymore.

267
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,480
He runs up to this one pagan dude,

268
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,540
and he grabs him by his sarong, I guess,

269
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,080
and, well, it goes with,

270
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,060
it goes, tell me,

271
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,720
what happens when the drums stop?

272
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,300
Pagan, which sounds like

273
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,340
bass solo.

274
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,700
laughter

275
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,780
Starwood rumbling in the jungle.

276
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,420
You missed it.

277
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,860
The sex was oozing from the trees.

278
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,640
Disgusting and perverted and beautiful

279
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,980
all at the same time.

280
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,380
music

281
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,420
music

282
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,160
music

283
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,760
music

284
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,260
music

285
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,440
music

286
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,740
music

287
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,960
Under the stars, under the night

288
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,140
Under the moon my pants are too tight

289
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,320
I know exactly what I want to do

290
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,580
I want to dance naked with you

291
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,940
I want to dance naked with you

292
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,600
music

293
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,220
music

294
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,740
music

295
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,000
music

296
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,980
music

297
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,100
music

298
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,580
music

299
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,380
music

300
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:26,740
it with you. Under the stars, under the night, under the moon, my pants are too tight. I

301
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,680
know exactly what I want to do. I want to dance naked with you. I want to dance naked

302
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,900
with you. I want to dance naked with you. I want to dance naked with you. I want to

303
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:46,160
dance naked with you. The El Queso All-Stars. And you can get more from the El Queso All-Stars,

304
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,640

305
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:05,140

306
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,540
at soundclick.com for the El Queso All-Stars.

307
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,000
State your occupation, please. A libertine and a seducer.

308
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Sex fiend. Oh, yes. Pure and simple. A libertine and a seducer.

309
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,340
State your address, please. Paradise. Paradise. Paradise. I can well understand that.

310
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,360
Oh, well, I guess we're ready to go. Praise Java Junction. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. And

311
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,540
praise Starwood.

312
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,540
Praise Starwood.

313
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:50,000
Because it is Starwood 23. This will be my 13th Starwood. Oh, lucky number. And most

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,540
of y'all are pagans and not yet dues paying subgeniuses. That's okay. But I should warn

315
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:06,100
my subgenius compatriots who are at a Starwood for the first time, yes, the pagan women are

316
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,780
beautiful.

317
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,120
Beautiful.

318
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:07,680


319
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:07,960


320
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,440
Beautiful.

321
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,880
Beautiful.

322
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


323
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


324
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


325
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


326
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


327
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


328
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


329
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


330
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


331
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:08,880


332
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,300
Wow.

333
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,400
Thank you.

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There's no Pinterest in this thing.

335
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,660
Thank you.

336
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:21,660


337
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:21,660


338
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:21,660


339
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:21,660


340
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:31,140
She was flying my house at midnight on the Sunday.

341
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,140


342
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,000
It's fine.

343
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,520
I mean, you get into the lights on Saturday night and you can't pie something.

344
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,420
Your 16-year old eye won't stop you looking good after-

345
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,620
Yeah.

346
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,200
I thought, oh, they're working on me.

347
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,760
They're trying to get me up.

348
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,480
But y'all are, I mean, many people here have very strong beliefs.

349
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,680
You know, UFOs, ghosts, the paranormal.

350
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,400
Bob doesn't buy that stuff.

351
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,200
Bob sells that stuff!

352
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,020
Yes!

353
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,260
Tick-tock, I don't want to play, I don't want to do.

354
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,360
Hey, diddle, diddle, 23's could do.

355
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,700
Me and Martha sure had fun.

356
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,760
Acapulco for everyone.

357
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,860
Goes out, foul, to get that Acapulco gold.

358
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,340
Ain't nothing it can't fix.

359
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,520
Old dogs can learn new tricks.

360
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,840
When the streets are lined with bricks.

361
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,520
Acapulco gold.

362
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,500
Misbehave in a matchbox.

363
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,840
High stakes.

364
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,660
Thanks to New Monet.

365
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,220
Did some of you here happen to see that cartoon show,

366
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,360
King of the Hill, that featured pagans?

367
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,220
Yeah!

368
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,820
I mean, to tell the truth, friends,

369
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm from the same town as Hank Hill in that cartoon.

370
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,940
That's why I sound sort of like him.

371
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,680
And frankly, I'm only about a step and a half left,

372
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,940
and I'm not as uptight as he is.

373
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:18,580
So for me to even hobble around that bonfire once or twice is saying a lot.

374
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,840
I've come a long way, man.

375
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,680
You know, slack has changed for me over the years.

376
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,880
There was one great line in that King of the Hill.

377
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,660
I like the way they handled it.

378
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,860
Actually, Bobby, the kid, wanted to become some kind of a pagan or mystic.

379
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,340
It was very loosely handled.

380
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,500
With these...

381
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,800
this nerdy older guy.

382
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,740
And Hank, his dad, wasn't concerned about the devil worship aspect or any of that.

383
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,540
He actually knew better.

384
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,980
He was concerned that Bobby would not get laid if he'd come around weirdos like that.

385
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,660
Frankly, I was like Bobby, and I wish I had discovered paganry when I was that age.

386
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,780
I might have gotten laid.

387
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,580
But as Bob Dobbs said,

388
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,420
breasts, specifically female breasts, are the anagram of the human form.

389
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,700
That doesn't make much sense, but Bob said it.

390
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,160
On the other hand, look what the conspiracy said.

391
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:26,600
In the words of my seventh grade biology teacher at the all-boys private school I went to,

392
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,960
he said,

393
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,400
breasts are nothing more than modified sweat glands.

394
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,220
I don't know what you boys are so excited about.

395
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
I left that all-boys press.

396
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,700
I'm a prep school.

397
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,220
Actually, the first time I was invited to Starwood, I was scared.

398
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,100
This was 1990.

399
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,340
Because it was like, I'm used to preaching in bars, but these people are like new agers or witches or something like that.

400
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,760
I thought, they're not like the Christians.

401
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,980
They know what we're making fun of.

402
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,120
Some people can't take a joke.

403
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,120
And that...

404
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,760
It qualifies you for membership in the Church of the Sub-Genius.

405
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,540
I don't feel like quoting our sacred, our one sacred...

406
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,340
Well, sure, why not?

407
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,640
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

408
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,480
I'll quote it anyway.

409
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,640
It's, fuck them if they can't take a joke!

410
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,800
Starwood includes dozens of lectures and speeches and sermons and stuff from the fame.

411
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,640
And workshops.

412
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,020
Practical workshops.

413
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,040
Such as this one.

414
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,220
In the making of crop circles.

415
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,520
By our own sub-genius friend from England, Reverend Circle Maker.

416
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,200
Also known as Matthew Williams.

417
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:59,440
Talking about how people have had all kinds of very strange experiences inside crop circles.

418
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,160
We've had paranormal experiences, seen UFOs, had healing experiences.

419
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,540
Some people claim that there are strange energetic effects which can be chemically sampled.

420
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,980
And people like W. Levengood, a scientist, has looked into these things.

421
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,900
And he said that there's strange crop changes that can be looked at and tested for.

422
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,040
Now, if all this is present in man-made crop circles, I want to know why.

423
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,880
Now, that's the big question for me.

424
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,420
It's not who's making the circles, but why do people have strange effects happen to them in man-made crop circles.

425
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,300
And the best explanation I've come to is that...

426
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,340
It's kind of like a placebo on one level.

427
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,740
In that, if you tell somebody that something is real.

428
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,640
If you tell them that a crop circle is real and they go in there, they're going to have a strange effect.

429
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,880
If you tell them that ten people have been healed in this crop circle and it's a great circle for going in for being healed.

430
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,280
The people will go into that circle and they'll have a healing effect.

431
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,240
But it doesn't work if everyone believes that crop circles are made by people.

432
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,760
So, what I do by coming and telling you this here is kind of like...

433
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,380
I'm telling you because you want to know.

434
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,160
I'm telling you because there are always going to be people who need to know.

435
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,960
But in many respects, when I go back home, I don't talk about this stuff as much as you think I'm talking here today.

436
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,200
Because it's necessary that people don't understand fully what the crop circle subject is about.

437
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,780
Postcards, there are all these postcards with crop circles on them.

438
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm looking at them and I'm like, I bet Matt did some of those.

439
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,120
And if he were to make one, he'd get busted for it.

440
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,360
But they're selling him his artwork in a government shop.

441
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,140
It will make sense.

442
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,060
And then I ask the woman, well there's this crop circle actually right in front of me.

443
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,900
This one right here.

444
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,940
I ask, well what about this crop circle?

445
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,660
And the woman working at the store told me, oh that's not a real crop circle.

446
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,060
That's what some hippies made that.

447
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,820
You are some hippies.

448
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,640
And I'm like, so what they're doing, they have government sponsored crop circle makers

449
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,600
who are making crop circles for postcards that the conspiracy sells to tourists.

450
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
But isn't that always the way?

451
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,140
But the real crop circles are made by aliens.

452
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,920
And that's what they're trying to cover up.

453
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,120
But we're not trying to make the complex simple.

454
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,340
Some of us like the complex complex.

455
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,960
We don't feel that we're owed answers.

456
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,980
Why do we deserve to know why and how the universe started?

457
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,900
Isn't it okay to leave a few mysteries out there, you know?

458
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,400
Keepers, if they ever caught the Loch Ness Monster or the Bigfoot or the Hot Beat or Horopod,

459
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,060
they'd be no more ho-

460
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,000
What do you mean they have to come up with some new hoax things?

461
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,160
But I'm sure the aliens will give us time for that.

462
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,100
Apparently there have been these alien abductions.

463
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,660
And I think what is happening is these aliens will abduct believers.

464
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,660
You know, they only abduct people who already believed in alien abductions.

465
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,660
They, you've heard the term missing time, where somebody wakes up and they've lost hours

466
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,460
and then they realize later that when they fell asleep and dreamed of a UFO,

467
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,100
it really was a UFO, and they lost those five hours.

468
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:15,760
Those same aliens are taking that time they steal from believers and giving it to disbelievers

469
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,520
and crop circle artists and subgeniuses so they'll have extra time to perform their clever hoaxes.

470
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,400
Which, nonetheless, give people magic powers and healing energy.

471
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
It's just amazing how that works.

472
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,600
How the worst fakers can get you to Oz and back.

473
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,160
But, don't look at me, I don't know how this thing works.

474
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,300
It was like ice water going up and down your spine.

475
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,660
I felt something.

476
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,860
I felt something touch me.

477
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,220
I felt something touch my right hand like a hand touching my hand.

478
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,660
Spiritual contact.

479
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,920
It was a triangle shaped craft hovering over Glendale.

480
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,880
I made a pact with the devil.

481
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,200
I'm convinced there's something going on.

482
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,340
I'm a warlock.

483
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,380
They died.

484
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,520
They died.

485
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,840
They found them dead.

486
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,780
Then the undertaker says,

487
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,460
Some things you don't have to explain, Mike.

488
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,220
They just happened.

489
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,020
Oh yeah, George.

490
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,200
I even saw the devil one night.

491
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,400
This is, uh, Queen Andrew.

492
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:22,760
How do you do?

493
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:22,760


494
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:22,760


495
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:22,760


496
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm here at Omaha with STRATCOM and the future base command.

497
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,700
And the participators.

498
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,940
Yeah, we've got ray guns.

499
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,540
There is an optical neural net computer system that becomes conscious.

500
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,600
Spiritual contact.

501
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,240
And we're definitely not alone.

502
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,300
You know, we're never as radical as reality itself.

503
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,280
Ha ha.

504
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Ha ha.

505
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,700
Ha ha.

506
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,140
Ha ha.

507
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:17,900
Ha ha.

508
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:18,680


509
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,480
Ha ha.

510
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,220
Ha ha.

511
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,800
Ha ha.

512
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,300
Ha ha.

513
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,820
Ha ha.

514
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,940
My head's spinning like crazy.

515
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:38,940


516
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


517
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


518
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


519
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


520
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


521
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


522
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


523
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000


524
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,220
You know what's going on.

525
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,220


526
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
A haha.

527
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,020
another moon and there's always going to be a new moon.

528
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,180
I know I leave the moon world you always think.

529
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,360
I once saw the sun's star.

530
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,020
And now it's coming in to class c and it's going to be like u

531
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,760
The Art Bell Remix.

532
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,620
Thanks to Rev. Shankar.

533
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,480
Did you see the pictures of Osama and Saddam's gay wedding on the weekly news?

534
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,800
Not only did I see that, but Paul Krasner read it to the crowd at Starwood.

535
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:18,780
I was tempted to do that, but I would not rip off some other comedy writer's crap for a paying job.

536
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,120
But Paul Krasner would.

537
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,140
And did.

538
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,140
But that guy didn't know.

539
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,800
And it was funny. It was funny as hell.

540
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It was a beautiful photograph of Osama and Saddam.

541
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,820
I thought he looked lovely.

542
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,440
Or they both looked lovely.

543
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,160
And it was a very well-written article.

544
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,080
It was worthy of the onion, really.

545
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,180
Yeah, well, ostrich feathers are quite a hard-to-find commodity in modern-day Iraq

546
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,400
because all the plutonium spent in uranium bombings.

547
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,260
Well, and they ate the ostriches at the zoo.

548
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,560
They found them out in a farm field buried under about six inches of dirt.

549
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,080
Who did?

550
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,640
I don't know.

551
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,180
I want to know who found it.

552
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,420
I don't care about, you know, they found it.

553
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,240
I want to know who's responsible.

554
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,320
The renaming of total information awareness as terrorism information awareness.

555
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:14,500
And, you know, if you recall, they called the invasion Operation Iraqi Freedom.

556
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,280
And they kept saying, as they couldn't find...

557
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,680
weapons of mass destruction.

558
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
They talked, well, we're really liberating.

559
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,220
We're liberating Iraq from Saddam's dictatorship.

560
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:34,280
But the reason that they didn't call it Operation Iraqi Liberation is because the acronym for

561
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,200
that would have been OIL.

562
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,800
And so...

563
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,300
Paul Krasner at Starwood.

564
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,380
I'm almost 50.

565
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,320
I kind of miss the Cold War.

566
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:48,760
I miss the Cold War.

567
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,500
It was cooler.

568
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,120
You know, you can really chill in the Cold War.

569
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:04,140
But this latest one, the TV wars, you know, the follow-up to the 91 mini-series that we've

570
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,640
just had.

571
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,960
Cousin Bush said at one point...

572
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,580
Bush was...

573
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,340
Can you believe that the country would let...

574
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,140
Like Iraq, for instance, where this guy's the head of the damn secret police.

575
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,900
He becomes the dictator of this country.

576
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,020
And then he puts his kids in charge.

577
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,400
What kind of a country would allow that sort of thing?

578
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,760
Anyway, Cousin, as I said, Cousin Bush was saying at the beginning of the war, he actually

579
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,920
said this phrase.

580
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,900
The goal of this war is peace.

581
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,460
The goal of this war is peace.

582
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,940
Well, I thought...

583
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,120
Now, I'm thinking about it.

584
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


585
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


586
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


587
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


588
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


589
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


590
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


591
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


592
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


593
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,120


594
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,780
1984 came, 19 years late.

595
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,300
The upside of that is that that means X day we still have to look forward to.

596
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,140
Bob predicted that the saucers would save the save on July 5th, 1998.

597
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,960
And if 1984 is 19 years late, then we only have to wait until 2017.

598
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,720
Praise Bob.

599
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:22,640
But these serious protesters, I mean, not like me, but serious protesters and some drunks,

600
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,920
have bribed, they said, Reverend Stan, you aren't doing enough about this war.

601
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,800
You should be telling everybody that Bush is Hitler.

602
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,000
And it's like, well, what is the right thing to do?

603
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,560
As Paul Cranston was talking about,

604
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,000
he gave this whole really moving thing about the unfairness, the horribleness of that whole thing.

605
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,020
But then it was like, well, what do you suggest we do about it?

606
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,900
He drew a blank.

607
00:32:52,220 --> 00:33:00,180
He'd been so depressed by the seeming helplessness of the anti-war movement.

608
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,660
And in my case, that knee-jerk stuff drives me crazy.

609
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,000
Friends, I tried to visualize world peace, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.

610
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
The best thing to have.

611
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,000
And the last thing that happened in the last year is I learned how to pronounce nuclear properly.

612
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,000
So what is the right thing to do?

613
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,880
Study survivalist manuals.

614
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,180
Learn how to shoot, hoard food.

615
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:32,160
Or what I'm going to do, learn how to give the best oral sex in the world from inside of a barrel.

616
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,740
But those soldiers, you know, those conscripted soldiers come by the train station.

617
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,460
They go, oh, man, use that barrel over there.

618
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,780
She's really good.

619
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,240
The other one goes, you know, that's not a woman in there.

620
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,740
Shut up.

621
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,820
I still don't have my voice.

622
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,700
Somebody found it.

623
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,000
One of those witches took it at Starwood, I think.

624
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, they're beautiful, but they're treacherous.

625
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah, took my voice.

626
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Here I am, four or five days later, still trying to find my voice.

627
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,680
Trying to find yourself.

628
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,760
When you go to those pagan hipster festivals and explorations of consciousness,

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,680
you're supposed to be finding yourself, right?

630
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,640
Did you just unearth more questions?

631
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
Another horrible can of worms?

632
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,240
No, we had mud healings down there at T-Bay.

633
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,560
Everything was just hunky-dory down there.

634
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
Mud healings.

635
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,820
Mud dance parties.

636
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,280
Well, there was lots of mud to be had since it rained for the first four days of the week-long festival.

637
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:47,760
We looked until by the time we'd reasonable degree

638
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,780
to just lay it outside.

639
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:50,780


640
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:50,780


641
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,100
They could.

642
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,460
It's a乡 because it's on Christmas like you gonna get, you know,

643
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:57,660
Can you imagine their fasion?

644
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,860
Hostel stuff?

645
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:00,620


646
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,180
A man is made out of mud.

647
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,620
Yeah, some people say a man is made out of mud.

648
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,320
Some people love their mud.

649
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,940
Present company included.

650
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,960
I saw people loving mud at that Starwood Festival.

651
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,400
My whole seminar was about loving your mud.

652
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,640
Well, it was because the mud was your only possession, right?

653
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,220
Mm-hmm.

654
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,040
The birth of the blues when mud was your only possession.

655
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,140
I even took away their names.

656
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
All their last names are now Smith.

657
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,140
This was your workshop at Starwood?

658
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,640
Yeah.

659
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,120
Wasn't that supposed to be a workshop in the history of American music, not the love of your mud?

660
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,480
How can you discuss one without the other?

661
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,500
The history of rock and roll and mud love?

662
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,200
Mm-hmm.

663
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,620
Mud love at the crossroads.

664
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,040
Makes total sense to me.

665
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,180
It made total sense to 25 believers in my workshop.

666
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,680
Well, it was weird because I didn't know you were doing that.

667
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:35,900
I was walking down the roads at Starwood, and I'd see these hipsters and characters walk by cradling ostrich egg-sized lumps of mud.

668
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,580
And they'd have little sticks and things stuck in.

669
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,600
And I'd have to get them to decorate them.

670
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,640
They were cradling them like babies.

671
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,420
That's right.

672
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,280
They're mud babies.

673
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:53,500
I didn't understand until later that it was you, Professor Smith, that had commanded these young students and old students...

674
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,220
And old, yeah.

675
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:05,240
...to make babies or something out of mud and to love them as their only possession so that they could, I guess, identify with the slaves.

676
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,080
The slaves and the Appalachians.

677
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,020
When all you had was your mud.

678
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,660
That's right.

679
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,800
Hey, at least you guys had mud.

680
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,400
All we had was sand down in Texas.

681
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

682
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,120
We didn't have water to mix with it.

683
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,140
So we couldn't cradle our sand ball.

684
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,920
It would just fall through our fingers.

685
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,940
Somebody actually pointed out that right there, right near there, the Mississippi Basin cuts through there.

686
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,120
So that mud really is, you know, Delta mud.

687
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,560
The Mississippi what?

688
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,420
Delta-bound mud.

689
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,400
The Mississippi Basin cuts up.

690
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,620
Well, weird water underchance.

691
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,000
Sandals go all over the country.

692
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,480
But you mean the...

693
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,260
The Ohio River cuts way off in different directions into Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but it all happens underground.

694
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,680
You're saying when a pagan urinates on the path at Brushwood, that water eventually goes...

695
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,920
Eventually gets down to New Orleans, yeah.

696
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,060
And parties at Mardi Gras.

697
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,040
Yeah, right.

698
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,560
But by then it's combined with an...

699
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,980
I mean, have you ever seen the Mississippi River down there, right there at New Orleans?

700
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,820
Yes, I have.

701
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,500
It's a lot of water flowing there.

702
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:19,820
So it has to combine with many, many, many people's having their urinations in the mud.

703
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,000
I know how it is.

704
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:34,560
You know, the vibes from your atoms of uric acid join with the vibes of all your, you know, fellow party goers eventually makes it into the Gulf of Mexico.

705
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,180
Yeah.

706
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,660
And when you stand there down at the French market and watch all that water, that muddy-looking water...

707
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,600
Yeah, you can see the water flowing past.

708
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,780
That's a lot of flush toilets and a lot of pagans and a lot of campgrounds.

709
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,200
Mm-hmm.

710
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,420
Indigestion.

711
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,340
Un insecto.

712
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,540
Dolor de estomago.

713
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,220
Diarrhea.

714
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,240
Diarrhea.

715
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,000
Diarrhea.

716
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,540
Diarrhea.

717
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,300
Diarrhea.

718
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,540
Diarrhea.

719
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:10,560


720
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,020
Indigestion.

721
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:40,660
The next would be Part 2, episode 3.

722
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


723
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


724
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


725
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


726
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


727
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


728
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


729
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,660


730
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:47,380
Psyche Soap is the only soap that makes you clean inside.

731
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,060
Psyche Soap, Psyche Soap, used by every star.

732
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,380
Lose your low-down dirty blues and buy yourself a bar.

733
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,960
Clean up or flip out.

734
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,220
Now, truth time.

735
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,340
Our next film featuring the dead kids, it's Thurbs with Dirty Thurbs.

736
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,600
Dead boys, I mean boys, dead kids.

737
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,320
Criminal priest, criminal menace, dangerous dead boys, dead kids.

738
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,640
Thurbs with Dirty Thurbs.

739
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,460
Uh, you, uh, um, very interesting.

740
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,720
Anyway, there's an old prayer.

741
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,440
A subgenius, well, it's not really very old.

742
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,860
A serenity prayer that basically goes,

743
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:49,040
Dogs, grant me the serenity to endure the pink boys I cannot kill.

744
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,680
The courage to snuff the ones that I can,

745
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,080
and the wisdom not to do it when the cops are around.

746
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
Now, that's all real funny,

747
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,660
and, uh, and, you know, we do do a lot of,

748
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,000
uh, looking down, I guess,

749
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,100
and some of, uh, our pagan brethren don't like the Church of the Subgenius.

750
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,040
They say that it, it trivializes serious enlightenment.

751
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,660
You know, because when you're enlightened,

752
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,280
I guess you're supposed to look kind of like this.

753
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,800
Now, a friend of ours on the internet,

754
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,020
a guy who had actually been through quite a bit,

755
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,420
but he got, uh, turned off to subgenius at some point,

756
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,280
mainly because he got into Zen Buddhism.

757
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,000
No, he became a born-again Christian,

758
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,580
then he, he read the Dalai Lama,

759
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,520
and he, he got, he decided that we weren't serious enough.

760
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,640
But then he saw the pictures from last X Day,

761
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,980
which was our festival a couple of weeks before Starwood.

762
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,320
If it had worked out, there wouldn't be a Starwood at all.

763
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:56,980
So I'm just joking.

764
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,900
They, uh, and he said,

765
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,400
You know, I was looking at those pictures of the subgenius,

766
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,540
and I said,

767
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,480
You know, I was looking at the pictures of the subgeniuses from X Day,

768
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,860
and it was, it looked like rooms full of power.

769
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,740
You know, it was a bunch of happy, smiling, laughing people being creative.

770
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,920
And that's what looked like enlightenment to him.

771
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,900
Or, well, maybe it's instupidment, but anyway, it worked.

772
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,440
You know, he came back to Bob.

773
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,120
As, uh, as Dr. Onan once said,

774
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,020
Even the devil needs somebody to play devil's advocate sometimes.

775
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,320
And Bob is the devil!

776
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,440
The devil's advocate!

777
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,180
And that's why we advocate Bob.

778
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,260
Praise Bob!

779
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,480
Because he won that bet with the devil!

780
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,400
He won that bet with the devil!

781
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,560
He won that bet for your sins, my friends,

782
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,820
to excuse and justify your every sin from now on!

783
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,380
I'm a holy man, and I can now give everyone of you permission to do anything you damn well please!

784
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,440
Absolutely!

785
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,480
Absolutely!

786
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,900
Absolutely!

787
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,080
Absolutely!

788
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,200
Sounds good, doesn't it?

789
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,620
That sounds real good!

790
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,060
That's what they told satan before he took all that acid.

791
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:23,360
The link between Good Nutrition and Heidi Tubbs is clearly demonstrated by Heidi Tubbs with the State Department of Pyramids.

792
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,400
We invite you to start tomorrow.

793
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:33,060
The noted, uh, Egyptian composer and musicologist Halim El-Dab

794
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:42,100
Bob is an honored guest at most Starwebs, as we hear here in this joint performance with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

795
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,600
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

796
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,620
I'm living in Arizona.

797
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,900
I'm living in Arizona.

798
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,660
I'm living in Arizona.

799
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:53,840
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, with special guest Dr. Ligea and Princess We Are Dead.

800
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,300
Pretty little house and a looking glass.

801
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,280
Showed us the way but left too fast.

802
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,080
Raised on Apollo and Johnny Quest.

803
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,080
This dream's the one I live the best.

804
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,420
That's what really makes.

805
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,560
That's what really makes.

806
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,700
Loving in space, I'm a TV screen.

807
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:42,260
Where one dream comes true, where one should live the best.

808
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,620
Where I love the fun of all of floods and winds.

809
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:49,940
Deep in the unnerving, at a very Viel.

810
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,300
Here, what I have is that I was supposed to hear.

811
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,420
Think about how my life's been changed.

812
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:11,180
Oh no, soon shall I see them come, this covered mountains of home.

813
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,900
Alwyn, they're from northern Ohio.

814
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,980
And this, I believe, is a band called Jana.

815
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:41,260
This guy is a bum, and we'll take him down to the bottom.

816
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,660
No need to be afraid, no, no, no.

817
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,280
Come with me, we'll find a lance to claim.

818
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,020
Alone in my heart, I won't see.

819
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,780
Forbidden conscience.

820
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,540
I'll take your hand, and see that I won't expire.

821
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,300
I'll see you in the sky, and tell you that I'm not alive.

822
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,840
Alone in my heart, I won't see.

823
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,240
Forbidden conscience.

824
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,740
Conscious, be conscious.

825
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,800
Unconscious, so conscious, be conscious.

826
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,300
Unconscious, so conscious, be conscious.

827
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,860
Howl on the moon.

828
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,240
Come with me, run with me.

829
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,480
Come howl on the moon tonight.

830
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,500
Howl on the moon tonight.

831
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,780
Come with me, run with me.

832
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,920
Come howl on the moon tonight.

833
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,020
Come on, make no need to be afraid.

834
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:02,780
Reach.

835
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,880
Reach is good in how she is made.

836
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:10,020
How you choose to sing your tune depends on how you see your moon.

837
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,380
Ain't no need to be afraid.

838
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,240
Reach is good in how she is made.

839
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,300
How you choose to sing your tune depends on how you see your moon.

840
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,520
The sister Melodious Chops, Princess Wiardo and M.A.,

841
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,240
also known as Victoria Ganger and Revelry, live at Starbred.

842
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,940
I'll be the moon.

843
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,020
I'll be the moon.

844
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:41,240
You choose to lead, must follow.

845
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:50,240
But if you fall, you will fall alone.

846
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,600
If you should stand.

847
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,720
Starbred is sponsored by Ace,

848
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,860
which is itself sponsored by the Chameleon.

849
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,380
The Chameleon Club.

850
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,920
Many of them heard here in the background.

851
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,560
Friends, if you want to know more about Starbred or Ace, you can find it.

852
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:28,720
They have a great website at www.rosencomet.com.

853
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,040
That's R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T.

854
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,800
M-E-T.

855
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,640
Rosencomet.com.

856
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:50,680
Or write to Ace at 1643 Lee Road, Room 9, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

857
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,460
And their 1-800 number is 800-446-4962.

858
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,980
All of that at Rosencomet.com.

859
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,040
M-E-T.

860
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,660
Uh, friends, in the background, the music we hear, well, what we just heard was Burning Sage.

861
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,120
This is Gaelic Storm.

862
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,320
They're very heavy on the Celtic music at Starbred, and the African music, and the Native American music,

863
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,900
and just about any music that's best danced to in really skimpy clothing.

864
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:46,280
Western Angbian children, um, really love the band.

865
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,380
So they used to play it when they were higher than they are now, absolute outside kids.

866
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:46,440
I like their music.

867
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:46,440


868
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,640
I believe the который Stephanie played for their class is really the music for my day.

869
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:47,760
Because the favor makes your day even longer.

870
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,760
And you're aétait....

871
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,560
Not going first, not going last.

872
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,320
We're just going to see the content of the band's history.

873
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:58,760
I think they sang quite a bit, and when I listen to theаяじゃない mimed the music

874
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:58,760


875
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:58,860
And be happy that you're listening.

876
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:58,880
And if you're not, thanks a million.

877
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,040
I'm moving on because there's five more songs that I wouldn'taba asked for.

878
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,040


879
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,480
www.beerforman.com

880
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,100
We must first pump up our hate of it.

881
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,860
I stand before you now, truly unafraid, in slack.

882
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,400
Why? Because I disbelieve something you do not?

883
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,340
No! I stand here in slack because I remember.

884
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:58,100
I remember that I am here not because of the path of lies before me,

885
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,560
but because of the path of lies behind me.

886
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,440
I remember that for 80 million years we have fought these humans.

887
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:18,020
I remember that for 80 million years they have set their jobs to destroy us.

888
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:24,100
And after an eternity of work, I remember that which matters most.

889
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,840
We are still here.

890
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,960
Tonight, let us send a message to these normals.

891
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,240
Let us tremble and shake this campground.

892
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,260
Let us shake this land of rock, stick, and froth.

893
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,020
Let us be heard from Tranquility Base to Babylon Heights.

894
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,220
Tonight, let us make them remember this is some genius,

895
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,980
and we must have slack.

896
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,580
Great ball!

897
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,300
Q Matrix Music.

898
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,620
Q Matrix Music.

899
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,100
This race, for neither ship nor sling of our chagrin, surrender.

900
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,880
Thank you.

901
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:31,940
And so the naked crazy pagans of every possible race here in America,

902
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,700
and from all over the world, finish their square dance to Gaelic Storm, I believe that was.

903
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,560
Whoa!

904
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,300
And this band here is Baka Beyond.

905
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,720
World music is, I guess, what it's all about.

906
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,640
Like I say, very heavy on the drumming.

907
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,100
Friends, it's a great way to spend a weekend, actually.

908
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,440
Thank you.

909
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,060
Thank you.

910
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,480
Thank you.

911
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,280
Thank you.

912
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,480
Thank you.

913
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,000
Thank you.

00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:01,560


915
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:01,620


916
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:01,620

00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:01,940


919
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:01,940


920
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:01,940


921
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,340
Thank you.

922
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,900
Thank you.

923
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:18,540

926
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,880
Yeah, I'm a faggot.

927
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:26,880


928
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:26,880


929
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,780
If not, don't take it to the RNVVGC or person's

930
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,460
All right!

931
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,360

I'm the music director of O2

961
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:24,100
And right now, on stage, live,

962
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,740
we have a music video playing,

963
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,120
and maybe getting more music.

964
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,460
Mix that.

965
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,980
Mix that.

966
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,280
Mix what?

967
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,480
Mix the announcement about the

968
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,640

getting monkey sex on stage.

970
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,360
Why should I mix the announcement?

971
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,780
Because if the place is not happening,

972
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,960
there is no Niggas, Niggas, Niggas, Niggas

973
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,800
getting monkey sex on stage.

974
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:48,700
Uh-huh.

And friends, all throughout

981
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,060
this show, you've been hearing the

982
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,240
collages of

983
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,780
Fernanda Nde,

984
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,320
Ali Moore,

985
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,240
such as...

986
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,220
Remember, people watch the lion

987
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,100
drinkers to make sure you have alcohol

988
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,720
and fire on every level of your home.

989
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,340
Remember, if someone

990
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,360
in your household smokes under the influence

991
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,480
of fire, you must be aware

992
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,080
of Ontario. Remember,

993
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,100
remember, I'm a dangerous drinker.

994
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,120
Remember, there's more

995
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,040
to responsible drinking than alcohol

996
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,240
and fire on every level of your home.

997
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,140
I think...

998
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,700
And I think...

999
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,840
Flash...

1000
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,180
Whatever.

1001
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,900
I like that.

1002
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,520
Ooh la la.
