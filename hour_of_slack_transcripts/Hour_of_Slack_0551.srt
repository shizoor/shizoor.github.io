1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
And, uh, gosh, tonight, friends, I had to bring my little dafter, Sivit, the Blivit, down here.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,400
I guess just to show off to her friend, Em.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,160
Tell Em hello. Go ahead.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,100
Hi, Emily.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,660
Okay, that's done.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,160
And, uh, we can soon get into the show.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,940
The horrible show, tonight's show, specializing in the, uh, or featuring the oral tradition of the Pobucker.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,300
Ah, yes.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,760
That film is shown to you not only for the benefit of your own personal good health, but for that of your entire unit.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,260
Lights out?

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,940
Some of the things that you will soon see.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,260
are highly spectacular.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,640
But let me assure you that they are authentic in every respect

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,140
and are dramatic proof of the excellence built into your...

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,280
Self-genius.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,800
Our own.

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,740
Watch.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,240
Now, see for yourself and take what you find here and put it to work.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,180
I am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm.

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,180
Cover yourself with wet newspapers and lie still

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,140
until the blast is over.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,580
I'm going to make you subside.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,700
Oh my God.

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
Have no fear.

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,160
You will not be hypnotized.

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,120
You will not lose consciousness.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,760
Nor will you be made uncomfortable in any way.

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,660
Bob?

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,600
Bob?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,500
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,700
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Bob?

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,140
Bob?

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,140


35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,140


36
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,140


37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,140


38
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,140


39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,460
That's your key phrase.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,180
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,460
We are controlling transmission.

42
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,480
Now, did you ever see anything as new and as fresh looking as that?

43
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,340
It's so new, it's almost too new to be true.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
Kill that.

45
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,840
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels and drag them three times around the radio station.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,020
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the sludge.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,000
And what exactly does this do for them?

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,740
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,140
You know, by golly, he's absolutely right.

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,940
Wake up, puppet boy!

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,200
Unpredicably big sea monsters.

52
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,320
Sea.

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
Man-eating bugs.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,880
Bigger than buildings.

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:04,360
A spectacular adventure on the Angry Subgenius Hour of Sweat.

56
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:12,360
A mother nature-grown berserk striking back at the industrial society that has exploited her.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,200
We must stop it.

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,620
Mankind hangs in the balance.

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,580
It's just crazy enough to work.

60
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,720
Oh, Jim.

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,180
Don't make me relive that.

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,680
Nightmare.

63
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,060
The Subgenius Hour of Sweat.

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
Clean, aristocratic, modern styling.

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,280
Truly distinctive.

66
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
There it goes.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,140
A little scuffed, but basically undamaged.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,780
That's us, friends.

69
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,600
A little scuffed, but, uh, yeah.

70
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,860
Yes, it's gonna be a study in po-buckerdom tonight.

71
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,540
A study of the oral tradition of the po-bucker.

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:08,460
We have many, uh, funny and revealing, and yes, telling, telling, uh, archival recordings of po-buckers, both subgenius and pink, in top spouting mode.

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,620
Uh, and also some of, some of the all-time great moments in talk radio.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,660
Uh, you'll certainly want to have your illegal bootlegging equipment up and running at all times.

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:31,980
Uh, but before, I guess before we sing the song of the po-bucker, we'll let, we'll go into this, um, this little section of tape.

76
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:44,780
Jayner Hyperkleets, I think, is mayhaps the, the, the greatest of the subgenius po-bucker scholars, and we'll let him speak for everyone.

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Here we go, pick up, boy!

78
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,100
Ah!

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,300
Ah!

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,520
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet as they once had thousands of years back.

81
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,260
And that ain't all...

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,580
...since!

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,520
Now, Bobby doesn't steal cars.

84
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,800
There's just certain areas in Southwest City that are designated as Bobby Free Toe Away Zones.

85
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,560
You park in a Bobby Toe Away Zone, that ain't your car.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,820
That's Bobby's car.

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,500
Hey, wait, where are you going with my car?

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,600
Sorry, this ain't your car anymore.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,160
Check your city map, you in a Bobby Free Toe Away Zone.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
But there's not any kind of sign.

91
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,060
See that cigarette butt?

92
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,020
Laying on the ground?

93
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,460
That's the sign.

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,640
No, don't steal my car!

95
00:05:48,620 --> 00:06:01,260
You can have my incurable cancer, you can have my death, you can have my screaming bratty kids, you can have my bitchy wife, but just don't take my car.

96
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,700
I'm taking your car, boy.

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:13,620
No, wait, you can have my personality defects, you can have my schizophrenia, you can have the voices I hear in my mind.

98
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,660
Oh, boy.

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:30,340
You can have my personal problems, you can have my $3,000 debt, but just don't take my car and my mistress.

100
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,140
You in a Bobby Free Toe Away Zone.

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Your mistress is in a Bobby Free Toe Away Zone, too.

102
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,320
Bobby, no. Bobby, please. Bobby, no. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you, Bobby.

103
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,760
You know, Bobby can steal cars that, even if they ain't whole cars, he can...

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Like, I mean, who's gonna buy their garden and salvage yard?

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,520
All there are are just rusted-out frames out there.

106
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,740
Bobby just got in the chassis of a rusty, rusted-out old 57 Chevy.

107
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,320
It didn't have an engine, it didn't have tires, it didn't have a body.

108
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,640
It didn't have a body.

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,840
It didn't have nothing.

110
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,320
I just, uh, don't ask me how, but Bobby somehow hot-wired it, drove that sucker home.

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,740
He said, all this needs is a couple of lug nuts.

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,720
He just put a couple of lug nuts on there.

113
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,380
Lo and behold, there was a car.

114
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,240
There was one old car. There was nothing left of it but a camshaft.

115
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,240
Just an old camshaft laying there on the ground.

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,860
There wasn't anybody gonna guard it. Just an old camshaft.

117
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,740
Now, don't ask me how.

118
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,060
Bobby Freed just started it up and just drove it off.

119
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,160
Just an old camshaft.

120
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,900
Then Bobby can just change it into a brand new car.

121
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,620
He just took some paint out. He took some spray paint.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,560
Painted it.

123
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,120
There was a car sitting there.

124
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,520
Freaked me out. He sold it to Billy Ray for $20,000.

125
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,180
Billy Ray took his gal, Charlene, to the drive-in movie.

126
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
He was making out with her.

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,520
Now, I was sitting in a bar with Bobby.

128
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,020
All of a sudden, Bobby just said, look at this.

129
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,380
Took two lug nuts out of his pocket.

130
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,420
That car just disintegrated. Just turned back into a camshaft.

131
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,900
Science was baffled and powerless.

132
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,720
This is confusing.

133
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,260
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.

134
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,900
Well, things are looking up.

135
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:02,920
A once proud civilization now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful ally, Bob.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
Titan against Titan.

137
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,180
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.

138
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,880
You'll see it all in Godzilla vs. Man-Horse.

139
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,100
Megalon.

140
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,700
But things weren't normal. There were changes.

141
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,220
Ah!

142
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,080
Ah!

143
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,080
Your mother bit me.

144
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,780
I never saw him bite like that.

145
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,120
It's a beautiful sight.

146
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,700
Strange, frightful changes.

147
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,140
That night, it all started.

148
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,460
Stop doing that.

149
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,420
Ah!

150
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,260
See this line, boy?

151
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,900
Here's what I call McCounty Line.

152
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,960
Step over this line, you stand in McCounty.

153
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,480
You break the law over here in the...

154
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,420
In Arkansas, we got three kinds of laws.

155
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,760
Commissarimeter, felony, and sodomy.

156
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,920
Felony will get you sent to the federal penitentiary.

157
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,320
Sodomy will get you sawed, boy.

158
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,020
Cut you in half.

159
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,680
Now, if some men you get busted for sodomy in their precinct,

160
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,700
they're just gonna cut you a little bit.

161
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,100
You get busted for sodomy in my precinct, I'm gonna cut you, boy.

162
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm gonna hurt you.

163
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm gonna cut you in half, and I want you to know that.

164
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,780
I don't know how they do things out in California or Los Angeles

165
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,040
or wherever the hell you come from.

166
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm just saying that you cross over this line,

167
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,080
you're in...

168
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,340
You're in standing in McCounty Line.

169
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
You're standing in McCounty.

170
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,580
You break the law in McCounty, I'll shoot you dead.

171
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,520
You fall over dead on that sidewalk, I'll give you a ticket for loitering.

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,980
You don't pay that ticket for loitering within 30 days, I'll throw you in jail.

173
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,080
And jail's one place you sure as hell don't wanna be, especially if you're dead, boy.

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,240
.

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,240


176
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,740
As part of your reward, it's over the air.

177
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,540
Are you listening to this show on a stereo or a...

178
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,320
Well, you...

179
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,840
Hello, am I still here?

180
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,500
I keep...

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,880
Of course, Frank, you're still here.

182
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,260
...being put on speaker bones by this other person, you know, this other one.

183
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,140
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,000
You know, some folks are...

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,680
Where did you get the idea to listen to this show?

186
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,220
...they kicked in the show on their fillings in their teeth.

187
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,620
I don't know, well...

188
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,980
I mean, how did you know about this show?

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,060
Come on, admit it, fess up, get it off your chest.

190
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,180
My friends told me.

191
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,020
Aha, word of mouth.

192
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,020
Okay, put that down.

193
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,720
Now, are you a Democrat or a Republican?

194
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,060
I'll get it.

195
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,400
Oh, I'll get it, okay.

196
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,260
I'm...

197
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,220
It just doesn't matter, I'm not into politics or political things.

198
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,740
And where are you calling from?

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,620
Well, they're into you to the tune of a $4 trillion debt.

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,020
General Jigarath, are you all alone here?

201
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah, I don't know, but it doesn't matter, I don't vote.

202
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,600
Okay, here we go, line 17, where are you calling from, mother's maiden name, and...

203
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,640
Ah, yes, the tune of the unknown voter in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.

204
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh, yeah, we better just vote for these unknown fornits here.

205
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,220
I'll get the word out, Bob.

206
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,200
Well, we're not that unknown.

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,780
When you cast your vote for us, you're really voting for a change that is a spare change for both of us.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,740
Oh, right on.

209
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,400
You could call it chump change.

210
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,560
Yeah, what I'm saying is it's time to change your tape if you're doing a 90-minute tape.

211
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,120
That's right.

212
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,940
If you're taping...

213
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,340
...the show with all its splendid sound effects, it's now time to discontinue your 90-minute tape and flippancy-flop it over.

214
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,080
Oh, they got you the tape!

215
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,640
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me, that was, I was impetuous, a youthful impetuousness.

216
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
I often go off that way.

217
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,360
There we go.

218
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,160
I need a bucket of ice water dashed across my loins, and then I'm myself again.

219
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,800
Oh, okay.

220
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,860
It's that disease I caught in the tropics.

221
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,000
Can we do that before the show?

222
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,160
That's how we wake up for each show.

223
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
Oh, that terrible alarm clock.

224
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
Can't you just get it out?

225
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm gonna have to phone with you guys, because this, I do not want to create the most enormous phone bill.

226
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,380
Oh, you're calling from outside the caller area.

227
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,840
Well...

228
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,060
Yeah.

229
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,360
Thanks for lending your dulcet tones to us.

230
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
Thanks for lending your voice and angelic presence to our divine symposium.

231
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,820
Unless you have a much more cheaper form of calling.

232
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,460
Well, you can come down and be on the show.

233
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,900
We'll get some cheap person to call next.

234
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,940
Good evening, Bob. How are you doing?

235
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,400
Good evening, Rocky. I'm very, very confused.

236
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Well, what are you confused about?

237
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,040
About I'm kind of confused myself, and we all get to that point in our life.

238
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,140
But we have to stop, sit down, smell the roses, and try to put our morals together and see what's wrong.

239
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,820
What seems to be out of place tonight with you?

240
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,640
Well, first of all, Rocky, I mean, you used to be very, very selective with who you would call.

241
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,100
Now you're calling just anybody.

242
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
Well, I'm going to become more selective to who I call again.

243
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,980
See, some people just don't appreciate good callers.

244
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm not...

245
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm not too concerned about what Sick Norman says or does.

246
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
I ain't never calling that freak.

247
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
I ain't listening to his show.

248
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,460
That's it.

249
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,160
Forget about that fat boy.

250
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,360
That man is a real smooth-talking Yankee that come down here,

251
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,060
come down to my neighborhood, my Southland, my coat-of-the-hills area.

252
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,400
He wants to tell me and everybody else what to do and how to live.

253
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,880
I want my statements made.

254
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,200
I want the people to listen to me.

255
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,120
I am the man on the phone.

256
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,540
I am the man that calls these people.

257
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,840
I ain't got no book in front of me.

258
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,820
I ain't got no magazine in front of me.

259
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm sitting here in a phone booth.

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,940
I am not fading into oblivion.

261
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,120
I am going to be stronger, harder.

262
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
You talk about your solar-flex machine...

263
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,180
Have you been drinking out of the jug again, Rocky?

264
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,340
Ah, no.

265
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,540
My voice might sound a little bit different tonight, does it?

266
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, yes, it does.

267
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,740
That's because I'm in a phone booth, and it sounds like I'm in an echo chamber.

268
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,260
And a lot of times when I sing, I sing in a phone booth.

269
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,860
You go into phone booths and sing?

270
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm a songwriter, Mr. Lassner,

271
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,920
and I'm also a poet.

272
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,680
I'm also a person that cares more about people out here

273
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,800
than the people that call in and that just say,

274
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,820
Rocky's a bum.

275
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,500
He hates everybody.

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,520
Authorities believe that he had as many as 18 women

277
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,940
living in a large house there with him,

278
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,060
playing the role of wives in a polygamous situation,

279
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,660
and that he had at least one of them who was 12 years old.

280
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,200
Please let me out!

281
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,920
It doesn't look good.

282
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,220
Sometimes I think all North Americanos are crazy.

283
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,460
If he's dead, you waste your money.

284
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,740
If he's alive, maybe you'll be sorry you find him.

285
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,560
No, we must find Bob.

286
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,220
Now I tell you what I believe.

287
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,860
Yes, what about it?

288
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,880
This beast exists because it is stronger than the thing that you call evolution.

289
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Bob is stronger than...

290
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,560
And it is something.

291
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,560
...the force of life.

292
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,160
A demon driving it through millions of centuries.

293
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,740
No, it can't.

294
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,180
It does not surrender so easily to weaklings like you and me.

295
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,660
Now look, we're not paying you to make jokes.

296
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:14,980
No, it loves us.

297
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,780
No joke.

298
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Well, I'll try to explain it to you.

299
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,940
Sometimes a species gets isolated in time.

300
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,660
If the conditions are right, it reproduces itself without change,

301
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,720
skipping a chapter of evolution.

302
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
A way back in time,

303
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,020
there must have been some major link between Bob and terrestrial life.

304
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
It's just possible that this is it.

305
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,200
Well, that's all there is to it.

306
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,020
And that, kiddies, is our fairy story for tonight.

307
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,980
And that, Civet, is our fairy story for tonight.

308
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,740
Now we have to get down to the brass tacks, to the real thing, right?

309
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,540
Right.

310
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,460
Like, uh...

311
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,760
Well, what...

312
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,260
How would you define a po-bucker, Civet?

313
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,220
What would you think of when I say the word po-bucker?

314
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,340
Cheap.

315
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,460
Cheap.

316
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,220
Cheap.

317
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,180
Well, maybe we should do the song.

318
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,560
Because some po-buckers are very generous.

319
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,400
I think perhaps what you mean is poor.

320
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,140
But that's not always the case either,

321
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,800
for there are many, many a rich po-bucker.

322
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,760
They're the most dangerous of all.

323
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,840
Let's do our song, okay?

324
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,460
Okay.

325
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,420
This is an old song that we made up a couple of years ago on the road

326
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,620
on our vacation in Appalachia.

327
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,300
That went...

328
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,400
I'm a po-po-po-bucker

329
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,920
I like to cuss and drink

330
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,140
But there's one thing that makes my head hurt

331
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,480
Please don't ask me to think

332
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,160
That's it, dear friend.

333
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,000
And in honor of this, uh...

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,840
Well, some further exploration into that world...

335
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,720
Well, actually, what I should do is tell you what we've been listening to first.

336
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,100
Uh, the collage tapes, uh...

337
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,520
The Dib Pepper All the Hour of Slack shows tonight

338
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
have been a combination of tapes by...

339
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,440
The good Joe Riley

340
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,980
Uh, Bob Hall

341
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,300
The Tape Beatles

342
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,120
Uh, and everyone else, puzzling evidence and so forth.

343
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,200
Um, you heard some Jane-er hypercletes there

344
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,120
from the New Southland Corporation rock opera

345
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,580
called Tales of Bobby Free.

346
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,360
Uh, the pieces we heard were

347
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Bobby Free Toe Away Zone

348
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,000
and the McCounty piece from Cherry Don't Cry

349
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,300
Jane-er Hypercletes, Southland Corporation.

350
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,620
Uh, we also heard some KPFA Berkeley, uh...

351
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,320
puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell's genius show

352
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,460
attacking the collars.

353
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,340
And, uh...

354
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,740
Some of those collars then later came to include...

355
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,480
Uh...

356
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
Well...

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,620
These old rednecks, uh...

358
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,200
Pobuckers and, uh...

359
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,760
Coups, crackpots, and subgeniuses.

360
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,300
Uh, on the...

361
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,020
Apparently, the Bob Lasseter show.

362
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,180
This tape was sent in by, uh...

363
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,180
St. Dave Mitchell of Headlines magazine.

364
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,180
And, uh...

365
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,480
I'd like to continue with these, uh...

366
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,900
pieces from the, uh...

367
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,540
Bob Lasseter show.

368
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,940
And, uh...

369
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,920
Thank you.

370
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,160
You see, this is the point I'm trying to make.

371
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,560
I wish these people would...

372
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,440
would forget about New York for long enough

373
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,060
to try to grasp what I'm trying to do here.

374
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,220
They have to realize that they're in my neighborhood.

375
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,000
I was born and raised in this area.

376
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,660
And all my ancestors were.

377
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,440
These people are coming in here, pushing me around,

378
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,860
saying, hey, I want to raise taxes here.

379
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,160
We want to build a stadium over here.

380
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,600
We don't want that.

381
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,160
Us good old boys,

382
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,740
we want our pickup trucks,

383
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,920
we want our magnums,

384
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,080
we want our blonde, blue-eyed women,

385
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,480
and maybe a little snort of Jack Daniels every once in a while.

386
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,680
I heard on the radio today

387
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,760
that they're gonna have to cut the water down,

388
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,520
the bridges are falling down,

389
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,200
because the Yankees come down here,

390
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,500
they don't know how to build a bridge.

391
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,180
Now they're all falling down,

392
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,640
and now they've realized that the Yankees can't even build a bridge,

393
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,120
so they gotta go to France and get them to build bridges.

394
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,140
They gotta get them from Romania and build bridges.

395
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,740
Because we ain't got nobody left here that wants to work here.

396
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,400
They gotta work for an honest day's living.

397
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,200
It's too hot for them.

398
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,940
They gotta spend all the money on beer.

399
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,240
All the rolls, all the rolls.

400
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,820
I don't care how many marshmallows a man eats,

401
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,120
I don't care how many Ritz Crackers these Yankees come in and buy these toys,

402
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,840
they ain't supporting me.

403
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,480
Yankees are known to eat marshmallows?

404
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,660
They eat marshmallows like they're going out of style.

405
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,360
They do?

406
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,860
They eat them like crazy.

407
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,380
Very rarely do you see a Confederate

408
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,020
going in a grocery store and buying marshmallows.

409
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,860
You won't see me buying no Moon Pies and RC Cola.

410
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,500
I won't do it, and I ain't buying no more Pepsi either.

411
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,900
Now I'll drink a Coke,

412
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
but I'm not buying no Pepsi,

413
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,220
and I think you can figure that one out.

414
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,400
Why?

415
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,880
No, I can't.

416
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,740
I tell you, because Michael Jackson is behind that.

417
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,880
Ah.

418
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,360
He's up there buying and selling all this,

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,460
advertising all this Pepsi.

420
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Wait a second, don't they have wine over there?

421
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,080
They have a whole lot of derries and Coke and Pepsi.

422
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,840
But if I'm gonna drink a Coke,

423
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,660
they ain't gonna put it on a TV screen.

424
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:00,920
But Rocky?

425
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,780
Go ahead, I'm listening to you.

426
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,980
I think that Coke hired Lionel Richie.

427
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,520
If he does, it's too bad,

428
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,340
because I'll boycott both of them.

429
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,340
I'll go to Sprite.

430
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,360
I'll go to 7-Up.

431
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,660
I'll make my own brew.

432
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,380
Well, don't you remember the guy, you know, for 7-Up,

433
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,440
that black man with the bald head?

434
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh, you're right.

435
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,060
There goes 7-Up, too.

436
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,940
You're right.

437
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,380
And Sprite is made by either Coke or Pepsi.

438
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,140
Coke makes the Sprite.

439
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,800
It's all controlled by the same people.

440
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
There was a time in the South

441
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,940
when we didn't have Coca-Cola.

442
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,260
The only place you could get that

443
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,740
was up where the Yankees lived.

444
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,340
We were happy with our Sassafras.

445
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
We were happy with our Shine.

446
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,820
But you had to have all these Yankees come down here

447
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,760
and tear down all the stills.

448
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,020
Yankees don't even like the cars.

449
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,220
I don't think we got all the stills.

450
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
Well, they ain't got mine.

451
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,100
Didn't think so.

452
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,620
I got my still up here in Clearwater,

453
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,020
and they never, ever gonna bust it up.

454
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,660
I don't care if it's an insurance man,

455
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,500
the IRS man.

456
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,640
They don't mess with my moonshine.

457
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,600
Nobody messes my shine.

458
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,060
Nobody.

459
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,080
Let them come in.

460
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
I got a 12-gauge double-barrel,

461
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,760
half-sawed-off shotgun,

462
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,840
and anybody that messes with me

463
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,040
or my organization or my family

464
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,100
is in trouble.

465
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm from the old school.

466
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,860
I'm not a liberal.

467
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,600
I am not a liberal.

468
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,560
I didn't think so.

469
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,760
I thought that was all an act.

470
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,180
I ain't a Yankee.

471
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,080
I got a Confederate flag.

472
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,760
I won't even fly this Union flag on a holiday.

473
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,400
I'll fly a Confederate flag

474
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,040
and if my neighbors don't like it,

475
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,000
that's too bad.

476
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,440
Petersburg, Watson, WPLP.

477
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,160
Young man, let me tell you something right now.

478
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,880
I come down here every year,

479
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,480
and I've been coming down here for 24 years,

480
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,020
and I, in my entire life,

481
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,600
have never heard such an outrageous,

482
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,580
outlandish person on a show.

483
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,880
Well, thank you.

484
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,260
You should be reported

485
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,380
to the Chamber of Commerce,

486
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,660
or the SBC.

487
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,460
I am going to write letters.

488
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
I spent $800 to get down here.

489
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,820
Alice is listening,

490
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,920
and she is not very appreciative

491
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,060
of what you've been doing.

492
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,160
Who's not very appreciative?

493
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,860
Who's not very appreciative?

494
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,800
She's very upset.

495
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,180
Who's upset, sir?

496
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,280
She's very upset.

497
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,220
Who is upset?

498
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,860
My wife is very upset.

499
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,800
You've got no business talking about us in this manner.

500
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,360
We are supporting you.

501
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,820
We are supporting you people.

502
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,340
Don't you understand?

503
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,260
If we quit coming down here,

504
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,380
you'll be out of a job, sir.

505
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,120
Right.

506
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,100
And I will report you,

507
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,820
and I've heard about you before in the trailer parks.

508
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,480
What's so funny about that, buddy?

509
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,700
Do you mean my fame has spread to the trailer parks?

510
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,960
Well, what is so funny about living in a trailer park?

511
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,580
Nothing, sir.

512
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,280
I'm living in an Airstream right now,

513
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,260
and I don't think it's very funny about the...

514
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,040
Wait, wait a second.

515
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,820
You come down here from where?

516
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,560
What was it, Iowa?

517
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,640
Dragging a trailer,

518
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,620
and you're not even staying in a motel,

519
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,500
and you think you're supporting me?

520
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,840
Are you on drugs, sir?

521
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,880
I bet you use marijuana and all this kind of stuff.

522
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,820
I bet you live a very loose lifestyle.

523
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,640
What kind of a lifestyle?

524
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,600
A very loose lifestyle.

525
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,320
I'm listening to you every night,

526
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,280
and you've got to remember this,

527
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,800
that we might stay here,

528
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,620
and I'm going to report you to the...

529
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,460
Oh, my God!

530
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,600
You might stay here?

531
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,820
I might report you.

532
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,540
I'm going to report you to the...

533
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,100
Trailer Park Association.

534
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,840
I'm going to write management a letter,

535
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,080
and you won't like it.

536
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,340
You'll be very afraid.

537
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,800
Sir, my name is Lassiter.

538
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,380
That's L-A-S-S-I-T-E-R.

539
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,100
Care of the Lassiter Broadcasting Company.

540
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,160
You're in trouble now.

541
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,900
No, sir.

542
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,640
I own the station.

543
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,340
You're in trouble now.

544
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,380
No, I own the place.

545
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,220
My mother bought it.

546
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,300
And I've heard about the way you talk about our president,

547
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,700
and I think it's a disgrace.

548
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,020
Why don't you write him a letter?

549
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,440
I have written him many letters.

550
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,060
Hasn't done you a damn bit of good, has it?

551
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,640
I don't like the way you talked about Jim and Tammy Faye Baker.

552
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,780
Me and my wife stayed at the resort for two weeks,

553
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,820
and we had a lovely and various enjoyment time.

554
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
Would you park your air screen there,

555
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,540
or would you stay in a hotel room there?

556
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,120
We stayed in a hotel room there.

557
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,580
Figures.

558
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,160
And we're going to go back, and I will help support his ministry.

559
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,840
Great.

560
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,520
You have done a disservice to God.

561
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,120
Would you leave tonight?

562
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:04,180
I have never heard anyone lambaste the ministers and the nation in such a distance in my entire

563
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,220
life, sir.

564
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,160
Well, you're lucky you've heard somebody do it now.

565
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm going to write a letter to the manager.

566
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,300
I'm going to write a letter to the...

567
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,900
That's Mrs. Lassiter, L-A-S-S-I-T-E-R.

568
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,140
That's the manager's name.

569
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,280
Mrs. Lassiter.

570
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,200
In the phone book.

571
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,840
That's right, in the phone book.

572
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,280
You're making me scream and holler.

573
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,540
That's one of the things I do best.

574
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
Sir, why do you carry on in this manner?

575
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:37,280
This is a very, very outlandish and monstrous tactic you're using.

576
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,140
You got it.

577
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,720
This is not right.

578
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,240
Why don't you help the old people?

579
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,460
Why don't you help us?

580
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,000
Sir, I'd like to help you out.

581
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,900
Which way did you come in?

582
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,260
I came in the wrong direction.

583
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,380
This is the police.

584
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,380


585
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,220
Sir, I'm not going anywhere.

586
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:57,540
I'm going to write you a letter, and you will receive this letter, and you won't like

587
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,760
it.

588
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,240
I'm going to write more than one letter.

589
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm going to write the station.

590
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,740
I'm going to write the Chamber of Commerce.

591
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,080
I, too, will write the Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber of Commerce will be up flooded

592
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,620
with letters.

593
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,260
Well, you put a lot of kisses up the back of your mouth.

594
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,260

They won't come on.

00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,760
Are you kidding me?

629
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,900
Be afraid, aren't you?

630
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,060
You're pulling my leg.

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,600

00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,200
I'll have you locked up, sir.

633
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,260
You can't do this.

00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,820
You're going to kill me.

635
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,040
That was the greatest call I've ever had in my entire career.

636
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:13,900

You think by laughing.

641
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,780
That you're showing me that you're not afraid.

642
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,940
That you're all afraid.

643
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,580
I know it.

644
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,880

658
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,660
to restore it to consciousness the greatest scientific stir since the explosion of the

659
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,260
atomic bomb

660
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,460

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,080
it's horrible how horrible are you shocked mr esmond you don't last a minute amongst those fiends

662
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,540

663
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,800
as a matter of fact you did but don't worry we'll forgive you anyway

664
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,820
oh

665
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,460
again

666
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,320
so

667
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,960
around you wouldn't believe this will adopt who is supposedly an adult is

668
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,980
sitting over here it picking hit hits hitting each other with civet who's only

669
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:33,700
12 years old yeah always say that okay anyway uh yeah here's uh well I don't

670
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,320
know what city this is from it doesn't really matter but I think that we should

671
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,780
all have pity for this young man passion Eric that's getting in the way of you're

672
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,020
really accepting real people and I agree I'd be a little alarmed if I were you

673
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,480
because it sounds like you're retreating into it more and more rather than less

674
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,280
and what's scary is that the more you decide that these are the perfect women

675
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,560
and real women are imperfect the more that you're going to push yourself into

676
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,680
it

677
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,520
my goodness what if you started wearing Little Mermaid clothes and I have a pin

678
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,760
I mean I had I'm actually last night had a wet dream when I was with Little

679
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,460
Mermaid and I think that that's the thing what really scared me was when I

680
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,980
started to have the wet dreams about her and I have like a little pin on my

681
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,960
jacket I have a shirt I have an Aladdin shirt which I always wear out all the

682
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,000
time and my friends my friends kind of know they just they just kind of make

683
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,700
fun of me that they don't they don't understand you know what I'm going

684
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,680
through and all now what would you like them to understand about you Eric

685
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,840
that you know that that it's normal it's not crazy to be in love with the

686
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,020
cartoon you know I don't think it's that weird I mean she's beautiful she's

687
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,900
perfectly perfect no girl could ever compare to the way the Little Mermaid

688
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,000
look who turns you on the most is it Jasmine from Aladdin Bells from Beauty

689
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,800
and the Beast or or Little Mermaid it might be it's definitely between Little

690
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,380
Mermaid and Jasmine cause I think was Bella was always covered up she was

691
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,420
always fully clothed except during maybe the ballroom scene you saw a little bit of cleavage

692
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,760
but Jasmine and Ariel will always there only having a bikini top on so

693
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,680
it was always between the two of them and it was always Little Mermaid until

694
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,300
when I saw Jasmine and she also just stole my heart away I mean

695
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,900
she's beautiful she's totally beautiful I mean I don't know what I should do like I

696
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,800
said I can't I got up girls I just don't want to be with them they just can't

697
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,660
measure up to the way cartoons are how do you feel that girls treat you though on the whole I guess pretty well I guess I guess pretty well I guess pretty well

698
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,840
Well, I mean, girls who I've been with in the past, I mean, I've had some pretty decentable relationships.

699
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,340
I had one relationship with this one girl, and she hurt me really, really bad.

700
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,120
This girl back.

701
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,620
How'd she do that?

702
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,900
Well, we were like best friends, and we went out, and we were best friends, and I think I fell in love with her.

703
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,180
And then she told me that, you know, we were together for a while, and she told me that she couldn't handle it, and she broke it off.

704
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,260
Then we got back, and then she broke it off again.

705
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,240
This happened about 12 times, on and off.

706
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,960
You know, every time that we got back together, I was so happy, and then she would break up with me again.

707
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:14,820
Well, you know, I think this is really at the heart of why you're so turned on to The Little Mermaid and Jasmine and, you know, all these other cartoon figures.

708
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,180
Because real love is painful!

709
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,260
I mean, could you really...

710
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,980
It hurt you!

711
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
You were a bouncing ball.

712
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,920
You were a yo-yo, and you didn't like it.

713
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,860
So why shouldn't you be happier having a paper woman who...

714
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:38,820
who totally would never treat you poorly, you could make up anything you want about her, and you're totally in control, because there she is on paper.

715
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,900
I mean, I think she's more than just paper, though.

716
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,480
I mean, I don't know, sometimes I like to think that she maybe exists somewhere, like some possible way in some world that she actually exists, and maybe I'll find her.

717
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,180
I don't know, I mean, or Jasmine, I mean, either one of the two, I guess.

718
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,360
Or I guess I would sacrifice for Belle.

719
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,780
I mean, these are the girls that I want to be with.

720
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,900
No one even...

721
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
No one could possibly compare to them.

722
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,580
I mean, I don't know what I'm going to do later on in life, you know?

723
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,120
You're going to have a real problem, Eric.

724
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,880
Because you're right.

725
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,980
You know, like I said, I masturbate to them.

726
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,820
I couldn't...

727
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,280
I had an erection throughout the whole movie of Aladdin with Jasmine.

728
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,540
And even, like I said, when there was cleavage shown in Beauty and the Beast, I couldn't believe it.

729
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,020
I got so turned on so quickly.

730
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,600
Well, you're absolutely right, Eric.

731
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,480
No girl's ever going to match up to that, because they get pimples.

732
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,380
Um, they...

733
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,700
They might have a runny nose.

734
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Um, their hair is oily sometimes.

735
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,040
Um, their eyes are puffy.

736
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,780
They're grumpy sometimes.

737
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,300
Who?

738
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,140
Yep.

739
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,600
Well, they'll never grump.

740
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,860
They'll never match.

741
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,760
You're right.

742
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,780
No, but that's okay.

743
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,940
Cut the poor guy some slack, okay?

744
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,220
Uh, John Bartles here.

745
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,700
Oh, by the way.

746
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,640
Sorry, that's our tape.

747
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,540
We may go back to that, because it's so bizarre.

748
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,760
And yet, I bet some of you boys have been thinking,

749
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,720
baby, last time you saw that...

750
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,540
Uh, how about Roger Rabbit?

751
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,820
Cool world.

752
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,820
The invisible girl.

753
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,480
That was the one I...

754
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,560
I, well...

755
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,520
Uh, yeah.

756
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,040
Dr. Legume up in Philadelphia submitted that.

757
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,300
That submission.

758
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,520
And, uh, I think...

759
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,380
This song by John Bartles has a great deal of bearing on the exact same thing.

760
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:34,960
Thank you.

761
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm hopelessly heterosexual.

762
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,340
Not overly intellectual.

763
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,000
And I see you're heterosexual, too.

764
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,340
So why don't we cut the crap?

765
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,200
And give it to this crazy...

766
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,200
And have a hopelessly heterosexual relationship.

767
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
Me and you.

768
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,680
Yep, I'm hopelessly heterosexual.

769
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,360
No use in denying it.

770
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,480
It's just impossible.

771
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,960
I was born that way.

772
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,520
And you were born that way, too.

773
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,320
Don't you see I'm hopelessly heterosexual over you?

774
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm hopelessly heterosexual over...

775
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,640
Over you.

776
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,560
Over you.

777
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,760
Over you.

778
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,940
Over you.

779
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,020
Over you.

780
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,020


781
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,020


782
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,100
Over you.

783
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,340
Over you.

784
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,240
Over you.

785
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


786
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


787
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


788
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


789
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


790
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


791
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,240


792
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,660
Hello?

793
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,000
I just called to let you know that I was sorry.

794
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,060
You're sorry?

795
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,120
I am sorry.

796
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,340
John, I'm sorry, too.

797
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,360
Well, would you tell Amy and I I'm sorry?

798
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,260
I'll tell him that you're very sorry.

799
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,820
And also that we didn't use that thing that he did.

800
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,740
You didn't?

801
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,020
No.

802
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,700
Oh.

803
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm sorry

804
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,460
For what might happen next

805
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,060
The world revolves around your conception

806
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,260
Even though it's warped by your own self-perception

807
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,680
Guess it's my fault

808
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,540
You got the wrong impression

809
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,220
I'm sorry

810
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,100
So sorry

811
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,980
I'm sorrier than you

812
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,280
I feel awful, yes it's true

813
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,580
I take full responsibility for everything you think

814
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm sorry

815
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,460
And everything

816
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,700
Everything I don't do

817
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,840
I'm sorry

818
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,320
Sorry

819
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,320
Are you really younger than me?

820
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,320


821
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,320


822
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,320


823
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,320


824
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,320


825
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,800
Was this just rappers' Nurts, who are just heath falan?

826
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:08,800


827
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,060
I feel tender

828
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


829
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


830
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


831
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


832
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


833
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


834
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,060


835
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,260
Stopping seeingudes

836
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,640
I was I'm so sorry

837
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,920
I tried to explain my episode

838
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:11,980
To my family

839
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,800
It's not all a n valle Jeep

840
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,720
I know no do kommies

841
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,680
It's not a don and Bill rappers

842
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,220
We can't stop listening if you say something else

843
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,040
Neverass fans areешеhroudacks

844
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,140
and take care of me if I needed her.

845
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,900
What do you think, Dr. J?

846
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,700
I think you've got to be really careful, Eric.

847
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,360
You're slipping into a little fantasy land here

848
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,420
from whence it will be harder and harder for you to emerge over time,

849
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,880
and I'm worried about you.

850
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,280
You've got to give the guy credit, though.

851
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,760
I mean, Belle and Little Mermaid, they are pretty.

852
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,220
Yeah, sure.

853
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,860
You know what I'm saying?

854
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,620
Well, so is Mel Gibson and Dennis Quaid.

855
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,880
You know, they're handsome, but, well, at least they're real people.

856
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,540
What about Johnny Quest?

857
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,860
Eric, you've got a problem here.

858
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,440
Clutch cargo.

859
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,380
I hate to tell you this because I know you're not happy hearing it,

860
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,420
but the more you slip into doing this,

861
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,940
I would say you have to stop this right away

862
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,760
because I see you going further and further into your imagination

863
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,280
and being disappointed with real people,

864
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,780
and that's where I think it comes from,

865
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,060
your disappointment with girls and your hurt from this.

866
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,520
Oh, hard.

867
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:31,160
I can certainly understand this guy being disappointed with real people,

868
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,380
but how many real people are there after all?

869
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,620
Now, we're going to get back to our investigations into the world of Pobuckers.

870
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,940
I've got a little bit of tape here from one of the great Pobuckers of all time,

871
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,600
Jim Jones.

872
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,240
Wish I had more Koresh friends because he would also certainly qualify.

873
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,520
Qualify.

874
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,680
Servant, what was it you wanted to say?

875
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,920
The second word I think of when I hear the word Pobucker

876
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,460
would probably have to be ma.

877
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,800
Ma.

878
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,020
That's us.

879
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,420
The Midwest.

880
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,480
A mother feels a sharp pain in her right hand.

881
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,660
Far away at that exact same moment,

882
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,160
her daughter screams as she touches a hot pan.

883
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,360
Just chance?

884
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,720
Or is it telling us something about our own untapped capabilities?

885
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,640
Power of a flash.

886
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,200
Goes deeper into unexplained phenomena than ever before.

887
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,060
It documents the facts,

888
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,540
and it covers what people were never willing to talk about.

889
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,320
Stonehenge.

890
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,520
A visitor fashions a wire antenna in the shape of an ancient Egyptian symbol.

891
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,020
He points it at the stones,

892
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,400
and a surge of power rushes into his arm,

893
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,260
knocking him unconscious.

894
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,500
Was it all in his mind?

895
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,340
Or was it much more than that?

896
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,380
Sponsored by the Church of the Sub-Church.

897
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,760
They tell us that

898
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,240
we lost our tail

899
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,460
evolving up

900
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,860
from little snails.

901
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,480
I say it's all

902
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,120
just women's sails.

903
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,860
Are we not men?

904
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,240
We are devils.

905
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:47,060
Have we been釘 по лодке,

906
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,620
look at him

907
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,800
And blues

908
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:49,800


909
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:49,800


910
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:49,800


911
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,640
You'd never be able to вспi

912
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:50,800
do

913
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:50,880
What is BOK志

914
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,160
But its

915
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,940
You

916
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:51,940


917
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:51,940


918
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:51,940


919
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,200
to see

920
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,200


921
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,640
his store.

922
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,740
You who are stupid piss ants and reptiles and lower than the primates, you

923
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:12,520
can make a hoopie if you want, but your hoopie makes me sicky, and so you can

924
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,100
make your hoopie while I do something that's far more significant. I got me some

925
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:23,620
big plans, both here, there, and everywhere. Got lots of plans.

926
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,520
The relatives of Jonestown residents, their contact cut off from their loved ones by

927
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:41,220
dad, were becoming troublesome. A group was formed called Concerned Relatives, and

928
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:46,740
with the prize defectors Timothy and Grace Stone, the custody battle for John

929
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,080
Vickney was won.

930
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,340
After became the center of the challenge, they also sent a petition to the U.S.

931
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,060
State Department charging human rights violations in Jonestown. It was

932
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,540
complicated.

933
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:03,600
You think it's anachronized to talk about it. Odd in the same way that it would be

934
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,180
odd if...

935
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:11,640
Talk about it. It strikes me as odd in the same way that it would be odd...

936
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,800
Odd in the same way that it would be odd if...

937
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,640
But for some reason...

938
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,860
But for some reason...

939
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,980
But for some reason...

940
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,080
But for some reason...

941
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,140
As to stimulate that appetite. as to stimulate that appetite.

942
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:28,940
Attorney theme plays

943
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,320
Voice of Kurt Everywhere

944
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:44,460
If we have seen the coming of a saviour, a beacon of slack, a banner behind which we

945
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,280
may all unite.

946
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,080
It is the coming of Awesome.

947
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,400
J.R. Bob Dobbs

948
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,680
and his mighty

949
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,600
Church of the

950
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,800
Subgenius.

951
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,920
Monkey men

952
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,380
all

953
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,720
in business suits

954
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,680
Teachers

955
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,960
and critics

956
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,820
all dance the pooh

957
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,240
Are we

958
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,900
not men?

959
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,420
We are

960
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,080
devout

961
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,180
Are we not men?

962
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,500
D.D.O.

963
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,940
Come in.

964
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,040
Hi, Sam. Got a minute?

965
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,840
Hi, Paula. What's on your mind?

966
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,860
Sam, I think we have a real

967
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,320
emergency situation here.

968
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,420
Are you aware that we're making some

969
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,840
submission deadlines by just one day?

970
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,180
No, I wasn't.

971
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,720
I've been so busy recently that I haven't paid much attention.

972
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,720
Another symptom. And take a look

973
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,920
at this financial statement I just got from accounting.

974
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,600
Endless

975
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,240
submission.

976
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:45,580
Submission.

977
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,140
And you too can submit,

978
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,540
dear friends, to the word of

979
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs

980
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,700
whose church this is.

981
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,000
And you know, you really ought to write.

982
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,860
It's about time you got around to writing

983
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,820
into the Church of the Subgenius for the

984
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,620
free information.

985
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,720
Well, it's catalog is what it is.

986
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,100
But what a catalog.

987
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,820
A catalog

988
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,760
of sins.

989
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,820
And I'd like to give you that post office

990
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,180
box number to write to.

991
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,620
Write. Now.

992
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,180
We'll give you some

993
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,580
if you just write to Bob

994
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,060
at, and you can just

995
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,620
address that,

996
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,320
B-O-B, friends, at

997
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,920
P-O-B, that's

998
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,820
post office box

999
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,480
140306.

1000
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,020
Ah, yes.

1001
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,260
140306.

1002
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,380
Dallas, Texas.

1003
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,780
75214.

1004
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,360
Yes,

1005
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,000
we're not.

1006
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,540
Kidding.

1007
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,780
It really is

1008
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,260
Dallas, Texas.

1009
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,200
Ah.

1010
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,760
This is Walter

1011
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,780
Concrete. We're here on this

1012
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,640
busy street corner to perform an

1013
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,700
interesting experiment. I'm an

1014
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,740
amputee. I'm going to ask the

1015
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,680
first person I see if he

1016
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,700
can tell if the thing hanging from

1017
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,580
my shoulder and my arm

1018
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,700
is really my arm or a prosthetic

1019
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,660
device totally concealed by a

1020
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:14,840
new,

1021
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:15,400
still,

1022
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,900
know I'm wearing,

1023
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:17,900


1024
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,180
motto and hang Coco Manor

1025
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,260
dollar go.

1026
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,260


1027
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,660
great I'm ready to change

1028
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,100
me.

1029
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,580
We present at don't

1030
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:24,580


1031
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,940
the new вопрос.

1032
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,920
There's course for the

1033
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,560
man.

1034
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,840
Who I know.

1035
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,960
stumps. In reality, I have

1036
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,180
no arms. See? Do you have a quarter?

1037
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,880
Eaten away by the

1038
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,040
new plague tumors.

1039
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,560
There's no ozone

1040
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,500
like no ozone

1041
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,860
I know. Everyone

1042
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,000
is also very blotchy.

1043
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,860
Do you have a quarter? They're in my brain

1044
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,360
now to see.

1045
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,920
Any kind of spare change at all, like maybe a dollar or something?

1046
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,320
No, not at all,

1047
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,500
my bad man.

1048
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,540
Ring.

1049
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,260
Ring.

1050
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,060
Ring.

1051
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,600
Oh, hello?

1052
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,020
Yes? Is that? You don't say, you don't say,

1053
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,480
you don't say.

1054
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,840
Well, friends, that was Brain Rot

1055
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,920
Radio just then,

1056
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
and it is, isn't it?

1057
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,860
It is.

1058
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,020
It is.

1059
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,800
Brain Rot Radio out of

1060
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,660
Cleveland, WCSB

1061
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,120
is where those ugly guys do that,

1062
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,920
and they are too.

1063
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,480
Oh, God.

1064
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,200
You know,

1065
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,160
they'd never make it in TV.

1066
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,420
I would. Oh, yeah.

1067

00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,580
cover of this. Dude, man, it rocks.

1079
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,040

1084
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,580
We'll sail up north and cross

1085
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,760
the ice and cross the barren snow

1086
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,960
fields. You gotta be tough and you gotta

1087
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,820
be a man to club the baby

1088
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,740
harp seal.

1089
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,600
To club the baby harp

1090
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,900
seal. We're men among

00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,640

00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,660
while the others stand there staring.

1100
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,500
While the others

1101
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,860
stand there staring.

1102
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,500
We're men among men and

00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,800

When we shoot him down, he'll get back up, so we'll shoot him down again.

1108
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,320
But he'll get back up, so we'll shoot him down, because we are manly men.

Yes, we are manly men.

We'll hunt the black rhinoceros down on the plains so dry and hot.

1114
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,400
We'll blow him over and take his horn and leave the rest to rot.

00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,760
We'll take that corn and sell it to our Taiwanese connections

1120
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,660
They'll grind it up into medicine so men can get erections

1121
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,920
So men can get erections

1122
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,300

We're men among men and manly men

It's been for three years

It's been three years that these four musicians got together

1169
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,220
Each musician had an idea

1170
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,280
Juntos hicieron una historia

Ocho pistones hechos para matar

00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,200
El tanque lleno de sangre nunca se va a vaciar

1196
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,800
El motor hecho en la fundación

1197
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,700
Revuerto en fierro con la sangre de los humanos

1198
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,720
Es una cosa horrible, maldado, sin consencia

Frío del corazón hecho para matar

1200
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,820
Matar, matar, matar, matar

1201
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,100
No vas a ver

1202
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,200
This is a car, a car of spongebob

1203
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,620
This is a car of spongebob

1204
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,240
I believe you're a son of spongebob

I believe you're a son of spongebob

1207
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:33,820
In the night, there are eight left since that car appeared.

1208
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,120
That death, that skull made of iron.

1209
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:45,240
The power is with the lights off so you'll never look at it until it's too late.

1210
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,620
You're already on the car's wheels.

1211
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,400
The red wheels are full of blood.

1212
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,660
In the coldظ in the cold that caso de dolor di Francia,

1213
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,420

No hay noche que pasa que no hay muerte

1222
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,900
Desde que se apareció ese carro

1223
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:34,160
Esa calavera, ese fierro frío con sangre sobre su cuerpo

1224
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,920
No hay noche que pasa que no hay gente que llore

1225
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,200
Que le falta que se punta a una persona

1226
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Porque no puso atención a lo que diría

1227
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,400
Un carro sin luz, corriendo recio en los barrios

1228
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,800
Queriendo fijarse para un carro y un carro

1229
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,880
De monio

1230
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,360
De monio

1231
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,020
De monio

1232
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,620

De monio
