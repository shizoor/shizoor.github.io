Whether or not you believe it, you are listening to true recordings of Bigfoot creatures in their natural environment.
We know these are naturally occurring primate voices. We have the evidence that establishes that much.
You people of Earth, tell your people and your government that we have created a...
Some genius, our own science.
At the first sign of robots, they will act automatically.
Your choice is simple. Live in spaceships or grow smaller every day.
Remember.
Bob?
The genius from Mars. He has come to San Antonio to address the United States Brewers Association.
Uh...
Uh...
And...
Uh...
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Satellites.
Here's that Los Angeles picture, sir.
This is a sonic radar picture taken from extreme altitude.
It shows full details of the Martian nest outside Los Angeles.
Their machines appear as round blobs.
Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.
Uh-huh.
We know there are three cylinders.
Three machines to each group.
And three machines to each cylinder.
Passengers arriving in flight number Q73 will be exiting through gate gate six.
Q73.
Please proceed to baggage claim area number three.
And carve your baggage claim tickets ready for inspection.
Thank you.
You're American, aren't you?
Yeah.
You seemed almost high out there.
I was just playing around, having fun.
Yeah, so far this has been killer.
Matt, I wanna know why there are so many negative things just the parsing.
Well, if Europe was to stack up the
Mars military commander on Earth,
it'd be just like a heavy shifting connection between Mars and Europe in a�� dunkle.
There's a bunch of other things people under the tips and do.
Yeah, it's like a모
to the cluster which will have profound implications.
The force commander Lepton Rectilinear is widely expected to say that the extra 20,000
plus Martian troops sent to Earth since Perihelion have significantly reduced radical Earthite
violence and should be extended.
We've been saying all along that we needed more tentacles on the ground and this proves
it, stated Rectilinear.
My sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our
enemies in a number of areas of Earth.
His appearance before the cluster alongside Martian issuer of ultimatums Rhodium Virtual
Particle comes ahead of a report on the war which Vast Cool Intelligence 42 must deliver
by Aperhelion to the cluster.
And meanwhile, in the area known as Wales, 27 Martian troops were killed when their fighting
machine was destroyed by an improvised atomic device or IAD.
.
We need an import of this bake to enable the transfer of craft materials.
.
Here's such an interesting detail that we don't get as a
huge75.
Ironically, Dr. Howell, I hear the cicadas and other bugs of the desert all the time.
Most interesting.
I can hear them even when they're nowhere near. If they're thousands of miles away, I still hear those bugs.
Well, those bugs and their sound represent a certain presence in the universe
and it's most curious and contemplative to bring to mind the fact that the original title,
Al-Azif, an Arabic title referring to the sounds of insects made in the desert,
is actually the name of the so-called Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred,
which is a Greek name given to the book.
Al-Azif was the original title.
And I think that's the reason why I'm so interested in this book.
And of course, that refers poetically to insect noise
I didn't know that.
apprehended without knowing the source.
My doctor said it was tinnitus.
Well, of course, the doctors will tell you something that's reassuring and fits into their game plan.
So I really am hearing bugs thousands of miles away, and it's not just a ringing in my ears.
It sounds just like the bugs that I grew up hearing my whole life
in Texas.
When I moved to Cleveland, Princess Wee would occasionally say things like,
Do you hear that sound?
And I, well, yeah, I hear the bugs.
Somebody's downstairs.
But one day I realized that it was snowing outside, and what I was hearing probably wasn't cicadas.
Unless you were hearing snow bugs.
There are several species of snow spiders.
Are there really?
Yes, they are.
Friends, you learn something every day if you're around a tree.
I'm Dr. Howell.
And you know there's snow bugs like snow bugs.
But these so-called snow spiders are actually blown up by winds to lower levels of mountains that have snow.
And nonetheless, they run agilely over the snow and catch insect life, which is also blown up by the winds.
Thus, nature is neat and fastidious and allows not a single crumb to escape.
And the most important thing is that you don't slip from her plate.
Have you ever burned a book, invaded a country without verifying intelligence, or sent someone a bomb from the beach?
You will.
And the company that'll bring it to you, AT&T.

I remember in MAD years ago they proposed a wonderful sitcom.
Of course it was a satire.
But what a great situation comedy it would make if they have situation comedies anymore.
My Hollywood friends on the production side hate reality TV because there's no lighting for them to do.
All the jobs from sitcoms are gone.
But the sitcom that MAD proposed was called Life with Albie.
And it was about that lovable woman.
The beautiful, dim-witted Albert Einstein.
And life in the sitcom world with him.
Oh gosh, Albie, don't tell me that you smoked your famous serum and mailed your pipe to President Roosevelt.
No, no, no, I didn't send it to Roosevelt.
By God, I did.
I sent it to...what is...Martin.
Do you remember that one, Doug?
Life with Albie?
MAD did it?
Who's Life with Albie?
It was a sitcom.
A sitcom.
An imaginary sitcom.
Well, pardon d'autre chose.
It would make a great sitcom.
Better than Enemies, better than Friends, better than any of them that are out there.
Program, program, program, program.
Hold everything.
Hold everything.
One if I land and two if I carbonate.
That's pretty good, daughter.
But that ain't the way I hear it.
Killer Diller of the cold cuts, King of the caviar cutlers, and cutest kid that ever cooked a kettle of kippers for country kids.
Club campfire cafeteria clam bake.
Cautious and crafty at concealing the calories in coconut cake for curve-conscious cuties,
cutinously crowded in cozy cafes.
And the caniest coot that ever combed the countryside for corn on the cob that couldn't conceivably be commanded by the commoner kinds of cat-stand customers.
Crowned by the Cook's Convention in Kickapoo, Kansas as the classiest cupid that ever cut a cantaloupe.
Covered with compliments, cups and confetti, but twice I'm boys I gotta cook this.
You know how a cocks eats.
But I happen to know that cocks is on a diet.
Well, my goodness, what is going on here?
The sweat, the sweat.
Blathers all over me.
So don't cut.
Well, hey, look.
Well, hey, look.
Oh, look, I hate to do this, but I promised a fella I'd show him how to polish his...
Cut.
Let's polish your...
Cut.
Now.
And we did it.
You just apply it, let it dry, and wipe it off.
And you get a beautiful gleaming finish.
I'll say so.
Quick and easy.
I was through long before I thought I would be, and I came right over here.
Yeah.
Have a piece of cheese, Nick.
Something smells awfully good in here.
Most peculiar fellow seems to know his instrument.
You're a hard man.
Or am I just being a silly girl?
No, sure, sit.
Well, did too much sampling.
Has it ever occurred to you, self-polishing?
Ain't that awful?

I'm talking about CIO and AFL.

Because we know what you do to unions.
You don't fight them and you don't debate with them.
You wipe them out, hide and hair.
But, but, but, but.
We hear the voices of those who would set class against class.
Whites against negroes.
Christians against Jews.

White Moron, Too Far Gone.
Too Far Gone.
White Moron, Too Far Gone by Norrell Preff,
as was the deer bush and too much sampling and et cetera.
Now back in time we go, friends,
to 10X Day with Dr. Howell and the Picnic Table Radio Studio.
Friends, if you ever get bored with television and sci-fi,
books, history is much, much weirder and more twisted.
Court TV is weirder than Star Trek and the history
of Russia is a thousand times weirder than the Marvel Universe.
I know that sounds impossible, unthinkable to some of you,
but it's, it's actually true.
Peter the Great is more bizarre than Reed Richards.
Take it advisedly.
In fact,
Peter the Great started the Church of the Subgenius.
That was the first thing he did when he was made Tsar of all the
Russia's, Emperor of the World at age 17.
He and his buddies who were mostly foreigners,
Frenchmen and other devils,
formed a group called the All Drunken Synod of Fools
and gave themselves funny pope and reverend names
and paraded through the streets of Russia in costumes,
mocking the elders of the Russian Orthodox Church.
Smoking Mirshuam pipes.
No one, no one in that country could have gotten away with that,
except the Tsar.
And he, through most of his career, was considered the Antichrist by his people,
who, like us, had no choice.
Especially by those old fuddy-duddies in the Russian Orthodox Church.
Right.
He was so, he was such a subgenius,
Right. He was so, he was such a subgenius,
that he taxed, he put a tax on beards.
Because the Russians had become the laughing stock of Europe,
because of their beards.
It was against their religion to cut their beards,
and they looked like a bunch of bears.
That was the stereotype of Russians, that they were cave people.
And Peter the Great, wanting to drag Russia,
kicking and screaming into the 18th century,
insisted that people,
shave their beards.
And that convinced everybody that he was the Antichrist.
Only the Antichrist would have made you get a haircut,
in ancient Russia.
Funny how things turn around.
I guess I'd have to shave.
Well, it's expected of you.
And it's suspected that Peter the Great had to throttle his own son,
which, like Ivan the Terrible,
my great-great-great-great-great grandfather.
My great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
Not by way of the Romanovs, by way of Rasputin.
I'd say this to ensure disbelief.
They laugh at me.
They mock me.
Well, just as Rasputin was hard to kill,
so is the Church of the Subgenius.
Like some weed, chopped off in one place,
it flowers and flourishes in another.
Like blackberry vines and brambles,
constantly pushing up in new places through the earth,
with new fruits,
and new thorns.
Are you that thorn, or are you that fruit, my friend?
It doesn't matter to us.
You can be the thorn that pricks the hide of the conspiracy,
and brings with a jolt of pain that drop of necessary sacrificial blood,
or you can be the fruit which is taken in the bill of birds,
and lofted to heaven,
only to be rained down as a bird dropping on George Bush,
as you can see on YouTube.
Or...
Oh, is there a YouTube?
Yes, you can see on YouTube a bird shed on Bush,
and I recommend this for viewing.
Friends, it happens to all.
No matter how mighty you think you are,
That's right, all those servers...
the little birds of the air will put you in your place.
It happened to me.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that was going on.
Two starwoods ago,
I was sitting in the little clearing back there,
jabbering like an idiot,
smoking something.
Oh, no, I just cleaned my little pipe out.
And I was about to load my little pipe,
it was just like this one.
Hmm, fancy that.
And it was already filled, I felt a little tap on my hand,
and I looked down and my pipe had been filled,
with a kind of reddish, juicy stuff,
that a nice little berry-eating bird had deposited from overhead,
somehow landed right in the bowl of this tap,
and I was able to get it out of the tiny pipe.
Now, what are the chances of that?
Well, how did it taste when you smoked it, though?
Well, I didn't...
You know, it was a sign, obviously.
I took... I interpreted it as saying,
Stang, you're full of shit.
And I bragged about it on stage a little while later,
proving that I was, in fact, full of shit.
But it was a true story, that's the funny thing.
In the Church of the Subgenius,
you can lie and lie and lie and exaggerate,
and it all turns out to be true!
And they'll always believe the lies,
and never believe the truth.
That's the horrible thing about it.
They get the lies and believe the jokes.
Don't be like that, friends.
Just believe every bit of it, and get it all.
And also realize that you are here
among a group of fellow communicants and believers.
And let's not get into the destructive game of saying,
Oh, well, so-and-so is not as much subgenius as I am.
That person isn't a real subgenius.
We must be homogenized, but not pasteurized.
We must be of a body, but not ideologically pure.
And fortunately, that is the way we are.
All messed up.
Yeah.
Like in a modern cream separator.
Puppet Face!
Go away!
Puppet Head!
Go away Puppet Head!
Go away Puppet Head!
Yeah.

God...




Anyway, there they be, and just imagine how they'll look on many a mantelpiece.
In the meantime, it's a privilege to be doing Subgenius Radio here with Lonesome Cowboy Dave at X Day 10 on a beautiful Sunday.
Well, Spiro, what I'd like to first mention before we get into the actual awards themselves is the beautiful look and creation of these awards.
Some of them were 23 years in the process of being made, many by very, very erudite and elite Hollywood staff.
Older than some subgenius.
Spelled with like a staff lococulus, and others were just created out of thin air, but somehow they arrived here.
And what are some of the stats on former Bobby Award winners who haven't made it back?
Well, some of them have retired and taken their swag with them.
Like...
Like the Egyptian pharaohs pulled their loot into their tombs.
But as you can see, each Bobby Award rests on a platform of beautifully conceived, sculptured feces.
And then the X for X Day 10 is made out of multiple colored and decorated popsicle sticks.
Finally, a floating, severed child head hangs over the top.
As the ultimate comment on...
This form of intellectual aversion and delight.
For your nature lovers, we'd like to remind you that the fecal matter contained in these beautiful, beautiful awards is crystal completely contrained.
Contrained is the new word for it.
In the syllabus of Elmer's glue, which creates absolutely no hemorrhoids, absolutely no lesions, and no air can get in there to cause disinfection.
And Elmer's glue is a very organic substance.
In and of itself.
Which is why Elmer's face is on every bottle.
Of course, there are many people who don't even know who Elmer is anymore.
But in my childhood, I was bombarded with scenes from the domestic life of the Elmer family.
How about you, Stan?
You remember that?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
There was...
Elmer was the bull.
Elsie.
Elsie, right.
The wife of the milk-giving dairy cow.
Yeah, she was her...
Her logo head was on milk.
Yeah.
But his was the thick, white glue.
Yes.
And then there were the kids, of course.
Buster and Beulah.
Buster and Beulah had a tragic childhood.
Well, they were destined for the meat factory, but they lived a sort of strange bovine version of the 1950s nuclear family.
At any rate, Elmer's glue, the real substance.
The true.
The blushful hippocrene has gone into making these artificial turds,
which are so realistic that you won't want to touch them, even though you know they're fake.
Handling them will make you uncomfortable.
That is how much work has gone into making the shit pile at the basis of each Bobby Award.
Now, these X-Day Bobby Awards were drunkenly crafted in one evening by the Reverend I-Don't-Know,
and the Reverend I-Don't-Care,
Her Highness Hell-No,
and Dr. Dark.
And although it's not on this cheat sheet, there's another name that belongs attached to these strangely feculent awards,
and that is Sister Susie the Floozy,
because when I was up at the snack shack, I caught her putting these things together.
Yes, many hands have labored to create these productions.
And...
So it would be...
And...
A shame if we didn't get to hang one on every departing subgenius before he scuttles away.
And many hams have caught her putting.
Oh, that took a long time for that.
From PR News in Washington, I'm rising from the worst grease scene in decades.
President Bush says success in Iraq won't happen, but Mr. Bush maintains that sexual abuse is working.
This week, a senior Republican called for sexual abuse by as many as 5,000 priests by Christmas.
More than 170 sex fights have broken out since yesterday morning, and police say at least seven people were involved in PR News.
Police expect holy shit.
They're honoring a 9th century religious figure who they believe will return PR News to mankind in Washington.
Well, everybody keeps talking about a bunch of freaks or something.
What can we do? And what can you do to prevent...
The Self Genius Powered...
Well, we're all going to suffer for it.
But you're not fooling us.
Don't look at us.
I didn't have anything to do with it either.
I say let's let him talk.
All right.
Well, it won't be funny.
I'm warning you.
Oh, and there are some new quotes.
Bob, for the subgeniuses here, this is really important because he doesn't...
You know, we don't get many.
I mean, we don't get many direct transmissions from Bob.
You can channel him, but not for long.
Like one word at a time.
And in order to get a proper whole sentence, we have to line up a bunch of Bobbies, the expendable kind,
when we get a tape recorder and then run down the line as they each say one word and then flop over.
Because it's like a flash bulb that's been burned out.
You know, it's used once and then it's gone.
But at the expense of about 40 Bobbies...
We got these two new quotes.
The first one is more typical occult-type mystic wisdom.
Bob said,
So many look but don't see, and most don't even look.
They just use their eyes to keep from bumping into things.
This is the tomfuckery of foolish-nism.
This is the tomfuckery of foolish-nism.
Now, the second one was more typical of Bob.
No need to watch spilt milk burn.
He said.
And I think what he meant by that is, I'm just interpreting, is don't fret.
Actually, that was, Kim Kesey said that was the one rule of life.
Don't fret. Easy for him to say.
Probably just that day.
So, yeah, no need to watch spilt milk burn.
It's so, someday the real meaning will sink in.
That happens a lot.
We waited for 1998, you know, when the world was going to end, for 20 years.
And just before that date, my son, who was about 10 at the time, pointed out,
Hey, Dad, you guys still looking for an out with your 1998?
Yeah.
I said, well, what do you mean, son?
He goes, well, if you turn those numbers upside down, they make another number.
8661.
That had been right in front of us all that time.
We never knew it.
We never, Princess Wee's sister-in-law one time last year said,
Well, are you guys going to go to Starweed this year?
Where had that one been all our lives?




But, suppose the soul dies if it sits around on a cloud, plunking a harp, praising the center of being.
Well, it might.
That would kill me, I know.
Because there's no progress in such a setup.
And plus, your hands were not made for such an endeavor.
When you move from this plane, to do useful work.
I'll stop.
No, I did.
I just wanted you to notice that your hands were becoming those very hands you were describing.
Those very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very.
The hands of a murderer.
They were surgically stitched to my hands, but now they seem someone else's hands.
The glistening.
But they can sure throw knives now.
And little darts.
Can you handle these darts?
These strings and arrows of outrageous force.

Give them a fling, man.
Give them a fling.
I just wanted to say something while I'm still here.
Because I'm about to go, you know, partake.
And I'd just like to say that there's an old game out there for the computer.
It's called Floor 13.
Where you're a member of the British government, and it's your job to keep control through kind of underground Big Brother methods.
Anyway, about an hour on into this game, you have to rescue a member of the Church of the Subgenius.
Really?
It's true.
And I forgot even the name of the company that puts this thing out.
It's like, it's from 1991, Floor 13.
You can get it on almost any abandoned ware site out there.
It's freeware now.
But you have to protect and keep alive a member of this church.
They say the founder, but it's not identified as either a Bob, a Stang, or a Drummond, or anything like that.
Wow.
It's worth checking out.
Interesting.
You know, I watched that Floorist 13.
And I thought it was awesome.
You know, Dark City.
Dark City.
That was a terrible movie, too.
That should have been renamed Kiefer Sutherland just wheezes.
Man.
That was awful.
Does anybody really know the way to Shell Beach, as Stang always brings that up?
I like that movie, too.
Dark City.
A huge satellite in the sky.
Terrible.
Terrible movie.
Well, I mean, the ending, you know, make the ending what you will.
I mean, like, whatever, you know.
But it was a fun experience to watch.
It was a very mysterious ending.
I don't know how Kiefer Sutherland had any work after that movie.

And now, back to Tenex Day for the last time.
There's some really perverted artwork in there.
That imbature is a real artist.
You know, artists.
Can be as perverted as they want to in their art.
I think he's just...
Actually, he's got a family, too.
Maybe I should shut up.
Well, as Dick Cheney said, you've got to watch what you say.
On the other hand, I have nothing to worry about.
My kids are both grown up and married.
My daughter just got married last week to a real cool guy.
They live in L.A., though.
So...
There's some good news.
Plus, like we said, it could be X Day any time.
In 1998 conspiracy calendar,
I decided generally that it's predictions are a dumb idea.
I happen to be standing in that pond over there covered with honey.
We said it was motor oil.
Fortunately, there were no...
And it occurred to me, you know, maybe you shouldn't believe everything you read.
How about that?
Maybe all those fake magazines were full of crap.
Hard to imagine that, you know, preachers or gurus would, like, lie or be wrong.
But Bob has many lessons, I suppose.
As the great Carter LeBlanc preached a couple of years ago,
he brought us the gift of disbelief.
And don't you think those Heaven's Gate people could have used that?
On the other hand, we don't...
No, they might be aboard the saucers.
When we finally get lifted up, maybe old Doe, Bo, and Peep will be standing there going,
we told you so.
Well, my understanding is that their saucers suffer from shoddy workmanship.
Well, they're the kind that crash.
They have a luggage limit.
They're having a big party over that at Roswell.
They can only take one suitcase.
What does that tell you about these saucers?
Right.
Come on.
A saucer has to have infinite carrying capacity.
Right.
And ability to fold space and so forth.
They're not going to crash in the New Mexico desert.
So a bunch of po-buckers can run off with souvenirs of them.
They're cut-rate saucers manufactured by low-class alien civilizations.
Or else it's those hollow-earth, joy-riding teenager types.
They're terrestrial, but they've been here all along.
They come out from the hollow earth, opening at the poles,
and do buzz earthlings, beam thoughts into your head, that kind of thing.
They do donuts in the sky.
Yeah.
And do crop circles as sky-riding.
They actually do that from underneath, from the hollow earth.
That's their sky.
So when we see a crop circle, that's like a Coke logo,
backwards and inside out for them.
That's why they seem so mysterious.
Unfortunately, we never get to taste that particular thing.


It's a particular beverage.
It's forbidden and sealed off to all inhabitants of the surface world.
Many have taken ship at the pale beaches,
but few return to the sunlit lands.
So that's what they're calling it nowadays.
Oh, these kids today, I tell you.
You know, it's funny.
When I put on the headphones,
I hear this rich 60-cycle hum down low in the background.
And when I take the headphones off,
I hear somebody singing off in the distance.
Reassuring electronic background.
Somebody's stereo somewhere back there.
You know, this virtual world just doesn't cut it.
Well, they could pick it out if they examined the record close enough
with their special equipment.
You know they could.
Oh, I'm sure we're being observed on some fancy form of Google Earth right now.
You can see right through the roof.
They're looking at little heat forms of all of us.
Predator vision, you know.
And they can easily pick up the sound.
I mean, you can almost do that with Google.
Hal, we looked at your front door through Google Earth the other day.
What was going on down there?
Princess, me and I, they announced this new street scene thing.
You know, our cameramen have tooled down the roads in Seattle, San Francisco,
and we're all available.
We'll eventually come to your town, USA.
Yeah, they look through people's windows.
I'm not kidding about this.
They find embarrassing things going on, and they put it up on the web.
I saw.
We landed on you.
We typed in your address in the mission district
and landed right there on that spot and swiveled around.
It's in swivel vision.
You can't, like, walk up to the door and around it like in Blade Runner,
but you can certainly.
Not for the time being.
And we can.
We swiveled around and saw the door just as you'd gone in.
I know you had just walked in.
And how did you know that?
You could see the heat trail, sort of.
Oh, I left the heat trail.
Because we paid extra for the special Google Earth that has the thermal sensing.
So you could see this little, this Hal-shaped red smear go around the corner and in the door.
They call me the red smear.
But see, so we could easily be followed.
Am I not the red smear?
You think they have better things to do.
But then look at Magdalene.
But then they don't have better things to do but harass all of us.
And every time there's some new product in the store that Princess Wee and I both like,
say there's some cheese that's reasonably priced and it's some imported thing that's just fabulous,
as soon as we bought it more than three times, it's taken off the shelves.
Has that ever happened to you, my friend?
Yes, you too are being tracked with negative marketing.
How to deny slack from the subgeniuses.
Now if I was a real kook, I'd believe that.
The thing is, every time I think that, it does turn out to be true later on.
We thought we were kidding about all that stuff.
The denying of slack to subgeniuses, this is the worst of it, is only a byproduct.
The actual thing is to increase sales by removing from the stores products that appeal to subgeniuses.
Right, it's just making more room for pink stuff.
And make more room for products that appeal to normals.
Because that merchandise turns over at a greater rate, generating profits.
But of course, subgenius is about spiritual profits and spiritual profit sharing.
Savings, friends. Real savings.
Like when they say, have you been saved?
Yes, Bob's got my soul in a canister.
But have you been...
Rusty canister. The valve might be stuck, but it's in Bob's name.
He's got deed title to my soul, friends.
That's when you can say, yes, I've got my savings in a safe place.
It's in the arms of Bob. It's in the vault of Bob.
Canisters don't rust.
The deed and title to it is in the vault of Bob.
Stainless steel.
The actual rusty canister is in Reverend Stank's basement in Cleveland.
That's such a cliche, that those canisters rust.
They're made of stainless steel.
They get pitted sometimes by micrometeorite bombs.
They're not a bombardment, but they're stout.
There might be things to worry about, but rust is not one of them.
Your soul will not be placed in a rusty cylinder.
But this is, of course, good poetic hyperbole.
Well, it also keeps them from looking for the real Dobstown.
They just go, oh, Reverend Stank's slacker mansion.
That must be the headquarters.
That's the Batcave.
Yeah, right.
It's actually a tell being a decoy, folks.
Well, what's really amazing are those giant signs labeling everything,
just like in Batman's cave that you've got at your place.
They're hard to get used to.
You heard they took away my neighborhood committee said I couldn't have the giant gorilla,
concrete gorilla in my front yard anymore.
What a shame.
It looks barren without it.
Yeah, and we lost one of the limousines to taxes.
But for the most part, the slacker mansion is fine.
Yeah.
Earthquake hardly, you know, we hardly felt it.
I understand you're about to open up a new Bigfoot attraction over there.
No, that's at Nenslow's House of Mystery in Portland.
Has anyone been to the Woodstock Mystery Hole in Portland,
which is also near a Bigfoot temple of a kind?
You have, haven't you?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I've been down in the hole, Dr. Howell.
I've been down in the hole.
That hole is something that every subgenius should have the experience of lowering himself into, as I did.
It's the ultimate roadside attraction.
It really is.
It's got everything you'd want in a roadside attraction.
It's really satisfying.
There is a mystery at the bottom of that hole.
That was Dr. Howell at 10X Day with yours truly.
And the background music that you've been hearing in the titles here
is by Speed Cave.
You are also hearing Hour of Slack number 1120
from the Church of the Subgenius.
And if you want more information from the Church of the Subgenius,

Dear Bush, a letter to Bush.
This is me, Dog, Dog, Dog, Dog.
Jerk, jerk.
Hack, hack, hack.
A leg man.
Rock, rock.
The biggest.
We weren't picked out to chew up small countries that never did us any harm.
But he drilled us well.
We had some poles.
My convictions are that war is evil.
And that the evil men are those who started it.
Wars mean filth and thirst and pain and the scream of dive bombers on top of you.
All right, mister.
You started it rolling.
We know the score.
Blood and toil and long bitterness.
We don't like being ordered around.
Back and forth and across and up and down.
Bush.
Bush.
Bush.
Bush.
Bush.
Bush.
Bush.

Major Corporate Fund.
Major Corporate Fund buy.
Wal-Mart.
Late yesterday the retailing giant announced it would rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, create.
Major Corporate Fund.
Customers will be able to rack.
Customers may rack.
Borrow.
Boot shops at Wal-Mart.
They don't think boot shops at Wal-Mart.
They don't think, think, think, think, don't trust Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart sees a huge opportunity to take people.
Take, take, take, take.
And what they'll be able to do is take their check every week.
Take everything.
Have you ever watched someone being tortured?
Learn special things.
That's all.
From the School of the Americas.
Now any questions?
From creative interrogation experts.
Where did waterboarding come from?
Good question.
Or bomb the buildings?
From a phone booth.
Okay.
You will.
I will.
It's being a really good machine.
With the AllSpark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.
And fate has yielded its reward.
A new world to call home.
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,
but watching over them in secret.
Waiting.
Protecting.
I have witnessed their capacity for courage.
And though we are worlds apart,
like us,
there's more to them than meets the eye.
I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message to any surviving Autobots
taking refuge among the stars.
We are here.
We are waiting.
Before I die,
сам pergunta,
I'll face myself.
Come on,
get movin.
Come on,
get movin.
Not much time.
not much time,
not much time.
