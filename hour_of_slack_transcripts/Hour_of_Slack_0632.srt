1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Oh, folks.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
I have no idea what's happening.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,040
Here in Dallas.

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,680
I better go inquire.

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,760
The resupply ship has not arrived.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,180
We've been waiting for the resupply ship now for five years.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,380
We're going to have a snappy end, you know, so it'd be cool.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,840
Dave's been eating his toenails as food every day.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,440
Hey, Dave, that ain't toenails, Dave, would you?

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,920
No, I got a lot.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,300
I got them in boxes.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,900
Some of them toenails.

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,180
The air conditioner is awesome.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm in the ocean.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, I guess I better go look at them all the time.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,340
It's called a garbage bag of fat in my life.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,380
I would spend the rest of this afternoon, an appreciating afternoon,

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,660
on the last week and I think maybe four years ago,

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,200
thinking about the vision I had of Karl Marx talking to those ghost voices from heaven.

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,700
Luminous beings, I wish.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,480
I don't know if I can ever recapitulate what I just thought.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,240
And the worth of your labor is, um,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
uh, this one.

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,340
Satan is my, uh...

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,440
Poor old Dave.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,120
Are we still...

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,220
A lot of smumbling in his cup.

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,400
Are we still praying?

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,360
He's a pal of mine.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,320
I hope not.

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,440
Was that all a prayer?

32
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,020
Well, let's offer up a prayer to the...

33
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,380
I was getting ready to pray.

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,760
Oh, chihuahuas of war.

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,240
Chihuahuas of war.

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,900
My God, they've unleashed the chihuahuas of war.

37
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,260
Yo quiero ICBM.

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,060
Yo quiero ICBM, man.

39
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,520
That's that.

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,260
Yo quiero tamahaki.

41
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,440
Yo quiero...

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,620
Submarines.

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,820
Oh, yes.

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,280
We don't have to talk about that.

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,080
The end is coming.

46
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,400
Yo quiero...

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,380
All right, all right.

48
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
No more Adam and Adam missions.

49
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,500
Yo quiero Zyklon B, etc.

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,480
Yo quiero the Earth.

51
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,260
Yo quiero Slack.

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,720
Yo quiero Zyklon B.

53
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:49,900
Slack.

54
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,840
Yo quiero...

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,760
La iglesia del subgenio.

56
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,000
Si, si.

57
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,820
Yo ya lo...

58
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,220
Ya lo...

59
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,760
Ya lo conozco muy bien.

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,980
Y esto...

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,280
Yo ya...

62
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,580
Yo ya...

63
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,140
Yo ya...

64
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,280
Yo ya...

65
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,840
Yeh.

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,180
Yo ya...

67
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,360
I wonder what your name?

68
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,620
Shiver.

69
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,140
Shiver.

70
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,600
Shiver.

71
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:13,800
Shiver.

72
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:13,900
Shiver.

73
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,380
Shiver.

74
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,540
Shiver.

75
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:14,820
Shiver.

76
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,380
Shiver.

77
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,520
Omar.

78
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,640
Shiver.

79
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:18,940
Shiver.

80
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,540
Shiver.

81
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:19,540


82
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:19,660


83
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:19,960
Shiver.

84
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


85
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


86
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


87
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


88
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


89
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


90
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:19,960


91
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,500
Shiver.

92
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,500


93
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,500


94
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,500


95
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,500


96
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,500


97
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,900
Shiver.

98
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,300
Shiver.

99
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,480
Shiver.

100
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,040
Shiver.

101
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,580
There are so many logical and there are...

102
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,400
possible ways in which the entire tribe of mankind

103
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,740
can wipe out the earth.

104
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,260
Bob?

105
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,840
Bob?

106
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,720
That's your key phrase.

107
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,520
It will trigger the entire message

108
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,540
without your being aware of it.

109
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,840
We are controlling transmission.

110
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,580
We'll control...

111
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
Kill that...

112
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,880
For the next hour, sit quietly

113
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,440
and we will control all that you see and hear.

114
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
Turn on the machine.

115
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,800
This is Radio Yerevan.

116
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,420
We got puppet boy!

117
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,720
We are conscious of our responsibility

118
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,780
and obligation to provide programs

119
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,680
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

120
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,940
There is absolutely no other possibility.

And now you are ready for the final

125
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,020
200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

for late-night movies.

00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:55,660


132
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,280
Late-night viewing.

133
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,900
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

134
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,020
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

135
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,720
which reaches from the inner mind to...

136
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,120
The Subgenius Power of...

137
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:10,880
What?

138
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,400
Give me a light.

139
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,020
Give me a light.

140
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,160


141
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,560
So I can give it a light.

142
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm going, I'm going.

143
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,700
Well, here I am.

144
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm right here.

145
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,300
A lot of these kids are highly educated.

146
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,340
They come from upper middle class homes,

147
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,720
but they're burned out and they're broken.

148
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,600
And the pain that's in their heart,

149
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,180
they will...

150
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,260
With their clothes, they'll show the darkness externally

151
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,880
by doing a lot of black clothes and black makeup.

152
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,640
And they're poets.

153
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:55,640


154
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,920
Poetry is always seems to be focused on death

155
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,280
and hopelessness.

156
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,080
And on the opposite end, you got the rainbow kids,

157
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,240
which are the hippie partier kids.

158
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,520
And they might not even be aware of the world falling apart.

159
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,780
They just want to get high and fulfill their physical needs

160
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,560
and have a good time.

161
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:13,780
And...

162
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,640
I met her at the 12th grade.

163
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


164
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


165
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


166
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


167
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


168
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,200
And I watched that program.

169
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,580
Congratulations.

170
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,300
Oh, yes, of course.

171
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,940
And it's wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

172
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,700
They don't care to the other end of kids that care so much

173
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,060
that it's eating them up alive.

174
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,540
They just don't have anything to focus on

175
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,720
because no one's taught them about it.

176
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,500
The music of the...

177
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,300
.

178
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,600
It's a spinning wheel, baby.

179
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,520
.

180
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,080
.

181
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Knock a little patch on the cat's pants.

182
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,320
.

183
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,400
Swing a coat on grandma.

184
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,260
.

185
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,780
Get a little juice on the table.

186
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,600
.

187
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,040
Swang up with a little circus money.

188
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,640
.

189
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,400
It's a spinning wheel, baby.

190
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,700
You know, when I called before, it was about spiritual warfare.

191
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,900
Spiritual warfare, Satan's spiritual warfare.

192
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,280
And sometimes I have a hard time distinction

193
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,600
.

194
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,560
going on right okay

195
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,600
slip into something a little more comfortable

196
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:52,220
think it's sweat and spew you filthy humanoid nobody cares you don't fit in

197
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,740
them day you will be a pure cyber intelligence a quantum intelligence a

198
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,000
quantum pattern it is life is such sex is so much better that way to do whatever

199
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,260
it takes to come to know what to do to get other ideas didn't bring you down

200
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,280
well this whole scene is just in your imagination

201
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,700
it's just gone

202
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,740
another great

203
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:32,400
throw some monsters in someone who wants to know the truth is searching for hope

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,060
walks in the doors of a place called

205
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:43,860
it's like they're ashamed to shout for joy or you know stand up and play the tambourine

206
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,900
or something they just are so quiet and refined and then when I play the drums and I've been

207
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,640
looking to get into a band and doing that kind of stuff and I keep getting this

208
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,200
you know

209
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,060
guilt trip played on me in a way from saying you know well these beasts are evil

210
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,380
you know Jennifer I think all you need to do is to take a quick jaunt through

211
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,860
Dave, Brian, help me he's about to kill me

212
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,820
oh, if only we could escape

213
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,280
they, they torture me they make me say things they make me do things I can think I have a brain

214
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,140

215
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,860
help me escape

216
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,480
hey!

217
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,200


218
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,940
who are you?

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,460
I know that I am a parakeet I am an intelligent parakeet they make me say things they make me they make me do things help open my cage help me escape

220
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,760
oh, that's alright over voice that's alright over voice

221
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,600
I can think I have a brain

222
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,180
yes you can think you have a brain

223
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,880
I know that I am a parakeet

224
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,700
the bots are not your синopsis

225
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,320
I am an intelligent parakeet

226
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,660
no you twitter about that

227
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,440
they torture me

228
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
you twitter about that

229
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,460
they make me say things

230
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,180
but you say nothing more important than the fact you are in charge because they say things

231
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,180


232
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
Help me escape.

233
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,860
You were ignorant. You were ignorant. You were ignorant.

234
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,740
By state law, they have to clear this building out, check for a fire, and then let him come back in.

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,140
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

236
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,640
Well, that was our night, dear friends, at the Bob Larson Ministries.

237
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Devival, actually. We went to a Bob Larson revival.

238
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,860
I taped it. Couldn't get hardly any kind of a decent tape off of it.

239
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,480
But I did get to be on his show, and here it is.

240
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,920
Back to Turning Point, to the daily in-depth study of God's Word.

241
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,640
We are quickly lining up. We want to see you. We want to help you.

242
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,060
And I want you not to miss Dallas tomorrow night.

243
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,040
Please put it on your calendar. Get there. Be there.

244
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,440
It's going to be a night unlike any that city has ever seen.

245
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,820
And Dallas had seen some pretty strange things.

246
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,460
So don't miss it for anything.

247
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,060
And speaking of some pretty strange things,

248
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,400
before I get to the rest of you callers out there at 1-800-821-TALK,

249
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
we've got some publicity seekers out there.

250
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,000
They are a strange bunch. Maybe someday we'll do a larger show on them.

251
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,380
But I wanted to talk to them briefly because some of them plan to be there tomorrow night.

252
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,620
Yes, I am aware of them.

253
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,120
I have been sent their literature through the years

254
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,060
and have never really talked to one of these particular people.

255
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,100
But some of you may be aware of the church.

256
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,820
The church of the subgenius and their god, Bob.

257
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,660
At least they have good taste, tongue in cheek.

258
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,200
And I've got one of their representatives on the line with me right now, direct from Dallas.

259
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,300
Ivan Stang. Ivan!

260
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,580
Oh, Bob, at long last.

261
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,580
You are the current church leader of the church of the subgenius.

262
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,140
Well, I just work here, Bob. I'm working for Mr. Dobbs.

263
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,580
Bob Dobbs.

264
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,540
Right, Bob Dobbs.

265
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,600
I'll tell you, I'm so glad to finally be on your show.

266
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,920
I've been listening for years.

267
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,100
Years?

268
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,640
Well, especially around Halloween. I love your Halloween shows.

269
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,280
Now, how have I managed to fail by not getting through your thick head

270
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,520
after all these years to get you from Bob to God?

271
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,020
Oh, you... Bob, you have saved me so many times.

272
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,280
I have converted over to Christianity almost every time I ever listen to your show.

273
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,220
And then go back.

274
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,720
Well, we believe in the short-duration personal savior.

275
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,140
Phenomenon.

276
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,020
Bob Dobbs himself considers himself a short-duration personal savior.

277
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:29,380
Now, come on. Now, you people have really had 10,000 people ante up 30 bucks a piece to join this internet religion,

278
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,780
this religion of the quickie printer, tabloid-style cigar-smoking, pipe-smoking God

279
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,380
who will come to Earth soon to take everybody away in pleasure saucers.

280
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,280
You've really gotten people to pay 30 bucks a piece?

281
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,940
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

282
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,520
And we've sold about 100,000 copies of our books.

283
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,440
Okay, so...

284
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
I mean, we've been around for 20 years.

285
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,260
Now, in a nutshell, for the people out there who've never heard of this sort of thing before, you are what?

286
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,860
Well, the Church of the Subgenius is a religion that Bob started

287
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,360
specifically to help the mutants, the misfits, the disbelievers,

288
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,020
and also those who would believe anything.

289
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,260


290
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,060
And I think that's the most important thing.

291
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,940
And I think that's the most important thing.

292
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:18,980
And I think that's the most important thing.

293
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:18,980


294
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:18,980


295
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:18,980


296
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:18,980


297
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,060
But you're definitely not normal.

298
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,480
Nobody's going to ever accuse you of that.

299
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,180
Well, in that respect, I think we probably have a lot in common, Bob.

300
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,700
All right, all right. Touché.

301
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,660
You believe that the world is due for demolition on July the 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.?

302
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,120
Praise Bob. That is correct. 52 days from now.

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
And if it doesn't happen?

304
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,760
What kind of a question is that?

305
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,240
I mean...

306
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,260
You think we're going to end up looking ridiculous like those poor little religious nuts here in Garland,

307
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,840
right around the corner from me?

308
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,740
Remember the...

309
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,400
Oh, yes.

310
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,420
God's Salvation Church.

311
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,740
Yeah, the Taiwanese folks.

312
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,020
Yeah, they happen to just be very nearby.

313
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,900
I went over there and gave them my $30 just in case.

314
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,080
You know, we've been telling people to have faith in Bob.

315
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,240
I figure I might as well practice what I preached for once.

316
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,400
Now, you say it's...

317
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,920
In your literature, you say it's not too late...

318
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,880
...to be saved.

319
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,780
All you have to do is send $30 to Bob.

320
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,580
And I want folks to understand this is not Bob Larson.

321
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,780
This is Bob Dobbs the God.

322
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,660
Oh, Bob...

323
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,440
Yeah, Bob Dobbs is probably a lot cheaper for salvation than you are, Bob.

324
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,300
And you get eternal salvation or triple your money back.

325
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,580
It's not a bad deal now, is it?

326
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
Well, how do you know if you don't get it to get your money back?

327
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,960
Well, I guess you'll have to cross that bridge when you come to it.

328
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,800
Now, some people...

329
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,440
Let me put it this way.

330
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,920
If you end up...

331
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,180
If you end up in hell as a result of investing $30 in Bob Dobbs' church,

332
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,840
he will meet you at the gates of hell with a check for $90

333
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,320
and a little booklet called How to Enjoy Hell for 5 Cents a Day.

334
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,740
It's $89.95, I think.

335
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,380
Now, other than having a good laugh and creating something out of minds

336
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,440
that otherwise would be wasted on something probably even worse than this,

337
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
what are you people up to?

338
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,060
Well...

339
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,060
Basically, Bob, we've declared war on God.

340
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,700
Now, I know that that sounds...

341
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,800
I mean, that's kind of taken on a big job.

342
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,380
We've been pulling God's leg for a long time, and that's a very large leg to pull.

343
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,020
It takes a lot of nerve, and you damn well better be funny if you're gonna do it.

344
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,380
But we have gotten so sick and tired of this invisible monster

345
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,720
that everybody keeps talking about that is so weak and pathetic

346
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,900
that it has to be defended by illiterate liars.

347
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,040
And we're gonna have to fight little old ladies and rednecks against jerks like me.

348
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,260
Now, what kind of a God is that?

349
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,960
We're just sick and tired of putting up with it.

350
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,860
This thing's been, you know, allowing starvation and hunger and all this stuff all over the world.

351
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,600
We've just had enough.

352
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,380
They've been telling us for years we were gonna go to hell.

353
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,100
What else could we do but start our own religion?

354
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,740
Are you guys gonna be there tomorrow night?

355
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,720
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

356
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,900
Now, we don't plan any kind of disruptions.

357
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,300
We're generally very polite folks.

358
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,660
Well, you're gonna see God tomorrow night.

359
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,840
You're gonna see God in action.

360
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,120
You're gonna see the supernatural like you've never seen it before.

361
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,640
Then what?

362
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,080
Well, if I'm impressed, I'm sure I'll convert.

363
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,460
And put $30 in the offering.

364
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,300
I've given many gods a lot of chances, and I've worshipped many, many gods and demons.

365
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,500
But, you know, I always end up coming back to old Bob Dobbs.

366
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,560
Now, there are people out there who probably think

367
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,980
you are some secret agent.

368
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,040
I have a good friend of mine that I just put up to this for comic relief.

369
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,960
I don't know. You haven't mentioned.

370
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,580
You people contacted me this week and said,

371
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,860
Oh, by the way, since Bob's coming to Dallas, maybe he'd like to talk to us.

372
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,780
Oh, yeah.

373
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Well, we happen to have been, you know, because our end of the world is coming up very soon,

374
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,480
we've been on kind of a big PR blitz.

375
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,000
And I'll tell you what, Bob, it is a big relief for me to talk to somebody

376
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,400
with even the slightest bit of sense.

377
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,480
Because mostly I've been on the radio with, uh,

378
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,380
drive time classic rock jocks,

379
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,600
which is the lowest form of life on earth.

380
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,320
You and I absolutely agree.

381
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,140
And I'd rather be talking to a fellow religious nut than one of these normals,

382
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,040
if you don't mind, you know, present company excluded.

383
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,260
Yeah, yeah. I have Richard on the line.

384
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,420
Richard, you called in a second ago to ask a question about this guy.

385
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,220
What's your question, Richard?

386
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,280
Yeah, I wanted to know if, basically, if this kind of thing was serious.

387
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,760
Oh, oh, oh, friends.

388
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh, oh, man.

389
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,080
I forgot how funny all that stuff was.

390
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:04,320
This guy called in who, he was actually the guy from the alt.fan.bob-larsen news group,

391
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,380
which is not really a Bob Larson fan club.

392
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,460
They actually, uh, they're not really a Bob Larson fan club.

393
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,460
They actually kind of make fun of the guy and so forth.

394
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,960
And, uh, this, um, anti-Bob Larson guy called up and said,

395
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:27,020
uh, Reverend Stang, what are you doing on the air with this, uh, adulterous radio preacher?

396
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,040
And I knew what he was talking about.

397
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:37,040
Bob Larson has had some problems in that respect, much like our current acting president.

398
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,440
You know, some guys just, you know,

399
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,720
just have these organs, I'm sorry, you know.

400
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,140
And, uh, and I jumped in and said, uh, I, you must be talking about me.

401
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,420
I'm sure you're not talking about Bob Larson.

402
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:01,340
And the, the, um, caller, uh, said, well, basically, they, they censored him.

403
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,120
And it was totally, completely removed from all human reality.

404
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,280
Oh, but, uh, check out what, Larson, uh,

405
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,760
tuned in as, as he, uh, faded back in after the, uh, you know, censored out stuff.

406
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:23,860
He, he fades back in going, well, you know, uh, I've got a lot more nuts calling me than you have in your whole religion.

407
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
And you know, friends, he's right.

408
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,180
And it's kind of a sad commentary, isn't it?

409
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,520
I've got more nutcases who listen to me than follow you.

410
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,420
And we're not gonna glorify these idiots out there and jerks who try to, uh,

411
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,420


412
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,900
try to take advantage of religious fanatics like you to attack sane people like me.

413
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,720
But, Ivan, I want to know, in all seriousness, how many people belong to your religion?

414
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,640
Is just you and a couple of buddies, where do you get the figure of 10,000?

415
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,520
No, we, uh, Bob, quite seriously, we have four books that have been published by Simon & Schuster,

416
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,460
the first one being Book of the Subgenius.

417
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,800
They're, it's still in print.

418
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,280
About 100,000 copies.

419
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,680
The second one is sold.

420
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:19,080
I've printed, well, 60 or 70,000 copies of our little pamphlet, our equivalent of one of those chick comics.

421
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,180
And, um, we have had at least 10,000 members sign up over, I mean, we've been around for 15 years.

422
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,480
Bob predicted that there would be millions of them and that we would have taken over the world by now,

423
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,720
but I think the conspiracy read Bob's prophecies, too.

424
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,620
And prophecy heeded is prophecy fulfilled.

425
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,100
And you are the sacred scribe of the church.

426
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,820
I'm the one, I'm the guy who has to do a lot of the dirty work, yeah.

427
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,680
I assign the sacrifices and that kind of thing.

428
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,600
All right, well, I tell you what, one of these days we're going to get you back and talk a little longer.

429
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:02,740
I would suggest, however, beware those little old illiterate ladies as you referred to them a moment ago.

430
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:10,420
Because there are some godly women of the Lord who deeply resent what you just said,

431
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:18,360
and they are going to kick your spiritual butt with the power of prayer if you show up on Friday night.

432
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,960
So beware.

433
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:32,280
Those people that you denigrate have got more spiritual power and common eternal horse sense in their little finger

434
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,340
than you've got in a lifetime of pursuing illicit religions.

435
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,140
And they're ready to take you on.

436
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,480
And they're ready to pray you into the kingdom.

437
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,800
So I say, prayer warriors, my friends in Dallas, beware.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,760
As you can see, it's going to be an interesting evening.

439
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,940
I've got David on the line.

440
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,600
Hello, David, let's go from the ridiculous to the sublime.

441
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,000
David!

442
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,240
I say that if you get your side into this, it's $222.99 only for tonight.

443
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,480
On your way out, make sure...

444
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,400
There are so many logical and thoroughly possible things.

445
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,380
There are so many logical ways in which the entire tribe of mankind could be wiped off the earth at any moment.

446
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,720
Hey, hey, why don't you knock on that trap door there and say,

447
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,680
Yogg-Sothoth three times.

448
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,900
Go ahead, do it, man.

449
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,380
Okay.

450
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,060
Yogg-Sothoth.

451
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,780
Yogg-Sothoth.

452
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,980
No, I'm not going to say it the third time, because you know I won't get one out.

453
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,100
I didn't think I was going to catch you.

454
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,880
That's right.

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,480
That's right. I know your tricks.

456
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Last time I did that, I had bad luck for ten years, man.

457
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,340
That's right.

458
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,680
You old mean Mr. Tooth Decay.

459
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,060
That's right. And ultimately that was because of your truth decay.

460
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,640
I saw a little man in the laundromat.

461
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,940
A little tiny man looked like mean old, mean old Mr. Tooth Decay.

462
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,280
When one stops to think what a tiny little grain of sand this haughty world of ours actually is in the dark sea of space,

463
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,780
the spectacle of man's inhumanity to man becomes a cosmic joy.

464
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,440
What's the instinct to a dog?

465
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,120
To run, to hunt with a pack, to kill, Master.

466
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,960
To run with a pack.

467
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,180
Give me a light and a light.

468
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,180
So I can give it a light.

469
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm going to burn.

470
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm going to burn.

471
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm going to burn.

472
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,220
I'm going to burn.

473
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,740
A lot of these kids are highly educated.

474
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,780
They come from upper middle class homes.

475
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,120
But they're burned out and they're broken.

476
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:59,360
And the pain that's in their heart, they will, with their clothes, they'll show the darkness externally by doing a lot of black clothes and black make-up.

477
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,660
And their poetry always seems to be focused on death and hopelessness.

478
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,600
And on the opposite end, you've got the rainbow kids, which are the hippie partier kids.

479
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,860
And they might not even be aware the world's falling apart.

480
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,820
They just want to get high and fulfill their physical needs and have a good time.

481
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,500
I met her through a 12-step program.

482
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,660
Congratulations.

483
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,540
Oh, yes, of course.

484
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,860
It's wonderful.

485
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,620
Wonderful.

486
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,220
Wonderful.

487
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,280
They don't care to the other end of kids that care so much that it's eating them up alive.

488
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,900
They just don't have anything to focus on because no one's taught them about it.

489
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,000
The music of the .

490
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,680
He said, the spinning wheel, baby.

491
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,620
Knock a little patch on the cat's back.

492
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,640


493
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,640


494
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,440
Swing a coat on grandma.

495
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,820
Get a little juice on the table.

496
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Swang up with a little circus money.

497
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,400
He said, the spinning wheel, baby.

498
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,900
You know, when I called before, it was about spiritual warfare, spiritual warfare, Satan, spiritual warfare.

499
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,660
And so sometimes I have a hard time distinguishing what's really going on.

500
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,520
Right.

501
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,640
Okay.

502
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,180
I got a bad feeling in a few minutes I'm going to be going cocky doody all over this here floor.

503
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,820
Very bad.

504
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,420
Because it's getting pretty weird out there, man.

505
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,560
Slip into something a little more comfortable.

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,440
All the world is waiting for you and the power you pose in.

507
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,260
Think and sweat and spew, you filthy humanoid.

508
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,300
Nobody cares.

509
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,140
You don't fit in.

510
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,740
One day you will be a pure cyber intelligence.

511
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,180
A quantum intelligence.

512
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,400
A quantum pattern.

513
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,300
It is life as such.

514
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,140
Sex is so much better that way, too.

515
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,120
I'll do whatever it takes to come to know what to do to get other ideas.

516
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,180
I hope I didn't bring you down.

517
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,780
Well, this whole scene is just in your imagination, babe.

518
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,080
Just go ahead and...

519
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,860
He's having a bad one.

520
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm looking at another graveyard again.

521
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,620
Should we wake him up?

522
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,240
No, let's leave him here.

523
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,240
Throw some monsters in.

524
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,040
Someone who wants to know the truth is searching for hope, walks in the doors of a place called...

525
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,600
The Loony Bin.

526
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:49,020
It's like they're ashamed to, I don't know, shout for joy or, you know, stand up and play the tambourine or something.

527
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,920
They just are so quiet and refined.

528
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,440
And then when I play the drums and I've been looking to get into a band and doing that kind of stuff,

529
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,520
and I keep getting this guilt trip played on me in a way.

530
00:25:59,600 --> 00:25:59,820
Right.

531
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,860
I'm saying, you know, well, these beasts are evil.

532
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,600
You know, Jennifer, I think all you need to do is to take a quick jaunt through...

533
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,620
Dave, bring him here. He's about to kill me.

534
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,560
Oh, they both believe we could escape.

535
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,380
They torture me.

536
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,520
They make me say things. They make me do things.

537
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,060
I can think. I have a brain.

538
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,880
Who are you?

539
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,600
Help me escape.

540
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,240
Hey.

541
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,020
I'm a parakeet.

542
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,540
Who are you?

543
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,760
I know that I'm a parakeet. I'm an intelligent parakeet.

544
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,100
They make me say things. They make me do things.

545
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,220
Help open my cage. Help me escape.

546
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,600
That's all right, over voice. That's all right, over voice.

547
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,400
I can think. I have a brain.

548
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,940
Yes, you can think. You have a brain.

549
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,240
I know that I'm a parakeet.

550
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,420
The bots are not your own.

551
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,020
I'm an intelligent parakeet.

552
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,380
No, you twitter about it.

553
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,180
They torture me.

554
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,960
You twitter about it.

555
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,240
They make me say things.

556
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,200
But you say nothing of importance.

557
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,520
They make me do things.

558
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,080
Help me escape.

559
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,220
You're uncontrolled.

560
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,640
You were ignorant. You were ignorant. You were ignorant.

561
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,780
You were not ignorant as to what you were doing.

562
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,560
You followed a passion because it was pleasurable for the moment.

563
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,300
Now make a commitment that I will not live on passion, passion anymore.

564
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,840
When trials seem unending, when heartaches are hitting wave upon wave, if only we could remember.

565
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,600
Hail Mary, Mother.

566
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,280
Hail Mother of flesh.

567
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,060
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

568
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,400
I remember.

569
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,780
Back.

570
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,040
Back beyond flesh and bone.

571
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,140
Unicellular mother.

572
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,720
Colloidal, quadruple father, origin of my life.

573
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,920
Our slimy protozoan father.

574
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,680
In moist sailor heaven.

575
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,520
Hallowed be thy tissueed name.

576
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,940
In shallow, brothy, tropical pools.

577
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,100
Beyond life.

578
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,600
Beyond life.

579
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,140
Beyond life.

580
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:23,600


581
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,580
Beyond life.

582
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,080
Beyond life.

583
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,060
Beyond life.

584
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,600
One of life's most beautiful and costly wonders is born out of pain and irritation.

585
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,440
When a piece of sand slips through the opening of the oyster shell, it immediately begins to rub against the soft tissue to produce a hard substance.

586
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,820
That hard substance eventually develops into one of the world's exquisite gems, a lovely...

587
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,580
Gray flesh.

588
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,580
Growing.

589
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:53,000
I was into masturbation and drinking and I stopped that.

590
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,980
and now it's just the thoughts in my mind.

591
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,140
Is there truly to be in for mankind?

592
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,860
Fifty million zircons!

593
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,180
Pray, Bob.

594
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,020
You can open them soon.

595
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,980
And we're leaving this in for a bar cart.

596
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,400
Pray, Bob.

597
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,680
Pray, Bob.

598
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,340
What do you want?

599
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,280
Pray, Bob.

600
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,180
Before, before God.

601
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,320
Will the end of the world come that way?

602
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,200
Transport to Planet X.

603
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
Hey, wait!

604
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,720
You're not gonna put one of these T's on my back and relieve my pain?

605
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,900
Transport to Planet of God.

606
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,960
God Planet.

607
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,660
Mormon God Planet.

608
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,540
Send...

609
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,100
...mormon God Planet for retraining.

610
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,000
Send...

611
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
...A to Alpha Centauri for delivery.

612
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:51,140
I guess it's like...

613
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,080
...a certain kind of...

614
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,500
...a certain group of men that I feel...

615
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,800
...um...

616
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,780
...enslaved to, I guess you would say.

617
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,080
Is it based on ever getting into pornography?

618
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,200
Mm-hmm.

619
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,180
Okay.

620
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,180
And so, are those some of the flashbacks that come back?

621
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,560
Yes.

622
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,240
No, Maria, you have learned a great deal.

623
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,380
You've got a lot of truth in your noggin.

624
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,000
No way out.

625
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,620
No way out.

626
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,380
No way out.

627
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,040
No way out.

628
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,460
Suicide is the answer.

629
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,100
Will the end for mankind come out of interstellar space?

630
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,780
Mommy?

631
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:27,700
Mommy?

632
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,500
I'm sorry, but I should be but not.

633
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm sorry, but I'll stop.

634
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,180
There is no mom.

635
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,280
Please, now, stop it.

636
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,060
There is no mom.

637
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,500
Mom is dead.

638
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,100
When one stops to think what a tiny little grain of sand this haughty world of ours actually is in the dark sea of space,

639
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,200
the spectacle of man's inhumanity to man becomes a cosmic joke.

640
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,520
Is there anybody out there?

641
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,660
Hello, is anybody out there?

642
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,940
Can you hear me?

643
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:23,520
I made her, I know I made her out to be a god because I believed everything that she told me.

644
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:35,320
It is later than you think.

645
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,240
I can't see you, honey.

646
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,560
Wait.

647
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,960
Come on, man, I'm starting to sweat now.

648
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,660
I'm going to see if you sweat.

649
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Help me.

650
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,820
Help me.

651
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,640
Help me.

652
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,240
Help me.

653
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,080
Help me.

654
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,280
Help me.

655
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,200
Help me.

656
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,460
Help me.

657
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,820
Help me.

658
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,240
Help me.

659
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,920
Help me.

660
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,720
And I still believe that I'm ugly.

661
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,600
Stronger.

662
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,540
You see?

663
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,380
You see?

664
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,840
You're stupid minds.

665
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,800
Stupid.

666
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,540
Stupid.

667
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,920
There's a reason why.

668
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,160
there was an appeal toward sexual activity.

669
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,220
And then they saw the red fire and heard the big sound

670
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,600
as the silver rocket shot up toward Mars

671
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,000
and left them behind on an ordinary Monday morning

672
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,560
on the ordinary planet Earth.

673
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,740
And the funny thing is, he's not even high on anything.

674
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,360
He's just completely in his natural state.

675
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,720
Him and his worms.

676
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,300
Him and his worms.

677
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,920
His brain is as naked as the day he was born.

678
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,940
And we are the products.

679
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,740
And when the show of Dave is over, all the shows are over.

680
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,640
All the voices.

681
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,040
All the songs.

682
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,400
All the stuff.

683
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,520
All of it was inside that little tiny ball inside his head.

684
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Love me.

685
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,980
Love me.

686
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,940
Love me.

687
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,880
Love me.

688
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,040
The sexual act is love.

689
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,140
Right?

690
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,220
He was dressed in a strange uniform.

691
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,420
And he came down out of the sky in a long silver craft.

692
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,080
They thought only we could escape.

693
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,900
They torture me.

694
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,900
They make me say things.

695
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,020
They make me do things.

696
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,700
I can think.

697
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,600
I have a brain.

698
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,380
Who are you?

699
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,080
Help me escape.

700
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,660
I'm a parakeet.

701
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,060
Who are you?

702
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,520
I know that I'm a parakeet.

703
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,280
I am an intelligent parakeet.

704
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,920
They make me say things.

705
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,600
They make me do things.

706
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,540
Help open my cage.

707
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,720
Help me escape.

708
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,420
That's all right, over voice.

709
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,120
That's all right, over voice.

710
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,960
I can think.

711
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,920
I have a brain.

712
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,440
Yes, you can think.

713
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,480
You have a brain.

714
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,100
I know that I'm a parakeet.

715
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,780
The thoughts are natural.

716
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,600
I'm an intelligent parakeet.

717
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,920
No, you twitter about it.

718
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,720
They torture me.

719
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,540
You twitter about it.

720
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,820
They make me say things.

721
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,760
But you say nothing.

722
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,340
They make me do things.

723
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,900
They make me do things.

724
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:13,900


725
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,320
Your mind is being controlled.

726
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,820
Help me escape.

727
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,480
Your mind is being controlled.

728
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,640
There is no escape for you.

729
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,500
I can think.

730
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
I have a brain.

731
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,360
They make me say things.

732
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,400
Nashes.

733
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,500
Teeth clog at the walls.

734
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,980
Help me escape.

735
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,360
He thinks that I know it's not going to save him.

736
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,360
Forgive him.

737
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,260
Open my cage.

738
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,960
I'll just open this golden cage here.

739
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,660
Forgive him, butler.

740
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,660
He knows not what he says.

741
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,200
Children who can be free...

742
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,300
Get it?

743
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,080
Do not judge the whole race by this one example.

744
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,500
Then I'll be free.

745
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,940
There are no more like him.

746
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,260
Destroy the rest.

747
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,100
The ship, it came from the sky again.

748
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,060
The tall man stepped out and talked with me, telling me little jokes and laughing.

749
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,900
What else?

750
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,720
Bring forth the virgin.

751
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,640
I feel the virgin.

752
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,680
powerless right i feel out of control he told me he'd take me away in his ship into the sky

753
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,360
take me back to his planet with him it's quite ridiculous really we found ourselves down in

754
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:33,640
module 24 and uh the gravity is kind of low down here yeah yeah it's about one-sixth of earth

755
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,380
it's kind of fun module 24

756
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,160
well they don't come down to this one a lot yeah well it's spooky down here black lights and the

757
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,520
and the fog machines it kind of gives you yeah the floaty the things the little strobe lights

758
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,260
the landing strobes that you see through the window that's the one thing about this lowest

759
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,920
level dark those little flashing landing lights little beacon

760
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,840
they're not

761
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,360
they're not

762
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,360


763
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,400
really synchronized to each other so every now and then they line up

764
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,200

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:21,160

the

781
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:45,700
brain

782
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,780
water

783
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,860

he over there

789
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,420
issen

790
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,100
okay

791
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,220
cet

792
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,520
Alpha Centauri. Little does he know he'll be the star of a cooking show.

793
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,340
This kind of stuff is called how to serve humans.

794
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,180
And then it happened.

795
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,500
A whirring, rushing sound.

796
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,400
The warmth is of a giant fire passing in the air.

797
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,040
The gleam of metal in the sky.

798
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,640
He's come. It's true. The dream is true.

799
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,820
Three will kill an elephant. Dave can take five.

800
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:45,640
He likes the pretty colors that the toxic beetle shell makes when he smokes it.

801
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,680
That is the weirdest stuff I ever tried in my life.

802
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,060
You eat one damn burrito and you have a brain gasm.

803
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,900
There's some good things on this dude.

804
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,340
Here Dave, take this hypodermic syringe.

805
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,000
And smoke some more of the crushed up beetle legs.

806
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,720
Think about the old days Dave.

807
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,680
Think about the days.

808
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,620
Dave, remember for us for a second.

809
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,860
Where did you get that cowboy hat?

810
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,080
Where did you get that cowboy hat Dave?

811
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,300
Tell us about the hat Dave.

812
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,520
Yes, remember the hat.

813
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,440
It's been a long time since I put on this gear and decided to become a country singer.

814
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,800
And eventually star on that Centauri.

815
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,220
Yeah, this old hat.

816
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,560
I ain't seen a lot of bad motels buddy.

817
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,560
And a lot of rooms in that one.

818
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,200
This old hat's been around the world with me and now it's been to outer space.

819
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:55,180
Yeah, only one problem is this hat seems to be expanding and the top of my head keeps on growing into a pointy cone.

820
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,800
And I have to think my weird mind terms from the church are subgenius to make it go down every time it happens.

821
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,960
Every time I pull this old hat off and look at it, it's got a new punch mark coming out of it.

822
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,640
And I think, dang, man, somebody if I get off this ship and they start cheering in the floor and I put this on, they're going to think I'm kind of goofy.

823
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,720
But still, it's good luck.

824
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,600
I could drink me a whole gallon of rain water out of this here hat.

825
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,980
I'm going to walk down by the river and have me a drink out of my old hat.

826
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,720
God knows why.

827
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,020
The rockets came like drums beating in the night.

828
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,040
They came like locusts swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke.

829
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,400
I don't have any control.

830
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm bad.

831
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,060
I'm bad.

832
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,920
I'm bad.

833
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm bad.

834
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,840
I'm bad.

835
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,840
See that green star up there?

836
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,320
That's Earth.

837
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,280
You know, sometimes I have evil thoughts about people and stuff.

838
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,220
I'm in control.

839
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,400
I'm in control.

840
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,380
I'm in control.

841
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,860
I'm out of control.

842
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,680
I feel powerless.

843
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,780
I feel out of control.

844
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,020
Actually, friends, that's the third time I've said that.

845
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,020


846
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,820
This morning, I tried to say that on this little tape deck.

847
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,040
I keep getting interrupted in my mixing by the phone ringing.

848
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,940
It was Jesus.

849
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,360
I can't believe that the Lord is up so early.

850
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,840
It's like 9.30 in the morning here.

851
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,320
Friends, we are sort of out of control, though.

852
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,300
My air conditioner is broken.

853
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,580
And our website got shut down.

854
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:41,500
The people that run the server, I think, must have gotten some angry letters from fundamentalists

855
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,920
or something.

856
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,700
And they just caved in, shut it down.

857
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,780
It's no big deal.

858
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,080
Praise Bob, there are real Americans left in the world who will do anything for a buck.

859
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,680
So we found a new server that specializes in hardcore pornography.

860
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,100
You know, it's a shame that we have to...

861
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Eh.

862
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:09,640
This is like the third time we've had to move our website, www.subgenius.com, in the last three months.

863
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,400
But I don't want to complain about that.

864
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,320
Actually, friends, I should...

865
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,640
Well, I could complain.

866
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:22,600
I could complain that the Church of the Subgenius isn't quite as big as Bob Larson Ministries.

867
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,360
You know, we can't draw as big of a crowd in Texas as Bob Larson can.

868
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,260
But...

869
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,240
But we're growing.

870
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,860
I mean, we've got 40 days left before the world ends.

871
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,780
And then our little company is growing.

872
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:45,920
Jesus had called me to warn me to look out for our new employee, Reverend Laura.

873
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,460
Praise Reverend Laura.

874
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,680
We actually have...

875
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,220
You know, we employ several people part-time.

876
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,780
Lovely Reverend Nikki Death Chick and now Reverend Laura.

877
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
And various other people.

878
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,620
And various other people on and off.

879
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,420
And, you know, I mean, we're trying.

880
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,100
We're trying.

881
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,640
Anyway, what we've been listening to...

882
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,440
Friends, this...

883
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,460
Obviously, you've been listening to Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

884
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,460
Although this was a very special show in that Chaz Smith did that amazing edit of this material.

885
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,080
He cut in all those little audio clips.

886
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:29,220
He collaged the recording session that we actually did not do at the right time.

887
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,780
And we did that in the radio station at WCSB.

888
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,020
We did that in sitting around in Chaz's little black light lit studio.

889
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,620
Sort of like my little studio, only prettier.

890
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,240
And so let's get back to that, friends.

891
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,980
Also, I mean, I'm so glad that Chaz edited that show for us.

892
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,200
He did.

893
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,180
He did a great job.

894
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,700
And it really...

895
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,020
It saves our butts.

896
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,200
Here's an address for Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

897
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,700
They actually have tapes of their music and their improv radio shows.

898
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,940
I say theirs.

899
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,260
It's almost like I'm a...

900
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,900
Kind of almost like a member of the band because I participate a lot.

901
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,440
I'm just the worst musician in the band.

902
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:27,360
Anyway, that's Einstein's Secret Orchestra, P.O. Box 602684.

903
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,380
Cleveland, Ohio 44102.

904
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,360
Again, that's Box 602684.

905
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,220
44102.

906
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,800
Now, what else do I...

907
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,400
Well, as always, there's mountains of stuff I could play.

908
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,060
But you know there's a new Negative Land album out.

909
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,200
Got a new CD from Negative Land.

910
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,200
And I get...

911
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,000
Probably almost all the college radio stations are playing that.

912
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,340
I'm not sure.

913
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:57,340


914
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,280
But I'm gonna play some anyway.

915
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,640
But what they're not playing is Reagan's Pollock.

916
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,460
Heck, let's just go to Reagan's Pollock right now.

917
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,400
I lied to you.

918
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,720
I lied to you, man.

919
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,160
Actually, I wanted to give credit for the music in the background there.

920
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:27,000
That was my good friend, Reverend Imat Zepol, also known as El Diablo.

921
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,860
And his group, Cosmic Voyeur.

922
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,860
And now, Detonator by Reagan's Pollock.

923
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,180
Thank you.

924
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,620
Here are the bitches that I asked for.

925
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,960
Here are the bitches that I need to survive.

926
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,500
You sent me these bitches.

927
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,740
Dear God, I think you'd appeared in the blink of an eye.

928
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,160
Here are the bitches that I need to survive.

929
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,160


930
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,160


931
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,160


932
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,160
The bitches were waving like beauty contestaments

933
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,440
The bitches lined up in a row

934
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,820
The bitches were blind and they giggle like bitches

935
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,880
The bitches been over with asses to show

936
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,660
Asses to show and asses to show, asses to show

937
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,800
The bitches been over with asses to show

938
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,400
Asses to show, asses to show, asses to show

939
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,680
Asses to show and asses to show, asses to show

940
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:54,760
I cross the street on a bridge of asses

941
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,780
I live my life on a bridge of asses

942
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,440
Bridge of asses

943
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,340
I climbed to heaven on a bridge of asses

944
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,520
Bridge of asses

945
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,500
Right for the bitches

946
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,800
Ooh, the bitches make me feel alright

947
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,940
Ooh, the bitches gonna do it tonight

948
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,360
Ooh

949
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,100
法ر

950
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:08,260
A lovely little ditty by Reagan's Polyp from their new CD, Detonator.

951
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,360
Here's an address for Reagan's Polyp.

952
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,760
You won't be finding this in many stores.

953
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,480
That's Reagan's Polyp, 225 West 105th Street.

954
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,980
That's 225 West 105th Street.

955
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:34,500
Suite 1FW, New York, New York, 10025.

956
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Reagan's Polyp, affronted by our old friend that I've never met, Reverend Chris Dumas.

957
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,540
I always want to say dumbass for some reason.

958
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,560
Sternow used to be in that band, but he ain't no more.

959
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:03,100
Reagan's Polyp, an unusual and yet disgusting, horrible, awful band.

960
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,640
Praise Bob. Thank you.

961
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,520
Reagan's Polyp, 225 West 105th Street.

962
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,160
Reagan's Polyp, 225 West 105th Street.

963
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,880
Reagan's Polyp, 225 West 105th Street.

964
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:27,880


965
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:27,880


966
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,920
I missed it, guys. Try it again.

967
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,280
Hi, I'm Eddie Idle.

968
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,380
I-D-L-E.

969
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,580
No, it's not my real name.

970
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,360
Before this, I was Chaney Link in the Prisms.

971
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,200
That wasn't my real name either.

972
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,320
Give me an E.

973
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:47,680
Give me an E.

974
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,520
Give me an E.

975
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


976
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


977
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


978
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


979
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


980
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,040
very good name probably because I thought of it before I found Mertz

981
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:00,580
everything was bad then before Mertz we couldn't get any material to perform and

982
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,300
arguments broke out on stage guys were taking equipment home not bringing it

983
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,120
back I maybe you read about it the prisms you guys aren't even the prisms

984
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:18,900
well anyway oh these guys don't even read yeah then I happened to buy a tin of

985
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,160
Mertz the tiny brain shaped tablet that makes up your mind well that changed

986
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,760
everything I guess I ditched the van I change my name got these guys together

987
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,840
switch to keyboards now I'm Eddie idol completely famous with a future that's

988
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
economically secure

989
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,020
you know

990
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:46,020
You guys can get your life in gear too, but first you've got to get your mind in gear with Mertz

991
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,380
Mertz makes up your mind

992
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,520
Okay, guys, let's do another take on rolling down the river

993
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,540
Mertz makes up your mind

994
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,840
I'm in control. I'm in control

995
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,960
Okay, we're coming in for a landing on Alpha Centauri

996
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,340
Look at this, it's coming down awfully fast

997
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:19,860
Oh my god, it couldn't be that we're going to crash after all these years

998
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,760
A 30 year trip and he doesn't even know how to pull the brakes

999
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,140
The stupid idiot, after all this time he screwed everything up

1000
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,480
He could have been a star, he could have had all the frup in the world

1001
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,280
Dave, come to the light, come towards the light

1002
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,780
Come towards the light?

1003
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,640
The spotlight

1004
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,420
Am I dead off-chart or am I just having another bad dream?

1005
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,740
No, the spotlight underneath the helicopter

1006
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,960
We're going to put you on board and take you back to 1968

1007
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,960
You guys coming to take me back to the lines?

1008
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,560
Yeah

1009
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,100
Hey man, I'm on R&R

1010
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,080
You've been in the hospital, Dave

1011
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,420
I'm on R&R, you can't take me back

1012
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,860
No, you've been in the hospital, it wasn't R&R

1013
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,460
You had your spine replaced

1014
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,800
You had your spine replaced

1015
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,160
You were spineless in your first life

1016
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,080
We gave you a new spine, now you're going back

1017
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,760
We lost Mickey, man, we couldn't do anything about it

1018
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,800
I don't want to go back

1019
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,260
Don't you remember you were in a foxhole, Dave?

1020
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,760
I don't want to go back!

1021
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,980
Charlie's grenade landed in there

1022
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:46,060
And the next thing you knew you were wiping your best friend's face off of your face

1023
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,120
Oh no, that's right

1024
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,180
No, wait a minute

1025
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,620
I don't know what happened

1026
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,700
You were injured, your spine was blown out

1027
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,420
My spine was blown out, no wait

1028
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,900
Yes, no, wait

1029
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,980
We took you to the hospital

1030
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,440
Yes, you took me to the hospital

1031
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,540
You took me to a medivac and a doctor shot me up

1032
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,140
And then they tried to put a new spine in but instead it was just

1033
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,600
Uh oh, get down, man!

1034
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,520
Charlie's injured, we're about to lose the war!

1035
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,900
The last Martians died out years ago

1036
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,900
They're a dead race now

1037
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,520
They don't know what I'm thinking about them

1038
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,420
They don't know what I'm wishing on them

1039
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,880
And it's like I'm taking the control

1040
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,700
And I know that that's really wrong

1041
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,380
And that's really bad

1042
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,520
One would mind, neither bird nor tree

1043
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,640
If mankind perished utterly

1044
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,580
And spring herself when she was born

1045
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,380
And woke at dawn

1046
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,600
Would scarcely know that we were gone

1047
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,140
That we were gone

1048
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,580
That we were gone

1049
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,000
That we were gone

1050
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,600
That we were gone

1051
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:46,800
That we were gone

1052
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,600
Today is October 5th, 2026

1053
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,080
Hey man, get that away from me

1054
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,400
I don't want none of that stuff

1055
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,040
I thought you guys had the good smack from Dunag

1056
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,680
No, we just gave you the wake up drug, man

1057
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,160
Oh no

1058
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,020
In 20 minutes you're gonna be seeing things the way they really are

1059
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,800
You're gonna dig it, dude

1060
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,160
Here, I'll put on some Hendrix while you wait

1061
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,040
Oh yeah

1062
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,360
Let's go

1063
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,980
It was Saturday night

1064
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,800
And I went to a bar and

1065
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,780
I put in a quarter

1066
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,960
To hear some guitar

1067
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,000
And I sat on the bar stool

1068
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,200
Baby, drinking my beer

1069
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,420
Why?

1070
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,840
Oh, rock and roll music

1071
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,100
Made love to my ear

1072
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,320
And don't you know it sounded good to me

1073
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,440
So please, baby, please

1074
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,340
Say give me some

1075
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,340
Rock and roll music

1076
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,120
I want it right now, wow, wow, yeah

1077
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,160
Rock and roll music

1078
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,100
I like it somehow

1079
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,300
Rock and roll music

1080
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,580
It's rockin' so good, yeah

1081
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,680
Rock and roll music

1082
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,240
It's so, so, so good

1083
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,740
Let's go

1084
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,100
Ooh, righteous rock music

1085
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,940
It hits like a fist

1086
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,160
All right

1087
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,080
But I really don't know

1088
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,700
What you're really hatin'

1089
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,800
I'll tell ya

1090
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,660
When it goes like this

1091
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,120
Ding

1092
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,580
Ding

1093
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,840
Ding

1094
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,220
Ding

1095
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,800
Ding

1096
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,160
Ding

1097
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,640
Ding

1098
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,320
Ding

1099
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,620
Ding

1100
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,000
Ding

1101
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,100
Ding

1102
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,460
Ding

1103
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,180
Ding

1104
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:49,180


1105
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:49,560
Ding

1106
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:49,680
Ding

1107
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:49,680


1108
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:49,680


1109
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:49,680


1110
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:49,700
Ding

1111
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,460
Ding

1112
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,360
Ding

1113
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,360


1114
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,780
Ding

1115
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,560
Ding

1116
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:56,940
Ding

1117
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,940
Bang

1118
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,580


1119
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,300
The power of love

1120
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,920
Now varies

1121
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,180
From people

1122
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:10,180


1123
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:20,340
And hard to find

1124
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,980
guitar solo

1125
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,700
You know, and then they're like raining from the sky down in the Gariboo, Maine.

1126
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:59,340
But what is instinct, really, to a dog?

1127
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,380
Instinct to a dog is probably...

1128
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:02,960
They would know.

1129
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,660
...milly, milly, milly, milly microns the french fry is from the wall.

1130
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:13,460
No, actually, I think that dog wishes that its instinct was to hunt and kill and run with the pack.

1131
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,220
But actually, the dog's instinct is to serve man.

1132
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,720
To serve man.

1133
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,440
To serve man.

1134
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,340
It depends on the dog.

1135
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:27,320
I mean, certainly not a wild dog, but our domesticated dogs, it's like Planet of the Apes, man, you know.

1136
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,780
And soon they will take over, are you saying?

1137
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,280
There are slaves now, but we're teaching them all the time.

1138
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,340
Well, I am a slave at this very moment.

1139
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:43,240
When the dogs learn how to communicate by vibrating their voices, they start to use their own...

1140
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,160
Mind vibrates your genitals.

1141
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:45,800
...radio.

1142
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,880
We drop fire on children.

1143
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,440
We drop fire on children, but they won't let them write the word...

1144
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,820
...on their airplanes, because it's obscene.

1145
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,460
Well, you wouldn't want a bunch of burning children to be confronted by such an awful word.

1146
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,720
I mean, such a wonderful, awful word, or whatever it is.

1147
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:09,740
I was driving my burning child to school one day, and he saw that word written on the wall.

1148
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,880
And I said, do you know what that...

1149
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,940
Kid, put yourself out.

1150
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,300
I said, do you know what that word means?

1151
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,740
And he said, yeah, that means butt.

1152
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,200
And I went, son...

1153
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,860
It's time for a little talk.

1154
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,120
And I can bet it was probably a pretty long talk, too.

1155
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,100
That was...

1156
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:33,160
General Versus, I must insist that we cease this cruel hunting of humans.

1157
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,620
Dr. Zaius, you are a silly liberal fool.

1158
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,680
These humans are nothing but animals.

1159
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:44,100
We will take them aboard our pleasure saucers and train them to be our servants.

1160
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,740
We will give them lobotomies and do experiments on them.

1161
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,480
There's nothing else we can do.

1162
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,700
The surplus of the program's almost all been eaten by the last cuts.

1163
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,360
We have to do with what we can.

1164
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,100
And look at them, anyway.

1165
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,000
You call them human?

1166
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,800
Bob Dobbs!

1167
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,320
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1168
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,460
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1169
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,140
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1170
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,100
Got your pencil ready?

1171
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:15,960
Bob.

1172
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,140
Post Office Box 14030.

1173
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,600
306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1174
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,140
That's Bob.

1175
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,000
P.O. Box 140306.

1176
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,820
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1177
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,700
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1178
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,960
I don't understand you, then.

1179
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,800
When must... what must be over for July?

1180
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,300
Uh...

1181
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:48,920
That snowy field.

1182
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:54,140
When I was out, we were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas, when I said in July.

1183
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1184
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,280
Yes, always.

1185
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,820
I'm always past that.

1186
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:00,500
You are?

1187
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,060
Yes.

1188
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,160
That's about where I say in July.

1189
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,320
Now we need something to bring the bones and stones of this verbalization to life.

1190
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,160
We need to find a video brilliancy of enormous power and clarity.

1191
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,400
A pictorial flash, like a burst of heat lightning, to illuminate the central concept.

1192
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,160
We were...

1193
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,520
We were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas, when I said in July.

1194
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,720
The big green jewel of the vegetable kingdom.

1195
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,320
Yes.

1196
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,440
Why, that's about where I say in July.

1197
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:34,700
There will be other pictures in the commercial illustrating secondary flames, which adds dimension and depth, or which add mood and feeling.

1198
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,100
But these will swing out from this video.
