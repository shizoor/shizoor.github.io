1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm using children as human shields.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,700
However, time is running short for solving PR's problems.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,460
That's patently untrue.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,100
Also today, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is sentenced to eight years in prison.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,300
She's accused of helping PR News elude capture for 16 years.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,700
You're listening to PR News.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,360
That's true.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,560
True.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,660
Stocks so far, 22, 112, 53, 23, 28, 32, 10, 13, 19.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,680
Also today, a large square of Secretary of Commerce was attacked by angry mobs

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,440
as it unsuccessfully attempted to get into the rebel-held town of Washington.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,700
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues out of control.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,860
Clinton has claimed the life of at least one person.

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,180
She destroyed more than 100 structures.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,100
Which she says can be accomplished without.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,560
Harsh austerity measures.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,120
Also today, John Bryson's office said, this is PR.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,080
You ain't nothing but a...

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,960
Soul genius.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,160
Power of...

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,500
Watch.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,800
We depend on you to lift the standards of our young people.

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,280
Not hasten their decadence.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Attention subgeniuses.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,520
Attention subgeniuses.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,920
The Mutant Mountain Boys will be playing at the main stage

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,740
within the next five minutes.

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,080
Human time.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,240
Or within the next ten seconds, Princess Wee time.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,320
The end days, my brothers, are soon upon us.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,320
For soon, my brothers and sisters, the skies will open.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,360
The saucers will come.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,820
And we will all meet them in the sky.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,140
And if they don't, then, you know, whatever.

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,880
We'll get drunk. I don't care.

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,740
We'll get drunk.

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,240
We'll get drunk.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,380
We'll get drunk.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,080
We'll get drunk.

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,240
We found a sweet haven of sunshine at last.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,920
The exits are parting above.

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,920
They'll scoop us with tentacles newly cast.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,040
And smoothly they'll sell us some love.

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,380
The tempest is over.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
We're safe evermore.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,720
We're safe evermore.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,120
Action when rupture is nigh.

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,960
The danger has passed.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,620
We're rescued at last.

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,260
The end days are here by and by.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,780
Cease us endangered and sends out his men

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,760
To pilot our ping-beaten soul.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,540
The end times have teased us again and again.

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,620
But this one's the truth, it's told.

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,020
The tempest is over.

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,400
We're safe evermore.

57
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,720
What slackness, what rupture is nigh?

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,700
The danger has passed.

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:15,840
is past. We're rescued at last. The end days are hereby and by.

60
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,400
His trance shall control me through life and in death. Completely I'll fuck to the end.

61
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll praise Bob each hour in my last weeping breath.

62
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,820
Shall joke of my life and in death. I'll praise Bob each hour in my last weeping breath.

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,080
He'll protect me from things that morning blind.

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,200
She'll set my soul's best friend on fire.

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,300
I'll praise Bob each hour in my last weeping breath.

66
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,440
He'll give me a hug and a blessing to bliver Take me to heaven and on earth.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,100
He'll take away my troubles, all my tears. And I'll endeavors store, I shall ask him

68
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,760
Were rest and rest were rest, no husband's mind.

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,300
Germans forgot heart and soul are far, Death and doom meet and that쳐.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,020
He'll join my dead and deep and renowned relicsful heart.

71
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,380
We're safe evermore.

72
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,200
What slackness, what rupture is love?

73
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,420
The danger is past.

74
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,120
We're rescued at last.

75
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,800
The end days are here by and by.

76
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,860
This is your captain. Is there a subgenius on board?

77
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,180
Mister, it's 4 a.m.

78
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Hey, you're a genius, right? I'm a subgenius.

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,580
Okay. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh. Uh. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh.

80
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,680
Thank you, Reverend Wilhelm von Stroheim for that little cut-up.

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Before that, the Mutant Mountain Boys live at 50 next day.

82
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,020
And at the top, the return of the real PR news by the great Mr. Fernandinende Leemur.

83
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,100
Evidently referring to him as being dead, resurrected him.

84
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,120
More PR news later.

85
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,360
Friends, this is Hour of Slut number 1373.

86
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:40,520
And it's mostly rants and song jams recorded live at the main stage the second night of 50 next day.

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,740
And consequently has way more cussing than usual.

88
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
So be forewarned.

89
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:52,520
We start with our MC, Priestess Pisces and myself explaining the way the freeform rant jamming works.

90
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,020
Okay, so here's how this is gonna work.

91
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,200
I have a stage hook.

92
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,860
The people who can use this stage hook are myself, Stang, and we.

93
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,020
The stage hook will work like this.

94
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,780
If you would like to rant,

95
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,140
you can come up on stage and rant.

96
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,540
If Stang or myself or we are tired of listening to you spit on the mic because you're drunk,

97
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,900
then the stage hook will be employed.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,780
I doubt if Princess Wee and I would even go to that trouble.

99
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,020
Because it's at 7 o'clock the world ends and we have to get up at 6.

100
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm not really used to that.

101
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,160
I don't do the staying up all night thing.

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,960
Yeah, go ahead.

103
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,040
Have fun.

104
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,420
At 7 o'clock in the morning, everybody's gonna be looking at me going,

105
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,700
Where's Reverend Stang?

106
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,980
Are the saucers coming or not?

107
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,860
So we're actually going to go to bed at midnight exactly before our car turns back into a car.

108
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,980
Well, in other words, you're Fox because it's me.

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,660
Here's made last year or maybe the year before by Reverend 808.

110
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,820
This shitty performer hook is large enough to grab,

111
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,700
more than one person or one really large person.

112
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,940
Or, sure, Gordon, why don't you come up here?

113
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
I bet we can practice on you real quick.

114
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,640
It's way too far for him to walk.

115
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,520
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,980
If you could get somebody to wheel you down, that'd be great.

117
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,460
You know what, it's funny.

118
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,440
We've got a bunch of old doctors who love to heckle,

119
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,100
but I don't see a damn one of them up on stage in this open rant.

120
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,940
Pisces, that's called slack.

121
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
That's why I'm the one that gets paid in just mere pathetic ways.

122
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:40,800


123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,440
They get paid in pathetic money.

124
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
They get paid in slack.

125
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,960
No, this is called rewardian versus emergentile is what this is called.

126
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
They're bigger emergentiles than I am.

127
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,960
They use us like puppets.

128
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,220
They pretend to be rewardians.

129
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,580
Not that I would name any names, Dr. Drummer.

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,600
You know what, all this time I put a tampon in my vagina and not Gordon's hand.

131
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:09,220
But what they really do is get us to do all the physical and organizational work and smiling.

132
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,620
Being polite to everybody.

133
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,380
Jesus Christ!

134
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,100
This is going to drive a man insane!

135
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,320
Again?

136
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,940
I envy most of you because you get to hate the conspiracy.

137
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,380
Think what I have to hate.

138
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,920
We got a microphone here.

139
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,940
All of them are laughing.

140
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,480
Oh great.

141
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,120
Well what the fuck is going on here?

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Everybody's laughing and having a good time.

143
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,520
Laughing and having a good time?

144
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,060
Yes.

145
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,140
If you don't know who the fuck I am, I'm G. Gordon.

146
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,740
I'm the mercenary of mercy.

147
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,760
Bob's fucking left hand.

148
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,580
Pope of the southern hemisphere.

149
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,020
And nobody's fucking sweetheart.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,860
And then all this joviality and cuteness and everything is so much fun.

151
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:01,400
But basically what I've seen lately is this church has got a rotting stain going through the middle of the heart of this church.

152
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,920
Because you know why?

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,420
It's so easy for you.

154
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,620
Because you're the generation of the people I have.

155
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,120
The little phone goes ee-dee-dee-dee.

156
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,120


157
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,820
I got a little thing in my ear.

158
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,620
I was so cute.

159
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,440
I got the tablet.

160
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,740
I don't have to fucking think about anything.

161
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,940
I look it up on Google.

162
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,440
Yeah.

163
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,240
Look at you.

164
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,080
So now if we had Wi-Fi or anything like that here, I wouldn't even be able to talk to anybody.

165
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,320
You all sit there going ee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.

166
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,380
And everybody goes Steve Jobs.

167
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,800
Oh my God.

168
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,920
It's so terrible.

169
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,900
I'm so sorry.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,340
What the fuck is the guy that stopped a whole lot of people going around?

171
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:35,980
Oh yeah.

172
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,240
Yeah.

173
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,520
Yeah.

174
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,880
I don't know.

175
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


176
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


177
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


178
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


179
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,960
It's like we're putting an bangs on you and then you're like, Oh, no, just go.

181
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:36,960


182
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:36,960


183
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:36,960


184
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:36,960


185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,380
You know, like, I'm sure a bunch of people are going like, Oh, yeah, walking in front

186
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,320
of fucking buses and things and you don't even have to do anything to be cool.

187
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, no.

188
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,400
You just go on things like Foocon.

189
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,800
Oh, I'm in a Foocon hole!

190
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,600
I can't get out.

191
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:50,920
What do you mean?

192
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,740
You can't turn your goddamn computer off?

193
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,200
What's wrong with you people?

194
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,920
Oh, look here, I found this on FooCom, I'll change the word here, put a comma in, it's like, hey, look at this, ain't that cool?

195
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,640
You are a bunch of high-tech, lazy, indulged pussies.

196
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,220
Let me tell you something about this church.

197
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,200
You heard me, listen to me.

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
I'll tell you something about this goddamn church.

199
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:23,500
It was forged in the pain and blood of cheap copying, lousy goddamn whiteout, and a whole lot of pennies paid for Xeroxing.

200
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,260
Not to mention the postage.

201
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,920
And most of the spoken word in this church was not Skyping or wiping or blooping or whatever the fuck you do.

202
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,600
It was like a cassette, which, in case you don't remember, was a little tiny thing for recording analog sound.

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:49,300
And it had mechanical, never mind, you don't care, you don't remember, because you're too goddamn indulging yourself with your little phones, your little things.

204
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Listen to me.

205
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,240
This is a do-it-yourself religion.

206
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,540
Let's talk about religion.

207
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,300
Religion starts off when some asshole, smart guy, working guy whips up a little line of bullshit, and it sounds good.

208
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,300
And he goes, whoa.

209
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,740
And everybody goes, whoa.

210
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,120
And somebody else says, hey, we could do a book with this, you know?

211
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,060
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.

212
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,880
Next thing you know, it's the law of the land.

213
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,860
We have the book.

214
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,000
You must go buy the book.

215
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,780
Okay, we'll go buy the book.

216
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,700
Okay, but first you must cut the end of your penis off before you can go buy the book.

217
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,780
Oh, we did it.

218
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,120
It hurts.

219
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,300
Yeah, now we will kill you.

220
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,660
Because you cut your penis off.

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,980
I mean, it's like our way or the highway.

222
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,520
So all of these different streams of things called religion, which I prefer to call bullshit,

223
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,660
are strained out here, and people are killing each other and everything.

224
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,740
And Bob comes along, and what have we got?

225
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,280
We've got a goddamn religion.

226
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,160
We do it ourselves.

227
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,340
We have no...

228
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,920
People say, Stang's in charge.

229
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,740
Fuck, Stang ain't in charge.

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,460
Legume ain't in charge.

231
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,580
Pisces and Legume and Stang are wonderful people.

232
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,820
But nobody's in charge in this...

233
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,160
Let me ask you something.

234
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
When was...

235
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:04,100
When was the last time you defaced public property with a goddamn big dob's head?

236
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,420
When was the last time you left the pamphlet in a Christian science reading room?

237
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,260
Yesterday!

238
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,240
When was the last time some stupid goddamn idiot Christian was on the corner blathering

239
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,260
and you faced him down and told him what a dumb shit he was and gave him a pamphlet and bought him to Bob?

240
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,640
This is an in-your-face church.

241
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,220
This is no nice church.

242
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
I mean, we have marriages and shit.

243
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,960
Oh, that's so nice.

244
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,840
Oh, look at your Pisces.

245
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,900
God bless you.

246
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,880
But at the same time, this is a sinny sacrilegion.

247
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,420
It's not based on being funny or being cute.

248
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,560
It's deriding and hating things that are pink.

249
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,720
All things that are pink, my friends.

250
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,540
This is your do-it-yourself hate kit.

251
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,380
Don't you understand that?

252
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,360
Hate is pure.

253
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,520
Hate burns.

254
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,780
Hate cleanses.

255
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,940
Feel the beauty of that four-letter word, friends.

256
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,540
H-A-T-A.

257
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,940
Hate.

258
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,480
Hate.

259
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,460
Hate.

260
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,060
Oh, a splendor.

261
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,380
And I just tell you here, before I leave, Bob is not the smiling guy.

262
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,580
That's not a grin.

263
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,360
That's a fucking shot of Freud.

264
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,260
Do you know what that is?

265
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,960
He's laughing at your asses.

266
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,500
And you people who pay your $35.

267
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,320
And go, whoa, man, I'm in this church of the sub-juniors.

268
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,720
Paid my $35.

269
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,860
Now I'm going to lean back.

270
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Hey, entertain me, man.

271
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,940
Hey, send me some funny shit, dude.

272
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,300
Show me some YouTube stuff, man.

273
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,340
Oh, shit, this is really.

274
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,000
Hey, it's not about that, you assholes.

275
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,020
You got to do stuff for Dobbs.

276
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,840
You know, all that cheap, shitty copying and everything.

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,380
And those endless hours of bullshit on tape.

278
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,040
That's what made this church.

279
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,480
It was a participatory church.

280
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,420
And if you haven't figured that.

281
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,620
Get out.

282
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:01,220
All I have to say is, if you haven't gotten a fucking joke, you need to get off the goddamn

283
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,120
pot.

284
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,840
And with that, I will leave you with the words, repent, kill your boss, and fuck off.

285
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,920
This would be Popus Pantiera.

291
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,180


296
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,620
Hey, everybody.

297
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,060
How the fuck are you?

298
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,260
Before I start my very short rant, I have a rebuttal to G. Gordon Gordon and all the

299
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,360
whippersnappers that he thinks of it.

300
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,380
I have to remind him that at one point cassette tapes were newfangled technology, and so were

301
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,160
record players.

302
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
So was the wheel.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,420
And so was the wheel.

304
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:51,500
And so was the wheel.

305
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,220
And so was fire.

306
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,640
So there was always somebody about G. Gordon Gordon's age going, these fucking whippersnappers

307
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,480
don't know how to do anything right.

308
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,420
But that's beside the point.

309
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,980
I have a very short rant about what people like to call upward mobility.

310
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,520
So you think you're going up in the world, you get a better job, it pays about 50 cents

311
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,260
more per hour.

312
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,440
Which means you get...

313
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,600
I don't know, 50 bucks more an hour per week, which is great.

314
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,840
You think you're going up in life, right?

315
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,100
That's upward mobility, right?

316
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,640
That's what society says it is.

317
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,520
But life always has a way of taking away from you.

318
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,940
Like you get 50 extra bucks a week, that means you have to pay for your water bill now instead

319
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,840
of somebody else doing it for you.

320
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,820
And anyway, that's how they fuck you over.

321
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,160
They make you think you have to siphon a little bit more.

322
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,260
They make you think you have to pay for something else.

323
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,860
For better insurance.

324
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
For a new car.

325
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,260
You know, to keep up with the Jones.

326
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,720
That's how life siphons all your slack away.

327
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,800
And you see, things are never going to improve with a better job.

328
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,460
And you know why?

329
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,460
It's because every job has the same function.

330
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,420
No matter what you do, no matter how much you make, you're siphoning your slack into

331
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,420
time that you can never get better.

332
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,800
It's not yours.

333
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,240
It belongs to the conspiracy.

334
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,640
No matter what the fuck you're doing or how much you like it.

335
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,860
Yes, this is slack.

336
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,500
Are you an idiot?

337
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:43,120
You're siphoning your well-earned slack into the maw of the conspiracy when you work.

338
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,640
That's all you're doing.

339
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,280
It's been that way since we stopped hunting and gathering and started assigning classes.

340
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,980
There are clerics, there are kings, and there are peasants.

341
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,940
And that's how it's always been.

342
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,320
That's how it's always going to be.

343
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:05,580
Until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. when the fucking exes come down and kill everybody.

344
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,920
And we start hunting pink souls and gathering their skulls.

345
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,220
And that's why, unfortunately, I'm not going to be, I won't be able to stick around for

346
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,260
the, uh, for the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the,

347
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,280
uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, easily

348
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,820
damn right.

349
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,240
I

350
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,980
am unfit for a job that

351
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:31,980


352
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:31,980


353
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:31,980


354
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:31,980


355
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,420
a

356
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,420


357
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,420


358
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,420


359
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,420


360
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,620
uh,

361
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:45,040
s reduction off my value in what these kids did with their project.

362
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,740
Twenty-one and, um, 50 years ago, this war利

363
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,180
命

364
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,000
We're doctors.

365
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,720
We're doctors.

366
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,160
And slack.

367
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,440
We're doctors for Bob.

368
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,640
We're doctors.

369
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
We're doctors.

370
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,780
We're doctors.

371
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,120
We're doctors.

372
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


373
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


374
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


375
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


376
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


377
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


378
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


379
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


380
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


381
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,120


382
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,740
Bob needs a blowjob real bad to be resurrected from a man.

383
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,100
It has to be from a man.

384
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,820
It's not the sexual thing.

385
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,440
It's a ritualistic doctrine.

386
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,980
He did that with all of them.

387
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,220
Yeah, it's like balls touching.

388
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,940
It's not Gabe.

389
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,340
It's Bob.

390
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,520
Short rant.

391
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,480
Short rant.

392
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,920
Anyways, some people have been touching on this subject

393
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,260
a little bit.

394
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,760
Tonight.

395
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,540
But there have been, there just has been too much division in this church lately.

396
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,700
Why the fuck can't everybody just get along?

397
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,040
We're all a bunch of fucking kooks and weirdos anyways.

398
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,620
Why can't we all just recognize that?

399
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,400
Recognize all of our differences.

400
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,940
Celebrate them instead of turning our hate to each other.

401
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,240
Instead of the fucking pinks and the normals.

402
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,300
Because they're the ones that deserve our hate.

403
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,940
Am I right?

404
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,380
Pardon?

405
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,860
We can't be allowed to just get along!

406
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,060
See, there you go again.

407
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,280
You're causing division right now.

408
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,040
We're all banned.

409
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,400
We've all banned ourselves.

410
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,620
Through various things.

411
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,420
But we're still here but we're banned.

412
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,860
So what you're saying, Dillis, is basically that there's so much division in this church

413
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,580
so you're gonna tell them to fuck off so they'll be united against you?

414
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,440
Exactly.

415
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,640
Okay, I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

416
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,080
Okay.

417
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,760
I wasn't really going there but it works for me.

418
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,580
Okay, I'm glad.

419
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,260
Okay.

420
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm glad that works for you.

421
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
Because everything works.

422
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,680
Eventually.

423
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,640
Eventually.

424
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,400
Yes.

425
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,580
I don't know what the hell I'm doing now.

426
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,580
Well, you know, there's a difference.

427
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,700
Okay, so let's get this straight.

428
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,900
I'm gonna go through this really quick because I'm gonna summarize what we've heard on the stage so far.

429
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,320
I got it.

430
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,860
Go on.

431
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,240
Okay.

432
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,840
So.

433
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Here's the contrary point.

434
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,340
We have Bishop Stick who would like us all to get along and stop fucking each other over.

435
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,980
On the other hand, we have Gordon who wants us to hate everyone!

436
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,540
There is a common ground here and it's not so much a touchy-feely, lovey, squeezy,

437
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,920
hearts and teddy bears, my little pony world.

438
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,680
The truth is is that they are both right.

439
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,520
Gordon is exactly right.

440
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
You do need to hate more.

441
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,280
You need to hate.

442
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,380
The key is, brothers and sisters, is who you hate!

443
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,520
You and you and you and you and all of us have one thing in common.

444
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,240
We are subjugated!

445
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,060
We are subgeniuses!

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,440
And we are better!

447
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,720
Now, we are subgeniuses, we are better, we must have slack.

448
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,640
And we must not steal slack from other people.

449
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,460
And we are missing, sorely as Gordon pointed out, on one key principle.

450
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,200
I do not see enough hate!

451
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:57,940
And you may say, Priestess Pisces, you always seemed so sweetness and light.

452
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,720
That may be true, because you were my kind.

453
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,180
For now.

454
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,400
The truth of the matter is, is that we need more hate!

455
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,220
We need that hate!

456
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:19,380
So, I am going to lead you and rally you into a chant, hopefully, if you're not too fucking drunk.

457
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,740
So here we go!

458
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,740
I will start, and you will follow, unless you're too mentally retarded to do so.

459
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,860
Fuck the conspiracy!

460
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
Oh, come on, gruesome balls!

461
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,840
Fuck the conspiracy!

462
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,240
Fuck the conspiracy!

463
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,240
Fuck the conspiracy!

464
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,540
Kill the pigs!

465
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Kill the pigs!

466
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,440
Fuck the conspiracy!

467
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,580
Fuck the conspiracy!

468
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,040
Kill the pigs!

469
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,000
Kill the pigs!

470
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,140
Kill the pigs!

471
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,420
You're already confused!

472
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,640
This isn't that hard!

473
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,260
The world is about to end, brothers and sisters!

474
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,400
The world is about to end, and you are not prepared!

475
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,440
You are not prepared to have your hand on the trigger!

476
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:31,520
You are not ready to be the one to press that candy red button and watch them burn!

477
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,740
Are you too nice?

478
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:46,080
Are you too pussy to be the yeti, the uberman, the uberfem that you are?

479
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:53,540
Are you afraid to be the one to press that button?

480
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
Tell me, brothers and sisters!

481
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,180
Will you be manning the guns?

482
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,660
Or covering your ass?

483
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,120
Will you be blowing shit up?

484
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,440
Or blowing it off?

485
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,760
Will you be sucking up slack?

486
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,560
Or will you be sucking the cock of the conspiracy?

487
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,220
So before I turn it over to these wonderful musicians,

488
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,040
we're gonna do this one more time,

489
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,620
because I trust that there's still enough hate out there.

490
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,980
Remember, we have to.

491
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,100
We have to.

492
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,780
To keep doing this.

493
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,160
Ready?

494
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,460
Fuck the conspiracy!

495
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,980
Kill the pinks!

496
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,160
One more time!

497
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,900
Fuck the conspiracy!

498
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,200
Kill the pinks!

499
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,240
Thank you very much.

500
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,740
From PR News in Washington, I'm planning on fleeing to avoid prosecution.

501
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,960
President Obama goes on the attack against the state of Ohio.

502
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,540
He warned voters,

503
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,660
I don't need more workers and consumers and families.

504
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,080
So we don't need more insurance companies or oil companies.

505
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,700
We've tried it. It did not work.

506
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,200
President Obama continues to argue that President Obama's policies should have revved up PR's reports.

507
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,220
Quote,

508
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,440
What the meth wrote to once and last for the fight there without these fucking weenies.

509
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,000
Unquote.

510
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,260
Cambodian health officials are trying to find out the cause of a PR that has neurological symptoms.

511
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,940
After officials said, this is PR.

512
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,240
Thanks to Lee Murr for the new PR news.

513
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,400
On the jams we're playing tonight,

514
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,660
it was Bishop Stick on bass,

515
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,240
Reverend Suds Pasha on guitar,

516
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,420
Reverend Angry Larry on drums,

517
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,320
and Priestess Pisces making up vocals as she went along.

518
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,440
In fact, all of the music on these jam sessions is entirely improvised.

519
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:25,140
And Suds and Pisces had just been married to each other a few hours earlier.

520
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:32,040
Oh, and the guy ranting before Pisces led the hate chant was Reverend Dee Lister.

521
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:39,840
But for now, we'll go back in time just a few days to July 1st radio synesthesia

522
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,880
from WCSB Cleveland with Dr. Howe, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

523
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Dr. Zeronius on a very strange phone,

524
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,960
and host Dr. Sinister looking forward to the rupture.

525
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:03,120
We should be able to watch, say, for instance, the world ending in Australia on our TVs in Ohio.

526
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,760
By the same token, Zeronius and Todry in Portland would be able to watch

527
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,820
New York burn, for instance.

528
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,440
Right. And Ohio, of course.

529
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,280
Yeah, before it gets to them.

530
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,340
It's the party of the millennium.

531
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,800
And by the way, New York will burn.

532
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,120
It'll burn, friends, it'll burn!

533
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,940
Well, there's a show, right?

534
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,380
It will be purified.

535
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,160
It will be cleansed with the flay.

536
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,960
They're individually-discrafted, but they dock in the middle.

537
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,920
And they're parked in the same bay.

538
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,080
And the blood of the non-believers will flow with the blood of the non-believers.

539
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,940
Yeah, and when she wouldn't look,

540
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,220
that's not the entire freeway through Kansas onto her spacecraft.

541
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,660
Are we still there, Dr. Zeronius?

542
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,900
I wouldn't want her to miss out on that.

543
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,900
You can't hear me, can you?

544
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,000
I can hear you fine.

545
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,500
You're breaking up a little bit.

546
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,720
Todry is going to import the highway that runs through Kansas onto her escape.

547
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,340
Right.

548
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,680
I'm not going to get onto hers when she wasn't looking.

549
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,800
Oh, you were going to trick her.

550
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,880
Yeah.

551
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,000
So, yeah, I wouldn't want her to miss out on that.

552
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
That's like, that's like mine.

553
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,620
Are you going to have to put her in a cage or something?

554
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,580
That highway through Kansas is the Twilight Zone of legend.

555
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,020
Well, also, I just thought that Doc Zeronius was Dave.

556
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,140
I'm, I'm, I'm...

557
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,040
What a peculiar apprehension.

558
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm all confused.

559
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,700
Here, take his dress pin.

560
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,460
Perfectly ignored.

561
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,600
Perfectly ignored.

562
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,300
Normal reaction.

563
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,000
Nothing to be afraid of.

564
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,660
Unless you have a history of this in your family.

565
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,920
So they do have...

566
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,320
We do have individuated spacecraft, but they docked the setter.

567
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,020
Well, now I've heard this claim many times before, but what if you got to back it up?

568
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah, I don't know what that type.

569
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,500
I'll sit down and relax.

570
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,060
There's a long-distance document.

571
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,280
David Byrne, of course.

572
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,800
And, of course, nothing to prove.

573
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,040
Got the fax machine on here.

574
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,840
You know the number.

575
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,340
We'll take a look at this.

576
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,720
The hard part of all that is that it always requires proof, and then there we go again.

577
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,700
I know.

578
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,980
It's proof, and it's very, very difficult to maintain.

579
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,240
What is it?

580
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,580
And that's not really your problem anyway.

581
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,080
It's not?

582
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,300
I think it's everyone's problem, senor.

583
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,340
Now let's calm ourselves.

584
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm sure we can all come to some form of...

585
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,000
It's weird.

586
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,160
We don't have a microphone.

587
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,320
We don't have a microphone.

588
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,620
No problem.

589
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,980
We're getting a weird sound effect, Dr. Zeronius.

590
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,940
It sounds sort of like your compositions, in fact.

591
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,000
It sounds like it's phasing in and out of dimensions.

592
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,640
Messing with the microphone.

593
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,140
Is he doing that?

594
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,320
It's not on purpose this time.

595
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,460
It's not on purpose this time.

596
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,640
It's probably my attitude, and I didn't get much sleep tonight either.

597
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,960
And I'm using the Google instead of a phone phone.

598
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,300
Yeah, you do start...

599
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,240
You start blinking out of existence.

600
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,960
He's using a glue gun instead of a phone.

601
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
Or a glue-on gun.

602
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,060
I see.

603
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,080
Well, that's not everybody can...

604
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,580
Well, and every time lightning strikes between here and Portland, it breaks a...

605
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,760
It puts a hole in his sound.

606
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,680
All right.

607
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,680
We have three cats on the line at any given time, too.

608
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,340
There's a dead cat on the line.

609
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,200
Did you hear about the artificial brain that was made that immediately went and started

610
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,160
looking at cat videos?

611
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,080
Looking at what?

612
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,420
Brain.

613
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,960
They made an artificial intelligence and connected it to the internet, and it immediately

614
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,880
went to start looking at cat videos.

615
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,560
Kitty cat videos?

616
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,440
Yes.

617
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,740
It had a thing for felines?

618
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,780
Yes, the kitty porn.

619
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,160
For feline Americans.

620
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,220
Is that true?

621
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,440
Yes, cute kitty porn videos.

622
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,240
I can't pass pornography.

623
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,420
You know, America's appetite for this type of material is no longer...

624
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,060
Oh, man.

625
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,380
It's never been greater.

626
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,280
Everyone wants cute kitty antics to divert from the political spectacle.

627
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,520
Well, how is that much different from us liking dinosaurs?

628
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,160
You know, some people like kitty cats, simple, shallow people like kitty cats.

629
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:34,140
Heavy thinkers like to think about heavier animals, the blue whale.

630
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,140
Elephants.

631
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,860
Yeah, elephants, mammoths.

632
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,440
The great white.

633
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,220
That's irrelevant.

634
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,180
The great white.

635
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,220
Argentinosauruses.

636
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,340
Yes, the Argentinosaurus is the most interesting.

637
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,260
I get off thinking about very, very light animals.

638
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,620
Jellyfish.

639
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,120
Like polar bears wearing a bikini or something like that, or maybe a straight line shoe.

640
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,140
Or naked amoebas.

641
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,740
How about naked amoebas?

642
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,820
Now, that calls for some focus.

643
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,480
Did you know that...

644
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,120
I've seen a few videos of people who are not wearing a bikini.

645
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,120


646
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,860
They're wearing, they're wearing, they're wearing with those pie remains and much the same

647
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,100
way the gluons do when they forget to stick.

648
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,340
Is that a pseudo powder.

649
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,380
You're just have to see me.

650
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,340
I mean, whenever you look at something that's small, you're putting energy into that small

651
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,400
area and causing it to change.

652
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,280
Haven't you ever heard of what's his name?

653
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,200
Schrodinger.

654
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,480
Oh, yeah.

655
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,180
What's his name?

656
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,760
Schrodinger.

657
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,960
He had a cat too.

658
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,340
Oh, boy that kid.

659
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,500
.

660
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,700
He has two cats.

661
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,940
He has dead cat.

662
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,280
I can have dead cat and live cat.

663
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,540
Hmm.

664
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,300
Cats may not be very large, but they're very dense and...

665
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,280
see this one. You can

666
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,640
throw them very far.

667
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,400
I watched a cat

668
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
with milquetoast

669
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,040
exploring the top of a

670
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,020
transformer on top of a

671
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,660
power pole one time.

672
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,100
Just as we were about to say,

673
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,860
oh, how cute, it exploded.

674
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,400
It's a dead cat

675
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,120
on the line.

676
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,940
If your child

677
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,780
doesn't look like your child,

678
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,060
then there is a dead cat

679
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,260
on the line.

680
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,280
That's exactly what happened.

681
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,760
We couldn't find the evidence that it even

682
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
happened when we went to go look for

683
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,660
fur and stuff.

684
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,140
Nothing remained

685
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,520
as evidence that it

686
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,660
even happened. All our friends

687
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,040
were looking the other way.

688
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,980
That must have been its ninth life.

689
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,280
Otherwise, we would have found

690
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,260
another cat.

691
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,120
It was very

692
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,240
correctly. It was right as I said, oh, how

693
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,720
cute, I hope it doesn't

694
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,280
boom.

695
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,880
Yes.

696
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,740
Wow.

697
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,740
It was that was something else.

698
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,140
All right. So you guys remember

699
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,280
a little while ago when I told you I wasn't

700
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,840
going to do anything horrible to you tonight?

701
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,400
Well, I didn't

702
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,820
lie. I had a few more beers

703
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,440
and then I decided I was going to torture you all.

704
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,800
So I hope you're ready for the horror

705
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,920
because this is the worst piece of shit

706
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
I've ever read.

707
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,080
As long as it's

708
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,960
bloody and crap.

709
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,220
So, yeah, I'm going to read this horrible

710
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,980
piece of shit.

711
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,220
It was originally written by

712
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,500
Shel Silverstein.

713
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,160
And I got really bored one night.

714
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,900
So here it goes.

715
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,480
If you make it through this,

716
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,720
by the way, you get a window seat on the saucers.

717
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,320
Okay.

718
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
A long time ago when the earth was

719
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
green and there was more kinds of

720
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,820
subgeni than you've ever seen

721
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,120
and they run around free while

722
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,000
slack was still adorned.

723
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,400
They all rode around on magical

724
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,480
unicorns.

725
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,000
There was toothless teeters and random hippies.

726
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,380
There was phylos and nenslos and stangs and wees.

727
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,340
There was cats and rats and face fucking bats.

728
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,560
But as sure as you were born,

729
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,740
the slackest of all was the unicorn.

730
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,840
But Bob seen some conspiracy pink type of sin in

731
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,000
and it caused him to sigh.

732
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,680
He said, stand back.

733
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,440
I'm going to sell some stuff.

734
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,980
But first I must create a television of my own design.

735
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,620
He says,

736
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,540
I hear you Jehovah one.

737
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,580
What you're going to do?

738
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
I'm going to blow.

739
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm going to blow up all the pinks of the earth.

740
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,900
But before I do collect a small fee and I will send

741
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,320
pleasure saucers for you.

742
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,020
The Yetis and unicorns too.

743
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,620
You must take two blow up dolls and a lot of anal ease.

744
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,640
But no matter what you do,

745
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,920
Bob, do not forget the phylos and nenslos and stangs and wees.

746
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,940
Take two ended dildos and all kinds of space porn.

747
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,860
But as sure as you're the milk man's illegitimate firstborn,

748
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,060
if you mess this up,

749
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,720
Bob, you won't get any more damn unicorns.

750
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,080
Now Bob was there.

751
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,320
He answered the Colin.

752
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,000
He's sold everyone eternal salvation.

753
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,240
All of a sudden with a firm Uber femme tone,

754
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,540
Connie shouted,

755
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,260
it's almost 7am the sky is going to start falling.

756
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,920
He marched in the subgenie two by two and he called out as they went to bed.

757
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:02,920


758
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:10,520
through. Hey, Jehovah One, I got your toothless teeters and random hippies, phylos and nenslos

759
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,600
and stangs and wheeze. I got your cats and rats and face-fucking-bats. Got your two blow-up dolls

760
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:24,880
and a lot of analese. I even got your two-ended dildos and all kinds of space porn. But my new

761
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,560
pleasure saucer overlord, I'm so forlorn cause I just don't see no unicorn.

762
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,500
Old Bob looked out through the frop-induced haze, but the unicorns were hiding and playing

763
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,080
silly games. They were kicking and splashing, enjoying the first buzz of the morn. Oh, them

764
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:53,020
silly unicorn. Then the legumes started preaching and the stangs started stanging. The two beans

765
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:59,520
started trolling and the earth started shaking. The big-breasted goddesses started squeaking and

766
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,520
yeti started roaring. And everyone's aboard,

767
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:10,380
but the unicorn. I mean the suds for Shaw and the priestess Pisces, the sternos and Papa Joes,

768
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:19,320
and a full fleet of extremely dumb-ass Bobbies. Bob cried, close the door, the clock is a-ticking.

769
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:27,880
It's almost 7.01 and we just can't wait for them unicorn. Then the saucers started moving and it

770
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,580
drifted towards the skies. And the unicorns looked up from the rock and cried.

771
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,760
And the earth started burning as we floated away. And from that moment on, unicorns were

772
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,640
eternally banned from X-Day. Praise Bob.

773
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,560
And the other rangers.

774
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,260
So

775
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,800
that was Reverend Pock.

776
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,800
Thank you.

777
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:09,560
And now and forever back to 50 Next Day Drill and the improv jams from July 4th with the band we like to call

778
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,600
Several Fisted Tales of Connie and a Pisces song about pink girls.

779
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:02,180
Jenny said that I don't particularly like those types of girls.

780
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,200
And that's Mary must be on here when she affectionately does .

781
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,200


782
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,200


783
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,540
And Jenny applied to the Marshall High School and fainted.

784
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:08,220
And Jenny said that she thought that going to the mall was fabulous.

785
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,760
And Jenny said that she felt that boy should be nicer to her, gives her strength.

786
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,540
That she was definitely going to the nightclub.

787
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:32,300
But you don't have to

788
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,980
to me, you know?

789
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,280
I just wish you were

790
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,800
a little more pretty.

791
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,400
A little more

792
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,580
skinny.

793
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,200
Have you tried

794
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,900
the new Cover

795
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,340
Girl Foundation?

796
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,140
I hear there's a

797
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,400
sale on at the Gap.

798
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,240
Betty can't understand why I don't give a

799
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,100
flying fuck about

800
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,480
that.

801
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,320
Nothing worse in this world

802
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,620
than a paint girl.

803
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,940
Nothing worse in this world

804
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,180
than a paint

805
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,480
girl.

806
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,320
Debbie said to me,

807
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,060
she said, I don't want you

808
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,200
talking to

809
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,380
her. And Debbie

810
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,420
said to me, I don't think I like

811
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,700
the cut of your jib.

812
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,660
And Debbie said to me,

813
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,220
I'm going to have to go to the

814
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,660
church. I'm going to kick your ass if you start

815
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,480
shit with me.

816
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,080
But that's

817
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,200
not what Debbie did.

818
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,420
And then Jessica said, you know,

819
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,980
I don't, why do

820
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,960
people get tattoos?

821
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,560
And then Jessica said to me,

822
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,940
why don't you go to church like everyone

823
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,340
else does on Sunday?

824
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,100
But I don't.

825
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:30,980
And neither do you.

826
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,700
And boys, I've got a message for you.

827
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,900
You've got a choice in this world,

828
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,040
boys, and I know there's not a lot

829
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,760
of us superfims around, but

830
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,940
if these

831
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,220
paint girls bug me,

832
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,920
even half as much as they

833
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,040
bug you, they're not

834
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,780
worth the time.

835
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,740
Do not

836
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,520
put

837
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,380
your

838
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,700
wang in pink snatch.

839
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,100
Fuck the paint girls.

840
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,420
And fuck the pink boys.

841
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,040
They're nothing more than conspiracy toys.

842
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,380
So don't

843
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,740
even think about

844
00:45:59,740 --> 00:45:59,740


845
00:45:59,740 --> 00:45:59,740


846
00:45:59,740 --> 00:45:59,800
jerks

847
00:45:59,800 --> 00:45:59,800


848
00:45:59,800 --> 00:45:59,800


849
00:45:59,800 --> 00:45:59,800


850
00:45:59,800 --> 00:45:59,800


851
00:45:59,800 --> 00:45:59,820
huefuch

852
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,200
por

853
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,520
the

854
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,260
believe

855
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,060
that

856
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,080
We'll be right back.

857
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,100
We'll be right back.

858
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:11,720
We'll be right back.

859
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,140
I miss everybody.

860
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,240
Me and Reverend Lucy Van Pelt, we miss everybody.

861
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,280
We missed it last year, but we're here this year.

862
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:47,740
And it's great to be able to tell people that we come on out to, like, a family reunion of, like, 150, 200 people.

863
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,860
So it's awesome.

864
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,680
Thank you.

865
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,100
All right, everybody.

866
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,560
This has been awesome.

867
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,460
We are the Mutant Mount Boys.

868
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,040
We've got one more soon for you today.

869
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:11,240
This is a praise to Bob's song, and it's also another praise to Devo, the De-Evolutionary Band.

870
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,920
May your records be unbroken.

871
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,240
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

872
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,240
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

873
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:40,340
There's a vine of heaven waiting in the sky.

874
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,020
Bob in the sky.

875
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,820
Well, I played the beast in BP.

876
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,820
One bright and sunny day.

877
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:09,740
When I finished listening to it, I put on some Q&A.

878
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,960
My turntable started jumping.

879
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,920
What it did, I know not how.

880
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,620
Oh, yeah, Bob knows how I cried.

881
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,340
Oh, when it scratched my...

882
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,960
You can sing it.

883
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,960
May your records be unbroken.

884
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,640
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

885
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,240
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

886
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:51,240
There's a vine of heaven waiting in the sky.

887
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,860
Bob in the sky.

888
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,680
Well, I bought a second coffee.

889
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,560
Listen through red eye express

890
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:11,460
When my girlfriend came on to me

891
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,420
She started taking off her dress

892
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,780
Oh yes, with come hither

893
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,540
I she called me

894
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:26,260
In a sweet and sultry voice

895
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,780
I just told her

896
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,280
Gotta wait now, girl

897
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,300
I'm listening to freedom of choice

898
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,420
Come on, may your records

899
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,120
Be unbroken

900
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,120
By and by, by, by and by

901
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,260
There's a bottle

902
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,880
Never wears it

903
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,140
And I scared

904
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:56,240
And I scared

905
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,260
By and by, by and by

906
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:58,840
The sky

907
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,620
The sky

908
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:47,440
Well, I know I've been a sinner

909
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,180
Gave my life that evil twist

910
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:58,160
Gotta say I ain't no criminal

911
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,260
I'm a Christian child, cause I'm a new traditionalist.

912
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:13,500
When I hear that truth evolving, oh no, I never stop.

913
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:24,100
Cause my heart is never gladder than when I shout that name above.

914
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:35,140
Cause may your records be unbroken by and by, by and by.

915
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:45,740
There's a vital heaven waiting in the sky, in the sky.

916
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:53,160
Now I know I ain't no youngin'.

917
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,800
One day I'm gonna be old.

918
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,760
Got that total evil feelin'.

919
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,880
And now it can't be told.

920
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,000
But I got my high five, got my jukebox.

921
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,460
Got my albums in my lap.

922
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:30,700
Should I ever lose my way now, Bobby?

923
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,220
Well, I got smooth noodle maps.

924
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:45,020
Oh, hey, may your records be unbroken by and by, by and by.

925
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:54,080
There's a vital heaven waiting in the sky, in the sky.

926
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,020
One more time.

927
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:06,460
May your records be unbroken by and by, by and by.

928
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:19,240
Cause there's something for everybody in the sky.

929
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,380
Bobby.

930
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,720
Bobby.

931
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,280
Bobby.

932
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,080
Bobby.

933
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,080


934
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,080


935
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,080


936
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,080


937
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,560
Yeah.

938
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,140
Yeah.

939
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,700
All right.

940
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,760
Peace.

941
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,260
Peace.

942
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,940
Friends, when was the last time we had for real gospel music here?

943
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,420
I don't remember.

944
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:54,420


945
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,660
It was on the new year's day.

946
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:54,660


947
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,460
I want to ask you.

948
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,120
Well, last night.

949
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,680
No, no, I, I.

950
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,420
If we might have had some but I don't remember.

951
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:10,840
That was a spirit filled, holy ghost pipe smoking, hymn singing, B-vival if you ask

952
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,080
me.

953
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,780
I'd say that's your 35 bucks worth right there.

954
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,740
We can all go home now.

955
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:16,960
Bye.

956
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,080
Friends, stick around because it gets $1,000 worth of music.

957
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


958
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


959
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


960
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


961
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


962
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


963
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,080


964
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,480
We're going to the next.

965
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,120
A billion times worse.

966
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,440
Which is easily said because they're pretty good.

967
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
Now there's a lot of questions about the schedule.

968
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:39,740
The most common one, I have to admit, was what's the supri- special surprise guest.

969
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,620
Hey, welcome to the story.

970
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,120
Good to be here with all y'all tonight.

971
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,060
Good to see you.

972
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


973
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


974
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


975
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


976
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


977
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


978
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


979
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


980
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


981
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


982
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,060


983
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,020
This is fine.

984
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:32,720
Gone to paradise on that bright of a side July day

985
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:43,300
When those soldiers' flags don't get in my way

986
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,660
Regrets I never knew

987
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,680
But by the celling

988
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,340
I am mine

989
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:59,680
I do what I want to do

990
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:05,620
And I won't be stopped by dying

991
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,220
I walked the crooked road

992
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:15,980
And now I've taken to the skyway

993
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:20,940
And more, much more than this

994
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,420
I did it my way

995
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,140
Yes, there were times

996
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,140
I blew my loose

997
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,600
Here in this church

998
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,180
With ill repute

999
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,060
But through it all

1000
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,560
When the pigs were down

1001
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,260
I chewed them up

1002
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,780
And crapped them out

1003
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,520
I faced them all

1004
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,120
With iron balls

1005
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,520
And did it my way

1006
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,840
They'll beg me for their lives

1007
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,200
And I will say

1008
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,200
Not in a shy way

1009
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,140
There's no mercy in me

1010
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,840
I'm gonna do

1011
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,240
What I do my way

1012
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,780
I gave my cash to Bob

1013
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,940
I paid my time

1014
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,620
I paid my ticket

1015
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,120
I'll ask that those pink sloths

1016
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,840
Make it a limit

1017
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,820
For what is a man

1018
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,480
What has he got

1019
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,220
If not his sleigh?

1020
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,660
Then he'll be sure to say

1021
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,880
I'm disappears

1022
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,720
And sorry to say

1023
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:06,580
So I'm leaving

1024
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:06,620
Hope you listened

1025
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,860
If you play along

1026
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,820
Annoyed

1027
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,460
But when you won't

1028
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:14,460


1029
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:14,460


1030
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,060
Your mind

1031
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,060


1032
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,060


1033
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:29,880
I paid my dough, I paid my dough, and it is my way.

1034
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,840
Elvis has left the building.

1035
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,000
Sire, there is no more money.

1036
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,460
We gotta get some money.

1037
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,660
That dirty, perky, shark-a-pack, black-a-wattin',

1038
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,980
fill-a-buck-a-burton, perkaluma-burton,

1039
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,040
dirtin' buster-knife.

1040
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,180
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1041
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,700
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1042
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,040
to help us keep on going for another couple of weeks.

1043
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:22,520
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1044
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,060
But if you truly love Bob,

1045
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,620
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1046
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,540
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1047
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,100
or especially the radio page,

1048
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,140
or the catalog store pages,

1049
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,460
and help out financially as best you can.

1050
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,800
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1051
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,800
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1052
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,040
to make us feel like we're the only ones who can help.

1053
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,460
We want to make our own situations worse.

1054
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,420
But some of you still have jobs.

1055
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,740
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1056
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,300
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1057
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,660
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1058
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,020
All we're saying is that

1059
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,640
blowjobs could go the way of stevejobs

1060
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,200
if you don't pay dogs.

1061
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,080
We also take checks and money orders to

1062
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,160
subgeniusfoundation.com

1063
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:16,320
and we'll be back with more of the best of the best.

1064
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,320


1065
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,320


1066
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:27,440
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1067
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,680
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1068
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:42,160
You ain't got no money to take your broke ass home

1069
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,880
You ain't got no money to take your broke ass home

1070
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,660
You ain't got no money to take your broke ass home

1071
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,520
You ain't got no money to take your broke ass home

1072
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,000
Sex, money, Bob!

1073
