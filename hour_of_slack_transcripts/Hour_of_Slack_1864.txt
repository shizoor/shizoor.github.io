I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean father Slack.
I'm so curious.
I'm so curious.
I'm so curious.
I'm so curious.
I'm so curious.
I'm so curious.
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election,
and this is the hour of Slack in Dallas, Texas.
You know, I know where that is.
Coming up on your morning show.
On your morning station, it's the hour of Slack drive-by comedy hour.
Once again, your wacky hosts Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave
help ease your morning commute with a fun-filled hour of classic rock, laughs, and trivia
where you can win fabulous prizes.
So stay tuned to your classic rock station coming up right after this.
Goodbye, Earth.
Good morning, Planet X.
Good morning, Planet X.
Say your prayers, little one.
Don't forget my son to include everyone.
I tuck you in, warm within.
Keep you free from sin till the Sandman he comes.
Sleep with one eye open.
Rip in your pillow tight.
Eggs and lights.
Enter night.
Take my hand.
We're off to Never Never Land.
It's so crazy about Bob.
Everybody in here is so crazy about Bob.
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.
All of the religions will be having a heart attack.
A pipe full of frog equals what?
A lot of slack.
No matter how you kill him, he always keeps coming back.
Bob.
I'm talking about you.

You thousands of bucks!
And don't expect wickedly bad guys like me to come back alive first time.
Don't tell me you haven't no idea what that blind dog pint is.
I also don't get surprised when a guy in play costs 1-1-0 in the mitzvah.


Fisherman.
You're classified as anêus?
Bob.
Full of Roundfighting.
Full of cribs.
Lynn of the Lawless divertments.


Fear of provisional development control. Fear of going disguised to a CGI suff.
And this guy's keep looking to the skies
At the saucers flying by
And maybe by and by
You will see the light at the end of the pipe
That leads to Bob Dobbs
Bob Dobbs
Talking about the salesman
To the gods
He's still in check of the coffin lid
On a conspiracy of normality
Oh, who could it be but Bob?
Oh, who could it be but Bob?
Crazy about Bob
Cause I looked deep into his eyes
Saw the dots littering
Soon I was hypnotized
Now there is no difference between two divides
The rich became the beggar
And the fool became the wise
Cause it's a way out, far out
Psychedelic freak out
Took a hit at Bob
I'm starting to freak out
Geek out
Bob Dobbs
My prince, I gotta look out
Look out everyone
Here he comes
It's Bob
Bob Dobbs
Bob Dobbs
Look out
Here he comes

You wish you could forget

Come on, Bob.
Come on in.
And the worst thing was I got a little angel baby hair in my spaghetti.
That was the worst thing.
I had angel baby hair in my spaghetti.
And once I get to my spaghetti, I start to get a little noodley, you know.
I hate that.
I hate to feel noodley.
You know, once you run around here along the sun, you just can't.
A little too long, you just get noodley, you know.
You start to hang out a little too long.
And noodle, noodle starts to noodle.
That's a sad day.
I hate it when my little noodley starts to fart along.
Yes.
So I try to.
I try to.
Rub things on it.
And a little baby toes.
A little baby toes all over the tent, too.
And there's one right up there, Bob.
Who's there?
Right up on the sleeve of the shirt of the jacket of the tent.
On the sleeve of the shirt of the tangly bag.
Okay.
And now I want you to gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.
Bob?
I'm so sorry.
I might not know if you have been to books now, but if not...
Three days at a time.

I have to let the bad news stay with you and you don't know what I'm up to.

Probably because I hate it when these things happen.

Just keep getting better and better and better.

And you're too scared now.

But at the moment, you can breathe all you want.
Because I love pigs out there.
It's love.






It's love to life.
It's love to life.

Wife, don't want no nine to five
I want a life, don't want no babies
Don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five
I want a life
People say that I gotta grow up
Hey, get into the younger men, I gotta settle down
Find a wife and make me a move to the white-brained part of town
Boy, do the job of working for the men when they don't really appreciate you
I'll surely go watching the fat on the back when your heart gives a liver of bruise
And I don't want no babies, don't want no wife
Don't want no nine to five, I want a life
Don't want no babies, don't want no wife
Don't want no nine to five, I want a life
Cause I love to play music, love to make music
Love to make money, love to meet women
Is that so funny?
Love to play music, love to make money
Love to meet women, is that so funny?
No!
People say I gotta grow up, I ain't getting any younger
And I gotta settle down
Find a wife, I'll make a move to

I'll surely go watching the fat on the back when your heart gives a liver of bruise

Thousands will die by starvation, riots, or even their own hand.
This is the sort of depression that destroys the faith of a people and their nation.
The sort of depression that does not make one stronger from the great challenge it brings,
but rather weaker.
I stand before you today with a message born not of hope, but of despair.
Yes, misery awaits us all, and there's nothing we can do to avert this grim fate.
This economic depression is far too great for any of us to overcome,
and there is nothing left for America to do but suffer.
All is lost. The situation is hopeless.
Yes, we as a nation,
are doomed.
Doomed.
Doomed.
Doomed.
Next song.
Ah yes, took a little while until we found something that was, uh,
how shall I say, more spiritually enlightening
to our, uh, to our, uh, general atmosphere of, uh, new reality.
Ah.
Ah.


I don't know the title for this song.
Andrew, I'm sure will write it down on the tape afterwards.
But here we go.
I try, try fear.
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hello, boys and girls, and snuggles.
Love you, Robin.

And really fuzzy.

Everywhere?
Oh, look!
There's a fuzzy bear.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.

Everybody be happy.
Our house.
Cotton candy and clowns.
Balloons flying in the sky.
Ha-ha.
Everybody be happy.
Everybody be happy.
Everybody be happy.




Don't question how or why.
Happiness is a good story.
Sadness is a sin.
Don't be ugly.
Be cute and snuggly.
Ha-ha-ha.
Be fuzzy.
Buries in.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
This is not cool here.
Coming down.
Real cuteness is what I want.
Must be cute.
Don't be scary.
Gotta be hairy.
Don't be hairy.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Happiness is mandatory.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

















He knows that and be true to the story Happiness is mandatory
Do you feel cute? Well do ya, punk?
Oh look at my fluffy tail. Oh it's so fluffy and it's got me
And everyone must be cute. Everyone must be cute
Our cute people must be obeyed
Our uncute people must be destroyed
The final solution to ugliness will be
Cute? Why is it cute?
Cute! We must have big bright eyes
We must all be cute
We must all look up in the sky and see the white fluffy clouds
I'm cute
You're cute
We're all cute

Keeping a close eye
On the back beat and force

Making sure the trains

Then I looked off into the cold distance
And what did I see
Looked like one solitary headlight
Coming after me

With his eyes on me
Coming to take me away

Heal to Bob
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob
Bob is a rock and Bob is a tree
Bob is a bear and Bob is a bee
Bob is truth and Bob is lies
Bob.
Cakes and fruits and pies
Bob's my hassle
Bob's my watch
Bob's my sandwich
Bob's my crotch
Bob's my toothpick
Bob's my brain
Bob's an ugly yellow stain
Bob's a cactus
Bob's an itch
Bob is take off every stitch
Bob's my master
Bob's my slave
Bob will rob me
Bob will save
Bob's my toaster
Bob's my fridge
Bob's my little sister
Mitch
Bob will cost you
Bob is free
Bob's the lock
And Bob's the key
In short, Bob is the man
Who used your leg as a frying pan
If your mind is a jar
You can pour it out of the sink
And the subgenius church
Is the missing link
Jump! Jump off the door!
Rebirth!
Because Bob is the future!
Woo!
Come on you lazy ass
Jump!
Bob!
You can see the future
It surrounds you
And it surrounds the imagery
In the church
Bob is the industrial information
And quantum revolution
Bob is the color of the future
What color is the future?
Bob is the bright refraction
Of the quantum field around us
It's because Bob has slack
So he can't be a man
Slack is the quantum field!
And that's why I'm on my knees praying now
Praying here before Bob
Because I am Bob
You know and that's the odd thing
Is because you know
I don't know if my mom was raped
By a parapaetic man with blonde hair
Who was delivering the milk
Pounding the milk
Getting a little hard
But you know but there it was
And I just came
And I just came again
And I just keep coming
I can't help
I can't help but come here
It's a special thing
Hallelujah brother!
And Bob is going to lead us into the future
Bob is going to be the next revolution
Bob is going to be the nanotech revolution
The quantum revolution
The spiritual revolution!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

Woo!
Woo!
Alright!
Yeah!
All these dot coms that you see
There's only one dot com that matters
And that is

So what does this all have to do with you?
Well you guys
You're yetis!
You are the future!
You have to use that quantum field for your future
You guys have to make the apocalypse happen
You have to make the apocalypse happen
The more you're yourself
The faster the apocalypse will come

My shoes got cow stuff on them.
It's the way conspiracy works, friends.
And conspiracy creeps into every human endeavor
by nature of humanity.
That's why we just try to say,
well, screw the humans.
We're subgeniuses.
We're different.
Subgenius can be any age, any size, shape, color,
can be from any background, any nationality,
any damn planet or species.
We don't care as long as they have
the fragment of Bob consciousness
and have sent $30 to P.O. Box 1436,
Dallas, Texas, and my P.O. Box.
Ah, yes, friends.
You can be saved even if it kills you.
And that's how much Bob loves you, friends.
He will kill you to save you
because, you know, once you're saved,
Bob, you never really die.
You know his old saying.
You know what Bob offers?
His most famous discovery.
Eternal salvation
or triple your money back.
What other words it offers that, friends?
If you don't live forever,
you get your money back.
A perfect, perfect formula
for belief and love
and slack.
And slack, whatever that is.
Slack for me would be to shut up for a minute.
Oh, it's been a long day.
Someday the exodus will come.
Bob's promise will come true.
Our alien benefactors will give us our own planets
and we will be able to create
the 25-hour day,
the 26-hour day,
the Martian time slip,
the day that lasts forever,
the night that never ends here,
friends.
The night that smells like cinnamon for three days
and then it smells like epoxy the next three days.
Any planet you want.
The most bizarre, outlandish things you can imagine
could come physically, literally true.
You better hope you have a pure mind
when that happens.
You better hope that you aren't thinking
real paranoid bad thoughts
in the back of your mind
at the moment when every wish can come true.
You better hope that you really have some good wishes.

chasing your head
and so you can't be constantly thinking about
how you're gonna get back at that conspiracy bastard
or so forth.
Friends, you gotta just learn to rise above it.
Time control is what Bob has been preaching all along.
And unfortunately, until we get the time machines working,
the only true form of time control available to us
is that boring virtue called patience.
And that's why you need to remember about the funny little monkey.
Because otherwise, it's so easy to lose patience with them.
And God knows, only Bob stands between most of us
and us becoming mad serial killers,
machine gunning entire McDonald's full of pink boys
out of their smugness.

oh,
he laughs upon what you feed, he laughs upon his feet, he laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street,
he never can stop laughing, he laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street,
he laughs at everybody when he's running, he says he's never cried, but once he did arrest a man, and laughed until he cried out.

laughs

His jolly face it wrinkled, and then he shut his eyes
He opened his great mouth, and was a wondrous sight
He said, I must arrest you, he didn't know what for
And then he started laughing, and then he dragged his jaw
So if you chance to meet him, when walking round the town
Just shake him by his fat old hand
And give him half a kiss
And then you'll start him laughing with all his best in mind
But really y'all, I kinda liked it

I got a comment in the background.
Ego Plum.
Well, once was a man.
The world's greatest salesman.
And he had devised a plan
to get the shackles from my feet.
Here I am, oh now he's gone
A martyr for the cause of his father
And he's coming again
Who knew that the first shot
Was gonna be the last shot
But he's got a hard driving pipe
The gas smoke all through the night
And although he may be hurting
The universe will keep on squirting
All the fun, oh
And he's coming again
He can save us from the men in black
With just a shot from his mighty sack
If only he could make it back
From the land of the dead
But until that happy day
We can only drink and say
Father's my Lord
And he's coming again
I know he can make it
Without him we can't take it
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the whims
Until the day that he comes back
It'll be over
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the whims
Until the day that he comes back
And he's coming again
Father's my Lord
Father's my Lord
Father's my Lord
Father's my Lord

Father's my Lord
And he's coming again
And if we don't want the exits upon us
And if we don't want the exits upon us
Then we need Bob to be on his part
Then we need Bob to be on his part
Then we need Bob to be on his part
Then Bob is my Lord
Then Bob is my Lord
Then Bob is my Lord
Bob is my Lord
And he's coming again
Great God is coming
So bring my death
Again
Wow!
Praise Pope Bob!

This is an epistle from the Reverend David Lee Black
The Reverend David Lee Black
I don't believe this
Read the first and last paragraph
Dear fellow subgeni
The evil forces of anti-slack that prevent me from going to America
Are the very same ones that prevent me from being with my brothers and sisters of slack on X Day in Brushwood
Subsequently
I think he meant consequently
Subsequently
I must have my own X Day in Kiel, Germany with my brothers and sisters of slack here
There's nothing
I mean nothing
That will stop me from getting on board the intergalactic love ships
On Wednesday the 5th of July
And being with the rest of you
Not the DEA
Not Janet Cujo Reno
Not Bill Clinton and his hordes of concubines
Not customs
Not even Mulder and Scully and the reanimated corpse of J. Edgar Hoover
Could stop me when that platform lowers
The red carpet rolls out
And I'm carried on board in a throne like an African chieftain
By my leather clad alien love slaves of the cosmos
I had a dream the other night
Which makes me believe this year is the year
One of the love goddesses came to me in a dream
Like a space cherub loved succubus
She floated through the air and revealed to me a divine revelation
Which I make known to you now
On her right leg and left leg there were ten holes
And a piece in the middle there were three
And in the middle there were three holes
She could suckle
Twenty-three
Which is the number of the illuminated
She took my hand and we floated up to the heavens
The pills are kicking in about this part in the epiphany
A-bom-a-ged-i
And anyway he foresees a battle of Armageddon
Where the demonic forces which you guys were talking about
Which have enslaved the human race
With the yoke of bad television
And have sold them sportswear, media-induced self-conceit
Landmines and cheap adrenaline-producing drugs
To then herd their unwitting victims into soccer stadiums
And pop-star concert halls
Only to farm their pain and misery
To feed its insatiable appetite
For hurt and suffering
Have finally realized that the exes know about their evil intentions
To make hostile bids for benign alien space corporations
Only to peddle their superficial cheapness
Of the evil of the universe
Hollywood black magic and so space mines
So they can create a hell in space
The intergalactic federation of alien races
Which currently live in peace and harmony
Will not tolerate their universal garden of Eden
To be invaded by the evil monkey-snake god of earth
The evil demon monkey-snake god
Who will replace all the stars with poison apples
And sell fig leaves to the goddesses
Who have 23 holes
This is all black all right
As I looked down into earth
I saw the saucers hovering over brushwood
Lemuria and Kiel
I saw smaller craft hovering over several other locations
Where subgenius ministers who are rich in slack
But poor in human money supposedly reside
I could see the masses of the illuminated
With their suitcases of cool
Boarding the saucers of love, hope and happiness
As they did the armies of earth
Scrambled to destroy the invading love ships
Of the sex goddesses
The very threat to their existence
Then it was the great and final war
As the last space saucer
Sex space saucer lifted high into the heavens
I could see great war begin
The navies and air armadas
With their rapid response forces scrambling to attack
I could hear the sirens of war around the planet wailing
Heralding the inescapably impending doom
That awaited citizens of this sinking battleship
Of hate, war and misery
But the great armies of earth didn't battle with the stars
But the star cruisers of the love goddesses
They battled with themselves
They battled with each other
For the right to battle with the invading saucers of slack
Hovering above the planet as it burned
I could hear the screams of billions of human souls
Who weren't lucky enough to get off this planet with the chosen ones
The alien sex goddesses took my hand again
And floated with me back down to earth
To my bed
Back to my alcoholic narcosa
And so I awakened with this revelation I now give
And with this revelation I also send the symbolic other half
In the form of a cake
I want Stang to have everyone line up for this cake
To be ritualistically served as communion of slack
For all at Hex Day in Brushwood
Make sure Nikki Death Chick gets a big piece
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her
Truly love you all

Your brother and his henchw Firth

My dongs
YourORA
My dongs
To be Born
Dear penis
I don't know what you wanna sell

I don't think I like you anymore
You used to watch me shave
Now all you do is stare at the floor
Oh dear penis
I don't like you anymore
It used to be you and me
A paper towel and a dirty magazine
That's all we needed to get by
Now it seems things have changed
I think that you're the one to blame
Dear penis
I don't like you anymore
Now he sings
Dear Rodney
I don't think I like you anymore
Cause when you get to drinking
You put me places I've never been before
Dear Rodney
I don't like you anymore
Why can't we just get a grip
On our man-to-man relationship
Come to terms with truly how we feel
If we put our heads together
We'd just stay home forever
Dear penis
I think I like you after all
Oh and Rodney
While you're shaving
Shave my balls
Laughter
Applause
