1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:14,340
Uh, hello Bob, and yes dear friends, it is 1997, but you're about to listen to Hour of Slack, number 75, from 1987.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,280
Praise Bob.

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:28,680
Praise Bob. Oh yes, dear friends, this is Li Biqin, a Chinese subgenius, and you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,220
Be calm, be calm.

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,380
Be calm, be calm.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,380
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,520
Hour of Slack. Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,780
Come on.

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:13,240
Verse zou.

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,120
What?

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,620
Wow.

12
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,100
That's more words than a bridge.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:30,000
el

14
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,160
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,660
He is a child just like in America.

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,960
And people need slack.

17
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,840
In Chinese, we call slack .

18
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,580
But it must be true slack, not the bad slack of the conspiracy.

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,220
Please, Bob, help me somebody.

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Bob!

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
Eternal salvation.

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,640
Or triple your money back.

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,960
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

24
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,180
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

25
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,960
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,200
Thank you.

27
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,540
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks

28
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,740
and brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,060
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,300
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,780
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,080
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Right, Bob?

34
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,520
Bob?

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,180
Bob?

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,360
Bob?

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,360
Bob?

38
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:00,800
Bob?

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,500
Bob?

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Bob?

41
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


42
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


45
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


47
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


52
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,060


54
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,220
Break out of that glass box and join the Church of the Subgenius.

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,200
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, we must be

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,600
prepared to face the worst of the worst.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
In the midst of a world of chaos, anything is likely to develop.

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,640
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, billing itself as the weirdest cult on Earth.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,360
What do they believe in?

60
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,040
Everything.

61
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,660
Who do they believe in?

62
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,980
A mysterious character named Bob.

63
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,120
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,860
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

65
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,420
And to you, young man.

66
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,300
This is a church that does not play games.

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,740
The other churches talk about love.

68
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,800
And think hate.

69
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,460
The other churches do not talk about money.

70
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,880
They take your money.

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,700
You don't see the gold-plated temples in the Church of Bob.

72
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,180
You don't see Cadillac convertibles in the Church of Bob.

73
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,180
You don't see Jensen interceptors in the parking lot of Bob.

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,360
You see slack-filled smiling faces in the tabernacle of the Bob.

75
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Bob founded the church mainly to help unmask the conspiracy.

76
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,640
And we're talking about the conspiracy.

77
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,880
What's next?

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,500
Just believe in the power of the dogs.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,420
I believe.

80
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,060
Believe in Bob.

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,720
I believe.

82
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,220
Reach out for him.

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,220
I'm reaching.

84
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,120
Feel the healing power.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,520
I think you killed him.

86
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,020
See, there you go.

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,860
See, now, do you remember anything?

88
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,400
Does it hurt?

89
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,580
No.

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,460
See, no problem.

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,220
No problem with Bob, right?

92
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,840
Yeah!

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,720
Right!

94
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,680
You midnight rams.

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
All right.

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,620
When are the midnight rams?

97
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,620


98
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,620


99
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,620


100
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,620


101
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,620


102
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,620


103
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,620
I don't mean just black nights.

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,380
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

105
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,760
Our midnight rams.

106
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,440
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher in Dallas, Texas.

107
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
And he's a good man.

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,580
Except that he don't buy me two glasses of Fitcher's beer.

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,600
And I said, I love you.

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,600


111
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,800
I love you, boy.

112
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,360
And I'm going to tell you, if I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

113
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,840
All right, man!

114
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,080
He can't whoop it!

115
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,140
He's going down.

116
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,860
Ae, ae, ae, ae!

117
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,560
It's just miracle wisdom coming through from me.

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Oh, yeah.

119
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:45,600
We may find only the intergalactic silences, or we may encounter intelligences greater

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,320
than our own, answers to questions we cannot even formulate today.

121
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,800
.

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:04,900
Or the pioneers, traveling or falling between fire and darkness, between freezing and burning, may sense that we live only on the narrowest of margins.

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,500
Snowflakes, condensed momentarily out of the great snowstorms and firestorms of matter in space.

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,240
The Earth is a planet that has not had much time left.

125
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,880
The date that Bob has set is, uh, I mean, he's not trying to do this. This isn't something he wants to do.

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,840
But, uh,

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,440
so,

128
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,580


129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,140
seven o'clock in the morning, July 5th, when everybody has hangovers, uh, 1998.

130
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,540
That year, you can expect the, quote, end of the world, unquote.

131
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,140
Uh, the Church of the Subgenius is here to make sure the end of the world happens correctly.

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,920
Uh, it can go various different ways.

133
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:21,160
Uh, people tend to think of the end of the world as, uh, a sudden, you know, bam, it's gone, or the rapture, you know, suddenly all the Christians are in heaven.

134
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,040
Happy, watching all the sinners fry.

135
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,080
I wanna get saved, you better get right with Bob right now!

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,000
Right now!

137
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,180
Basically, two factions out there right now is us and them.

138
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,060
Friend, have you ever heard the expression, there's no slack in this world?

139
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,580
A lot of people have to ask me what slack is.

140
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,600
And that's sad, mister.

141
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,920
They were born with slack. Oh yeah, you were born with slack.

142
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,100
But the conspiracy took it away.

143
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,140
The conspiracy made you want to be nothing.

144
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,560
You wanted to be normal.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
That's what the conspiracy is all about.

146
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,940
And the conspiracy is, uh, a patchwork of different things.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,440
Some are nations, some are products, some are hypnotic television shows, some are, um, bad pills.

148
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,840
You'll find unless you find Bob!

149
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,960
And you better find Bob right now!

150
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,800
And no one has ever met Bob.

151
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,100
The leader of our church, no one has ever met.

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,120
Because, as you know, all cults, they're leaders.

153
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,700
And leaders are usually pretty hard to find.

154
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,380
And Bob is no exception.

155
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,520
Bob will help you.

156
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,520
Dig your own weirdness.

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,180
I got a Bob in my pants.

158
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,940
I got a Bob in my pants.

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,060
Honey, I got a problem.

160
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,640
I got a Bob in my pants.

161
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,020
It's right over here.

162
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,560
I need some padded tweezers.

163
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,640
No, no, don't run away.

164
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,940
I got a Bob in my pants.

165
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,020
Oh, they all run away.

166
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,980
I need help.

167
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,860
I got a Bob in my pants.

168
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,740
Will somebody help me?

169
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
I got a Bob in my pants.

170
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,020
Hi, ma'am.

171
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm trying to squat my Bob.

172
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,280
I gotta squat my Bob.

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,660
Will you help me squat my Bob?

174
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,140
I got a Bob in my pants.

175
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,640
I got a Bob in my pants.

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
If you're up here, I can't hold you but a minute, bro.

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,960
I got a Bob in my designer jeans.

178
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,140
I got a Bob in my pants.

179
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,600
It's clean Bob.

180
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,960
I got a Bob in my shorts.

181
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,240
Don't smell.

182
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,700
I got a Bob in my shorts.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,220
Really, I trained it.

184
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,420
It's on really hot.

185
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,160
I got a Bob in my shorts.

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
I gotta get this Bob out of my pants.

187
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,860
I gotta get this Bob.

188
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,680
This is Sister Chris, and couldn't you just whiff the isness, the slack that was inherited

189
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,780
in that collage?

190
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,380
Truly first-rate sleazy art or tenth-rate high art that contains the cheapness necessary

191
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,620
to help you maintain faith throughout subgenius depression or alienation from blessed mania

192
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,540
in these times of no style, when no one has the guts to put their bloody hearts in the

193
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,680
line without fear of being called a weirdo, a time when people laugh at the things that

194
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,740
aren't funny and don't laugh at the ones that are.

195
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,740
They, being the normals, laugh only when there is a laugh track, because they don't, because

196
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,420
they rather they want to be accepted, and they don't want to step out of line.

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,100
It's gone so far, I've actually heard sobbing at a movie theater when the expensive cars,

198
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,340
the Mercedes-Benz and such, get totaled in a car chase.

199
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,540
Confusion abounds, and the only thing we can keep our precious insanity is by letting

200
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,080
go of the oppressive concrete weights around our necks that pull us down to the bottom

201
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,040
of the pool of normalcy, float up to the surface where the breathing is easy.

202
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,820
Come up to freshness.

203
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,540
Try Menthol Bob.

204
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,680
He's that refreshing voice in the back of your head that all of the nuns in Catholic

205
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,460
training and psychic torturing centers told you was the voice of the devil or one of his

206
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,240
minions, urging you to step away from the flock.

207
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,020
The herd instinct.

208
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,060
Is the real diabolical notion that organized religion teaches?

209
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:57,620
Dump those graven images down the drain before you dump your will in a ditch for them.

210
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,820
Ah, yes, the harvest.

211
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,040
I guess comparing the word Bob, Bob, Bob.

212
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,180
They said your mind is in this jar, and then they poured it down the sink.

213
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,320
Subgeniuses are the class of people who can't be classed.

214
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,660
Bob has taken winos on the street and turned them into millionaires overnight.

215
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,460
By the same token, he has taken millionaires and given them the slack they always needed

216
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,040
all along as winos.

217
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,000
Some of the greatest of the subgeniuses, some of the most ascended rogue subgeniuses

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,820
are complete morons.

219
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,780
You know, but they perform a service.

220
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,400
You know, we need the morons of the world.

221
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,060
And they've got me.

222
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,500
I don't even know where the hell they're coming from.

223
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,640
But, you know, thanks for letting me speak my piece.

224
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,320
Sure, sure, listen, if I were you, I would keep speaking your piece as much as possible

225
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,360
because it's not going to be long before people cannot say what they mean.

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,840
People won't be able to express themselves in public.

227
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,500
I understand that, but, you know, that other stuff is coming down with me.

228
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,700
I just can't, you know, relate to it at all.

229
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,860
It'll come to you.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,200
It's real.

231
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,940
I want to know what gets you started in this religious cult.

232
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,840
What gets you started?

233
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,400
Or what got us started?

234
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,520
What got us started?

235
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,060
Yeah.

236
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,320
Actually, I was contacted one time.

237
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,920
I was driving along in my automobile.

238
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,520
You've heard about these UFO contactee stories I know before.

239
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,940
But I was driving along.

240
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,440
I was driving along in my automobile one day and out on some country road

241
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,520
and was forcibly wrenched from my car and manipulated by creatures from outer space.

242
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,720
Does that appeal to you?

243
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,300
Pretty simple, really.

244
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,140
No, I don't believe it myself.

245
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,800
Well, what you can do, yeah, I was going to say,

246
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,460
you probably wouldn't want to send us a dollar if you, you know,

247
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,760
we don't insist that people believe us.

248
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,920
We only insist that they do what we do.

249
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,720
We ask them to.

250
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,240
In fact, we really, we believe that the majority of you out there won't believe us.

251
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,120
Yeah, I was wanting to talk to them too, guys.

252
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,780
Is this Rhodey?

253
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,740
Yeah, they're right here.

254
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,340
And I'm Rhodey.

255
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,500
Hello?

256
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,540
Okay, I want to ask them two questions.

257
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,520
The first question is, they said they was into winning souls.

258
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,800
Who are they winning souls for, Satan or Jesus?

259
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,060
Pal, Bob and Jesus are on the same side.

260
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,340
They're just not playing quite the same game.

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,920
Yeah, but there's only one game.

262
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,700
That's right.

263
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,700
There's only one game.

264
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,400
That's all.

265
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,300
We're not going to be able to tell you anything.

266
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,040
So play your game and keep on playing.

267
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,100
Well, my second question is, why are you deceiving everybody?

268
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,020
We're not deceiving anyone.

269
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,020
We are doing it for Jesus.

270
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,100
It's going to be a lot easier to deceive people once the government starts putting

271
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,680
Valium in the water supply.

272
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,360
I probably won't even be here.

273
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,220
That's right.

274
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,980
You're probably right.

275
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,080
Let me make an important point here.

276
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,840
A lot of the people that are born.

277
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,040
Again, Christians now are doing more to turn America against Jesus than they are

278
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,700
for Jesus.

279
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,940
Do you understand what I'm saying?

280
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Yeah, I hear you there.

281
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,900
But what I'm saying is, why don't y'all why don't y'all try to turn people to

282
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,400
Jesus?

283
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,620
We're just trying to take it from a slightly different direction.

284
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,880
We make people aware of the fact that they can make their own decisions.

285
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,760
We're going step by step.

286
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,500
Do you think you ever occur to you might be going in the wrong step?

287
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,320
We think about that all the time.

288
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,700
Has it ever occurred to you?

289
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,360
No.

290
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,940
I got a mighty big ball.

291
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,840
I got a mighty big ball.

292
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,200
I got a big ball.

293
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,920
I got a mighty big ball.

294
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,340
I got a mighty big ball.

295
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,060
And it's got to come out.

296
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,720
Well, he must have got in.

297
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Ain't no room.

298
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,520
It's got to get out.

299
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,540
There ain't no room in my skin.

300
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,180
But there's a mighty big ball.

301
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,980
Big ball.

302
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,720
Inside of me.

303
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,680
He's a mighty big ball.

304
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,360
Ugly ball.

305
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,120
You know, it makes me pee.

306
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,260
He's a mighty big ball.

307
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,180
He's too big.

308
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,980
He's a mighty big ball.

309
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,160
Man, he's really too big.

310
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,760
He's a mighty big ball.

311
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,440
He's a mighty big ball.

312
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,320
He's a mighty big ball.

313
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,600
He's a mighty big ball.

314
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,780
He's a mighty big ball.

315
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,960
That will overcome Satan's powers,

316
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,600
the anointing that will break the yoke of Satan's bondage.

317
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:08,180
And I want you to know that I have just been experiencing an attack on all sides.

318
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,440
It seems like on every room where we try to advance,

319
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,640
the devil would just unleash, literally,

320
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,780
horrors of demonic suffering.

321
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,220
He would come and force us to stop ourselves.

322
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:27,520
And after a few weeks of this, I just began to feel a deep hurting in my belly.

323
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,680
Way deep down in my spirit.

324
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,240
And some people say, well, on top of what?

325
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,280
You mean you experience pain too?

326
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,020
Yes I do.

327
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,500
I hurt just like you do.

328
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,980
I feel the pain of a satanic attack just like you do.

329
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,420
But I really didn't even know how to pray because I didn't know exactly what was coming at me.

330
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,380
Satan was bombarding me from so many sides, actually I felt kind of dumb.

331
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,320
Step in to the wonderful world of auto dynamics.

332
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,660
Step in to the swept wing Dodge of 1957.

333
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,880
If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980.

334
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:19,100
When everyone has a number instead of a name and the government tells you whom you should marry.

335
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Just imagine, 1980.

336
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,020
Oh my goodness, oh, oh, are you all right doctor?

337
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,800
If that don't work, we'll bore you.

338
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,620
I'm healed again.

339
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,360
Right here, right in front of us folks.

340
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
This ain't the highest quality slack I ever heard in my life either.

341
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,620
Yeah, well, it's better than that liquid slack.

342
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,300
We have to buy from you.

343
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,620
Hey, there's a caller.

344
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,040
We talked to Bosco Bear today.

345
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,620
Let's see what Bosco has to say.

346
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,880
Well, you know, it's a little known fact that the soul is actually located in the foot.

347
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,100
Of course, it's not physically.

348
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,800
It's not a physical thing.

349
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,580
It doesn't die with the physical body.

350
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,220
It rots, but never actually dies.

351
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,880
It stays around.

352
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,900
The soul is the stroke drug of the spiritual realm.

353
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,760
It wanders.

354
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,320
It wanders around trying to score a last bit of prop before it passes over into the before life.

355
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,800
And you know, a normal soul, when they get over into the before life, they all just run together into one big slurry.

356
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:34,000
They get strained out and used in another normal in the next life, but you couldn't really call it a next life because it's just normal.

357
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
Yes, but a subgenius soul becomes a dot.

358
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,960
They're hard to catch.

359
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,940
But what happens to a business executive?

360
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,480
They move fast, boy.

361
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,100
So what happens to a business executive's soul?

362
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:52,920
Well, those are the ones that Bob will use as the main commodity in his bargaining with the elder gods when the day of judgment arrives.

363
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,340
You should know that from looking at Prescripture 1714, Dr. Howell.

364
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,580
I presume you have been reading your prescriptures.

365
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:09,740
I was only making an inquiry on behalf of the many unenlightened listeners who might be curious to know how vulnerable a business executive might be.

366
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:18,000
I've just noticed a certain lack of discipline around this whole show thing.

367
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,840
Just the fact that you call it a show.

368
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,900
Don't eschew the show.

369
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,020
Don't eschew the show.

370
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,200
If the checks were bigger, the show would be better.

371
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,900
Oh, the checks and money, I see.

372
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, if the checks were bigger, the balances would be greater.

373
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,500
Your love of Bob is in direct proportion to how much Bob pays you, right?

374
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,420
Oh, I think Bob's love of me is in direct proportion.

375
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:39,720
That's so funny.

376
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:39,720


377
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:39,720


378
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:39,720


379
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:39,720


380
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,980
In direct proportion to how many souls I destroy.

381
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,160
Bob pays through the nose, and I've worn out many souls pounding the streets in his service.

382
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,400
That's right, and I've hurt my nostrils trying to receive those payments.

383
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,820
I had my third nostril forcibly opened by a crazed wino on Telegraph Avenue.

384
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,940
And that's the best way to do it.

385
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,320
That is really the best way, getting it on the street.

386
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,400
You don't have to get fancy about it.

387
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,420
You know, do it natural-like.

388
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,800
Get a, just, you know, the ones that's out on the street.

389
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,300
There they are now.

390
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,720
That's probably where Bob is.

391
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,400
Now, he's probably walking the streets.

392
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,680
Right now.

393
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,160
It's amazing.

394
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,220
Like a miracle.

395
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,740
The law of the land.

396
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Filling it full of money.

397
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,640
Just as we all are, he is only a delicate envelope of flesh.

398
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,580
Yeah, but he's been licked more than once.

399
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,720
He's a bag of skin filled with meat, just like everybody, but it's special.

400
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,700
Establish justice.

401
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,880
I ain't afraid of all the gulls and altars.

402
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,100
I used to think if I died in an evil place,

403
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,780
then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to heaven.

404
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,360
But now,

405
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,300
I mean, I don't care where it goes as long as it ain't here.

406
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,060
So what do you want to do?

407
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,420
I'm going in to examine it.

408
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,260
Isn't that dangerous, even with the suit on, sir?

409
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,260
It won't take me long.

410
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,280
Very well.

411
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,580
He's reached bottom.

412
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,960
Open the lock.

413
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,380
Father.

414
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,740
Hold it.

415
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,440
Mary, what are you doing here in a radiation suit?

416
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,600
You should've looked in the dynamic.

417
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
Father, I haven't got a aside For.

418
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,320
You think I can't?

419
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,020
There let me use it like a

420
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,300
There's-, there's-

421
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,180
And now you've broken all our trust,

422
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,520
and I've got this little t kommero.

423
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,700
You think this is going to control us?

424
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,560
get in their heads and start teaching.

425
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,640
J.R. Bob Dobbs, known among salesmen as the saint of sales.

426
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,640
It's actually a mystic sales ability.

427
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,620
Oh, okay.

428
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,340
Schedulatory sales.

429
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,960
Hey, where did you get these jokes anyway?

430
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,020
Oh man, the safety seal is broken.

431
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,700
Hey, hey, hey, these jokes have been tampered with, man.

432
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
Hey, jokes, I like Peter Rodman.

433
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,160
Scott, get him out of here.

434
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
He's good in science.

435
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,540
Where did these jokes come from?

436
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,840
In the same pot.

437
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,020
The conspiracy's been full with our jokes.

438
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,080
We're obliterating Abram.

439
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,000
And liberty and justice for all who believe.

440
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,420
Christ my Lord.

441
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,640
Perhaps somehow this knowledge weighs on him

442
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,700
more heavily than on many of us who are able

443
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,660
to bear our mortality without resorting

444
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,220
to an elaborate denial system.

445
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,560
Well, I haven't figured that one out myself yet.

446
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,140
Perhaps after the show you could show me

447
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,320
how.

448
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,180
Well, how else can you explain the avoidance

449
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,100
of humanity itself, of simple human charity,

450
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
of the fact of connection?

451
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,480
Well, it can be explained.

452
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,660
It's a simple explanation.

453
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,840
The explanation for practically everything is available

454
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,880
at your fingertips.

455
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,460
And it seems most of you in this room have forgotten it.

456
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,280
Now, what happened to the old, the old, you know,

457
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,320
kill or kill me philosophy of subgenius?

458
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,600
Hey, what happened to this?

459
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,360
I mean, Bob was supposed to kill you and you turned it around.

460
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,520
All right.

461
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,460
I died a thousand times.

462
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,260
All I want is a little crumb of bread, Ivan.

463
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,420
Just a tiny, just one bite of bread.

464
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,680
Now come back to the church.

465
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,420
Throw my face.

466
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,820
Just one, just one crumb of nourishment for one

467
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,480
of the old faithful.

468
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,360
Oh, man does not live by bread alone.

469
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,240
There's other things besides food that nourish you very enough.

470
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,380
But just one crumb.

471
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,220
You had your crumb.

472
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,400
More tape.

473
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,060
You dropped my tape.

474
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,340
Hey, hey.

475
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,340
You want to buy some show?

476
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,280
Our show is scientifically engineered

477
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
to reduce stress and fatigue.

478
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,080
The world's most successful show and superb performance

479
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,240
is only half the story.

480
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,100
It's a legend in its own time.

481
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,980
However, improper listening techniques

482
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,680
may lead some persons to dependency, seizures,

483
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,620
cranial fits, priapic conditions, micturition,

484
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,900
sternutation, subtle glandular mutations,

485
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,880
and in some territories, legal arrest.

486
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,320
Listen to the definitive, authoritative, and

487
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,360
informative, eye-opening, thorough, insightful,

488
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,360
useful, complete, and original subgenius hour and a half of slack.

489
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,800
.

490
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,200
Peace.

491
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,840
Peace.

492
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,720
Peace.

493
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,940
Peace.

494
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,680
Peace.

495
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,220


496
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
Peace.

497
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,980
Peace.

498
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,320
Peace.

499
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,540
Hey.

500
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,200
Peace.

501
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,420
Peace.

502
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,420


503
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,420


504
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,420


505
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,780
Get up in peace.

506
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,160
Peace.

507
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,120
Peace.

508
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,400
Peace.

509
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,400


510
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,400


511
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,400


512
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,880
.

513
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:43,880


514
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,800
Napoleon has indeed won the battle.

515
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:44,840


516
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,000
Peace.

517
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,480


518
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,480


519
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,480


520
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,480


521
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,480


522
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,480


523
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,940
Peace.

524
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000


525
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000


526
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000


527
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,940
Peace.

528
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


529
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


530
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


531
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


532
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


533
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


534
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:50,940


535
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,020
Peace.

536
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,420
Peace.

537
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:51,460
Peace.

538
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,460


539
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,460


540
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,460


541
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,460


542
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,460


543
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,460


544
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,540
Once congratulations to you and to all of us in your

545
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:52,940
wonderful, wonderful nation of coils policies.

546
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:52,940


547
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,340
.

548
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,280
Peace.

549
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,320


550
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,820
Scott Kemp, I sentence you to hell.

551
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,240
No, I have been saved.

552
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,220
I've been in church practically all my life.

553
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,920
Yes, you have grown up in church,

554
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,060
and you have certainly had an experience with your God.

555
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,660
But the record reveals that you have been unprofitable,

556
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,860
and the word decrees that the unprofitable servant

557
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,760
must be cast into outer darkness.

558
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,980
But when have I been unprofitable?

559
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,260
You have rebelled against my word,

560
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,600
and you have stolen your Lord's money.

561
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
While you lived upon the earth,

562
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,360
I permitted you to earn a good living.

563
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,400
As my servant, I gave you power and health to earn money,

564
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,220
and in return for this, I decreed in my word

565
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,060
that a tenth part of those earnings were mine.

566
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,240
I left that 10% in your care,

567
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,060
charging you to invest it for me

568
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,300
and to make me a good man.

569
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,300


570
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,800
I gave you my church,

571
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,420
that the gospel might be preached.

572
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,740
But you, Scott, have rebelled against my word.

573
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,760
You have not only taken 90% which I freely gave you,

574
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,280
but you have been so covetous as to take the 10% also.

575
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,880
Did you know that rebellion is a sin of witchcraft,

576
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,840
and that no covetous person shall enter the kingdom of God?

577
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,280
Oh, sir, I tell you, I didn't realize it was so serious.

578
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,160
I didn't realize it was so serious.

579
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,980
And if you don't want that to happen to you,

580
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,900
if you don't want the judgment in Dobbstown,

581
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,140
a recording of which you just heard,

582
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,520
to go against you like that poor Poe Bucker there,

583
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,420
Bob was mad at him because he was unprofitable.

584
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,460
And he didn't want us to be unprofitable either.

585
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,780
You can write for information,

586
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,220
not about this station,

587
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,000
but about the church of the subgenius,

588
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,980
which so many of you hate.

589
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,260
You got that pencil or pen or tattoo needle ready, dear friends?

590
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,760
That's P.O. Box 140306.

591
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,620
Got a nice ring to it.

592
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,980
140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

593
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,140
And just drop us a postcards with your address.

594
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,360
And...

595
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

596
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

597
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,840
Oh, yes.

598
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,280
The Harvest.

599
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,060
And we've gotten a lot of calls tonight.

600
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,740
Lots of great hate calls.

601
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,240
You know, I played some recordings of old hate calls,

602
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,420
and it's funny how they'll just follow that cue.

603
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
It just, it brings it out.

604
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,120
So keep calling and keep listening.

605
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,540
We'd love to know that you keep listening to something you hate.

606
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,820
That tells us a lot.

607
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,460
Thank you.

608
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,380
THE HARVEST

609
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,680
Space girls always smoke but tease

610
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,540
Swallow butts and feed no waste

611
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,260
Say don't mess around with the rule

612
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,960
They don't want you

613
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,860
Just to show that they don't care

614
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,300
And that's why I'm here today

615
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,300


616
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,300


617
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,300


618
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,300


619
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,700
Go bite the face and burn the hair.

620
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,500
Suck them up and move the hood.

621
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,380
Now you've got the sprinkle blues.

622
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,560
My daddy works for the secret Marines.

623
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,800
I know because he has, he keeps six brains in maldehyde jars on our living room mantelpiece.

624
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,500
He chooses six different kinds of food coloring in them for some reason.

625
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,080
And I've been told never to touch the jars.

626
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,800
But sometimes I talk to the grains when nobody's home.

627
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,240
Electric static noises, lightning bolts.

628
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,660
Well, you know, lightning bolts and ions.

629
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,180
I'm going to jump out like a circus in the fireplace.

630
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,340
My daddy has seven brains.

631
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,960
Six he keeps on the shelf and one that he keeps in his head that he doesn't tell anybody about.

632
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,200
That he uses to play along with those TV game shows.

633
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,060
I see you off for tonight from North Carolina ...

634
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,400
Well I gotta finish with a reservation for tonight at the Andamanuk House Hotel.

635
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:20,180
I got a littleorvation for tonight.

636
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,740
You want two beds or one?

637
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,860
One.

638
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,680
Ok, one bed.

639
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,360
32 plus taxes.

640
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,660
I'd like to get a room to rest for a night.

641
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:27,660


642
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,240
32 plus taxes?

643
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,740
32.

644
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,860
That's great.

645
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,780
Now this is for two beds, kids.

646
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:30,780


647
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,500
Now, do you have mirrors on the ceilings?

648
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,660
Because I know some of these fancy whoop-de-doo Hollywood hotels have mirrors on the ceilings.

649
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,460
No, we don't.

650
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,300
Oh, no.

651
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,480
I don't know if I want to do it.

652
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,520
We don't like that kind of place.

653
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,660
Oh, you're not that kind of place.

654
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,620
No, we don't like that kind of place.

655
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,140
Well, wait a minute.

656
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,780
3-2-22?

657
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,400
What's that mean?

658
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,800
Now, let me ask you this.

659
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,560
You got color TV?

660
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,040
Color TV and telephone.

661
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,200
Oh, man.

662
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,140
Okay, can I give you the reservation?

663
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,760
No reservation needed.

664
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,700
When you drop by, we need your ID.

665
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,720
Oh, you'll have the vacancy, though.

666
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,860
We got lots of it.

667
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,080
Okay, let me ask you this.

668
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,680
Is adult photography allowed in the rooms also?

669
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,080
Sir, you've been asking me a lot of questions like that, okay?

670
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,300
I think you better go to other hotels.

671
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,920
Well, if I pee on the floor, can I drink it out of a Dixie cup if I can scoop it up with a straw?

672
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,740
No, you can't.

673
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,440
Why not?

674
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,040
I don't know what kind of question you're asking.

675
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,120
Well, if the bullfrogs were gagging on...

676
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,060
This is a decent hotel.

677
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,580
If you want that kind of a, you know, those kind of a hotel, you better go across the street.

678
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,720
The 400, they got mirrors, they got x-rays.

679
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,560
Oh, man.

680
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:40,800
Not here.

681
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,220
Man, oh, man, that's good.

682
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,660
Let me...

683
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,980
It's all an illusion.

684
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,080
Yes, these were the old days, dear friends.

685
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,020
We're listening to a 10-year-old hour of slack.

686
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,120
What a trip down memory lane.

687
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,580
It's been a long time.

688
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,240
It's been a long time for me, and what a confusing mess for you, but that's all right.

689
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,220
You don't want to know why I didn't do an original show this week.

690
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,800
I don't want to know either.

691
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,980
Praise Bob.

692
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,900
It's all an illusion.

693
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,640
All a lie.

694
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,700
The one who flashed the badge calls your name and says,

695
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,460
I am Special Agent Arnold Palmer,

696
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,860
acting under authority of Exec.

697
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,760
Order Camp X-Day 666.

698
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,800
BOM for your own good and the security of the nation.

699
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,960
We are taking you into protective custody.

700
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,560
You need to know these facts.

701
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,060
One, we are in a war to the death.

702
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,260
In large means.

703
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,520
The average subgenius doesn't even realize the anti-Bob is fanatically lusting to destroy...

704
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,100
Because of misconduct.

705
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,100


706
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,100


707
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,100


708
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,100


709
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,700
Every last subgenius patriot.

710
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,220
Even as they have done to our kindred in Dobstown, in Bolivia.

711
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,040
In any war, the most vital element is slack.

712
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,720
Positive mental slack.

713
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:22,400
This includes courage, the willingness to sacrifice oneself for the good of one's me.

714
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,140
Knowing one's own identity, knowing who and what.

715
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,100
The people.

716
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,980
The weak enemy is.

717
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,320
Your plans and your foe's plans.

718
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,720
The pink boys, although 50 times as many as they'll admit,

719
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,800
are still a ridiculously small minority compared to the Axists.

720
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,140
Able to dominate a world because they're organized.

721
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:55,920
They control communications and thus are able to keep billions of victims misled, disorganized, demoralized...

722
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,020
Inhumany.

723
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,020


724
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,800
The lord of laughs.

725
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,200
The lord of laughs.

726
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,100
His high-ranking...

Who killed his fellow brothers in a conflict with the Black Manna.

731
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,080
And let the personalities, so corrupt in no way be stripped of dignity.

735
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,920

conspiracy plot was actually not a conspiracy

744
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,360
plot at all, but a conspiracy

745
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,200
plot to make people think

746
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,940
there was a conspiracy plot.

747
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,340
Why is there a limit?

748
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,440
Pardon me, what was that

749
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,280
again, Dr. Howell? Maybe our listeners

750
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,860

Yes, and a different PowerShell code.

755
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,480
Cross the threshold of reality and enter a fantastic

756
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,280
imaginary universe. Who would you like to know?

757

and magic. Splendid palaces

759
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
where powerful dragons soar

760
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,760
through the sky. Mystical unicorns

761
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,060
comfort the pure of heart.

762
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,300
And sprightly elves cavort

763
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,360
in moonlit forests. Hey, Sting, we want

764
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,300

messing with it, your plane won't land

766
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,360
and you'll go straight to your Bob.

767
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,020
Peer over the edge of darkness where

768
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
ancient spirits lurk in the shadows.

769
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,940
Oh, so you like this

770
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,620
this hodgepodge

771
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,640
of death?

772
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,500
I like the number 9.

773
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,720
9 is amazing.

774
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,900
Satisfying.

775
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,720
It's not stodgy. It's

776
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,400
satisfying.

777
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,000
The most satisfying number is

778
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:32,860
nine. Four is not so hot. Four and eight are not that great.

779
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,200
Uh, hi, I'm interested in, uh, reserving a room for tonight. Do you have vacancies?

780
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,720
Oh, that's great. Now let me ask you this. How much does it cost for a room for two people?

781
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,120
Oh yeah. Oh, overnight. Oh, that's a great bargain. That's a great, you know,

782
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,540
you have the best bargain in town about, about for that. Now, now let me ask you this for single

783
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:23,840
bed, right? Okay. Now, now let me ask you this. Uh, when they, when they, uh, get the

784
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:23,980
delivery, they're going to be, they're going to be, they're going to be, they're going to be

785
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,740
When the Delvecchio method interred within, did the youngsters do it?

786
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,500
I can't hear you.

787
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,080
Well, when the youngsters did it with the Delvecchio method, they didn't have it.

788
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,840
Have what?

789
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:43,960
Well, they had the salami meat with the cervix menstruating, Barners.

790
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,520
No.

791
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,860
Now, at the Hi-Hat Hotel, do you allow youngsters to urinate on the floor

792
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,640
if they smash bullfrogs on the head with sledgehammers?

793
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,700
No, I don't know.

794
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Now, if I went to the bathroom and I found 11 bullfrogs gagging on clumps of hair,

795
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,900
do you think that I could desiccate them and eat the vital organs?

796
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,080
If I wouldn't be breaking the law, that is.

797
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,240
Yeah.

798
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,080
Would that be acceptable to the morals of your decency?

799
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,040
Yeah.

800
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,960
You know, the legless eunuch banded together and clumped with the corn stalks

801
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,020
reproduced from all over 90 cases.

802
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,820
Yeah, you want to rent overnight, right?

803
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,720
Yes, absolutely. Can you take my name?

804
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, okay. What's your name?

805
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,760
Perry Strump.

806
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,380
Huh?

807
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,240
Perry Strump.

808
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,140
Perry what?

809
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,280
Strump.

810
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,520
Yeah, okay.

811
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,000
It rhymes with hump.

812
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,420
Okay. What time you come here?

813
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,140
About 2 o'clock.

814
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,400
About 2 o'clock.

815
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:07,020
And we're coming from another dimension beyond the beams of the electrons, beyond that which is known.

816
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,240
We are vibrating very rapidly at a higher energy level, but we plan to be with you.

817
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,840
Will you accept us?

818
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,480
You come to here, okay?

819
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,180
One more last information.

820
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,520
Information.

821
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,460
Tell me what they did with the youngsters.

822
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,200
Did the youngsters do it?

823
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,440
What?

824
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,320
Did the youngsters meet the salami unit?

825
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,080
With...

826
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,400
What?

827
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,960
Did the youngsters do it with the salami unit which they had?

828
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,540
I was trying to find out. I talked to Karen. I talked to Sarah. I talked to Barry.

829
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,060
They didn't have any of the information that I wanted.

830
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,780
Please, please let me know. Else I can't come to the Hi-Hat Hotel.

831
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,240
Yeah, okay. Anyway, you come here and...

832
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,120
Barry had the plexiglass.

833
00:40:59,660 --> 00:40:59,920
Ah.

834
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,220
Do you got the tubes that were inserted into the nasal passages?

835
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:04,980
...

836
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,360
Hello?

837
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:08,820
Hello?

838
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,740
Hello?

839
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,100

00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,500
Hello?

841
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:13,780
Hello?

842
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:13,980


843
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,100


844
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,320
Hello?

845
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,400

Hello?

847
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:14,880

00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,340
Hello?

849
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,340


850
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,040
Charlie?

851
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:23,880
Prosecutor?

852
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,400


853
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,740
What is it?

854
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:24,740


855
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:24,760
Isn't VR because of contraption?

856
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:24,760


857
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:24,980
What should I do?

858
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,780
Choi, send aева to patients with 스타 añad кас 소�phin스.

859

860
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,860
lo, wicked.

861
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,160
Pretty uselessейств.

862
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,260
Gerishment in the whole world of the NHSth wavelength.

863
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,700
Because of Beijing's airkiungsthe wholeAmlogical page,

864
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,820
you know, it sat to bring the convolution between the human species and upcoming organisms.

865
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:52,920
Rift. There's a lot from that to L.A., the other L.A. group of crazies there. Truby, at one point,

866
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,700
answered one of those ads that you see in comic books and men's magazines that say,

867
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,720
send in your lyrics and we'll turn it into a country western song, you know, for 10 bucks.

868
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,260
You get a cassette back and they'd have put your lyrics to music. Well, he sent in a

869
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,140
pretty surrealistic poem and

870
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,880
sure enough, they made it into a song.

871
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,280
That's the way it is.

872
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,720
The parts of my days

873
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,000
Because they're black

874
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,580

The blind man's piece of red

877
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,680
Because he's black

878

The E.V.

881
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,880
The blind man's piece

882
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,420
Is a dark, glossy black

883
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,720
The E.V.

884
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,820
The E.V.

885
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:18,880
The E.V.

886
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,000
The E.V.

887

00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:32,220
Jeśli

899
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:32,220


900
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,460
Sp выглядит

901
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,180
There's always

902
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,180


903
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,420
that you need coke and you made the tolerated jacket out of.

904
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,980
I don't know.

905
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,640
I don't know.

906
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know.

907
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,280
I don't know.

908
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,700
I don't know.

909
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:07,180


910
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,500
I don't know.

911
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,300
I don't know.

912
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,240
I don't know.

913
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,320
Been in hell so long

914
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,420
that I'm blinded by any light.

915
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,200
Been buried at the bottom

916
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,640
of the dung heap so long

917
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,640
that my eyes are dead to any hope

918
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,540
for a better tomorrow.

919
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,100
Like a hideous deep sea

920
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,820
fish. I've adapted

921
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,180
to the blackest depths imaginable.

922
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,400
Please

923
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,600
forgive me if I perceive

924
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,520
no light.

925
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,780
Been in hell so long

926
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,960
that I'm accustomed to being paraded

927
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,940
by assholes.

928
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,720
I'm accustomed

929
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,240
to being penniless and powerless

930
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,480
forever. I'm

931
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,160
accustomed to doing

932
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,940
mob work for mob

933
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,160
chicks. I'm accustomed

934
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,480
to being a toady for incompetent

935
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,080
dildos and

936
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,420
living on loose change

937
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,200
until

938
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,680
Friday.

939
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,220
I am so accustomed to

940
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,960
eating shit mob that I am

941
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,340
unaware of any other kind of nourishment.

942
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,520
Been in hell so long

943
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,100
that any escape routes are invisible

944
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,900
to me.

945
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,760
Due to my

946
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,980
adapted blindness

947
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,080
from dying in hell

948
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,720
for so long.

949
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,680
Which was actually a conspiracy

950
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,100
plot, which was actually a subgenius

951
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,020
plot, which was

952
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,540
actually a front for another

953
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,340
conspiracy plot which had been

954
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,160
created by conspiracy

955
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,000
robots, which had been created

956
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,900
by subgenius robots, which

957
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,660
in turn had been created by

958
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,240
subgenius androids, which in turn

959
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:03,920
had been created by subgenius robots.

960
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:03,920


961
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,280
Which had been created by

962
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,920
glowingly dark brain aliens,

963
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,780
which had been created by the nine inch worm androids,

964
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,840
which had been created by castner heads,

965
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,080
which had been created by the Mission Impossible team.

966
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,720
Good evening, Klamath town.

967
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,640
Yeah, I'd like to make a reservation.

968
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,380
Is that okay?

969
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,580
Reservation?

970
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,140
Yeah.

971
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:24,760
Okay.

972
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,460
For what day?

973
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,040
For tonight. I'd like it.

974
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,820
For tonight?

975
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,340
Yes.

976
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,100
Okay.

977
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,820
Okay.

978
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,840
This is for certain tribes and races of people who have

979
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,940
characteristic odors.

980
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:38,580
Pardon me?

981
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,560
This is for certain tribes and races of people who have

982
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,660
characteristic odors.

983
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,200
Now, let me ask you this.

984
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,060
At the Cloud Motel, did the youngsters find the plexiglass?

985
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,360
Sir, could you please be a little louder?

986
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,400
I cannot hear your voice.

987
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,580
Okay.

988
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,840
Let me ask you this.

989
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,900
When you had the glassine packets, did you have any

990
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:03,900


991
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,840
plexiglass enveloped over the retinas?

992
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,680
The odor after coitus was overwhelming.

993
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,980
Now, is that allowed at the Cloud Motel?

994
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,800
I don't know.

995
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,140
Well, I cannot just hear your voice because it's...

996
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,860
Terry, Barry, and Linda informed me that we could have had it

997
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,500
done without surgery.

998
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,320
Is that correct?

999
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,720
That's correct.

1000
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,040
Sorry.

1001
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:25,740
Excuse me.

1002
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,460
Stay on.

1003
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,820
Oops.

1004
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:29,900
Here.

1005
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,260
You know, I'm sorry.

1006
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:35,800
I'm sorry.

1007
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,720
I'm sorry.

1008
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,400
I'm sorry.

1009
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,400


1010
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,560
Say it.

1011
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,500
Say it.

1012
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1013
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1014
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1015
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1016
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1017
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1018
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:39,500


1019
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,720
Say it.

1020
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,560
It can be done while you sleep.

1021
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,940
Yes, while you sleep.

1022
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:56,240
One hour of positive, constructive repetition while you sleep is equivalent to nine hours

1023
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,640
while you are awake.

1024
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,240
Bob?

1025
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,680
The message.

1026
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:03,880
The message.

1027
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:03,880


1028
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:03,880


1029
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:03,880


1030
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,320
is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

1031
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,920
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

1032
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,520
Bob?

1033
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,400
...that's your key phrase,

1034
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,260
it will trigger the entire message

1035
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,320
without your being aware of it.

1036
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1037
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,580
All right, wait.

1038
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,760
Uh, has that happened recently, do you know?

1039
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,480
All the time.

1040
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,940
All the time.

1041
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,560
They have to have a source of supply.

1042
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,320
Where do you people get these boxes?

1043
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,240
In the ground.

1044
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,160
On gathering night, all come from boxes.

1045
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,040
Clothes, wood, food, all from boxes.

1046
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,720
When I'm born, she'd be put into boxes

1047
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,960
and dug up for great eating.

1048
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,800
Uh, do you know whether they ever come out

1049
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,540
into the subway tunnels of the city?

1050
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,900
I think so.

1051
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,460
Right on underground.

1052
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:01,920
Underground?

1053
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,840
Underground.

1054
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,260
What do you know about the underground?

1055
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,220
The elders say there is much good eating underground.

1056
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,100
.

1057
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,360
From the far horizons of the unknown

1058
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,460
come transcribed tales of new dimensions in time and space.

1059
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,340
These are stories of a future,

1060
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,880
Adventures in which you'll live in a million could be years on a thousand maybe worlds.

1061
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,480
X minus 1.

1062
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,820
Robot has landed at the foot of the tube, sir.

1063
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,460
Switch on the intercom.

1064
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:52,620
Robot.

1065
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,700
Robot N71.

1066
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,080
N71.

1067
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,720
Identify this idea or goal and picture it clearly in your mind.

1068
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,300
Don't forget to use your drift meter.

1069
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,620
The music has gone and the mucus is up.

1070
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,140
Oh, no.

1071
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,140
We're really testing callers this morning. Good morning.

1072
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:10,740
Good morning.

1073
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,680
Are you man or woman enough to take the church?

1074
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,500
Yes. As a matter of fact, we're planning the overthrow of the convention.

1075
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,800
Ah, that's what we like to hear.

1076
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,540
That's what we hear.

1077
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,460
Yes, yes.

1078
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,280
Kill Bob.

1079
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,640
Meanwhile, there you are.

1080
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,340
First to inspect in the privacy of your own home, shop, office, den for 20 years or express permission

1081
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,960
already withdrawn by the Polk, McKinley, Harding, Dobbs, Coolidge men.

1082
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,220
The only men authorized to stamp your application with its own seal.

1083
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,720
Looks easy, doesn't it? But it won't come off.

1084
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,920
Yeah, exactly. We were ripe the day we started this thing.

1085
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,100
Yes, that's why they shut it down.

1086
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,480
Yes.

1087
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,780
How long are you guys going to be on?

1088
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,840
We're going to be on until they throw us out.

1089
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,740
Or kill me! Or kill me!

1090
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,940
They wallow in our intellectual impotence.

1091
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,780
Shorted the show out and spent the whole thing in one little three-second buzz.

1092
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,820
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to use up all of our tangible effect.

1093
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,700
Stay there until you fall asleep. When you fall asleep, that means we're off the air.

1094
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,840
When you quit listening to us, we'll no longer be there.

1095
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,260
You have to make the primordial matter of nature stand up and salute.

1096
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:23,080
Hey, Bob, man.

1097
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:23,820
Woo!

1098
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,160
Yeah!

1099
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,660
Give me some of that meat brownies.

1100
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,020
Prop it up!

1101
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,400
You!

1102
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,300
Pass that prop, prop smoker.

1103
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,400
Prop it up!

1104
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,120
Prop, prop.

1105
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,760
Give me some prop.

1106
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,100
Give me that trouble smoker.

1107
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,100
Put that prop on.

1108
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,200
There's a big party for Bob, but he's in a trance.

1109
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,740
There's a big party for Bob, but it's okay, he's in a trance.

1110
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,220
He's dead!

1111
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,240
Wild party!

1112
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,580
But he's in a trance.

1113
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,420
All the party guests are just sipping big mixed drinks.

1114
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,660
And they're chanting voodoo chants.

1115
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,340
Yada hey!

1116
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,100
Yada hey!

1117
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,180
Yada hey!

1118
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,100
Yada hey hey!

1119
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,300
This is the wall man, dear friend.

1120
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,460
The wall man.

1121
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,600
Get some props.

1122
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,900
All I got, Bob, was a batu box.

1123
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
It's okay, Bob's in a trance.

1124
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,980
This chick came over.

1125
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,300
This chick came over to get this prop from Indonesia.

1126
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,640
See his green eyes?

1127
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,820
It was just great.

1128
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,940
It was marvelous, man.

1129
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,700
Oh wow, Jerry Garcia's in a protest.

1130
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,320
And the rest is a mess.

1131
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,460
Yeah, man.

1132
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,240
It's a real band.

1133
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,080
That's Dolly Parton.

1134
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:10,720
You're a good guy.

1135
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,320
Hanging off the chandelier.

1136
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,180
Wonderful party, Bob.

1137
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,160
Wonderful.

1138
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,380
Bob, you're a good guy.

1139
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,800
Bob, I spelled something out.

1140
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,160
You got a cloth to wipe it up with or something?

1141
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,440
Dolly Parton and Paul Schaefer are making a spinach salad in the bathroom.

1142
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,760
Wrap it up.

1143
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,220
Hey!

1144
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,760
Hey, Bob.

1145
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,140
I spit on your floor, okay?

1146
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,580
Hey, Bob.

1147
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:48,580


1148
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,940
Hey, Bob.

1149
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,780
I spit on your floor, okay?

1150
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:52,780


1151
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,300
Hey!

1152
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:55,460
Hey!

1153
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,040


1154
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,960
Chop, chop.

etched, forged, and finished.

1166
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,740
These authentic replications

1167
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,900
not available in any store

1168
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,860
even on this radio station

1169
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,480
before their commission

1170
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,220
literally without regard

1171
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,800
for any quality.

1172
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,620
They come with their own

1173

adoption papers

1174
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,920
and you can bring them

1175
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,740
into their own home.

1176
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,600
You're kind of crazy.

1177
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,480
Ah, but now

1178
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,340
by special arrangement

1179
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,400
to the Postmaster General

1180
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,880
of Guam

1181
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,060
this 72-piece

1182
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,960
commemorative plinth

1183
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,600
honoring you

1184
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,240
and the footprints

1185
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,220
of the great jewel thieves

1186
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:31,900
of the French Riviera

1187
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,460
mentioned earlier

1188
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,400
each encased in its own

1189
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,360
watery silk caddy

1190
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,520
that revolves 360 degrees

1191
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,180
on genuine Swedish

1192
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,620
ball bearings

1193
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,620
has been cancelled.

1194
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:37,880
Sorry.

1195
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,820
Yes, indeed.

1196
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,060
Oh, there it goes.

1197
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,860
Oh, it hurts.

1198
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,140
But we can carry it, caller.

1199
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,840
Okay, hold on.

1200
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,600
All right.

1201
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,600
All right.

1202
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,460
The resulting confusion

1203
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,840
of all seismic signals

1204
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,380
will cause

1205
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,820
the simultaneous detonation

1206
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,960
of American warheads

1207
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,620
to arm and arm.

1208
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,820
I'm not sure

1209
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,780
if you've ever seen

1210
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,160
the money

1211
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,160
but who signed the check.

1212
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,560
In the end,

1213
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,480
the signature

1214
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,140
is always the same.

1215
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,720
It's merely a sport

1216
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,220
to them

1217
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,000
and they do it

1218
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,500
for their own

1219
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,780
lurid

1220
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,360
misguided

1221
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,940
husband.

1222
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,300
And your own

1223
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,020
against it

1224
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,500
generating this

1225
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:39,820
voice

1226
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,160
to play

1227
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,800
a song

1228
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,200
that you can't

1229
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,200


1230
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,220
The unforgivable

1231
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,020
pleasures

1232
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,420
they derive

1233
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,300
from

1234
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,320
letting you

1235
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,540
in on the truth

1236
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,560
little by little.

1237
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,020
The truth

1238
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,080
will become

1239
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,780
very clear

1240
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,540
to you

1241
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:08,660
in a moment

1242
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,060
even now

1243
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,780
when you're

1244
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,300
deciding

1245
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,380
in the mind

1246
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,420
you've convinced

1247
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:17,860
yourself

1248
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,420
you possess

1249
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,680
soon to be

1250
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,420
replaced

1251
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,840
at your request

1252
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,620
to

1253
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,460
the man

1254
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,200
that set them free.

1255
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,620
But surely

1256
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,080
if they can мол

1257
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,380
to spontaneously

1258
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:52,700
abandon

1259
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,320
the crew

1260
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,640
who started

1261
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:55,660
before

1262
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:55,700
you

1263
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,340
anner

1264
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:58,380
that was

1265
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:58,440
in your

1266
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:58,480
truce,

1267
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:58,600
there is

1268
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:57,440
some

1269
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:57,820
at the

1270
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,600
fugitives from your consciousness arguing this very moment.

1271
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,880
Arguing with the elder gods.

1272
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,220
Arguing for your souls.

1273
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,100
The parchment is signed by your willingness to participate.
