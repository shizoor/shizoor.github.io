1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
What, what, what?

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,060
The station's full of aliens.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,860
And I'm sick to my stomach.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,980
Look at this thing.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,560
A fetus.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,580
They've changed the way the boards are set up.

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,500
Yes, my friends, but we will persevere

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,640
because this is the hour of slack

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
on which we can only but, but seek

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,480
to find that which will play our takes.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,240
Dr. Smith, radio operator.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,720
No trouble.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Get set, let's go and aim.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,300
According, everything's going fine.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,100
No trouble.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,280
Oh, yeah.

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:48,800
Yes, dear friends, this is hour of slack number 1021.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Except that it's really a rerun of, get this,

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,860
hour of slack number three.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,680
Yes, the third show.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Ever done.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,160
And it was done 20 years ago this month

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,760
in early November 1985.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,280
And it was done at the once good Dallas station, K-N-O-N,

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,200
the day after a big subgenius revival at a bar

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,500
called the Twilight Room.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,300
It was a Halloween revival, which we called the Scary Ball.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,660
And it was a show that starred Doctors for Bob

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,880
and Brother Cleve Duncan

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,520
and all sorts of guests from out of town,

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,220
some of whom were in the studio

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,980
for this third hour of slack,

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
including the baby Gary Gabrog-Fran

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,200
from the Puzzly Evidence Show,

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,080
the baby Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,400
in for Dobstown 3 in Brazil,

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,600
and the baby Dr. Onan Canobite,

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,160
all of them in the studio.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,700
And we had really good,

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,560
good tapes of Doctors for Bob

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,000
live in concert the night before.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,140
And you'll hear yours truly,

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Reverend Ivan Stang, as a baby

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,660
and all hoarse from preaching

46
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,060
and confused at being a DJ at the mixing board

47
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,880
because it was only my third time.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,760
I was 32.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,260
An infant.

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,500
Still, friends, it proves the rock-steady

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
historical bedrock of slack.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,680
It's so as evidenced by this ancient show

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,540
and then 20 years later,

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,880
this great music behind me,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
which I'm playing right now,

56
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,360
which is from the new album

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,440
by the Flying Ryan Brothers

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,340
called Blue Marble.

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,660
Incredible instrumental dual guitar music

60
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,760
by these Flying Ryan Brothers.

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,260
Friends, you can get more information

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,440
about that from,

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,220
uh, ryanetics.com.

64
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,060
Uh, yes.

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,460
Sort of like Dianetics,

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520
but it's the Ryan Brothers.

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,580
R-Y-A-N.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,780
Ryanetics.com.

69
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,100
Uh, yes.

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,060
And, uh, so prepare yourself

71
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,020
to go back in time 20 years

72
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,180
to Hour of Slack number three.

73
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,120
R-Y-A-N.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,900
Welcome, potential initiates,

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
and remain with us

76
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
for the next 30 minutes.

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,540
Mob?

78
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,660
Mob?

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,040


80
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,260
The message is now part of

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,700
and registered in your subconscious mind

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,860
every time you say,

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,080
see, hear, or think.

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
What about slack?

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,180
That's your key phrase.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,040
It will trigger the entire message

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,120
without your being aware of it.

88
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,780
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

89
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,240
Hour of Slack.

90
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,980
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

91
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,760
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

92
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,880
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,480
Megafist Temple Lodge

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,340
of the Church of the Subgenius

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,180
with Pastor Buck Naked

96
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,560
of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,900
The opinions,

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,280
the opinions expressed

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,780
are not necessarily those

100
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,480
of this radio station.

101
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,980
Before the sermon,

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,040
a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

103
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,760
living avatar of slack,

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,280
and saint of silence

105
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,820
on planet Earth.

106
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,640
Are we controlled by secret forces?

107
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,480
Do you ever get the feeling

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,960
that free will is a joke?

109
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,320
Do people think you're strange?

110
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Do you?

111
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,460
Then you may be on the right track.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,940
Are you abnormal?

113
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,000
Then you are probably better than most people.

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,140
Yes, your time shall triumph.

115
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, at last,

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,660
the step-by-step process is revealed.

117
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,780
This is it.

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
The only faith that promises

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
action, thrill, success in sex and business.

120
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,500
Bring your weirdest dreams

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,760
to rampaging life.

122
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,000
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,980
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

124
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,260
This is a way of life to millions

125
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,840
Yet half of it don't even know it.

126
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,620
Is the one, true, living Slack Master

127
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,760
With spiritual know-how

128
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,500
to help you

129
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,340
bash through the locked doorway

130
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,720
to financial heaven.

131
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,680
spiritual know-how

132
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,520
He is the one, real shortcut to Slack.

133
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,240
Ehhh

134
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,060
Heeewww

135
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,640
Heeejar crack

136
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:50,640


137
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,660
will see another to mention

138
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,100
on your TV.

139
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,580
Just fear a sharpest of removal no longer,

140
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,960
just fear a sharpest of removal no longer,

141
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,440
Become physically attractive overnight.

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,040
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

143
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,080
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

144
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,360
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

145
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,000
And coming right back.

146
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Plus, bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

147
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,400
To help you create the highest possible earnings.

148
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,060
From the psychodynamics of abnormality.

149
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,300
To turn conspiracy and blinded personality disorders around.

150
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,680
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

151
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,500
That will fool normals and get you sex.

152
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

153
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,660
Ah, yes, it's the hour of slack.

154
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,900
Welcome, welcome once again.

155
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,840
And yes, after the usual slow takeoff, it's hard to get these shows off the ground.

156
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,540
Especially when you're at the very end of your so-called rope.

157
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:24,860
And indeed we are, folks, because we, if any of you were at the amazing subgenius masquerade scary ball last night at the Twilight Room.

158
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,620
There's more rope in here.

159
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,260
We came to show off the ground.

160
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,320
We're gonna make it big.

161
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,300
Yes.

162
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,840
No, there's no, you can use chewing gum and stuff.

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,520
That's the way this station is held together.

164
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,420
And, oh, this station is on KNON 99.9 FM in Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington.

165
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,820
Put one right in this, in this, in this thing.

166
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,460
This, yeah, this body shrimp.

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,180
Now, who are you?

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,860
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

169
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,760
There's this, there was only supposed to be one person on this show.

170
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,500
And all of a sudden we've got shows from San Francisco and Brazil and Tennessee.

171
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

172
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,260
Yeah.

173
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,380
Yeah.

174
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


175
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


176
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


177
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,380


178
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,920
And we've walked in to the radio tabernacle here in Dallas, Texas.

179
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,380
Oh, yes.

180
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Oh, yes.

181
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,700
Dear friends.

182
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,560
Reach for those checkbooks.

183
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,300
We're so.

184
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,920
That's right.

185
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,200
Reach for those checkbooks.

186
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,280
But you can't write that check to the subgenius foundation because we can't pray for money over the air.

187
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,960
That's right.

188
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,320
With this FCC license.

189
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,060
But, but we can pray for you to send money to this station.

190
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,160
But we can ask you to bring all those things down to the stations now.

191
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,600
Yeah, more of those things.

192
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,840
The things that you keep in your drawers.

193
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,120
That's right.

194
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,140
That's right.

195
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,860
Those little things that you don't want the.

196
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,960
You're not supposed to talk about drawers on this radio station.

197
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,500
Okay.

198
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,360
We're a broke fan.

199
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
Keep in the bloomers.

200
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,440
Bring those things.

201
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,740
Yeah.

202
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,180
Bloomers.

203
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,620
That's it.

204
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,020
Okay.

205
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,740
Yes.

206
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,040
Bring those things, ladies and gentlemen.

207
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
And your parents.

208
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,020
Tell your parents to listen right now because this is going to be the most offensive piece

209
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,960
of radio you've ever heard in Dallas, Texas.

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,620
Let's try.

211
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,740
We'll, we'll try.

212
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,160
We'll be.

213
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
Let's put it that way.

214
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Strangely enough, somehow the show has ended up with a number of subgenius celebrities.

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,700
Celebrity guests.

216
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,160
That's right.

217
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,360
Dr.

218
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,820
Gary Gabrog, friend, star of the amazing subgenius show in Berkeley, California, which you will

219
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,480
be hearing on and off in a most confusing manner as we, as we slowly fade in.

220
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,920
Oh, wait.

221
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,160
What?

222
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,620
What?

223
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,100
The collars?

224
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,500
Are there?

225
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,620
We finally got collars here.

226
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,340
Thanks, folks.

227
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,840
We're not going to cover anything.

228
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,560
Poor girl.

229
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,180
She's in a bubbling vat of jokes.

230
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,900
We're going to throw a tarp over it and protect it from the elements.

231
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah, we may throw a tarp over it, but we probably, that's all we'll cover.

232
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,560
This young lady has the jokes.

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,920
All day.

234
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:24,980
Yeah.

235
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,800
She's soaking in the jokes.

236
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,460
We're going to use them.

237
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,600
We're going to use them.

238
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,040
We're stationed right now.

239
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
We'll cover you up with something soft and warm, too.

240
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,320
We're going to have to reverse the charger.

241
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,560
This is a tarp that's been soaked in water.

242
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,060
You're already covered?

243
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,960
Well, yeah, good.

244
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,740
She has one of those champions.

245
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,240
Actually, you know, a lot of depilatories can help in these.

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,820
She was covered pretty well, but maybe not.

247
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,980
With these more dishes, they're covered by the horrible fur that the KPFH gives to each

248
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,640
of their customers.

249
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,240
My screen.

250
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,520
Don't yell.

251
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,420
It's the only phone you have.

252
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,340
My screen's dark.

253
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,780
Okay, there we go.

254
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,980
What's happening to my picture?

255
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,100
Okay, that's very broad.

256
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,580
I don't know.

257
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,980
You could have been talking to that last caller instead of us.

258
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,460
I'd be up and forget about it all myself.

259
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,240
Listen, caller.

260
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
I'll give you the previous caller's phone number.

261
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,920
All these guys are dreams in my head.

262
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,620
There's a storm in here.

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm getting cold.

264
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,900
I don't like it.

265
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm in the dark.

266
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,100
I do like it.

267
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,040
I want to go home.

268
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,260
This is the most miserable thing I've ever seen.

269
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,160
It's joyous.

270
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,660
I can't even see Mobius Rex now.

271
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,980
It's as dark as a poor little bit.

272
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,560
Bit.

273
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:19,980
Bit.

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,220
Bit.

275
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,460
Bit.

276
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,740
We're having some more serious, serious technical difficulties.

277
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,280
We seem to be colliding with shows from other states.

278
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,820
It's so hard.

279
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,760
We've got to drag this show out into the big part of the auditorium.

280
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,500
No, no, no.

281
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,780
It's illegal to get this show out on the street in Dallas.

282
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,580
Buck and I were almost arrested last week for driving this show up and down Central.

283
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,940
It's so hard.

284
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,540
What is this?

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
The story with this station.

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,960
At least they could give us air in here.

287
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,500
Well, it may not be entirely their problem, Dr. Gabrog, friend.

288
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,960
It may be the fact that we've also...

289
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:53,960


290
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:53,960


291
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:53,960


292
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:53,960


293
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,920
We've also got subgeniuses in this room from as far away as, yes, Brazil.

294
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,060
The incredible and rather disgusting Brazilian clench has been represented.

295
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,780
See, when we do a show at the Twilight Room, oh, people in Dallas.

296
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
People in Dallas, oh, they can't...

297
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:16,940
They don't always make it, but people from Knoxville, Tennessee, Santa Barbara, oh, Brazil of South America.

298
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,340
So we got the Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, mercenary of slack from the...

299
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:30,120
Dobstown 2 plantation and zombie skull farm in Brazil.

300
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,180
Welcome, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

301
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

302
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,820
Yes, he's by far got the classiest accent of any subgenius.

303
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,540
Thank you, thank you.

304
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,720
And you see, these creatures that have entered this station are actually fallout from the incredible devival.

305
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,620
And it was a devival last night.

306
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,340
It was really...

307
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,240
I feel thoroughly devived, Gary.

308
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,560
Yes.

309
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,800
I could just use a bit more, just a bit more of that liquid slack.

310
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,440
Pass another cup over here.

311
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,780
Here, here's a half-pound ton of slack.

312
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah, for those of you who were at the show last night at the Twilight Room and couldn't hear it,

313
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:13,100
we do have the amazing tapes that were recorded there.

314
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,900
So we will be cutting...

315
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,300
That's what we're saying.

316
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,720
No, no, that's why we're here, for people giving us things.

317
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,580
And we want people to bring those things down to the station.

318
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah, this is a religion of...

319
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,620
We're asking forgiveness of everything.

320
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,180
We want forgiveness from you for us and hate from you for the conspiracy.

321
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,080
That's right.

322
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,340
The conspiracy that makes you not understand what we're talking about.

323
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,940
Because if it weren't for them, why?

324
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,320
There'd be nothing on the air in Dallas except subgenius shows.

325
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,140
And you may groan to think such a nightmarish thought, but actually the...

326
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,280
We've decided...

327
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah, listen to them.

328
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,660
Even the...

329
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,680
Even the subgenius doctors themselves in terrible, terrible pain.

330
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,560
We're near death here, and believe me, we can't just ask you to walk out and kill normals.

331
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,040
We can't ask you to do that kind of thing on this station.

332
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,200
We can't ask you to do what would be the rightful work of Dobbs.

333
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,940
No, because it's against the law.

334
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,780
It's against the law for us to do those things.

335
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,520
Gary, would you get the show off Reverend Onan's foot?

336
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,200
I think it's perfect.

337
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, man.

338
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,340
The show...

339
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,740
I don't want to touch that show.

340
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,280
You know what happened last time I stuck my finger in the show?

341
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,360
Oh, no.

342
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,180
Well, friends, we don't want to be talking about that.

343
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,480
There's just something wrong.

344
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:37,240
But we do also have Dr. Onan Canobite of the amazing subgenius band, Dr. Onan's Wotan Band,

345
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,720
as well as the famous occupant.

346
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,100
Yes.

347
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,980
Yeah, there.

348
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,940
Yes, you can hear.

349
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,420
Now, Dr. Onan is only a tape recording.

350
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,620
And yet at the same time...

351
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,220
See, we've got a crowded show tonight.

352
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,880
We have over 100 guests.

353
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,940
Over 10,000.

354
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,400
And too many listeners.

355
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,280
I don't think that we can cram the show into that many radios.

356
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,940
I don't think it'll...

357
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,920
Just line up and keep it quiet here.

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,900
I haven't got enough room.

359
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,260
It's going to thin out.

360
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,660
Right.

361
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,440
If we try to reach too many listeners, it'll just dilute it.

362
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,260
Now, a subgenius church can be a franchise in your own area.

363
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,400
And it's also called, in church jargon, it's called a clench.

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
It's called a clench.

365
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,860
Now, Onan was the one who figured out, who started his own solo...

366
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,120
A little.

367
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,440
...clench.

368
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,040
A little.

369
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,060
And it's schismed all over itself.

370
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,200
So tell us about that.

371
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,220
Mm-hmm.

372
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,480
Mm-hmm.

373
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:28,560
Mm-hmm.

374
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,220
That's what you're most famous for in town.

375
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,860
I want you to know that.

376
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,100
Schism.

377
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,720
I see.

378
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,060
Yes.

379
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,580
I didn't see the schism in the way.

380
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,020
The solos, the stark fist acting upon a solo clench, resulting in ultimate schism.

381
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,940
And friends, you know, most of these religions...

382
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,300
...most of these religions...

383
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,880
...they indulge in tremendous infighting between denominations.

384
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,860
We encourage infighting between denominations.

385
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:51,860


386
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:51,860


387
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:51,860


388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,740
That's true.

389
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:00,060
No two subgenius denominations should ever dominate one another, especially not if they're the same.

390
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,260
And if any two subgeniuses are the same, one must die.

391
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,520
That's true.

392
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Because this is...it's different.

393
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,080
You know what I mean?

394
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,560
I was going to ask, Dr. Onan, were you the one that had the first church in the round, the circumschism?

395
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,340
No, that was just hearsay, just rumor.

396
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,120
That was just a joke.

397
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,640
Oh, it's reverend hearsay.

398
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,720
Yes, I remember that.

399
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:19,960
Reverend hearsay.

400
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,860
These are the kind of things that we can't say out loud.

401
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,380
You see, we're going to be on a radio station, KPFA in Berkeley, California.

402
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,600
These are the kind of guests that we can't have on our station.

403
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,460
Yes, but K-N-O-N is a non-station, you see.

404
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,340
And because of that, we can get away with things that they would never suspect anyone of, especially not us.

405
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,780
But we're going to...we've got to...the problem is...

406
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,400
Lucky track recordings.

407
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,320
...we have so many great tapes that we can play for you, all by subgeniuses.

408
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,680
Ah, yes.

409
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,100
And you would think...

410
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,400
Now, I don't want to hear a bunch of amateur garage bands, but...

411
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,840
You see, music by subgeniuses could include, and let me name drop, boys, let me name drop.

412
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:11,580
Music by subgeniuses could include George Clinton, Devo, Ernest Tubbs, and even Dr. Onan Canabite, who is here and whose tape we are about to play now.

413
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,120
You can buy this tape, friends, from the Subgenius Foundation, but it's against the law for us to tell you that.

414
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,920
So turn off your tape recorders.

415
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:31,640
And indulge in a little, and after Dr. Onan's, I think we'll be flipping Wellmans out and going into the next little Wellman of the revival, the Scary Ball revival.

416
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,580
Last night, thank you, dear friends.

417
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,800
Oh, yes.

418
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,560
Thank you.

419
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,100
Thank you.

420
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,320
Thank you.

421
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
Thank you.

422
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,360
Thank you.

423
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,140
Thank you.

424
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,380
Thank you.

425
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,580
Yes, dear friends, that was the amazing Dr. Onan.

426
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,100
Well, that was actually Occupat.

427
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,080
And they're a panting bunch.

428
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,780
Now hold it.

429
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,100
What was that?

430
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,180
Clown the ballerina here and there.

431
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,120
Clown the ballerina everywhere.

432
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,460
Oh, no, that's not.

433
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,120
That was mean.

434
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,360
Why'd you do that to that little girl?

435
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,320
You've got to get the babies out of this room.

436
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,920
It's hard to find a place to sit or walk.

437
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,640
You guys act like a bunch of babies.

438
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,720
What are you doing on the air?

439
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
A bunch of stinky little subgenius rats.

440
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,920
Well, what about Roo Mouse and what about Paul's kitty?

441
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,140
Well, it's also illegal to talk about California deities in Texas, Dr. Gbrog.

442
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,220
Friend, there's only room for so many religions in this corporate state.

443
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
What happened to ecumenism?

444
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,000
Whatever happened?

445
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,780
I mean, how come we got California deities and Texas deities?

446
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,500
Is this a state church?

447
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,260
What is the problem here?

448
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,400
Exactly what?

449
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,620
I can't.

450
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,380
I can't worship Bohandas and the radio station.

451
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
All hail Roo Mouse and Bohandas.

452
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,320
And we shouldn't be peeking out the meter so badly.

453
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,700
Yeah, but what about Bob?

454
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
What about Slack and what about the conspiracy?

455
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,180
What about them?

456
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,760
Yeah.

457
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,600
The conspiracy.

458
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,660
The conspiracy has given me so much more than Bob ever gave to me.

459
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,440
Yeah, it's true.

460
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,260
The conspiracy does pay better than Bob Dobbs or, for that matter, almost any other religious savior.

461
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,540
But the conspiracy isn't.

462
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,420
It's not quite as much fun.

463
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,380
And we had a...

464
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,320
Did you get the check in the mail?

465
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, I got the check.

466
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,160
You see what I mean, folks?

467
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,880
Go tell Stang.

468
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,500
I just...

469
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,960
Go tell me.

470
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,580
The Bob said came down and said the check's in the mail and I haven't heard from him since.

471
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,960
You guys are going to have to talk to doctors for Bob about that.

472
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,460
Hey, where's my...

473
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,080
Okay.

474
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,860
Well, folks, for those of you who weren't at the scary ball last night, that's too bad.

475
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,540
But for those who were and still couldn't hear it because of the strange acoustics that go with rock and roll,

476
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,320
performances, we are bringing in some beautiful lilting melodies from Doctors for Bob,

477
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,260
most of whom could not be here tonight.

478
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:03,340
Some of them are lost in the station and we're digging through these boxes of cassettes.

479
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,180
I want to say I just stepped on Buck.

480
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,280
That's right.

481
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,560
Oh, poor Buck.

482
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,520
It's okay, Buck. Get up. You'll be all right.

483
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,220
Okay.

484
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,140
Well, the Twilight Room, we'll just go ahead and play this lovely...

485
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,860
Just remember, if you'd been there last night, you'd be changed.

486
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,620
But we're going to start off...

487
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,340
We're going to start off with a religious gospel hymn from Doctors for Bob called,

488
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,040
You can't, and that is can't, hide from God.

489
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,300
Because he's meaner than you.

490
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,160
You can't hide from God.

491
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,800
Because he's bigger than you.

492
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,360
Help me, somebody.

493
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,100
You can't hide from God.

494
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,640
Because he's bigger than the whole universe.

495
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,960
Help me, somebody.

496
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,480
You cannot hide from God.

497
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,500
Because he's bigger...

498
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,600
Because he's bigger...

499
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,420
Because he's bigger than all reality.

500
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Help me, somebody.

501
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,180
You cannot hide from God.

502
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,340
You cannot run from your own legs.

503
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,560
Is there a person in this place tonight who can run from their own legs?

504
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,840
Yes.

505
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,240
Cuz I'm also love.'

506
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,580
Are you going to go ask him toこれ to you tonight?

507
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:14,580


508
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,480
I think it will be fun if you do thatball, inside his bed.

509
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,780
Yes.

510
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:16,900
That's what I'm going to do.

511
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


512
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


513
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


514
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


515
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


516
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


517
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


518
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


519
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:16,900


520
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,500
It's something that we do when we get home.

521
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,640
Hey, what's the details?

522
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:17,680
What's the info that's going on here like I said?

523
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:17,820
There's positive in there?

524
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:17,820


525
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:17,820


526
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,620
Why do you think our own eyes are there?

527
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,580
I don't know.

528
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:19,580


529
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,460
You cannot see your own eyes, you cannot run from your own legs, you cannot hide from God.

530
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,020
Help me somebody. She ain't got no legs, my legs on fire.

531
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,680
They're a problem, my mind's still okay.

532
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,340
Right side.

533
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,440
You cannot wet water.

534
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,120
How you gonna wet water?

535
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,420
You can throw water on it, that's gonna make more water.

536
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
You cannot wet water, you cannot see your own eyes.

537
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
You cannot run from your own legs.

538
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,260
You cannot wet water.

539
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:49,540
You cannot wet water.

540
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,280
You cannot wet water.

541
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,680
You cannot wet water.

542
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,860
You cannot wet water.

543
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,120
You cannot wet water.

544
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,280
You cannot wash soap.

545
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,940
It's already the cleanest substance on earth.

546
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,360
You cannot do salt and hash and put the yeast together and try to wash soap.

547
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,300
You cannot wash soap.

548
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,660
You cannot wet water.

549
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,940
You cannot see your own eyes, you cannot run from your own legs.

550
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,400
You cannot hide from God.

551
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,420
Help me somebody. She ain't got no legs.

552
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,460
My legs.

553
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,040
They're on fire.

554
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,860
My God.

555
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,620
Help me somebody.

556
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,420
They're a problem.

557
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,880
They need some help, but I ain't a clear.

558
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,900
Oh, ho, ho.

559
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,120
A lovely hymn.

560
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,860
Yes, indeedy.

561
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,280
I mean, here.

562
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,140
We got so much stuff we could play here.

563
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,740
It's just...

564
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,700
It's pathetic, doctor.

565
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,860
It's all pathetic stuff.

566
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,600
That's the problem.

567
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,480
That was 112 more guests.

568
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,680
We got people waiting outside the station.

569
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,900
Been waiting outside for three days just to get on this show.

570
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,560
Just the two minutes that they want to say,

571
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,020
Hi, Mom, or Hi, Bob, or...

572
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,540
Hello, Kitty.

573
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,940
Yeah, they think Bob might be...

574
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,480
Hi, girls.

575
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,140
Yeah, we'll have to...

576
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,480
Buck says we have to do that on.

577
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,080
Oh, Buck's such a stickler for FCC details.

578
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,140
Go ahead.

579
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,680
You would be, too, if you had the problems of this station.

580
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,440
That's true.

581
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,260
That's true.

582
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,220
There's demons attacking this...

583
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,640
That's right.

584
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,380
There are...

585
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,000
Let me tell them about that demon, okay?

586
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,460
Okay.

587
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,420
Yeah, just...

588
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,440
Just refer to it as a demon just in case.

589
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,160
I...

590
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,480
I...

591
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
I hate that old demon.

592
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,460
That demon, he got...

593
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:06,200
He got to my mistress and left her in the back of my Mark IV Continental with eight sleeping pills in her and the motor running and that.

594
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,180
I...

595
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,340
I hate that old demon.

596
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,680
That demon...

597
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:18,580
I went to the store to buy shoes for the children and come back and I go into a trance and a fog comes over my mind and I'm like, whoa.

598
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,400
Hey, hey, hey.

599
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,460
The shoes was in the back of the...

600
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,980
It was gone from the back of the car and there's just three empty liquor bottles back there and I...

601
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,400
I...

602
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,320
I hate that old demon.

603
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,300
Funny.

604
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:31,940
Funny.

605
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,260
You know, you shouldn't have married that demon, Buck, if that's the case.

606
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:35,560
Yeah.

607
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,560
Shouldn't have hired that demon, Buck.

608
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,020
Yeah.

609
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,240
Shouldn't be paying taxes to that demon.

610
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,680
You shouldn't have gotten him...

611
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,340
You shouldn't have just signed that contract with that demon.

612
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,560
If the laws in this county were any better, you wouldn't even ever have the bail...

613
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,240
You shouldn't have hired that demon.

614
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,560
Okay, but by the way...

615
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,100
You shouldn't have filled out that job application for that demon, Buck.

616
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,620
You signed up for that beautiful little...

617
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,120
Okay, Buck.

618
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,220
Well, it ain't straight up yet.

619
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,200
It ain't straight up yet.

620
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,500
Well, just a moment.

621
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,000
We'll...

622
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,760
Don't worry, Buck.

623
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,720
They got bills for that.

624
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,160
That's right.

625
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,100
It'll be soon.

626
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,900
Now, we gotta...

627
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,480
That's right, friends.

628
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,180
We gotta tell you what...

629
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,040
Where we are until it's straight up.

630
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,320
Yeah, and...

631
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,740
And you can help, friends, if you can just stimulate your radio enough.

632
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,040
That's right.

633
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,860
Put your hand on that radio and...

634
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,320
Love.

635
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,740
Love.

636
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,040
Love.

637
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,480
Love.

638
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,560


639
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,060
Put your hands on the radio.

640
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,820
And if you turn on a...

641
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,500
Feel the power.

642
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,040
The healing power come through.

643
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,500
That's right.

644
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,700
You can feel the power of your radio warming your hand up and that's...

645
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,300
Okay, close enough.

646
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,580
You gotta get...

647
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,140
Wait a minute.

648
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,760
Wait a minute, Buck.

649
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,660
We're playing it.

650
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,660
We're still scared.

651
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,360
We're still scared.

652
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,820
We're still scared and we're still doing a show.

653
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,400
It's scary in here.

654
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,640
There's something weird going on in this station.

655
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,380
Wait till...

656
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,980
The show!

657
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,060
The show is going on!

658
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,540
Let's see it.

659
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,500
Hey, man, there's something wrong with the wiring on this show and the wiring...

660
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,200
That's the thing is for hiding.

661
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,320
Uh, what did you say, Bob?

662
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,200
I said...

663
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,860
Good Lord!

664
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,460
What's to lose?

665
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,860
A little time?

666
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,080
Hurt your ego a little bit, baby?

667
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,880
You probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now, so that's no big deal.

668
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,920
So why not?

669
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,580
So why not?

670
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

671
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,660
I don't know.

672
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,860
You don't know.

673
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,280
And you will never know.

674
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
You have signed the application.

675
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,460
You do have the kit.

676
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,740
None of those things are important.

677
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,720
But there is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.

678
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:32,300
And you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is going to say about it.

679
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,020
Because nobody else is going to pay your bills for you.

680
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,900
Why not?

681
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,020
You don't know.

682
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
And you will never know.

683
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,320
And who knows?

684
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,100
Just maybe.

685
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,480
Just maybe.

686
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,320
You could have one of the biggest.

687
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,440
I don't know.

688
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,480
But even more important, you don't know.

689
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,160
And you will never know.

690
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,520
You will never know.

691
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,520
Just maybe.

692
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,220
You're in for a new and exciting experience.

693
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,580
You have signed the application.

694
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,300
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail?

695
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,120
Or are you going to write in and get your pipe?

696
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,500
I'm still waiting for the cast.

697
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,660
The cast?

698
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,560
Well, the cast is all here, unfortunately.

699
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,200
They'll be outside your house to sing a song about 8 o'clock this morning.

700
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,260
Actually, we're expecting Vic Morrow, too.

701
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,920
Yeah, he's going to be starring in all the body parts.

702
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, he dropped out.

703
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,080
I just want to know, you guys are very informative tonight, but I want to know, what planet are we on?

704
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,260
Oh, me too.

705
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,380
We aren't planning this.

706
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,560
This is, uh...

707
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,440
Oh, it's all planned.

708
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,960
Bob, look.

709
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,900
Go ahead and admit.

710
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,600
See, look, look.

711
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,140
Page.

712
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:54,880
Page.

713
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,040
A plan and a conspiracy.

714
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,880
Look, I'm on page 16.

715
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,240
It says, Lady Calls Talks About Chili.

716
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,600
I mean, all this stuff is...

717
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,660
You can't fool these people.

718
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,360
Yeah, I'm tired of this script.

719
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,040
Let's go to this script here.

720
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,640
No, look.

721
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,420
Do my stuff.

722
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,020
My stuff's really funny.

723
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,280
Hey, look.

724
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,880
Prepare for the auto-cataclysm of my hoarding food.

725
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,140
Gold guns, ammo, and gas.

726
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,980
Long-abundant survival techniques.

727
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,380
Learn.

728
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,200
Learn how to kill.

729
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,500
Of course, you don't want to kill a sub-genius believer, but...

730
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:32,780
God's judgment is going to come and fall again upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous society.

731
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,780
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

732
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,520
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

733
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,160
It's a strange world out there.

734
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,400
It's kind of...

735
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,560
This is what life is.

736
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,080
It's like...

737
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,860
At a...

738
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,780
At a bottom-line level.

739
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,020
You know, and I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.

740
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,900
Here's what it is.

741
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,840
There's no gimmick about that.

742
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,440
It's straightforward.

743
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,300
It's strong.

744
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,280
And it's elemental.

745
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,240
We are heavy stuff.

746
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,600
Rich crap.

747
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:09,900
Rude.

748
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Devil worship.

749
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,000
A wild, gnawing, animal hunger will grow in you.

750
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,740
His number is 600...

751
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,500
Three score...

752
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
That phone number is...

753
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,700
Six.

754
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,280
Three hundred six score and six hundred and nine hundred and sixty-six.

755
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,780
We're...

756
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,700
No, no, we're...

757
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,260
No, don't worry.

758
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,620
You guys...

759
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,360
There's nothing here.

760
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,920
Then we can make the plans now.

761
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,720
We can really reveal the plans.

762
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,760
No, there's no problem.

763
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,280
No, don't reveal the plans.

764
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,500
But we can't talk about any of this stuff.

765
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,380
We can't talk about both.

766
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,380
Or Rumaus.

767
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,300
Or Kitty.

768
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,100
No, don't...

769
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,560
Please, don't talk about any...

770
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,940
Because those confused people...

771
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,260
Bohandas...

772
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,160
Bohandas was walking through Tokyo.

773
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,700
Bohandas is the friend of all the little children.

774
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,680
And what about Wolwo?

775
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,140
Yes, friends.

776
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,540
Halloween is getting closer and closer.

777
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,760
And it is going to be very scary.

778
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,800
Here in the subgenius world.

779
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,340
And even out there in the world of reality.

780
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,720
Stand up on your...

781
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,160
Everybody wants to have great movies.

782
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,080
And we have our soap.

783
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,980
I can't take it.

784
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,740
You can't...

785
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,880
You can't clean...

786
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,260
You can't wash soap.

787
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
What are you going to do?

788
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:18,820
Cut...

789
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,200
Cut that bar of soap in half.

790
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,460
And rub it against itself.

791
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,460
Soap is the cleanest thing known to man.

792
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,200
You can't wash this show out of your ears either.

793
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,220
You tried scrubbing it out.

794
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,460
You tried rubbing it out.

795
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,700
You tried scouring it out.

796
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,780
This is the show that stinks.

797
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,640
You go listen to six hours of Beethoven right now.

798
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,760
And I can guarantee you, you'll still hear this show tomorrow morning.

799
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,320
That's right.

800
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,640
That's the thing about these subgenius shows.

801
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,760
You can turn off your radio.

802
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,180
You can stop your car.

803
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,780
You can run away from it.

804
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,860
But you keep hearing it.

805
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,660
Lay in bed at night.

806
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
Close your eyes.

807
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,540
You can even put the cables to your power supply.

808
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,980
And you still get the show.

809
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,440
Oh, it's a scary show at times.

810
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,520
It's in my ear.

811
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,180
It's in my ear.

812
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,860
No, no.

813
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,520
That wasn't...

814
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,320
That's not the show.

815
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,960
That's one of those creatures.

816
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,580
That's right, Dr. Jewell.

817
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,060
That was that thing that was growing on you earlier today.

818
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,680
Oh, no.

819
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,580
It's in my ear now?

820
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,600
It's in your ear.

821
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,240
Oh, no.

822
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm going to have to change shirts as well as shorts.

823
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,920
This is awful.

824
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,540
Well, doctors, what do you think?

825
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,340
I've got a whole stack of wellmen here.

826
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,580
And we've got everything from more...

827
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,760
Last night's Twilight Room to more sick music by Healthy Sub-Gene Eye and vice versa.

828
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,360
Doctors.

829
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,260
Let's vote.

830
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,340
Call into the station right now and vote.

831
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,940
That's right.

832
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,040
Even though we can't take your calls on the air, you can still call this station.

833
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,260
That's right.

834
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,920
You can vote.

835
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,820
Pastor Beckett will take your calls.

836
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,520
By your own personal biorhythms.

837
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,880
Calculate your vote.

838
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,320
Even if we give you your own phone number over the air.

839
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,760
What is your phone number, by the way?

840
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,860
And we'll call you.

841
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,580
That's right.

842
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,700
Call us and tell us.

843
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:48,880
Call us.

844
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:48,920
Call us.

845
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


846
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


847
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


848
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


849
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


850
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


851
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


852
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:48,920


853
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,920
We can't remember our phone number over here.

854
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,280
Oh, you want the phone number?

855
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,620
Yeah.

856
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,520
What is the phone number?

857
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,140
Okay.

858
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,140
To call us here.

859
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,320
Subgenius calls it.

860
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,060
Why not?

861
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,900
Oh, for this.

862
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,080
Here's your shit.

863
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,600
Do it now or you might forget.

864
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,420
Boy, Buck does that so nicely.

865
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,800
He does.

866
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,460
Buck is a professional.

867
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,180
Can you come out to California and say his station ID for us?

868
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:08,880
Cool.

869
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,480
Buck underwent four operations to get his vocal cords to be able to do that.

870
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,260
But he still hasn't been wellmenized.

871
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,920
Well, let's do this.

872
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,840
Let's do that to him after the show.

873
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,980
And I'll inform the head.

874
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,240
The head.

875
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,340
What about the head?

876
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,920
What about the scary poster of Dodge thing?

877
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,500
That evil head.

878
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,660
There's no sign of Wellman.

879
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,880
There's no sign of Wellman.

880
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,520
We're just landlady right here and hoping that we can get in touch with him.

881
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:36,980
Wellman's gone.

882
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,240
Yeah, Wellman's gone.

883
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,800
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

884
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,980
Friends, beware that head.

885
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,000
Save it.

886
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,760
I left the little Wellman at home.

887
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:59,460
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens

888
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,200
down at Onion Creek Country Club and golf course.

889
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,180
Thumping slowly like an over-enlarged fig,

890
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,000
the bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood.

891
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:28,540
It hovered briefly over the sand trap and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion

892
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:36,180
at an angle of about 44.325 degrees, like a shot off a shovel.

893
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,100
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

894
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,260
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.

895
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,680
The population.

896
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,100
The population of southeast Austin went wild.

897
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,020
They tore off their clothes, danced in the streets and said,

898
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,560
The bloody head has come.

899
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,320
The time is here.

900
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,900
Take off your clothes and be somebody.

901
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,020
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.

902
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,880
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently, buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

903
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,660
Slowly, the blood of Arnold Palmer rose.

904
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:17,660


905
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,640
Slowly, still ever moving upwards, it wobbled slightly,

906
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:29,400
spraying a small losando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it,

907
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,800
healing two old ladies and giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

908
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,640
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the Piazza di Piazza,

909
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:47,640


910
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:47,640


911
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:47,640


912
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:47,640


913
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,440
a forward-control radar access plant at Bergstrom Air Force Base.

914
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,020
Three interceptors were scrambled, one of which crashed on takeoff.

915
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,400
They could find nothing.

916
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,280
The radar was still tracking the dead.

917
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:14,780
The bloody head moved north, rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.

918
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:25,600
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was moving north-northeast,

919
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,080
while ascending still upwards towards the constellation of Orion.

920
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,620
The bloody head moved on.

921
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:43,400
Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

922
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,580
117 ó

923
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,580
2

924
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:14,700
7

925
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:14,720
8

926
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,740
9

927
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:14,760
15

928
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,980
trouble you go to to raise these tapes right they go awry rub magnets on the back of them yeah and

929
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,040
they still go out yeah it's it's lovely it's a miracle what's happening i don't know i think

930
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,520
the show just died saturday are we in little rock no no we were in little rock on wednesday yeah

931
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,500
we're going to be in san francisco la this is the subgenius world revival crusade continues next

932
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,380
cities are or my my hometown of san francisco i know there's a lot of people that are afraid

933
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,920
to know there's a person from san francisco in town because you think you might catch something

934
00:38:48,920 --> 00:39:01,640
but i want to tell you liberalism is not contagious folks unfortunately

935
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,980
stupidity might be jobs uh yeah that's more pills get right here in the whole bucket

936
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,460
yep we got the famous bucket of pills here we didn't bring the bucket of pills to the scary

937
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,000
ball at last night because only you know only three or four thousand should yeah there weren't

938
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,700
enough people to just like that yeah in two layers deep i mean i've heard that expression you're a

939
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:30,000
really great audience before but but why lie exactly really yes at the twilight room folks

940
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,220
you'll find at least uh fifty percent of the people although it is a wonderful club and they do

941
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,360
let us go in there and hurt the audience

942
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:53,660
give them a pick by watching another episode of the podcast

943
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,920
that's a good one

944
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,540
do you want to do cool

945
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,020
i'm going to go on here for a real quick dude

946
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,600
now we've gone through the entire stream and what you gotta do is on their влад müsica

947
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:07,840
make sure you're not where everyone else is

948
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,820
by dancing and responding to music.

949
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,340
Who called Doctors for Bob a band in the first place?

950
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,000
An act.

951
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,480
Yeah, they dared call it.

952
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,360
John Anders called Doctors for Bob an act.

953
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,700
Well, if Doctors for Bob is an act,

954
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,900
then that woman who came home bleeding to death

955
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,700
from losing her legs last night

956
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,460
deserves an Academy Award.

957
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,680
Copyright 1985, Jane or Harper, please.

958
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,420
Well, we're going to return to that lovely, lovely experience.

959
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,580
My legs are on fire.

960
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,920
The studio's on fire.

961
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,980
Yes, we'll be returning to the Twilight Room right about now.

962
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,760
We feel like there needs to be an explanation

963
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,060
for our very existence,

964
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
so we've got a little piece here that's called

965
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,640
The Explanation for that very reason.

966
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,400
Before we go on,

967
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,440
quote, version, unquote,

968
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,100
I'd just like to take this opportunity to state briefly

969
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,620
and for the record

970
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,040
that my fellow Doctors for Bob and myself

971
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,780
are members in good standing of a church.

972
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,880
But not just any church,

973
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
for the church to which we belong

974
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,720
just happens to be, beyond a shadow of a doubt,

975
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,640
the world's only bogus true religion.

976
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
Of course, I am referring to

977
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,880
the church of the subgenius.

978
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,720
Now, the church of the subgenius,

979
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,200
as founded by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

980
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,660
Santa Fe El Pastor Slack in 1953,

981
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,640
is the grand religion of the future.

982
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,800
Uniting superior mutants,

983
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,140
social renegades,

984
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,700
twisted geniuses,

985
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,500
and sci-fi sinners

986
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,800
in a worldwide rampage

987
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,120
of immorality

988
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,220
and prophetic

989
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,900
yucks

990
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
and drudgery.

991
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
Yucks and drudgery,

992
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,800
which will hopefully inevitably lead us directly

993
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,680
to a commodity all too naturally.

994
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,460
And today, it's modern sense

995
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,440
that you go vote society

996
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,600
and that commodity, friends, is Slack.

997
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,020
Now, Slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

998
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,960
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to drive us.

999
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,160
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the lapels

1000
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,360
and screaming at it.

1001
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,020
Now, back in the 50s, Bob himself noticed

1002
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,820
a decided lack of Slack.

1003
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,420
In our culture,

1004
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,820
he noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

1005
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,080
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy

1006
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,460
against the difference.

1007
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,160
An insidious conspiracy

1008
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,220
dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

1009
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,480
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factors.

1010
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,920
Dedicated in short to the total and utter eradication

1011
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,880
of the original Slack with which we were all born.

1012
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,900
Well, Bob wanted to find out.

1013
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:04,900


1014
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,720
He wanted to fight this conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen.

1015
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,320
And what better way, I ask ye,

1016
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,640
than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

1017
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,560
It's the Church of the Subgenius.

1018
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,420
Praise Bob!

1019
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,580
Oh, help me, somebody!

1020
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,300
Now, many people I know view the conspiracy

1021
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,400
on a very tiny, arcane, and mealy-mouthed level.

1022
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,360
You see the conspiracy only at the U.S. government,

1023
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,880
the CIA, FBI, Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod,

1024
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,800
Catholic Church, Jerusalem, Minstrel League, Council on Foreign Relations,

1025
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,060
or Trilateral Commission.

1026
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,600
Other, more occultated individuals can see to the next level.

1027
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,500
You see the conspiracy as the men in black,

1028
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,040
the green energy demons,

1029
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,460
the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the Hollow Earth,

1030
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,800
the henchmen of Negian,

1031
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,420
the Yakutism.

1032
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,360
But even they don't have the full story, ladies and gentlemen.

1033
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,380
But I'm here to tell you tonight

1034
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,000
that the conspiracy exists as none other than Jehovah One,

1035
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,240
alien space god of wrath from some corporate sin galaxy,

1036
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,720
and his stark fist of removal.

1037
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,720
Oh, help me, somebody!

1038
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,800
That's what many of you hear tonight, I'm sure.

1039
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,240
The Church of the Subgenius may sound a bit, oh, demonic.

1040
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,340
And you're right, it is demonic.

1041
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,800
But, well, speaking of benevolent demons here,

1042
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,840
well, the Church of the Subgenius does recognize

1043
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,840
every major deity of every world religion.

1044
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,960
Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, Elvis, Earl,

1045
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,140
Hank, Fudge!

1046
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,260
Rather than having one central authority great figure,

1047
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,160
the Church of the Subgenius possesses an entire pantheon,

1048
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,220
or subgenion is the word,

1049
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,960
what are referred to as short duration personal saviors,

1050
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,240
or surdurpercents.

1051
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,820
Now, as in any other major world religion,

1052
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,800
the Church of the Subgenius has certain inalienable tenets,

1053
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,880
certain basic precepts around which a life philosophy can be formed.

1054
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,360
The most important of which are...

1055
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,240
Too much!

1056
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,280
It's always better!

1057
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,120
But not enough!

1058
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,200
No!

1059
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,320
Too much!

1060
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,180
Not enough!

1061
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,400
Not enough!

1062
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,240
Too much!

1063
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,980
But is it always better than that?

1064
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,100
Make your children pray to God, help me, somebody!

1065
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,760
One soul per breath.

1066
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,260
I've done you a little more money on that soul.

1067
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,960
This soul's already hocked up to its neck.

1068
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,440
Give me some more, Church.

1069
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,680
Jehovah 7, Jehovah 12.

1070
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,120
Guy, that's gonna cost you another soul.

1071
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,480
There's three more souls.

1072
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,900
Give me a double smudge bucket of that air.

1073
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,880
Here at the station, we don't have to worry about this.

1074
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,340
We've got the souls of listeners on the way.

1075
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,940
I'll let you listen.

1076
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,180
Listeners out there, I'm like, I'm sorry to have to tell you this so late,

1077
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,100
but after listening to a subgenius show for more than 43 minutes,

1078
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,280
we can put a lock on that soul.

1079
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,220
Ah, yes, smell it.

1080
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,280
And you know, we use your souls to generate new church air

1081
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,940
for we the famous subgenius preachers.

1082
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,320
That's right.

1083
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:10,300
While you're at work, we're here spending your money and breathing your air.

1084
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,060
15,000 at least.

1085
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,020
That's right.

1086
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,580
And that's a red scent for entropy.

1087
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,920
Who is Krieger and why do these guys keep talking about stuff?

1116
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,040
Let's launch Klager.

1117
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,120
Good morning, caller.

1118
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,100
Good morning.

1119
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,780
Welcome to Berkeley, Iceland on the radio.

1120
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,440
All right.

1121
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,720
We're listening to one of the other calls.

1122
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,240
Here we go, caller.

1123
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,260
I thought you had a scary caller here.

1124
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,780
Something's a little tiny.

1125
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,720
We're able to get callers where no one else can.

1126
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,340
No.

1127
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,300
No.

1128
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,920
I see.

1129
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,520
Say no.

1130
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,840
So, you're going to have to sharpen your voice if you want to cut through this stuff.

1131
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,600
Never mind why.

1132
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,640
Just get out of the car.

1133
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,800
Take it easy there.

1134
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,920
Keep your hands above your head.

1135
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,580
Spread them.

1136
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,820
All right, turn around.

1137
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,500
Filthy.

1138
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,360
Here's the little button.

1139
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,520
A dirty button.

1140
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,020
Very well, Mr. Dobbs.

1141
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,720
Filthy button.

1142
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,740
Dirty.

1143
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,940
This car is registered as a stolen vehicle.

1144
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,060
Why can't the English teach their children how to speak, huh?

1145
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:20,720
For example.

1146
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,760
The Arabians learn Arabian.

1147
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,760
The English tongue.

1148
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,900
Yes, that's our fault.

1149
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,280
In France.

1150
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,020
Come on, show.

1151
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:26,680
Give me a screen.

1152
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,020
The British population.

1153
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,820
How is an elementary like this?

1154
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,000
Paul, learn a little more.

1155
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,460
You are so...

1156
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,640
Did I?

1157
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,860
Keep on.

1158
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,540
See them down on the old stupid show.

1159
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,340
That's the old stupid show you're listening to.

1160
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,600
That's one of those old stupid California shows.

1161
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,400
You know, they sneak in here.

1162
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,860
We had the foolish.

1163
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,140
You complete the

1164
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,280
you're serious this is?

1165
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,820
She's asking for her ghost into the dark

1166
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:05,820


1167
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,740

Like they can't sit still.

1170
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,000
choice between playing you know these it's it it in some ways is less than an hour and more than

1171
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,280
a show here as opposed to less than a show in less than an hour yeah it's kind of it's like

1172
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,320
three quarters of a show in 45 minutes basically is what you're getting yeah but but that's good

1173
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,700
because that means we can go home and go to bed crack the statues on their own yeah the people

1215
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,640
And the fish on his line is bigger in his mind than the reality of the reel he has to reel it in.

1216
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,000
You should have bit fish.

1217
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:10,240
The one that got away is the catch of the day.

1218
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,260
You should have bit fish.

1219
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,140
You took the bait, it's too late to pray.

1220
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,800
Now over you, they say the grace.

1221
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,440
Lord bless this fish.

We ate the fish.

1228
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,140
And can we take the bait?

1229
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,400
We've got to carry the weight alone.

1230
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,540
We've got to carry the weight alone.

1231
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,120
Carry the weight alone.

1232
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,900
