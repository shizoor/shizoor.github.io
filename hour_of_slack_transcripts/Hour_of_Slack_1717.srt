00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm exhausted, frustrated, and anxious to get PR's reports first.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,760
It's been seven days. Researchers say that I'm getting worse,

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,900
since long before South Carolina spun off from Virginia earlier today.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,820
Researchers say I really can't remember in English.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,520
Long-term percent is 4.65, up to 4.11 percent.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,060
A new study suggests that this PR News is getting worse.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,080
Quote, PR News, there's something pretty insidious going on.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,380
What is it? What's the matter?

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,300
I just had a terrible dream.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:41,560
What?

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,540
It was blood and fire and thunder and something awful was moving in the middle of it.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
I could hear it roar and bellow.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,740
The Self-Genius Power of Self.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,540
If I were to allow that to continue, he would blow every circuit in his body.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,340
That is correct, sir.

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,220
Testing, testing.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,900
Ah, yes, dear friends.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,380
For this hour of slack, we're in Austin.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm with Dr. Philo Drummond here.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
I can drive my truck.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,140
I can drive my truck for 22 cents a minute.

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,960
He's a little conflicted about these scooter machines that are suddenly everywhere.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,440
15 cents a minute.

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,140
You don't have to do this for a living.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,580
Good God.

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,600
Change your mind.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,340
You're buying bikes, buddy.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,760
What the fuck?

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,800
The Sub-Geniuses are in downtown Austin during South by Southwest,

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,420
handing out outdated Sub-Genius pamphlets with the Cleveland address on them.

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,780
Go back.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,420
Get some.

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,320
Are you sure?

34
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,700
What?

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,180
You're going to go down the street and regret this choice.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,680
Of course, as usual, Dr. Philo Drummond forgot something.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,960
He won't say what, and he has to go back.

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:17,840
But here we are on the streets of downtown Austin promoting the movie with the simple title of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Sub-Genius.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,040
And the world premiere is tonight, or today, this afternoon, in less than an hour.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,680
So we've got to give all these pamphlets away.

41
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,500
Okay.

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,620
So we've got to give all these pamphlets away.

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,100
Look what it did to him.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,480
Good Lord, man.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,880
Sternow's wearing a pipe-only sticker on his mouth.

46
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,140
Philo invented the pipe-only stickers.

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,620
You can be pipe any poster, and it becomes a work of art.

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,740
This town is nothing but posters right now.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,960
There's Joe Bob Briggs with a big old pipe on him.

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,980
He's already got one pipe.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,020
occurrence. Well they just grow. Nature does that. You plant one and a whole bunch grow later.

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,880
Don't let him kiss you.

53
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:16,280
Onan Canobite is with us. Pope Sternodox Kekever. Reverend Susie the Flusie.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,640
Philo was here but he had to go get something. I think I know what that means.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,620
Reverend Apostasy Fenord is here. Her sign says, are you controlled by secret forces?

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,960
Are you abnormal? Well are you?

57
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:41,860
Reverend Anna Moll is here. She handed a Bob sticker to a police officer and he promptly put it on his police car.

58
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:52,620
We've been turning these silly posters into fine art by using the three Ps of perfect pipe placement.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,620
Perfect pipe placement. One of the first things we learned.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,820
Well for us it was kind of instinctual. Philo was the one who formalized the rules.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,380
We would just wake up in the morning and start placing pipes perfectly.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,020
Right. Yeah but we were born that way. Other people have to be taught because they don't know perfect pipe placement.

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,180
They'll put them upside down.

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,940
I think the first time we placed pipes perfectly was in Peoria with P-Dawg.

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
No it was Poughkeepsie.

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
Poughkeepsie with P-Dawg. That's right.

67
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,880
Peoria was the second night.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,700
And we put them all upside down and we had to go replace them the next day because we were fucked up.

69
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,980
Well that'll happen. But see that's how you learn.

70
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,620
Yeah some people put them in the nose or in the exit wound.

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,240
They'll put them just about anywhere except with perfect placement.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,700
Okay Philo has returned. We can move on.

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,620
We're walking towards the convention center where the subgenius movies are.

74
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,540
The movies can be shown for the very first time to almost anybody.

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,320
I've actually seen it six times.

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,740
I left my phone in there.

77
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,360
Oh yeah your phone. Uh huh sure. Yeah it was just your phone.

78
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,920
It's a really gala though.

79
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,380
Yup they're handing out subgenius pamphlets.

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,700
Of course everybody walking up and down the street is handing out some kind of sticker or pamphlet.

81
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,280
People have beat us. They've been here before us.

82
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
There's pre-production.

83
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,960
There's proselytizers out here.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,220
Yeah. So it's an exciting Sunday afternoon at South by Southwest.

85
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,060
She's the proselytizer.

86
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,780
She looks like a hooker.

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,840
I recognize that woman.

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,300
Oh my god. How much?

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,140
Too many.

90
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,660
Too many.

91
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,300
If you have to ask you don't have it.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,740
Pastor Pressure and Joyce are here and St. Byron Werner.

93
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,160
Got everybody now?

94
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,600
Yeah.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,600


96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,480
Byron Werner has his rural war room instrument.

97
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,220
This is like a live rural war room concert.

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
It's more like a Punch and Judy show.

99
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,660
BAH!

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,880
Reverend Pease feels really important and handsome because he's got a special t-shirt that the

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,100
production handed us.

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,420
We even have like a dozen black choir robes but nobody seems to want to wear them.

103
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:31,680
It's too hot.

104
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,460
Oh yeah I guess so.

105
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,560
There's some free frozen yogurt keepons in there.

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
Not us.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm so cool I'm not even wearing a Bob shirt.

108
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,460
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,040
There we go.

110
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,720
We're on lounge.

111
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,320
I forgot the salute.

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,480
Please.

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm not giving you one.

115
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,400
Come back tonight.

116
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,820
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah,

117
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,440
yah, yah, yah, yah.

118
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,820
You fair?

119
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,500
Farlow is drop lifting pamphlets into people's bicycle baskets and things.

120
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,440
A free Ford F-150 coupon in here for you.

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,920
Those pamphlets are all going to be gone pretty soon.

122
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,300
The subgenius movie starts in half.

123
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,580
Half an hour at the convention center.

124
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,160
Come one, come all.

125
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,820
You won't believe your eyes.

126
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,000
You'll thank your lucky stars you were not born like them.

127
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,400
Pee your own damn ass in front of your mom.

128
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,680
Where's the Eskimo women?

129
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,940
And your grandparents.

130
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,300
And your kids.

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
Stole my pop idea.

132
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,080
Sterno.

133
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,280
If you pee your own damn ass in front of your kids and your grandparents and your mom,

134
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:55,360
you'll be at the subgenius world premiere of the documentary of the century.

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,640
Sacting towards Bethlehem.

136
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,160
No, that was the old, that was the working title.

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,120
If you urinate, you're sure to be interested in this.

138
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,700
The subgenius movie starts in 20 minutes.

139
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,360
We pee, interested.

140
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,160
Step right up.

141
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,880
We are doctors.

142
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,020
It's okay, man.

143
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,320
Show us your children.

144
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,960
We're doctors.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
We have that.

146
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,480
We have rigid cardboard certificates.

147
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,500
Show us your children.

148
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
Give us your children.

149
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,780
Bob will improve them.

150
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,540
Or change them somehow.

151
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,100
Bob will improve your children.

152
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,660
We pee, interested.

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,760
I used to be stupid and Bob cured me.

154
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,660
If you urinate, you are sure to be interested in the subgenius movie.

155
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,560
Do you urinate?

156
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,660
Praise Bob.

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,380
Join us.

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,080
If you urinate, it is only by the grace of Bob that you have.

159
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,400
By the grace of Bob shall ye pee freely.

160
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,760
It's the magic time of pee.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
It's the mighty time of pee.

162
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,460
But only.

163
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,880
If and only if.

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,900
You accept Bob into your heart.

165
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,440
Tonight.

166
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,060
Tonight.

167
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,600
Or perhaps just your eyes for a few minutes of the movie.

168
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,680
It's pretty interesting.

169
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
Or give us $20.

170
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,880
Yeah, whatever.

171
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,580
Either one.

172
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,680
We're up for any program.

173
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,540
No cards.

174
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,160
Just cash.

175
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,600
If you eat food, you'll need to see the subgenius movie.

176
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,820
You've never seen anything like it.

177
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,080
Freaks of nature.

178
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,040
The most unusual curiosities known to man.

179
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,380
You will thank your lucky stars that you were not born like them.

180
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,500
And yet they live.

181
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,600
They breathe.

182
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,580
They crawl on their belly like a reptile.

183
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,840
The subgenius movie.

184
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,060
You've seen it before.

185
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,900
In your dreams and nightmares.

186
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,760
I think Sam wants us to go that direction.

187
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,240
Ah, yes dear friends.

188
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:27,000
Even if you pyroflatulate, you will be accepted into this unity of mutants, misfits, disbelievers,

189
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,680
and praise Bob, those who will believe anything.

190
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,880
And I know that you will.

191
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,760
It's like he's done this before.

192
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,400
There's probably some still saying, hand these guys some free pamphlets.

193
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,440
They're staring at us.

194
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,380
Oh, okay, good.

195
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,460
We could go on to the movie at 3.

196
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,320
Oh, right on.

197
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:43,900
Can't wait.

198
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
You guys want a gummy bear?

199
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,860
Yeah.

200
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,340
Are they gummy bears?

201
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,860
Yes, they are.

202
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,900
I would like one.

203
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,520
You know it.

204
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,680
Come here, Seth.

205
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,500
Oh, gummy bears, I hear.

206
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,620
They're not for you.

207
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,800
They're not for you.

208
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,420
He asked me.

209
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,080
You're old.

210
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,280
I got extra if you need one, buddy.

211
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,660
He's the gummy king.

212
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:00,980
Salvation.

213
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,460
Oh, I wouldn't call me more of a vassal.

214
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,300
A vassal?

215
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,720
Uh-huh.

216
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,220
You know, we have a gummy bobs project.

217
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,060
Don't go too rough against the bar chain.

218
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,180
Oh, wait.

219
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,360
I shouldn't mention your name.

220
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,360


221
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,220
I'm your trademark dude.

222
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,400
Gummy bobs.

223
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,660
It's a secret.

224
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,380
That's right.

225
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,160
40 milligrams a piece, buddy.

226
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,980
Oh, nice, dude.

227
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,660
Thanks very much.

228
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:18,960
Enjoy.

229
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,060
You want one?

230
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,680
Sure.

231
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,180
Here you go.

232
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
Give me one.

233
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,900
Enjoy.

234
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,680
Is there anything in those?

235
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,200
Yeah.

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,740
40 milligrams.

237
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,980
How much?

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,320
40.

239
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
It's a great ride.

240
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,640
One is enough, friends.

241
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,860
One hit of Bob Dobbs is all you need.

242
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,300
From Nevada.

243
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,340
You're welcome.

244
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


245
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


246
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


247
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


248
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


249
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


250
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,340


251
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,500
It'll never come down.

252
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,200
It'll be the last drop you have to smoke.

253
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,180
They call it the weekend tuxedo box in Nevada.

254
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,580
I'm working on a new girl right now.

255
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,980
Just like the Masons, Subgenius Church is good for business deals.

256
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,700
You meet other business people.

257
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm networking.

258
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,660
Networking, friends.

259
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,800
It happens all the time.

260
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,340
Have intercourse with a beautiful live girl or literally anything else.

261
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,860
I'm going to take a look at the list of the best restaurants in the world.

262
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,220
I got so much to tell you but I don't know what to say.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm eating beef jerky every single day.

264
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
When you gonna bring a little sunshine back?

265
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,260
It's raining in my brain.

266
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm gonna make a little beer.

267
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,340


268
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,340


269
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,340


270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,660
And the sky is rolling black.

271
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,740
I gotta hang loose.

272
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
I try to rock steady.

273
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,640
I sleep in my clothes.

274
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,380
Pretend that I'm all ready.

275
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,040
I got no distractions.

276
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,020
I got too many choices.

277
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,260
I can't sleep at night.

278
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,700
I get freaked out by the noises.

279
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,940
Damn, it's good to see these faces again.

280
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,920
Since you've been gone, I've been hanging around.

281
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,220
Hanging it up.

282
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Holding it down.

283
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,300
My cats aren't dead but they sound like they're dying.

284
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,480
I get so high that I feel like I'm flying.

285
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,120
Beyond all that, things couldn't be finer.

286
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,280
Gotta let you go.

287
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,920
The house is on fire.

288
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,920
Damn, it's good to see these faces again.

289
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,900
Since you've been gone, I've been hanging around.

290
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:40,900


291
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,000
Hanging it up.

292
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,480
Holding it down.

293
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,940
When I feel like I can't keep on

294
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Trying to do this all alone.

295
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,960
I pick you up and bring you home.

296
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,020
I got so much to tell you, but I don't know what to say.

297
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,860
I wonder how you're doing a zillion miles away.

298
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,800
When you gonna bring a little sunshine back?

299
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,460
It's raining in my brain and the sky is rolling.

300
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,860
Hold on, hold on.

301
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,940
Hello?

302
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,740
Oh, hey guys.

303
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,320
Oh my gosh, I miss you so much.

304
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,400
Really?

305
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,980
Oh, that's terrific.

306
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,760
No way.

307
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

308
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,900
I gotta go.

309
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,420
I'll call you back.

310
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,440
I think I smell smoke.

311
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,220
Damn, it's good to see these faces again.

312
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,960
Since you've been gone, I've been hanging around.

313
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,000
Hanging it up, holding it down.

314
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,660
So damn good to see these faces.

315
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
Let's bust it out.

316
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,480
Let's fill up the spaces.

317
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,640
Let's start where we left off.

318
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,240
Let's get in a fight.

319
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,340
Get it out of the way.

320
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,160
And move on with the night.

321
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,520
That was, of course, Massive Hot Dog Recall.

322
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,840
Fronted by Al Mothersbaugh,

323
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,720
our band of the...

324
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,300
months.

325
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,740
From, well, I can't say the album title on the radio.

326
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,080
The movie premiere went great because the movie is pretty great.

327
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,940
I love it.

328
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,540
And my old subgenius doctor buddies who've now seen it love it too.

329
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,940
And even normals love it.

330
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,100
Or well, they like it a lot at the very least.

331
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,100
Reviews have been very good so far and distributors have been approaching.

332
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,260
Sandy Boone about it.

333
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,620
When a distribution deal is nailed down,

334
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:19,300
then DVD copies can go out to the Kickstarter investors and contributors.

335
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,880
It looks and sounds fabulous on a big theater screen.

336
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,760
Even the parts I shot on Betamax 40 years ago.

337
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,900
The editing, sound mix, music are all mind-blowing.

338
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
For me anyway, and I should know.

339
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,280
And it says something that the best movie about the Church of the Subgenius was made

340
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,580
by a Christian.

341
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,200
What it says is, don't stereotype kids.

342
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:58,300
After that world premiere, Sandy hosted a release party in the yard of the George Washington

343
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,220
Carver Museum with catered food and drink.

344
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
A bunch of mutant freak performers.

345
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,220
I don't know.

346
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,140
It was art, cars, a laser show.

347
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,980
And a mini D-vival, about 20 minutes long.

348
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,100
Done rather impromptu and on the spot, which you'll hear presently.

349
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:27,660
But now, back to the crowded but festive streets of Austin, Texas during South by Southwest.

350
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,560
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

351
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,220
But you may not be this far.

352
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,220


353
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:46,080
not it all depends on whether you're right with Bob our peas is proselytizing to the the captive

354
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:54,680
audience is standing in line to buy a burger they can't avoid him you've seen the Hare Krishna's

355
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,320
you've seen the Jehovah's Witnesses this is a million times more obnoxious than all of those

356
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:09,440
cults put together no they won't be shooting the movie against the side of the truck they'll

357
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,220
be shooting the cast against the side of the truck we're in a firing squad well it's publicity

358
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:27,880
there's more where they came from folks don't worry I have to I have to admit this is the

359
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,280
first time I've ever walked around public holding a bob saw

360
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:46,020
subgeniuses and cats we have to move on they're hard to herd have you seen this man have you seen

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,940

movie yes they dared to break open the insane scandalous cult the Church of the subgenius you

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:19,780
too can well if you're not a Bob fan you can at least get a little fan with a Bob on it it's free

366
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,820

367
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,880
this is sort of fun

368
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,720
you just bet never go public like this

369
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:49,080
look this excuse me sir this guy look at the sign on his back it says he's a genius

370
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:59,560
kill him kill the kill the genius damn the Church of the subgenius accepts anyone except

371
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,820
genius

372
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,480
free prizes You Won't Be Alone in the church of the subgenius

373
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:16,140
hey how much did that French tickler cost you I got my French tickler for free from the subgenius

374
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:25,900
movie production saying you have to say something to the Instagram site on social media oh okay

375
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,300
hello Instagram site on Social media code Hello Instagram site on Social Media code that's my была

376
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,300


377
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,700
media. We're here at South by Southwest in Austin. We're not the only people promoting

378
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,960
our product, but we've got the best product and the loudest promotion and the longest

379
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,980
pamphlets, free pamphlets. The subgenius movie, Inside, You Won't Believe Your Eyes, Freaks

380
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,600
of Nature, unlike anything you've ever seen.

381
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,340
I've got my paws stuck in this trap. They put a trap out here for us.

382
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:17,680
The port one subgenius has already been trapped in a clever trap set by the conspiracy, but

383
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,200
you can gnaw your way. No, you have to bite your hand off, man. No, you have to gnaw your

384
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
hand off, but you can escape the conspiracy snares.

385
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
Guys, go ahead. I'll just die here.

386
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,180
Go ahead and gnaw off that.

387
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,840
That leg. Lose that bear trap. Free pamphlets. You'll never see them at this price again.

388
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,620
Oh, shit. I might have really gotten myself in a trap. I'm going to pickle here, boys.

389
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,600
It's an intelligence test, Pease.

390
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I'll fix it.

391
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,900
The polar bears solved that one in five seconds.

392
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,980
Damn, that's a climb, man. Keep moving on the other side of the building.

393
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,160
The other side of the building? That's...

394
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,540
That's two miles from here.

395
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,940
Why didn't you tell us there was going to be all this walking?

396
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,380
Sound like Vrocknar at his first cannabis cup.

397
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,300
What? We have to walk?

398
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,140
What? They don't roll joints for us?

399
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,780
You guys do trades? Come on, man. Trade. Let's trade.

400
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,420
Pease is desperately trying to trade a subgenius pamphlet for a subgenius pamphlet from a guy

401
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,140
who already got a subgenius pamphlet.

402
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,580
That's a good one.

403
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,720
That's a good one.

404
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,600
Reverend Pease is a true doctor. He really is. He's simple.

405
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,560
He's ridiculous.

406
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:49,700
He's simple, but he's a good subgenius. He is kissed by the slack of Bob. He doesn't

407
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,080
need brain cells.

408
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,240
With tongue or without?

409
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,560
You won't need those brain cells anymore after you've seen the subgenius movie.

410
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,420
They dared to break open the scandalous church of the subgenius cult.

411
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,760
Say, I've heard of that subgenius cult. How do I find out more information?

412
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,120
Well, just take a good long look at this pamphlet, read it closely tonight.

413
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,180
And check out that little website subgenius.com.

414
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,020
That sounds fine. I'll get my whole family in on the fun.

415
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,060
You'll be saved. You'll get eternal salvation.

416
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,120
Subgenius.com.

417
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
or triple your money back.

418
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,540
No other mind control cult makes this offer,

419
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,800
this guarantee, this promise.

420
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,800
And if you can't trust Bob, who can you trust?

421
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,100
Will a salesman call and call and call?

422
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,380
Beautiful live salespeople will call.

423
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,560
Excellent.

424
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,120
You too can have intercourse with a beautiful live salesperson.

425
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,400
My goodness, how much money can I give you right now?

426
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,480
Why, how much money?

427
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,840
We don't really need money,

428
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,180
but only $35 will get you in the front door.

429
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm sure it helps those less fortunate.

430
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,580
The ground floor of a lucrative new cult.

431
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,300
Well, Bob told us we'd get in on the ground floor,

432
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,560
but he never said it'd be a one-story building.

433
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,980
Praise Bob.

434
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,980
He lies by omission.

435
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,000
Is that not the most beautiful form of truth-telling?

436
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm building a floating bridge.

437
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,460
Staff Sergeant Jiren explained floating bridges.

438
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,900
What are the, and then the tractor trailers with supplies on them.

439
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,660
The temporary bridge is only for emergency personnel and PR News.

440
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,100
But Chuck says those details are non-PR News.

441
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,280
The Trump categorically rejects,

442
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,260
and I wish security is tragic.

443
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,220
Iran's state-run news agency reports that at least this is PR News.

444
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,940
In the incident yesterday,

445
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,140
with British Prime Minister Theresa May floating from London,

446
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,320
Britain says EU.

447
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,560
The Trump was drugging and molesting his lawyers in 2004.

448
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,500
The broad judge in the case has PR News in Washington.

449
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,060
Now, friends,

450
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,680
we've got a whole,

451
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,220
a whole bunch of new quotes from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

452
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,100
Uh, I,

453
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,880
well, Philo and I and a lot of other people have combed through the old memos and napkins

454
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,960
and backsides of unpaid bills and so forth,

455
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,680
uh, for Bob's quotes.

456
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,760
But our friend, Reverend Elvis Martini stumbled upon a new stash.

457
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,720
Uh, we're not sure,

458
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,080
if,

459
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,240
uh,

460
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,020
who the me is in these.

461
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,660
Uh,

462
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,980
maybe it's Reverend Martini and he,

463
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,140
he doesn't want to admit it.

464
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,300
But, uh,

465
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,320
get a load of these.

466
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:09,840
Uh,

467
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,140
there,

468
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,880
there's a million of them and,

469
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,080
uh,

470
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:22,260
every single one of them is a brand new church of the subgenius doctrine that probably many,

471
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,680
many monks and nun snakes will be studying for decades to come.

472
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,500
Even after the world ends.

473
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,560
The first one,

474
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,560
and, and they're all,

475
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,140
they're all like this.

476
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,920
They all start with,

477
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,680
as Bob once said to me,

478
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,500
as Bob once said to me in a vision during a hangover,

479
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,860
let me profit off of your mistakes.

480
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,680
As Bob once said to me while arm wrestling a xenomorph,

481
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
you'll learn more being a vatican,

482
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,680
evacuated from a pleasure saucer than you ever would have by never having been brought on board.

483
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,380
Also how to hold your breath in space.

484
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,920
Of course,

485
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,380
I can't talk like Bob,

486
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,060
but I'm,

487
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,040
I'm doing my best to at least sound clear.

488
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,940
As Bob once said to me in line at the supermarket,

489
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,980
I wish I had less frop and smoked more.

490
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,120
As Bob said to me in the subject line of a chain email,

491
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,060
just because you can reach the keyboard,

492
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,120
it doesn't mean you have to type something.

493
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,100
As Bob once said to me during a job interview,

494
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,880
fake it till you make it.

495
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,500
As Bob once said to me while planking,

496
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,360
I am my own con.

497
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,280
As Bob once said to me while ejaculating on a Jackson Pollock,

498
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,360
never do for free what somebody else is willing to.

499
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,520
As Bob once said to me after taking a paternity test,

500
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,280
I'm what stupid people like to call smart.

501
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,380
Actually, I thought Trump said that.

502
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh, he probably stole it from Bob.

503
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,440
As Bob once said to me while pulling the ears off a Gundark,

504
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,700
Han, why do you keep calling me Bob when my name is Luke?

505
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,120
Oh, I get it. That's a Star Wars joke.

506
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,460
Oh, okay.

507
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,800
What? How is that possible?

508
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,840
This is from, like, 1960.

509
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,480
As Bob once said to me while setting his shorts on fire,

510
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,620
a refund for your $35 membership will only cost you $70.

511
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,680
As Bob once said to me while scraping asbestos out of the Statue of Liberty,

512
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,140
don't just eat hell, eat the burger out of it.

513
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:00,560
As Bob once said to me while performing the world's first wallet transplant,

514
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,840
their vaginas may be pink, but their penises are still green with envy.

515
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,880
As Bob once said to me while taking a course in sensitivity training,

516
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,160
bear bears bear bear barrel...

517
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,480
Oh, god damn, this is hard.

518
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,480
Bear bears bear bear bear ball.

519
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,480
Oh, okay, I gotta do this one more time.

520
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,100
Slowly.

521
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,160
Bear bears bear bear bear balls.

522
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,560
And bear bear balls bore by a bear are anything but a bore.

523
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,960
As Bob once said to me while I was mowing the Interstate Divider,

524
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,400
What?

525
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:57,040
And then there was one final one that came later, and that is...

526
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,760
Well, I'll have to use the Trump word on this one for the broadcast version.

527
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,160
But, as Bob once told me while throwing up tequila,

528
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,500
if you don't shit your pants in front of her, you'll never know if she's a keeper.

529
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,380
Apparently, I'm not.

530
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,380


531
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,380


532
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,560
Praise Bob. Praise that man Bob. Such wisdom.

533
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:31,660
And praise Reverend Elvis Martini for providing us with that new batch of secret teachings

534
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,080
that is going to keep a lot of us occupied for a while.

535
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,140
And now this.

536
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,620
Woo!

537
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,500
Alright.

538
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,020
Very good.

539
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:47,160
Alright, so, and without further ado, we're gonna have Ivan stay,

540
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,420
and Steve Wilcox gonna come up, and they're gonna start the Divide-All.

541
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,220
Woo!

542
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,040
Woo!

543
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,140
You can have anybody who wants one here.

544
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,140
Praise Bob!

545
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,260
Woo!

546
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,760
This way.

547
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,680
We gotta have all of these things, okay?

548
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,660
Who's this Steve Wilcox guy she keeps talking about?

549
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,080
Well, see, here's the thing.

550
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,140
We need to have a debate.

551
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,780
We need to have somebody.

552
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,140
We have to introduce our introducer.

553
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,160
Yeah, oh yeah.

554
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,960
Right.

555
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,800
We can't start talking officially.

556
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,440
Yeah, we can't start a Divide-All until the official introducer is introduced,

557
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,380
and he has to be wearing a suit.

558
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,340
And, uh...

559
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,800
Okay!

560
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,120
Alright, let's pick the show now.

561
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,920
Without further ado.

562
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,420
He can come up.

563
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,640
Onan Canobide, folks.

564
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,940
Praise Bob!

565
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,220
Now, uh, before we...

566
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,200
Before we...

567
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,100
Before we go on, you don't know me or anyone in my ministry, do you?

568
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,020
No, no, I've been hired to take out the trash tonight.

569
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,680
Alright, look, you see, so everything you see from now on is gonna be a miracle.

570
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,700
Of that and that.

571
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,480
What you got to say for yourself?

572
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,960
You laughed at him.

573
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,840
Shuddered at him.

574
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,420
And yet, but for the accident of birth,

575
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,560
you might be even as he is.

576
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,520
He did not ask to be brought into the world,

577
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,740
but into the world he came.

578
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,980
His code is a law unto itself.

579
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,580
Offend him, and you offend us all.

580
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,460
Not beast, not man.

581
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,360
Stay!

582
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,840
This is the House of Pain.

583
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:00,480
Well, friends, we've had church meetings in a whole lot of very different

584
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,860
and sometimes even surprising places.

585
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,000
Like great big real churches, or auto junkyards,

586
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,400
or impromptu ones in prison yards.

587
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,400


588
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,400


589
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,800
But this is one of the more unusual environments

590
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,200
in which we can have a deep Bible.

591
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,400
And I'm so happy to do it in Austin,

592
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,800
with food and drinks,

593
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,740
and so many professionals.

594
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,440
That's what's really different here.

595
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,400
We normally just don't have that many people

596
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,300
who are actually good at something practical.

597
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,000
So praise Bob, and thank you all for coming very much.

598
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,820
We could not be happier with that movie.

599
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,480
Especially me, because I used to be a film and video editor.

600
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,100
I've actually done a whole bunch of feature length documentaries.

601
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,140
I know exactly how hard it is.

602
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,280
That poor cutting room floor.

603
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,060
Think of that thing.

604
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,920
It's abused horribly on projects like this.

605
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,120
So, but in the end,

606
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,180
you take all these Sal's purses

607
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,060
and turn them into pearl ears.

608
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,020
Or something like that.

609
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,440
You know, you have to cut,

610
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,100
you take 100,000 hours of home movies

611
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,160
and tedious talking heads,

612
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,780
and carve away everything that doesn't look like

613
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,500
a Church of the Sept Genius movie.

614
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,820
And the hour that you have left goes by really fast.

615
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,160
And fabulous.

616
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,700
And for me personally,

617
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,380
now some people I know,

618
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,540
they think some of this is funny.

619
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,440
But I got all teared up

620
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,740
in two or three places there.

621
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,940
Because the music would be so sweet,

622
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,540
and there'd be all my old friends

623
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
looking like little tiny babies.

624
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,000
Actually, a lot of cases,

625
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,180
it's good looking young actors

626
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,820
playing the early Sept Geniuses.

627
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,800
Because frankly, as far as I can remember,

628
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,120
we've always looked like this.

629
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,180
And never looked like that.

630
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,240
So, it's a fabulous job of CGI trickery

631
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,340
or look-a-likes or plastic surgery or something.

632
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,840
And I love the way they put it all into context.

633
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,380
But, as important as that movie might be,

634
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,040
to we the subgeniuses,

635
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,080
and you, the potential subgeniuses

636
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,620
who just ran into this thing,

637
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,580
it's a...

638
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,920
As important as that is,

639
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,300
there's one thing that's even more important.

640
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,600
And that's that man Bob.

641
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
I walked into this place,

642
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,200
and I heard people talking,

643
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,840
oh, movie stars, big money.

644
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,660
I didn't hear Bob's name mentioned once!

645
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,700
Well, actually, there were a whole bunch of people

646
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,640
talking about Bob, but it wasn't that Bob.

647
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,780
So, friends, those of you who are unsubscribed,

648
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,620
I'm not gonna say if it's yet.

649
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,260
Now, we're not going to preach to you,

650
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,040
well, not for long,

651
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,240
but if you...

652
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,920
It won't hurt you to look at that little free pamphlet

653
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,800
or that subgenius.com thing on that internet,

654
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,000
TV stuff and whatever.

655
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,520
Oh, and Philo runs a channel of subgenius video on Roku.

656
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,840
So, oh, and then there's those radio shows, right?

657
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,580
Three of three radio shows have been going on for 30 years,

658
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,640
and they're still alive!

659
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,360
So, we'd sure like to kill them.

660
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,060
So, we need your help.

661
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,700
To kill the radio shows, kill the radio shows!

662
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,160
And Bob!

663
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,860
Damn it, how can you...

664
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,400
Look what he's done to us!

665
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,740
We have to stand here praising him like brain-damaged kooks!

666
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:04,820
Again!

667
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,820
Where's the slack?

668
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Yeah, where's the slack?

669
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,420
Oh, yeah, that's right, we get to go to these free parties.

670
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:10,720
Okay.

671
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,300
Okay, forget it.

672
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
For I love you, Bob!

673
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,540
I love you, Bob!

674
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
We know we couldn't kill you anyway, Bob.

675
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,740
You can't kill a face.

676
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,880
You can't, you can't kill a face.

677
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,420
And it is...

678
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,660
Dr. Philo Drummond, why don't you come on up here?

679
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,160
No, wait, wait, the introducer...

680
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,060
Well, you have to come up and introduce the introducer.

681
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,360
And then he, and then you can come up.

682
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,320
Okay?

683
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,060
After he introduces you, then you can...

684
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,840
Friends, we have a man, a man over here,

685
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,440
who's been known to introduce people.

686
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,760
He's one of the finest introducers this country has ever seen.

687
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,160
And pretty soon he's gonna come up here in front of you and introduce a fella.

688
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,060
I think I'm gonna bring him up right now.

689
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,660
We have Onan Kanopai.

690
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,780
Let's hear it for Onan!

691
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,300
The world's greatest introducer!

692
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,620
Onan! Onan! Onan! Onan!

693
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,440
When the odd knob fobs the job on a cop

694
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,660
to cop the frop on a slob

695
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,460
whose job it is to spot and drop,

696
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs, that is slack.

697
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,820
When the closest hostess proposes a toast

698
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,780
to roast the old gabrog

699
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,640
whose boast as a ghost

700
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,620
is that he's slow to take a joke,

701
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,120
why, that is slack.

702
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,940
And when the bootblack who lacks tack

703
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,260
attacks and smacks back the galactic attack

704
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,900
with a laugh,

705
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,360
that is slack.

706
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,440
That is slack.

707
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,060
And this is Dr. Philo Drummond.

708
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,540
Chris Brown!

709
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,360
Thank you, Onan.

710
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
That was a great, great introduction there.

711
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,760
I don't think I could even duplicate it at all.

712
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,200
I'm not even gonna try.

713
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,140
I think I'm just gonna stand here and waste some time.

714
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,600
You know, have you ever been to church

715
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,300
and you sat there in the pew

716
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,880
and you was just waiting for that guy up there

717
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,020
talking at you to quit talking?

718
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,020
You just kept going on and on and on

719
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,460
and finally figured out a way to

720
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,180
get your arm underneath your head.

721
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,700
You put that arm on the pew

722
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,280
and the fella up there just talking away

723
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,960
and pretty soon he just kinda drones you into

724
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,660
semi-unconsciousness.

725
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,220
And then pretty soon they start passing around

726
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,360
that collection plate.

727
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,760
And pretty soon you wake up and kick that collection plate.

728
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,900
All over the church.

729
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,220
Waiting, waiting for that money to come back to you.

730
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,160
A million different ways.

731
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,940
And it always does. It really does.

732
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,540
At least it has in my experience.

733
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,660
But as far as I know,

734
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,260
this is the last time that we've all been together.

735
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,740
Maybe it's the first time.

736
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,920
But irrespective of that,

737
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,060
I just can't get over how good our introducer was.

738
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,720
I want to have another round of applause for our introducer,

739
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,680
Ronan Garabay.

740
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,420
Let's hear it.

741
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,380
Let's hear it for Ronan.

742
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,540
He said all that stuff off the top of his head.

743
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,720
Right off the top of it.

744
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,560
Isn't that right?

745
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,440
It's true.

746
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,520
Okay, now we have a, we usually have a,

747
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,300
we didn't do our moment, our special moment.

748
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,380
You know, like we do.

749
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,000
Reverend Stank?

750
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,800
Yeah, that was actually,

751
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,540
what the original introducer was supposed to do.

752
00:40:59,600 --> 00:40:59,880
Yeah.

753
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,980
Was to call for everyone to,

754
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,080
and we don't want to embarrass anyone,

755
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,500
but if you could just quietly lower your heads

756
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,100
and join us in a moment of sacred noise.

757
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,420
Praise Bob! Praise God! Praise God! Praise Bob! Praise God!

758
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,180
He's so high you can't get over him.

759
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,240
He's so low you can't crawl under him.

760
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,700
He's Bob!

761
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,120
That's somebody else's line.

762
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,600
Yeah.

763
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,420
But anyway, it works. It still works.

764
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,580
Yeah, it still works.

765
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,800
Actually, you can take a sentence from almost any religious text

766
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,240
or preaching or song

767
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,680
and just replace certain words with Bob

768
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,740
and there you go.

769
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,200
Suddenly you've got real art.

770
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,600
Just stick up, graphically,

771
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,000
all any bad art needs to become real good art

772
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,960
is to have a pipe placed on it

773
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,580
in exactly the right place.

774
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,120
That's right.

775
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,440
That's called, this is a science

776
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,620
created by Dr. Philodrumon called Perfect Pipe Placement.

777
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,920
And you may notice that all around town

778
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,360
this week there's these little stickers

779
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,960
that are just a pipe.

780
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,940
And when added in the perfect place

781
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,220
to anything, suddenly it's converted into

782
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,820
some kind of weird art.

783
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,860
Oh, look, yeah, there's one.

784
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,800
It's transparent.

785
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,160
It's a perfect device to make anything into art.

786
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,780
This simple little device creates art with a user.

787
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,900
A simple user, a simple device placed on a simple advertising

788
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,240
by a simple mind.

789
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,100
And now you have great art using the three Ps.

790
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,200
Perfect Pipe Placement.

791
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,840
I put mine on my mirror

792
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,560
so that when I look in the mirror just right, there it is.

793
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,940
You can take it like this?

794
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,660
Yeah, it works in a myriad of ways.

795
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,500
Some people have been known to actually,

796
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,340
if I can get it apart, it's really difficult.

797
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,200
This is the hardest part of Perfect Pipe Placement.

798
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,320
Getting the backing off the pipe.

799
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Getting the backing off of the sticker.

800
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,340
Of course you can use a stencil or blood of sacrificial victims

801
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,600
or just about any fluid you can think of.

802
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,780
There you go.

803
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,140
See?

804
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,160
One minute a regular guy, the next minute fine art.

805
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah.

806
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:37,060
So thank you for allowing us to school you

807
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,160
in the three Ps of Perfect Pipe Placement.

808
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,260
This is the first time this has ever been announced in Austin, I think.

809
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,940
Yeah, definitely.

810
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,660
We possibly should have gone preaching about the fact that

811
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,400
on July 5th at 7 a.m. the world is going to end

812
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,680
and unless you are right with Bob by virtue of

813
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,800
a mere $35 membership and ordainment kit,

814
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,540
you also get to be a universal life minister for free for that.

815
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,940
Yeah, that means you can marry people to each other.

816
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:09,980
I...

817
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,520
We could...

818
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,360
Legally.

819
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,700
We could marry everybody here to whatever they want to get married to.

820
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,580
Because that's the one thing Bob's not picky about.

821
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,400
Who wants to be married to that man?

822
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,980
He's not picky about who you want to marry or what you want to marry.

823
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,620
You can marry your dog.

824
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,400
You can marry your wallet, your car keys, so that you're bound eternally.

825
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:30,940
I don't know if you can marry your dog, actually.

826
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,220
I think they have some room for that.

827
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,700
No, no.

828
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,560
No, it's okay for us.

829
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,320
It's a non-practicing marriage, perhaps.

830
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,300
Well, and they can be short-durational.

831
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,080
They can be timed to last a day or a week or whatever.

832
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,480
There's a little certificate that you can fill out that comes with the membership pack

833
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,400
that allows...

834
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,840
Yeah.

835
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,160
You can really do...

836
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,280
20-minute marriages are real popular.

837
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,840
If those countless weddings that I've conducted weren't valid, then a lot of money's been wasted

838
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,300
on divorces, my friends.

839
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,540
That's where the real money is.

840
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:03,700
That's right.

841
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,140
It should have been the law office at the sub-genius.

842
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,520
Good!

843
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,120
We could have had the biggest law office in Dallas.

844
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,720
Why did it take us so long to think of that?

845
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,860
Because we didn't have law degrees.

846
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,820
We didn't have the perspective of seeing that as a law degree.

847
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:19,820


848
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,040
We didn't have the perspective of seeing that movie.

849
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,380
That's true.

850
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,440
It was like a time machine compressing...

851
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,120
If only we'd seen it then...

852
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,420
Yeah.

853
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:31,120
If only we'd seen it then, we'd have known never to start this thing.

854
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,060
And we'd be successful lawyers now.

855
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,560
Yeah.

856
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,200
It wouldn't be...

857
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,720
Wait a minute.

858
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,200
But that would be like the Three Stooges being lawyers.

859
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:38,740
Yeah.

860
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,120
Do we cheat them out?

861
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:49,800
We were frankly both very inspired by the Three Stooges, the Law Office, and the

862
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,020
Warner Brothers cartoons.

863
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,180
The violent ones.

864
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:54,520
Yeah.

865
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,800
The Max Fleischer cartoons.

866
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,500
Stupid comic books and also the underground comic books.

867
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,420
And...

868
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,520
The real dirty ones.

869
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah.

870
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,540
Yeah.

871
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,280
And Bob.

872
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,020
Because that's all you...

873
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,100
Really, all that other stuff is just fluff.

874
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,000
You don't need any...

875
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,600
You don't need that.

876
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,820
All you need is that face.

877
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,760
Look at those dots.

878
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,780
Those dots are designed in a specific way in a category.

879
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:19,780


880
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,280
It's not your mind.

881
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,320
It's a...

882
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,800
If you look at it, you can't help it.

883
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,240
You don't need faith.

884
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,540
That's stupid.

885
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,720
All you need is face.

886
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,660
But it has to be that face.

887
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,140
Face.

888
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,920
Only that face.

889
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,660
That face of Bob and no other face.

890
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:32,980
That face right there.

891
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,440
And those dots aren't there.

892
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,900
That ain't that Bob head face.

893
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,720
The sacred Dobbs head.

894
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,840
That's all you need.

895
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,000
Look.

896
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,240
Think how many kids are in here tattooed on their bodies.

897
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,660
Right on their bodies.

898
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,840
They're saved forever.

899
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,880
They'll be beamed up.

900
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,000
They don't even have to carry a membership card.

901
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,760
They don't have faith, but they've got faith.

902
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:49,760


903
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:49,760


904
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:49,760


905
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:49,760


906
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,620
That's the important thing.

907
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,320
It doesn't even have to be on their face.

908
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,960
It can be on the sole of their foot.

909
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,220
That's where I'd have them.

910
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,120
I don't know why we saw that they had the tattoo on his back, an entire back covered

911
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,080
with a Dobbs head.

912
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,880
A mural.

913
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,540
And he was a really big guy.

914
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,240
Big guy.

915
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,320
That was probably a barrel of ink they had.

916
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,580
Dr. Drummond, did you know that that guy came to really hate the Church of the

917
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,380
Sub-Jeges?

918
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,160
That's really sad.

919
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,840
He decided we were a bunch of fascists because we wouldn't let him threaten other

920
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,740
people, fit in the way that he wanted to fit in the way that he wanted to fit in the way

921
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:19,740


922
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,020
that he wanted to fit in the way that he wanted to fit in.

923
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,880
And so he was playing physically over the phone or something like that.

924
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,040
How unreasonable of us.

925
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,360
Yeah.

926
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,340
So now he's stuck with this mural on his back.

927
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,760
Friends, don't be like him.

928
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,900
Wait, what did he do wrong?

929
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,420
I don't know.

930
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,320
A giant tattoo of a Dobbs head.

931
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:33,580
No.

932
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,240
You can have that.

933
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,320
That part's okay.

934
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,800
But don't get tired of it.

935
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,100
That's the bad part.

936
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,640
All right.

937
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,300
Well, friends, we don't want to be that guy that puts you to sleep.

938
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,720
The Mr. Science Podcast is brought to you by the Dr. Drummond Foundation.

939
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:49,720


940
00:47:49,720 --> 00:48:00,920
lecture series. Volume 1, number 1. The Mutron. Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First

941
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,980
Church of Mr. Science, Boston. Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear

942
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,460
light of the so-called forbidden sciences, we will find we have a far greater chance

943
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:20,120
of understanding the true nature of the universe. We are told about matter and energy and space

944
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:26,880
and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws or as foggy abstracts that

945
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,180
have no particular being outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids to make the

946
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:37,620
whole thing easier to swallow. We at the Temporal Management Research Facility of the Church

947
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,440
of Mr. Science of the Subgenius have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing

948
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,460
and full known works on the subject of time and its methods of control have discovered

949
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,740
the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent twaddle that is modern science.

950
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:59,960
This key is the Mutron. The truth must now be told. How it was covered up for so long

951
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,140
would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book, but it's too involved to be

952
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,260
told here. The actual issue at hand is the Mutron and its pivotal role in the management

953
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,240
of the true cosmos.

954
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,440
In order to properly understand the true nature of the universe, we must first understand

955
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,400
the following. It must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

956
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,980
The first of these basic particles is the electron, which has no mass but possesses

957
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,060
a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite, thus making it the fundamental unit

958
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:34,640
of energy. It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.,

959
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,840
acting in concert make up the jacotismic field, which is responsible for holding everything

960
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,000
that is anything together.

961
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:47,080
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle, commonly called a black hole.

962
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,220
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space but the influence of a single particle

963
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,340
can be felt at a much greater distance. They often have event horizons many miles wide,

964
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,640
beyond which not even light can escape.

965
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:09,360
The third fundamental particle is the Mutron. The Mutron carries with it an infinite temporal

966
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,980
capacity. That often means all alltable Force in the body. It's always capable of creating

967
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:10,980


968
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,060
alter the rate and intensity and general quality of the passage through time of anything it touches.

969
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:22,480
The neutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe. As far as we know, there might well

970
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,040
be only one of them, though there could be as many as a few dozen without generating a dangerous

971
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:36,300
concentration of neutron phenomena. Section A. Just how fucking big everything really is.

972
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,580
What we know is the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as

973
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:48,020
the nucleus and the neutron or mutrons acting as the electron cloud with the electrons providing

974
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:53,380
the energy for the neutron to drive us forward through time. Just about everything else in the

975
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,800
universe is just so much debris cluttering up the works of things. The fact that there is one such

976
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:06,160
atom more than suggests the existence of others. The neutron has a corresponding antiparticle,

977
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,960
known as the tachyon, which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,

978
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,820
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light. The simple

979
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,200
fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra-universal mutrons impinging on our

980
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,020
universe at a different temporal angle. These are the mutrons of atom universes that ours is

981
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,740
in compound with. After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

982
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,840
No atom of mere matter divides itself into alternate cells almost constantly,

983
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:49,180
but our universe does. All the time the universe splits in order to express every alternative open

984
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:55,520
to any phenomenon transpiring within, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. This is the

985
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,400
only way our minds can express the perception of the fifth dimension, or more properly the

986
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,200
second dimension of time. So this introduces the concept of time viewed as a plane rather

987
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,900
than a line. But there is another dimension of space, so is the case with time there is also a

988
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:18,440
corresponding up-down time. This is the direction in which our mental eyes exist. In this direction

989
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,280
we find alternate time tracks similar to the sidewise ones, with the difference being that

990
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,100
theirs is order-oriented in the direction opposed to temporal gravity, so that elements of those

991
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,960
other cells are constantly falling into our awareness from above.

992
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:35,740
The

993
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,060
neutron

994
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,820
Irurski V.

995
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:51,860
Or disconnected from the eyebrows of our brain.

996
00:52:51,940 --> 00:53:06,040
In this Crimson treasure, liked for its

997
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,440
The earliest known mutron impact on Earth occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

998
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,880
The primordial sea teemed with the most primitive of bacteria.

999
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,300
Their genetic material was a simple molecule shaped like a lumpy ladder.

1000
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,380
It was very chemically stable.

1001
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:27,440
The mutron passed through Earth and spewed out a wake that left each and every molecule of DNA twisted beyond recognition.

1002
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:35,420
In this state, its stability was ruined, and any force or random glitch that Mother Nature had to offer changed it somehow.

1003
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,020
Thus, evolution had begun.

1004
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,680
The vast majority of these events, however, affect individual beings or objects.

1005
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:51,580
One such example is Great Britain's Stonehenge Monument, which was not man-made as is popularly presumed,

1006
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:55,180
but is merely the material evidence of a rather minor mutron splash.

1007
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,440
Certain great sages of the past and present have actually had mutrons pass directly through their crania.

1008
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,140
A partial listing of these select people.

1009
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,020
. . .

1010
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,020


1011
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,020


1012
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,900
It's your first time seeing this.

1013
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,920
They can start for long parts of man's life

1014
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,420
The part we don't want to see is when a largešeial Nobody Deluge

1015
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:21,160
likes someBLEEP entity macht developed or the spontaneous

1016
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:21,180
creature is driven by the

1017
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,120
thing we see is our life.

1018
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,720
But if they treat a mutron technology

1019
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:27,760
with actionskt

1020
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,540
. . .

1021
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:36,000
rub because united

1022
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,220
In the light of this particular view, one might ask, what about the Big Bang and all that stuff?

1023
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,400
Well, it seems that matter does not play a very big role in the actual nuts and bolts operation of the universe.

1024
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,840
In fact, we find that it is the case in about half the universe's sample that there is no matter at all.

1025
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,720
Section B. What we must do about all this.

1026
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,960
It is well known that the electron can be pressed into service for all kinds of uses.

1027
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:12,800
It might be less well known that alien civilizations of a level only slightly more advanced than ours routinely use the enormous power made available by tapping into the gravity fluxes of quantum black holes.

1028
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,000
It's also possible to use the time potentials of the neutron to our own great advantage.

1029
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:25,020
The neutron is not subject to the same methods of coercion that we use to bend normal subatomic particles to our will.

1030
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,580
They're oblivious to matter and energy alike.

1031
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,940
The power of pure thought, because of its intimate relationship with matter,

1032
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,800
and the power of time, does have some small effect.

1033
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,980
Mutrons are attracted to areas of concentrated slackful enlightenment.

1034
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:47,540
A neutron container accelerator could be charged with a neutron if enough slackful minds concentrated their energies around a scoop entrance to the neutron accelerator.

1035
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:55,640
Once contained therein, it would take relatively little effort on the part of these minds to maintain it in a circular path.

1036
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:01,320
One purely technical problem facing this proposal is the size of the accelerator needed.

1037
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,200
It is a property of the neutron that it will only travel in the most gentle of curves.

1038
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:11,560
The minimum diameter of a circle to be traveled by a neutron is approximately 1,000 miles.

1039
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:19,520
Fortunately, we have easy access to an extraterrestrial body more than three times that size, Earth's moon.

1040
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:26,600
The accelerator could be built in a ring completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere about 100 feet below its surface.

1041
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,820
Because of the mental effort that would run it, it would be known as the psychotron.

1042
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,940
The psychotron would be a valuable tool in the use of practical time control.

1043
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:43,960
By accelerating the neutron in one direction or another, the entire moon could be induced to follow it in whatever temporal direction it might be directed.

1044
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,880
Forward, backward, sideways, or up-down.

1045
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,040
Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

1046
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:58,080
It is my proposal that this device be constructed for use in a major project to concentrate high slack wisdom in this universe.

1047
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,940
The single most radiant personality among modern minds.

1048
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,980
The most radiant man is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1049
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,220
There are other alternate Bobs existing in other alternate time tracks.

1050
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,820
Not all of them are as prominent as our Bob, but still are privy to the same great gnosis.

1051
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,820
Others are already the rulers of their respective Earths.

1052
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,360
All, though, are truly Bob.

1053
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,340
Imagine if we could travel to those alternative time streams and convince all of those Bobs to return to our world.

1054
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,800
This is exactly what I am suggesting.

1055
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,600
The formation of the Congress of Bobs.

1056
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,200
Yes, my friends, this is our mission.

1057
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:43,680
Those who wish to donate to the Psychotron Project will be given a free ride to the alternate world of their choice once the project is complete.

1058
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,180
Thank you.

1059
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:55,680
Thank you, Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger, also known as the artist Seth Deitch of the famous cartooning Deitch family.

1060
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,900
An old, old friend.

1061
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,180
What a classic.

1062
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:06,280
Mixed by other old, old friend, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, all in Boston in the early 1980s.

1063
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,680
Forbidden science for the ages, especially the old ages.

1064
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:22,160
And here's more old people who might as well be younger than lots of dour young people, because they're subgenius masters and masteresses.

1065
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,940
If you eat, breathe, or excrete,

1066
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:34,340
you're sure to be interested in this amazing breakthrough multimedia project.

1067
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,480
They have brisket nachos.

1068
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,760
Oh, God.

1069
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:49,740
You can die every night eating brisket nachos in the Church of the Subgenius.

1070
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,260
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

1071
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,240
And free anal fissure tissues.

1072
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,640
Buckets of free anal fissure tissues.

1073
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,200
Well, to the first...

1074
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,180
A squat drop bucket filled with anal fissure tissues can be yours.

1075
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,360
Join our cult.

1076
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,840
Only $10.

1077
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:16,260
If you've ever urinated, you're sure to be interested in the Church of the Subgenius.

1078
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,540
If you like to pee, join us.

1079
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,280
Do you like to pee?

1080
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,760
Ask yourself that.

1081
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:29,240
If so, Bob is ready to welcome you into his open arms and other things.

1082
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,320
We pee.

1083
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,540
Interested?

1084
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,960
Do you dare to see the thing?

1085
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,960
Only five miles.

1086
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,160
Uh-oh, here come these guys again.

1087
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,140
Dare to see the thing.

1088
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,200
Next exit.

1089
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,060
Oh, we're almost out of fans and pamphlets.

1090
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:49,960
That's good.

1091
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,600
You know, we could get rid of these a lot sooner if we just gave them to each other.

1092
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,320
Boy, I saw you trying to trade one for a guy who already had one.

1093
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,900
Have you heard about the good word?

1094
00:59:58,980 --> 00:59:59,720
I did.

1095
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,660
Okay, five minute break.

1096
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,600
I didn't hear about this though.

1097
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,500
Take a knee, boys.

1098
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,060
Have you heard the good news, brother?

1099
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,200
We haven't.

1100
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:08,960
Tell us some.

1101
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:17,800
It's your last chance to get in on the ground floor of a lucrative new mind control cult.

1102
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,940
You never need it.

1103
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,020
You needed those brain cells to begin with.

1104
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,760
Free yourself.

1105
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,160
Okay, are we off?

1106
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,580
Oh, thank God.

1107
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,440
Okay, friends, everything is at subgenius.com.

1108
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,440
We'll end this with this you had to have been there moment at the end of our Austin mini

1109
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,660
revival at Sandy's Subgenius Movie promo party.

1110
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:49,920
Part of the gag is in the fumbling, but that was a visual gag, so you'll just have to enjoy

1111
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:49,920


1112
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:50,780
and envision it.

1113
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,180
Does anybody else want to come up here and rant?

1114
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,680
That's something I usually offer.

1115
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,940
You've got, if you come up here and rant, and we don't like it, we're going to throw

1116
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,640
you off stage.

1117
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,120
But—

1118
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,820
That's right.

1119
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,560
If you want to come up here and rant, we'll give you a couple seconds.

1120
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,000
A couple of seconds, yeah.

1121
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,960
There's a big hook over there.

1122
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,220
The line foreman behind that guy, he's first in line.

1123
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,120
I think actually this is exactly what Sandy was most afraid would happen.

1124
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,920
But I'll be honest.

1125
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,920


1126
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,920


1127
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,920


1128
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,920


1129
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,920


1130
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,740
actually think about it. In some ways she's really lucky that Pope's

1131
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:27,840
Durno Docs have to stay home. He would take over

1132
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,960
now. Yeah. He would take over and get everybody into a lot

1133
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,900
of trouble. Look at that. It's Reverend Pease. He's

1134
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,100
going to come up. He's a new kid. You guys doing a show? Yeah.

1135
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,860
We're doing a show. I've got a fake mustache. You can play me old man. Don't tell

1136
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,600
nobody. I'm going to put it on so they can't tell. Okay. Alright.

1137
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,340
Alright. He's a handsome boy. I don't think we have any takers.

1138
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,360
Do you guys have any of this candy? This shit

1139
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,480
sucks. Hey, nobody can hear you. Look at that. He's already acting like an

1140
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,820
amateur. Nobody can hear you. Get up here.

1141
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,240
Oh God. He wanted more of that candy. Okay, we have a volunteer

1142
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,360
from the audience who's going to come up and rant for you now. That's chapstick, not

1143
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,360
candy, Reverend Pease. He ate too much, he said.

1144
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,460
Now you've got to be good or we're going to kick you.

1145
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,620
That's right. Now you know it's not fair. I did the whole bit down there

1146
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:24,480
and he said nobody can hear me and then you killed the punchline by telling everybody that I thought

1147
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,360
the chapstick was candy. This is the problem with you. Move aside.

1148
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,480
You should have gotten up here quicker. Do these not work? I've got to hold this thing

1149
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,860
like Sharon? It works better. This is a tough church. It really is.

1150
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,220
It looks easy, but it's tough. I'd like to thank Sandy for my personal

1151
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:43,520
shake way. We're going to stand here.

1152
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,900
We're ready to pull him off.

1153
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,860
I'm a little disappointed in each and every one of you. I'm looking at you, Jason.

1154
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:57,180
You should have gone first, you bastard. So they left it to me and I'm the new guy. Nobody

1155
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,280
even knows who I am.

1156
01:02:59,020 --> 01:02:59,960
You don't even know who I am.

1157
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,720
Nobody cares.

1158
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:07,740
If someone can help me, I am not here on my own free volition. This man has captured

1159
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,200
me while selling Good Magazine.

1160
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,080
They've heard that before.

1161
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,500
It's all so much fun here in the church, isn't it, folks? Everybody's fine. There's nothing

1162
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:16,580
to be afraid of.

1163
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,180
There's nothing to worry about.

1164
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,700
That's fair.

1165
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,440
I'm there.

1166
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:18,880
That's fair.

1167
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,260
Okay. Stop it. Stop it.

1168
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:26,100
Anyway, so I came to the church because on the advice of my priest. He was pretty tired

1169
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:31,540
of my shit and thought that it would be best if I went to a church that was more accessible,

1170
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,820
as he put it. And so I did, and it took about 13 years.

1171
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,520
I'm trying to help you out, man.

1172
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:43,620
You're a player.

1173
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,900
One second, please.

1174
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,480
This is exactly what Sandy was afraid would happen.

1175
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,020
What?

1176
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,240
You got to stop talking to my friend.

1177
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,280
Tell your joke and hurry up.

1178
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:11,860
So there's this guy and he does funny stuff. You should see him all the time. He's busting

1179
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,200
me up.

1180
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,100
And so this one time.

1181
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,940
And he's got a big, big ass.

1182
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:15,940


1183
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,760
You did this thing, right?

1184
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:24,900
As this total weird, crazy, not funny, but, but funny thing,

1185
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,820
and I laughed you should just seeing it.

1186
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,780
It was pretty good.

1187
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,840
I enjoyed it.

1188
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,200
And perhaps.

1189
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:39,720
Thankfully that is where the recording stopped for reasons unknown, but I, I know the agony

1190
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,460
didn't go on for much longer.

1191
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,920
Uh, maybe my little Olympus digital recorder is turning to fucking bin abroad.

1192
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1193
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1194
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1195
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1196
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1197
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1198
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1199
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1200
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1201
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:45,920


1202
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:53,360
like my hearing aids and my brain pan simply gave out from the challenges exacted by being in the

1203
01:04:53,360 --> 01:05:03,680
midst of the vocal sounds of a dozen subgenius doctors for a whole week. As glorious as it was,

1204
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:11,880
I'm glad to be back with my mute dogs in the vast quiet of the Stang Ranch cedar forest,

1205
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:19,800
to which I have developed an allergy. But at least it's quiet, even for a deaf person.

1206
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,140
Praise Bob. This movie won't make us rich, but we hope it might increase membership ordainment

1207
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:33,700
sales for a couple of months when it goes on Netflix or whatever. And if you already bought

1208
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:40,420
the immense membership package, don't you need a t-shirt or special decoder ring or

1209
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:51,520
book of the subgenius? It's all at subgenius.com. And thank you, Sandy Boone, for making that movie

1210
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:00,620
called J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius. That's the final title. Praise Bob.
