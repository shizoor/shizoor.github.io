00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:13,480
Princess Wee and I are here at the Afrofest. Thanks to our friend Charles

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,620
Sinocor for setting this all up as a grand show so far.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:27,120
Representing our upside, and that it should be, at the Afrofest, it could be Tread Ball.

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,620
We'll see you at the action.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,000
And if the world doesn't end, we'll see you at the Starbucks.

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:49,460
And with Afrofest, what we're trying to do is to educate that you all know that we're

7
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,780
what?

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,120
One blood.

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,100
Those of you who were not here when we started, you know that we're not here.

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,100


11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,460
We're not here to open this show.

12
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,200
We found the oldest person in the house tonight.

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,620
And we had him come up here, well he was sitting up here, and he poured elevation.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,280
One drop.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,700
It is one drop of blood that connects each and every one of us.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,640
We are brothers and sisters.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,760
And we are all from the continent of Africa.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,980
Forget what they tell you.

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,100
They will call you clowns.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,100


21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
They will call you white.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,920
They will call you evil.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,300
They will call you tucosoid.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,320
They will call you warthog.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,900
This is the age of what?

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,740
Information technology.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,060
You go to Google.

28
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,960
You type in mitochondrial Eve.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,880
Or you type in African Adam.

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,860
The way it leads all the way to Africa.

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,100
Except we were dropped off here.

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,140
We were brought here by aliens.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,640
That we know that we don't belong.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
But as far as you here and you believe you're human, you are African.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,480
No matter what your skin color or your eye tone, we are all African.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,740
So that's why we're here.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,620
To celebrate Mother Eve Africa and Father Adam Africa.

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,740
Afrofest!

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,120
Stick around!

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,540
Happy Mother's Day!

41
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,400
Oh yeah don't forget, that is right on time.

42
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,080
When you are here.

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:49,380
One of the things that bothers me is that people think that there has to be something so amazingly powerful and wonderful up there looking after us, taking care of us, smiting our enemies, rewarding us with manna and good deeds.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:08,620
But at the same time, it bothers me that nobody seems to realize that there is something up there that is more powerful, more amazing, more incomprehensible than any of these so-called deities.

45
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,040
It's the universe.

46
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,340
And let's face it, the universe is a very singular place.

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:37,420
It's a place where a very simple molecule of gas spend a little time changing itself into clouds and stars and galaxies and solar systems and planets.

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:45,400
And dare we say it, life and life evolved to reach a point at which.

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,180
Some.

50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Somewhere in this vast universe, there is a life form that has evolved with enough faculties and abilities and mental acuity.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,960
To realize.

52
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:09,120
That the universe is amazing, enormous, fantastic, incomprehensible, but wonderfully entertaining.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,900
And that's what we need to realize.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,260
The universe has created.

55
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,520
Created us.

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,240
So we can appreciate the universe for what it is.

57
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,460
That's the only reason we're here, folks.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
So just enjoy.

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,360
Sit back, relax.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,900
And be entertained.

61
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,920
Just enjoy the rest of this film.

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:45,920


63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:45,920


64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:45,920


65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:45,920


66
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:45,920


67
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,340
Life Draw by 27!

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
Estẹ

69
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,080
аль!

70
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,540
Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

71
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,820
Brave, buff, bold, and honey-dragged.

72
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,320
Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

73
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,980
La, la, la, la, la, la.

74
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
La, la, la, Hour of Slack.

75
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,860
La, la, la, la, la, la.

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,520
The only cult they want to talk about is the Subgenius Foundation,

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,540
the Church of the Subgenius.

78
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,060
Dad, Doug Smith says we're different.

79
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,480
Doug's right, Virgil. We are different.

80
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,360
Thanks to Jesus, the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,440
Mommy, too?

82
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
Yep, the whole family.

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,940
Is everybody like us?

84
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,280
No, son, but we're working on it.

85
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,480
Round the clock!

86
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,300
Messages from invisible sources.

87
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,920
Or what some people think of as progress.

88
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,800
Well, ain't the heathens use smoke signals all through recorded history?

89
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,280
How's that a fucking recommendation?

90
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,640
Well, seems to me like letters posted one person to another

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,620
is just a slower version of the same idea.

92
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,880
When's the last time you got a fucking letter from a stranger?

93
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,540
Bad news about Paul.

94
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,340
Bad news.

95
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,960
Tries against our interests is our sole communication.

96
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,900
So by all means, let's plant poles all across the country.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,040
Bestune the cocksucker with wires to hurry the sorry word and blinker our judgments of motive, huh?

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,780
He's giving it more thought than me.

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,020
Ain't the state of things cloudy enough? Don't we face enough fucking imponderables?

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
Does it seem like you're not getting money for your payment anywhere?

101
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,820
Instead, Prosper's not another settlement, repayment, or consolidation program, but money.

102
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,700
Repudiation protects your money, lets you keep your unsecured debt payments.

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,880
Prosper better quality lives for money.

104
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,640
Money-free future.

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,900
8393.

106
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,260
Okay, hi.

107
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:44,740
Hi.

108
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,200
Oh, uh, how are you?

109
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm bi.

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,980
How are you this evening?

111
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,620
Uh, I'm very high.

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,880
Uh, so, uh, it's very to you, so, uh...

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,880
Mm-hmm.

114
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,340
Great.

115
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,780
And, and, and, uh, uh, too.

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,580
Mm-hmm.

117
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,020
Hello?

118
00:06:59,580 --> 00:06:59,980
Hello?

119
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,440
Can you hear me?

120
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,340
Yeah, I can hear you.

121
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,380
I can hear you.

122
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, Galactic Federation.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,920
Okay, very good.

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,340
Uh...

125
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,620
Alright.

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
Oh, hey, Henry.

127
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,400
You know you can't bring Arthur to school.

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,500
But he's my best friend.

129
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,900
No, he's your best lizard friend.

130
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,620
You've got lots of non-lizard friends.

131
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,700
Not really.

132
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,000
Really?

133
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,300
Nope.

134
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,540
Bob has been busted having an affair with a nurse.

135
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,380
If I go down, I need to know.

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,780
Busted having an affair with a nurse.

137
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,240
His son-in-law, Dr. Gunna, oversees the family.

138
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,740
Bob has been busted having an affair with a nurse.

139
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,500
Uh, a cannoli.

140
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,480
A knish?

141
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,380
That's not exactly that.

142
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
It's more like peanut butter and jelly inside burnt toast.

143
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,640
Oh, yeah.

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,380
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


146
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


147
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


148
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


149
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


150
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


151
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


152
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


153
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


154
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,380


155
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,780
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:39,780


157
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:39,940
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


159
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


160
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


161
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


162
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


163
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


164
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,940


165
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,820
And once you know that, you can cut them a little slack.

166
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,060
Besides, you'll have plenty of time to aggravate them in your teens.

167
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,940
From PR News in Washington, I could do significant damage to PR.

168
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,440
The final four Republican presidential candidates touched down near Birmingham, claiming two

169
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,340
lives and leaving at least 100 others hurt.

170
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,860
Authorities today were working to determine whether there were any additional victims

171
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,000
of Mitt Romney-Newt Gingrich.

172
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,000
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.

173
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,020
.

174
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,900
The European Union has joined the United States for another televised debate.

175
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,780
Government and police will need to obtain a warrant.

176
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,760
An Alaska woman who took on Newt Gingrich using a grain shovel was apparently able to fend the animal off.

177
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,640
According to a report in the Anchorage Daily News, Gingrich began stomping on the woman's husband.

178
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,980
Officials say the 85-year-old woman grabbed the shovel and began hitting the animal.

179
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,060
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

180
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

181
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,980
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

182
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

183
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

184
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

185
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:36,640
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

186
00:11:37,020 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

187
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,900
I'm continuing to pressure PR News in Washington.

188
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:42,320
Today is a time when every subgenius, every piece of equipment is measured against the unrelenting standard of

189
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,860
moment when you and your Cagalent긴 the day-by-day efficiency of your own efforts

190
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,200
Martin, get up to the bridge and check out.

191
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,740
... okay, right away.

192
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,360
... okay, right away.

193
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,360


194
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,100
... okay, right away.

195
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,640
... okay, right away.

196
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,880
... okay, right away.

197
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,260
come together, where each serves the other, and all serve Bob Bob Bob on or under, and

198
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,820
all serve the total organism that is the shirt itself.

199
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,980
Yes, Mark, what is it?

200
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,540
Maybe you better have a look, Bob Peter, yourself.

201
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,660
Something wrong?

202
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,660
It's dirty.

203
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,360
Looks alright to me.

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,560
It's just that it seemed to come up a little slow.

205
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:32,780
Hello.

206
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,180
Subgenius Information Center, where when the chips are down, the shirt is bought from,

207
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,820
where each subgenius feeds the others, and all together feed the demands of Bob to carry

208
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,560
out its mission.

209
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,960
It's the church of the subgenius, where you and the other very special subgenius, the

210
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,240
ones able to analyze, test, repair, and maintain the electronic nervous system by doing a subgenius

211
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,560
job.

212
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,360
I want the earth for myself, and that is why I have brought you from the far planet, Dr.

213
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,900
Botanist.

214
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,600
You will go and conquer it for me.

215
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,160
Yes.

216
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,640
You might have some trouble with the church of the subgenius.

217
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,820
And Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

218
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,360
It's all.

219
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,800
But the gargoyle barn will easily destroy them.

220
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,640
The world will be in your power before long.

221
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,200
Good.

222
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,100
Only Dr. Botanist can control the plant monster.

223
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

224
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,500
Bob!

225
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:53,720
Bob!

226
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,120
Bob!

227
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,560
Bob!

228
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,560


229
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,320
Swear to God!

230
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,420
Bob!

231
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,560
Bob!

232
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,060
Bob!

233
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,620
Bob!

234
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:07,720


235
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:07,720


236
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,160
Bob!

237
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,160


238
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,160


239
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,760
It's all Stanks' fault, and I've had enough.

240
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,380
Reverend is laid down trying to hide another seizure.

241
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,920
Makes you clever to see through the subterfuge.

242
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,060
I've been letting it go.

243
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,820
But if the idea is for you to drink more and more till I say something, I am hereby officially

244
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,540
saying, I wish you would stop drinking now.

245
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:32,540


246
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,920
fucking drinking.

247
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,220
I have

248
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,200
no fucking ideas

249
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,480
as far as you saying one fucking

250
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,340
thing about anything

251
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,720
I do or don't.

252
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,100
As far as drinking

253
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,640
or where I stand or nap

254
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,520
or any other fucking thing

255
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,340
concerning me.

256
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,320
Or go or leave or don't

257
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,540
or when.

258
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,060
Alright, Jane.

259
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,540
So you can go fuck yourself

260
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,080
and don't try and hasten anyone

261
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,140
anywhere. Because everyone follows

262
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,400
their own fucking pace

263
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,740
and don't try and fucking hasten them.

264
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,400
And

265
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,460
don't try and hasten them

266
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,960
although I think

267
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,400
Dave has... I don't know if my

268
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,740
certificate is in order or not. I've been listening

269
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,880
and I got a little nervous

270
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,480
at the end because you said you were

271
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,740
that everybody needs to measure

272
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,300
their equipment and mine is low.

273
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,600
Just don't feel hastened,

274
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,100
Dave. Don't feel hastened.

275
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,700
It's all Stang's fault.

276
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,860
Yep.

277
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
Blame it on Stang.

278
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,960
Well, Legim is

279
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,400
always trying to take the

280
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,280
credit for the blame

281
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,960
these days.

282
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,780
Although sometimes

283
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,360
Pisces gets it.

284
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,920
She said she couldn't call in tonight

285
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,640
by the way because she's moving.

286
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,380
Yeah.

287
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,780
Well, unfortunately, you know,

288
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,820
gravitationally, electronically speaking

289
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,660
I mean on the electron level

290
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,080
we're all moving at all times.

291
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,420
Even if we don't think

292
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,200
we're moving and they stick us in a casket

293
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,540
or one of those, what you call it, tubes

294
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,420
send you to outer space or whatever.

295
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,160
Oh, the worst is the time machine.

296
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
You go five seconds ahead in the future

297
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,140
and you're in the outer space because the Earth

298
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,560
just moved out from under you.

299
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah, I never considered that until just

300
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,080
a few years ago. I mean, until

301
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,160
just now. I didn't really

302
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,640
the first time.

303
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,320
It's a great thought. I wish I would have thought of it.

304
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,240
Well, let's see. Here's

305
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,320
what I haven't done yet, Dave, is

306
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,200
the credits. And I also

307
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,020
haven't

308
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,120
we didn't tell you how much

309
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,100
fun we had at the Afrofest last

310
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,540
night.

311
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,320
I remembered you were going to remember.

312
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,720
Yeah, well,

313
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,960
our previous show,

314
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,320
Charleston's show,

315
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,960
African Abstract,

316
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,760
we just now realized as he was leaving

317
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
that he, Princess We,

318
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,100
and I all have something

319
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,700
in common. We run

320
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,660
a festival.

321
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,800
He's done Afrofest,

322
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,920
this is the fourth year, I think.

323
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,980
And Princess We

324
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,660
started with Starwood

325
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,480
170 years ago.

326
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,820
That's in Neanderthal.

327
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,500
She wasn't

328
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,480
really one of the main people then, but by

329
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,880
evolutionary

330
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,220
forces,

331
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,860
she's become one of the

332
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,400
main people behind that

333
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,540
festival. And of course, we have

334
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,740
X-Day coming up.

335
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,460
I think I've already been through my X-Day

336
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,260
paranoias.

337
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,260
And I'm, uh, we slacked

338
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,040
off yesterday.

339
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,420
And didn't worry.

340
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,280
Well, Princess We didn't

341
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,220
slack off, really.

342
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,800
Starwood's a much bigger

343
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,440
headache than X-Day.

344
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,360
And there were many, much more

345
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,460
heads there. But the thing is,

346
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,420
although the heads are smaller,

347
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,160
I don't mean there were bigger heads.

348
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,280
If this really is,

349
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,140
if X-Day really happens,

350
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,260
I should say when it really happens

351
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,960
this year,

352
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,720
she won't have anything

353
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,780
to worry about. We'll just move the whole

354
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,620
campground to my

355
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
escape vessel.

356
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,860
And we'll have Starwood.

357
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,900
And all the hippies that paid for Starwood

358
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,000
will get the full show.

359
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,280
And then some.

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,260
And then the ones that haven't bought

361
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,620
their subgenius membership by then

362
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,580
will be ejected into outer

363
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,280
space or sent back to the

364
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,780
giant crater left at the former

365
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,360
site of Starwood.

366
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,220
But that's what happens to the

367
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,800
unsaved, the disbelievers.

368
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,220
Speaking of belief and everything, let me do the

369
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,860
credits real quick here.

370
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,080
Credo, I believe.

371
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,020
Did you hear the

372
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,640
fellow talking about

373
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,380
life, the universe, and everything at the beginning?

374
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,560
Yes. Right after Charleston's

375
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,100
rant? That was G.

376
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,860
Gordon Gordon.

377
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,660
We heard Charleston

378
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,220
doing a quick little

379
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,060
rant about early

380
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,980
African origins of

381
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,880
humankind, which I've

382
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,980
also been boning up on,

383
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,480
as it were.

384
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,840
He said bone. Well, fossil

385
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,320
bones.

386
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,220
Denisivian

387
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,620
bones.

388
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,320
Denisivian bones.

389
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,920
Sounds lewd and disgusting.

390
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,060
Or Ignatian bones

391
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
and Neanderthal bones and stuff.

392
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,920
That sounds even leuder. Anyway, that was

393
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,860
G. Gordon Gordon doing the

394
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,500
science talk about how

395
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,740
the purpose,

396
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,720
the purpose of life is to

397
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,300
enjoy yourself.

398
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,240
To entertain.

399
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,140
And he should know, because

400
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm not sure when he

401
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,360
had his 70th birthday,

402
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,140
but I think it was a while ago.

403
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,380
A while ago, yes.

404
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,460
And he'll be at X Day. In fact, he'll be staying with us

405
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,040
at X Day.

406
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,520
But the OK So All Stars

407
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,340
did our title.

408
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,260
Doug Smith says we're different.

409
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,400
It's from Invasion

410
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,300
of the Aluminum People.

411
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,180
1979 or 80

412
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,260
by the late

413
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,240
Reverend David Boone. There was a little

414
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,620
bit of

415
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,180
Deadwood,

416
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,480
you might say.

417
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,480
You know, that takes some

418
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,220
cuss cutting.

419
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,080
The internet version doesn't

420
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,180
sound the same as the version we played

421
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,060
on the air.

422
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,080
Oh, and the collages

423
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,040
were almost all by Reverend

424
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,380
Decapitator. Reverend Royalist

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,140
Bill Decapitator. The music,

426
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,200
the instrumental music in the middle was

427
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,220
The Psychoskeletons.

428
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,620
I like both of those very much.

429
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,020
Both

430
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,880
Psychoskeletons?

431
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
And also the

432
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
other, which you

433
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,840
mentioned before. The other musical.

434
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,260
Oh, the new PR

435
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,120
news is by Reverend

436
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,260
Cosmic Debris.

437
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,380
Ministry of Slack did the

438
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
subgenius readiness

439
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,040
public service announcement.

440
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,940
Those were funny also.

441
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,360
Everything was. And then at the end

442
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,320
there was, that was Calamity Jane

443
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
on Deadwood talking

444
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,140
about, don't try to hasten

445
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,060
nobody. Man,

446
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,820
I must have removed nine

447
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
cuss words from that thing.

448
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,120
I imagine so. Sometimes you can tell.

449
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,020
Yeah, and that's a magic number too when you think about it.

450
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,060
Thrice times, thrice times,

451
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,240
thrice did you remove this swearing.

452
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
Three times, three times

453
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,180
three did the blasphemes go.

454
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,200
As you retreated into

455
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,940
the potato room to argue

456
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,720
with the flower.

457
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh, and just so I get this,

458
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
so I don't forget, the music, the nice

459
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
music in the background is by

460
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,980
the Flyin' Ryan Brothers from

461
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,080
their album Under the Influence.

462
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,700
A new album from

463
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,320
Ryanetics

464
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,300
music, ryanetics.com

465
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,560
R-Y-A-N

466
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,480
Ethics.

467
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,560
And

468
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,100
I don't play them much on ARS Slack.

469
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,980
Because they're kind of like too good.

470
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,480
And pretty.

471
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,720
They have a little bit of an early XTC

472
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,100
feeling before they became

473
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,060
what you call it, pop stars.

474
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,040
And also a little bit like

475
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,900
Nevermind. XTC.

476
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,140
Dave, you know so much more about music

477
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,200
than I do. I've never even heard of it.

478
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
But that was just like the very first album, I think.

479
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, thanks to Philo

480
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,980
I am familiar with

481
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,720
early XTC and

482
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,700
nothing else after that.

483
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,120
There was a time when

484
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,620
Dr. Philo Drummond

485
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,560
was collecting

486
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,140
he had an actual job and would buy

487
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,300
actual albums at actual

488
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,180
record stores. And it was

489
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,100
the beginning of the punk period and

490
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,940
he would just go buy band names

491
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,340
and album art.

492
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,120
I guess he could afford

493
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,620
to do that.

494
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,140
I could do that with

495
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,720
MP3s for free.

496
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,660
He was a collector of cultural artifacts

497
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,340
at the time and he knew it because

498
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,040
because

499
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,280
he had that kind of vision

500
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,360
which only he had at the time

501
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,120
which that they would be as collectible items

502
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,200
because there would soon be

503
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,540
no more records. But now they

504
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,180
in a neo-McClunite sense

505
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,620
the damn things have been reinvented

506
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,600
and now kids that were not around

507
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,300
alive during the punk era

508
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,020
have punk bands that have to put out vinyl

509
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,560
on 45s.

510
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,000
And somebody in Germany buys a thousand of them.

511
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,420
Right.

512
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,080
What I don't get is

513
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,960
hippies came back.

514
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,340
They all did both concurrently.

515
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,040
I mean

516
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,940
in that they wear

517
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,620
these kids these days

518
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,360
they wear the same

519
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,180
dang haircuts

520
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,420
and tie-dye crap

521
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,200
that we did.

522
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,280
Only they still have all their hair.

523
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,760
It ain't fair.

524
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,420
It just ain't fair I tell you.

525
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,880
It's the civil, well like if you're into

526
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,260
real things retro it's the Civil War

527
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,440
look. A lot of people are

528
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,280
depopulating France now.

529
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,820
Removing their underwear and climbing

530
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,560
on the balconies in the middle of the night

531
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,860
waving you know thinking like somebody's gonna let them surrender.

532
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,060
But

533
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,240
I don't know if that's happened yet

534
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,660
but I assume it's coming just like everything else

535
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,180
is.

536
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,740
Everything that ever happened I'm afraid

537
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,660
is going to happen again including

538
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,860
the dark ages.

539
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,840
Yeah I just heard that on an old radio show

540
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,740
and it was called the Galactic

541
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,860
Barrier. And you get out so far

542
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,580
and it was like you know some

543
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,840
prime real early belief

544
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,860
in the finite

545
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,200
universe or something you know

546
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,420
as explained by mathematics.

547
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,320
And they hit this bump and then they go back

548
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,360
to where they started from.

549
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,300
Well it is a finite universe

550
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,860
in that frankly

551
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,440
you know I hate

552
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,420
to break any young person's heart

553
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,220
and I could easily be wrong about this.

554
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,680
I quit making predictions myself.

555
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,000
But I predict

556
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,100
that the

557
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,060
ideogularity will beat the

558
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,600
singularity and

559
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,920
you know

560
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,240
just as these

561
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,180
I mean I was raised

562
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,540
thinking there would be hotels

563
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,440
on the moon by the year

564
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,540
1977.

565
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,380
Yeah.

566
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,300
And we didn't even get the flying cars.

567
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,020
Although as Dr. Howell has pointed out

568
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,180
Hugh Hefner

569
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,840
has a flying car. You can buy

570
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,660
a flying car but you have to file

571
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,840
a flight plan every time you go

572
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
somewhere. Well Hugh Hefner

573
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,580
is a mummy. I mean he's a mummy.

574
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,320
He's like one of those reincarnated

575
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,120
you know the kids on

576
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,500
he's been alive for like 4,000 years

577
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,660
and stuff. Right.

578
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,260
I only call him St. Robert

579
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,140
St. Janay or St. Germain

580
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,280
type guys. Oh yeah St. Germain.

581
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah. And he can't

582
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
get a haircut because he's been you know

583
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,320
he's been through a thousand barbers

584
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,520
or millions of barbers maybe

585
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,660
even I don't know if that makes

586
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,220
any sense or if I even care but

587
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,400
I noticed those people on X minus

588
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,680
1 when they were doing they're talking about the galactic

589
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,300
barriers like it's like

590
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,200
1987.

591
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,360
And we have reached the

592
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,380
center of the galaxy.

593
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Yeah. One final

594
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,360
thing for men to discover and then

595
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,400
at the same time they had ships

596
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,120
whistles and guns that went

597
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,360
ooga ooga. They say now

598
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,180
hear this and stuff. Right.

599
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
And the spaceship

600
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,420
control panels looked

601
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,260
exactly like the old radio

602
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,180
control panel from KMON

603
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,600
in Dallas. Exactly.

604
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,060
Or their sound. The

605
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,220
sound. Actually I very frequently in old

606
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,140
movies will see

607
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,780
sound mixing studios

608
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,380
old timey film

609
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:36,960
sound

610
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,200
you know because they have spinning reels and lots

611
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,100
of dials and things

612
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,780
dashboard

613
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,180
speedometers that spin around

614
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,240
could still make a lot of like Christmas

615
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,000
tree lights go

616
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,140
it was a

617
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,940
wonderful time

618
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,240
a time so few

619
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,180
remember because

620
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,940
there's nothing really to think about

621
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,880
there. It's just a happening.

622
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,400
Well I don't think anybody really could

623
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,260
think a whole lot until a certain

624
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,400
point. And of course that was when

625
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,120
that was beginning of the end thinking

626
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,180
and even worse talking

627
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,820
yeah to use this

628
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,060
around talking about stuff and then thinking

629
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,240
about it in human language.

630
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,180
The tool tool using is actually

631
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,300
where where it starts going

632
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,460
really bad. Well

633
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,140
some say it was rocafort cheese.

634
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,460
Was the era was the

635
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,220
end and beginning of all things

636
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,040
as far as civilization and walking

637
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,640
you know on two feet goes.

638
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,200
Well you know we started

639
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,160
the show with

640
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,620
Charleston Okafor

641
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,180
doing a little rant about the early

642
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,740
African origins and I

643
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,140
have spent

644
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,000
actually this whole weekend I've been

645
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,600
re

646
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
researching my

647
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,920
paleo anthropology because

648
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,240
the stuff I was raised to know

649
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,420
was all wrong.

650
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,040
And and

651
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,800
you cannot get that the

652
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,820
latest stuff from a textbook because

653
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,540
it's coming too hot and heavy.

654
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,540
Two years ago

655
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,780
Neanderthals were completely different

656
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,660
species and couldn't

657
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,900
interbreed with humans.

658
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,260
But one year ago it

659
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,080
was proved more or

660
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,980
less at least for the time being

661
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,800
until somebody comes up with something

662
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,880
else that not

663
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,160
only did.

664
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,120
Neanderthals breed with humans.

665
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,380
So there was another species called

666
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,680
Denisovians.

667
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,480
Denisovians.

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,440
I only read this stuff.

669
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,300
I never hear it pronounced so I don't know

670
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,260
how to pronounce things.

671
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,940
Nobody talks about Cro-Magnon man

672
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,320
anymore.

673
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,820
It's now the Aurignacian culture.

674
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,000
It's actually given a name of a culture.

675
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,180
Well from 35,000 to

676
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,000
45,000 years ago in the upper

677
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,800
Paleolithic.

678
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,760
In Europe.

679
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,060
That was when the Neanderthals

680
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,280
started to vanish

681
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,920
and were apparently

682
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,780
replaced by people

683
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,300
who had come out of Africa

684
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,340
who had

685
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,320
were much more adaptable.

686
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,980
They had what we would call

687
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,380
a modern human brain.

688
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,560
They had developed that linguistic thing

689
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,900
that the big talking that led to all

690
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,440
the trouble.

691
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,740
This stuff that's getting us in trouble right now.

692
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,540
They had invented.

693
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:27,900
F.C.

694
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,440
Yeah.

695
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,280
They had invented the first figurative art

696
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,440
such as pornography.

697
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,020
The earliest one.

698
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,240
Yeah.

699
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,840
The earliest known art that looks like

700
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,960
something is a Venus that someone found in a cave.

701
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,380
Wow.

702
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,500
You once pointed out that the very one of

703
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,140
the some Neolithic painting in which a person

704
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,460
is sitting on a woman's lap and farts.

705
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,920
And you said it was.

706
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,340
What?

707
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,140
I don't know if maybe it was.

708
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,160
I thought it was you who told me that.

709
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,740
And I later Googled it and or whatever it looked it up.

710
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,420
And it's it's a painting of a woman or someone sitting on a woman's lap.

711
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,800
And the joke is a fart.

712
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,460
Well if I said that then you get a little lines.

713
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,840
That's Jimmy Hemsworth's argument palace and so forth.

714
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,140
And you know the various subcrop or crow crow towing whatever they used to call them in

715
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,900
ancient Virginia.

716
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm gone.

717
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,220
I don't know.

718
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,160
And that's where I'm going.

719
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,440
I've had it with this place.

720
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,840
I'm going to Crow at the end.

721
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,720
Well obviously Dave did pick up on it.

722
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,480
Well I was one of the early in a previous life.

723
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,960
I fled the colony.

724
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,080
And Wolf where was Crow Crow at the end.

725
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,900
Crow was just the name of a couple of people used to pass by on trading expositions expeditions

726
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,700
once in a while.

727
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,120
And a lot of them said well I'm going to go with you.

728
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,640
There's a lot more happening that way.

729
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,520
I thought it was the name of an Indian tribe in Virginia.

730
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,060
What's now Virginia.

731
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:15,420
But the guys who came the second wave of colonists who showed up expecting to find some colonists

732
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,640
found nobody.

733
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,800
And the phrase gone to Croato and carved on a tree.

734
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,800
Don't we have a T-shirt.

735
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,020
Well it's hard to think of that.

736
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,820
That could be New Brunswick or Korea or someplace near a city in the ancient Philippines.

737
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,840
But one thing is for certain is they got out of there and they probably walked out with somebody's help.

738
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
And there were probably enough people around if they brought you know walked a half a mile.

739
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,040
Somebody pointed you know in a direction if they didn't speak whatever language it was never dance it or.

740
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh most those Englishmen that came over here and even the ones who were like you know the landowners educated version of American.

741
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,900
Early American settler and governor types.

742
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,960
They didn't know Jack.

743
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:10,420
If it hadn't been for the the occasional natives given them a clue like hey you know you have to eat some vegetables or you're going to die.

744
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,080
Yes.

745
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,140
That kind of thing.

746
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,880
They never would have made it.

747
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,900
No.

748
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,220
They certainly would not.

749
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,680
Everybody.

750
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,180
Oh God.

751
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,300
Today I spent this afternoon reading up on Easter Island just because I got curious about it.

752
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,140
Princess.

753
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,240
We have a holiday.

754
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,080
And you forgot what year you are actually been.

755
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,180
Well you've been returned a few times.

756
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,440
But you forgot what year it was.

757
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,480
Well I did.

758
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,200
We had started with.

759
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,340
Princess Wee's mom sent her a picture of people digging up one of those Easter Island heads.

760
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,780
With big ears.

761
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,340
Yeah.

762
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,600
And we were all like wow they have bodies underneath.

763
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,080
And I was all like.

764
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:48,920
Yeah.

765
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,260
They're aliens from another planet that are going to be activated any second now.

766
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,260
Because I read that in a Jack Kirby comic book a long time ago.

767
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:06,360
But it turns out they've actually been digging those things up since 1990 and re-erecting them.

768
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,420
The what do they call them?

769
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,840
The something like Maui's but it's not.

770
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,800
Maui?

771
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,140
Yeah.

772
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,140
They are called those big statues.

773
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,820
I may not be pronouncing it right.

774
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
Again I only read this stuff.

775
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,380
I never hear it.

776
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,000
So I don't watch TV or listen to the radio.

777
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,500
But it's especially not this show.

778
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,880
But yeah they're called Maui's or.

779
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,620
Anyway you want to hear a quick.

780
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,240
Do you want to hear an impressive very quick history of Easter Island?

781
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,080
Cool.

782
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,900
Because I was you know when I said Maori I thought I was you know stressing the Polynesian connection.

783
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,080
Well they were Polynesians.

784
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,380
Dating now has them settling.

785
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,750
Settling that island around 700 to 1200 Common Era or AD.

786
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,950
And about the same time Hawaii was first settled.

787
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,870
And get this.

788
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:16,510
Those guys and gals had to sail 3,000 miles from where they were to get to Easter Island.

789
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:21,190
The nearest inhabited island to there now is Pitcairn Island.

790
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,090
Which is 1,200 miles away.

791
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,110
But they weren't coming from that direction.

792
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,410
They were coming from the other direction.

793
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,350
And somehow.

794
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,810
I mean that's some mighty navigational skills.

795
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,530
Yeah.

796
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,570
In catamarans.

797
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,490
Well that's why they call it the Middle Ages.

798
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,210
You know what I mean?

799
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:44,090
We kind of took a step backwards there in the European culture for a couple of almost a thousand years.

800
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,170
Well it happened to then.

801
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,570
And it's still happening technically.

802
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,170
I'm sure it will again yet.

803
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,170
And the Easter Island.

804
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,070
The Easter Islanders.

805
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,210
It's a.

806
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,410
God.

807
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,130
Everything that could go wrong eventually did.

808
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,670
I'm sure it was great at first.

809
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,410
The pre-European population of Easter Island.

810
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,570
Which is only 15 by 7 miles by the way.

811
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,790
In size.

812
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,690
Kind of triangular shaped.

813
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,690
The pre-European population was about 7,000 to 17,000.

814
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,690
It's hard to tell.

815
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,710
The.

816
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,750
Had they.

817
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,450
There were only three types of trees when those people first got there.

818
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,830
But they brought their own seeds.

819
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,710
And they had 21 to all kinds of different trees.

820
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,290
Including some of the biggest palm trees in the world.

821
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:32,990
But.

822
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,830
Even before the Europeans got there in 1722.

823
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,190
A Dutch ship landed there.

824
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,750
The Easter Island natives or Rapa Nui people.

825
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,570
Had extinctified all land birds.

826
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,250
And most sea birds.

827
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,090
And 21 species of trees.

828
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,370
In other words.

829
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,530
They had grown too big for their island.

830
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,590
And were starting to decimate the environment.

831
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,010
When the Europeans landed there.

832
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,450
Of course they brought the miracle of rats.

833
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,350
Which wiped out all the rest of the snakes and lizards and things.

834
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,350
And smallpox of course.

835
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,730
Measles and TB and so forth.

836
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,810
By 18.

837
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,110
Oh God.

838
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,950
It's horrible.

839
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,490
After the Europeans arrived.

840
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,670
Not that they necessarily had anything to do with this.

841
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,850
There was a war on Easter Island.

842
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,630
As people got more and more desperate.

843
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,970
The ancestor cult that built the statues.

844
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,450
Was defeated by warriors who were called the Bird Men.

845
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,990
Who have a similar group on Hawaii.

846
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,550
And they toppled all the statues.

847
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,670
Things continued to get worse.

848
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,170
In the 1860s.

849
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,090
The Peruvians started a slave trade.

850
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,790
Sailing to Easter Island.

851
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,110
By that time there were only 3,000 Easter Islanders left.

852
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,470
And the Peruvians made half of them into slaves.

853
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,530
Leaving only 1,500 people there.

854
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,290
By 1877.

855
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,250
There were 111 inhabitants.

856
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,530
And that's the story of the Peruvian people.

857
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,170
Of the Rapa Nui people.

858
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,710
Of whom only 36 had children.

859
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,770
In 1982.

860
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,130
A census showed that the population had grown.

861
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,950
Thanks to an Englishman.

862
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,410
Who basically bought the island.

863
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:35,730
And declared it a world historical site.

864
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,830
You know.

865
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,430
And allowed only tourists.

866
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,550
And kind of controlled things.

867
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,870
And they tried to bring back as many natives.

868
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,590
As they could.

869
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,110
But.

870
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,050
And to this.

871
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,370
Today there's about 2,000 Rapa Nui people.

872
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,490
Or about 70% of them are Rapa Nui.

873
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,330
Although they're mixed with Europeans.

874
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,050
And other Polynesians now.

875
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,250
So the Bird Men won.

876
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,830
And then they lost everything.

877
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,630
Oh and in 2010.

878
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,150
I had no idea about this.

879
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,250
The natives had a wounded knee.

880
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,310
Remember wounded knee in the 70s.

881
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,370
In wounded knee South Dakota.

882
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,570
The American Indian movement came in.

883
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,070
Yes.

884
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,250
Took over a drug store.

885
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,150
Basically.

886
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,450
In the little town of wounded knee.

887
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,190
And the FBI.

888
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,490
It almost turned into.

889
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,450
Well the government didn't respond with a drug store.

890
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,570
They responded with a bunch of armored vehicles.

891
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:27,630
Yes.

892
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,510
I know all too much about that.

893
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,750
The guys who started that.

894
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,730
Russell Means and Dennis Banks.

895
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,390
Lived in the house that I moved into.

896
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,810
Right after that.

897
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,870
In South Dakota.

898
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,250
So I.

899
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,470
In fact.

900
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,850
I did my best to prove.

901
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:43,850


902
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,070
I did my best to prove it.

903
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,110


904
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,110


905
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,110


906
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,210
To prevent an invasion of Crow Dogs Paradise.

907
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:52,890
But the feds weren't heading for that Crow Dogs that day.

908
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,310
They were going to his cousins.

909
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:55,950
Where they.

910
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:02,050
In fact did find a big stash of hand grenades and machine guns.

911
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,450
Because these Indian guys were all Vietnam vets.

912
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:05,850
You know.

913
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,830
That was back in the 70s.

914
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,830
Anyway it was interesting to find out that the Rapa Nui people in East Dakota.

915
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


916
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


917
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


918
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


919
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


920
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


921
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


922
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


923
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


924
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


925
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


926
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


927
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


928
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:13,830


929
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:21,090
Easter Island tried to do, it was like, hey, we got cheated, and this little hotel here really belongs to us, so we're going to take over.

930
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,950
That was in 2010.

931
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:30,530
And the Chilean government owns Easter Island now.

932
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,730
They came in and said, no, you're not.

933
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,750
And nobody got killed, and nothing happened.

934
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:45,370
Well, their voice will continue to be heard, because what a weird place and what a weird story to think of it to begin with.

935
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:45,830
Yeah.

936
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:59,370
3,000 miles, and they said, this is purely anecdotal, but I do remember hearing saying that ancient Polynesians could, like, feel the water and stuff,

937
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:06,590
and all the currents over here, and their star things were incredible.

938
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,290
It's incredible for the time, and for now, I guess, even.

939
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:09,850
Yeah.

940
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,290
Yeah, it's, well, you know, some people would say, well, they must have been helped out by aliens,

941
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:23,130
because only aliens could build them giant heads, and only aliens can dig ditches in the dirt that look like ants from overhead in Peru,

942
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,890
and only aliens can build pyramids.

943
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,410
No.

944
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:36,230
Either well-paid civil servants or thousands of slaves or both can build pyramids.

945
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,430
And stonehenges and Easter Island heads.

946
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:48,110
And, yes, yeah, you do have to haul giant rocks a long way, but that can be done.

947
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,050
Plenty of fishes and papayas.

948
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,650
In an area where there weren't any trees to have as things to roll on.

949
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,670
Well, they had plenty of trees for a while.

950
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,950
The same thing happened in Iceland, didn't it?

951
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:06,030
Wasn't it denuded, and now it's like, but luckily they have thermal underwear and so forth?

952
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,150
They do have a lot of thermal.

953
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,410
Well, they're getting into new information technology ways of growing things,

954
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:22,730
self-enclosed units that capture the sunlight and then make the water do something else,

955
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,830
and then turn on the lights and then turn the lights off when the lights are down,

956
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,390
because there's no agriculture, as you would imagine, in Iceland.

957
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:36,070
People indigenously lived off fish, period, and some kinds of lichen and moss and stew.

958
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,070
And things like that.

959
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,830
But I guess even potatoes wouldn't grow.

960
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,730
But now they can grow like killer hydro, dude.

961
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,190
Yeah.

962
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,110
Dude, it's like from Iceland, man.

963
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,730
It's frosty.

964
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,510
Yeah, have some frosty, dude.

965
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,790
I got it from the snowman.

966
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,850
Yes, silly land.

967
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,870
I mean, why would you, you know, and everybody worried about their bank crashing.

968
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,210
Well, I'd be worried more about the kids, you know, walking into...

969
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,950
It's an ice banker accidentally walking off a cliff into some penguins and stuff.

970
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,010
Well, apparently a lot of them went to Norway to get jobs.

971
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,550
It's a fine place to get a job, Norway.

972
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:19,950
Norway.

973
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,930
Norway, man.

974
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,370
Another pool of the imperialist sausages.

975
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,390
They dangle and dangle, and in the middle of the night you wake up

976
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,850
and there's another imperialist sausage passing by.

977
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,770
There's another cream puff.

978
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,050
There's another blah, blah.

979
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,350
Well, it's like the more history you read, the more it just keeps repeating itself.

980
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,810
Somebody has a revolution and then they're all going to do things cool this time.

981
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,270
And then one of them goes, yeah, but my way's a little cooler than your way.

982
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,390
And I have a bigger club than you.

983
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,590
Basically, it's the...

984
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,770
I have more people in my clique than you do.

985
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,690
Yeah.

986
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,750
And then he gets poisoned.

987
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:02,770
Yeah.

988
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:03,470
And then...

989
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,410
It's basically the bad guys win because...

990
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,030
They're the only ones that are willing to totally, you know, screw everything up real bad.

991
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:17,610
Well, actually, that movie Team America, World Police, explained...

992
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,130
Oh, yeah, the whole coin.

993
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:26,770
...society in one little rant of which I cannot use any of the main words on broadcast radio.

994
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:31,010
But it is the truth about all of history.

995
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:33,810
And it's...

996
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,650
I can't...

997
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,150
I can't even begin to do it.

998
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,930
No, it can't even be paraphrased.

999
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,590
No, it can't even paraphrase it.

1000
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,570
It wouldn't make any sense.

1001
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,090
Well, nothing makes very much sense anyway, so you can paraphrase it well.

1002
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,890
You can just, like, come up with a statement and, like, and then repair it, say it a different way.

1003
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,310
And we, you know...

1004
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,050
Hey, what do you think?

1005
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,110
How do you think we kept this dang church's subgenius going since 1979?

1006
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,150
If you want to tell a lie, tell a big one.

1007
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,210
And tell it over and over.

1008
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,850
And everyone would believe it.

1009
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,270
That's called television.

1010
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:08,630
Yes.

1011
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,270
Oh, did I...

1012
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,170
I may have told you about this, Dave.

1013
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,470
About the irradiation of your nether parts.

1014
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:15,410
I heard it again.

1015
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,730
You were trying to couple with a big screen digital.

1016
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,630
I was trying to bring mammoths back to life was all I was trying to do.

1017
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,650
Anyway, no, that wasn't what it was.

1018
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,470
I got a letter from a TV producer from the Learning Channel.

1019
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,270
They said, we're doing this show about people with...

1020
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:34,310
People with...

1021
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,110
Weird obsessions and collections.

1022
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,710
And I read about your alien abduction online.

1023
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:47,670
And I had to write them back and give a brief, fingers crossed description of Church of the Subgenius and go,

1024
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,010
you really misunderstand.

1025
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,470
I've never been abducted by aliens.

1026
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:56,230
And I don't even believe in that stuff the way people talk about it.

1027
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:03,770
I did write an article about an abduction experience that I later knew full well to be just a standard,

1028
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,070
night hag dream that people have had all through history.

1029
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,170
They used to think it was witches and leprechauns.

1030
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,770
And now it's turned to gray aliens.

1031
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,910
But yeah, I had one of those dreams too after seeing the movie Communion.

1032
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:28,470
But I got to throw in the phrase, since what we're doing is a complex bashing of gullibility and superstition,

1033
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,870
I doubt that our material would work on mainstream television.

1034
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,930
I got a big kick out of saying that to an L.A. TV producer.

1035
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,290
Because they always treat us like garbage.

1036
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:48,050
The only time it's ever been done right was the very second Showtime What's Up America in 1981

1037
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:54,370
did a good piece on Subgenius because the director was Reverend Larry Silkus,

1038
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,970
a subgenius and co-writer of Ghosts of Mars.

1039
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,230
These are hot lick stinkers.

1040
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,070
These guys go after the...

1041
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,410
If it leads, it bleeds.

1042
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:02,850
I mean...

1043
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,510
If it bleeds, it leads thing and stuff.

1044
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:09,210
And every other common denominator known to the people of Twelve Toes.

1045
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,590
They just come up with stuff, you know.

1046
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,190
And they know it's going to...

1047
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,210
It's going to...

1048
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:14,990
It's going to...

1049
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,770
You know, it's going to...

1050
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,170
It's going to...

1051
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:17,750
It's going to tell somebody.

1052
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,410
It's going to...

1053
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,690
You know.

1054
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,770
Well, it's what sells.

1055
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,270
You know, what gets most advertisers.

1056
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,610
Yeah, if it bleeds, it reads or something.

1057
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,750
If it bleeds, it leads, yes.

1058
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,690
That's always been...

1059
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:30,810
It's always at the top.

1060
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,850
Well, you've been...

1061
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,230
You've been studying on that stuff,

1062
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,590
so you probably really, really know how much it bleeds.

1063
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:38,550
Oh, boy.

1064
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:39,790
Oh, man.

1065
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,490
You can do pretty much anything without having to resort to technology.

1066
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,250
People's minds are easy to screw with.

1067
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,970
You noticed that.

1068
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,570
I mean, it's beyond this, you know, the marketing class thing where they say,

1069
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,010
Well, if you repeat something three times,

1070
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,390
usually the consumer will keep the image in their mind.

1071
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,810
Sometimes you, you know...

1072
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,790
How do you think I felt when...

1073
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:06,150
When the richest person I've ever met...

1074
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,670
Wanted to marry you.

1075
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:13,030
Flew into the Cleveland airport using his private jet,

1076
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,550
probably spent more on fuel just landing than I made the whole year,

1077
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,190
and wanted to meet with me,

1078
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:23,270
and what he really wanted was to meet J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1079
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:31,370
In other words, I don't know how to put this in a nice, subgeniously religious way,

1080
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,830
but the...

1081
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,330
The richest person I ever met,

1082
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,570
who had inherited...

1083
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,250
He was the heir to the ball seed fortune,

1084
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,850
was the most gullible, stupid person I ever met.

1085
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:50,050
And yet, I still was not able to keep a straight face,

1086
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,670
and string him along, and bleed him for a million bucks.

1087
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,810
I was too honest.

1088
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,310
And I was too disgusted by the way he treated his wife and kids.

1089
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,650
He banished...

1090
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,410
He banished us to the other side of the room.

1091
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,490
We weren't even able to sit with Reverend Stang.

1092
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,550
He had that corrupt British nobleman type of disdain

1093
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,730
for everything that came issued from his loins.

1094
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,810
Yeah, he wasn't interested in talking to Princess Wee,

1095
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,150
and he wasn't interested in having his wife involved.

1096
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,170
He was a philosopher, and he wanted to talk to me,

1097
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,730
but I think he assumed that I was just this clerk

1098
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,370
who was like the front man to keep idiots away from...

1099
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,010
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1100
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:35,650
You know, it's funny.

1101
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:42,290
I've had top rock station drive-time DJs

1102
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,810
right here in Cleveland assume the exact same thing.

1103
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,050
A spokesman for the Bob industry.

1104
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,630
This guy actually believes in this Bob dude, okay?

1105
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,370
Like, he got this Fraud of the Year Award of the Century.

1106
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,030
Fraud of the Century in Time Magazine in 2000.

1107
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,110
I didn't know who he was,

1108
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,630
so I looked him up.

1109
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,790
And he's like this crackpot who preaches aliens,

1110
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,930
and this Reverend Stang guy,

1111
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,150
he believes in this Bob dude.

1112
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,970
Every now and then I play that little clip on this show.

1113
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:19,690
Oh, man.

1114
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,610
That was done perfectly by yourself,

1115
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,390
doing even the change of character.

1116
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,490
Well, it was only one guy,

1117
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,270
but that was quite...

1118
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,690
said it all.

1119
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,510
And that's one reason why we don't do...

1120
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,950
fluff pieces with TV shows

1121
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:41,310
or drive-time radio jackanapes.

1122
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,930
Well, who cares what Sabrina Hazoukian

1123
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,750
and any other people with, you know,

1124
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,830
their lip mascara and their nostrils

1125
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,270
being dissolved by different acids and stuff like that.

1126
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:56,810
I mean, who needs to live in a cosmetically frou-frou world like that?

1127
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,810
Well, I wouldn't be able to afford to myself.

1128
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,250
It's the old problem of...

1129
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,930
I spent $400 this week

1130
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,430
just to show how I don't care how I look.

1131
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,470
I don't care what people think of how I look.

1132
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,110
Check out this tattoo I just spent $1,000 on.

1133
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,230
See, I don't care.

1134
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,230
Look at this crazy alienating hairdo

1135
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,810
I just spent my whole month's income on

1136
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,150
to prove that I don't care what people think.

1137
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,810
I'm so old I remember when people used to

1138
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,110
buy stonewashed jeans, you know,

1139
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:31,830
which are, you know,

1140
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,170
the way that jeans are going to appear

1141
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,690
in the next century and stuff anyway.

1142
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,130
So, you know, just wear it for a while and stuff like that.

1143
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,770
And all of a sudden I realized that this is a vast,

1144
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,330
has progressed as a vast industry of,

1145
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,090
what do they used to call them?

1146
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,150
Antique.

1147
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,670
Yeah, pre-distressed.

1148
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,010
Distressed furniture.

1149
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,350
Where everything's a cultural artifact with,

1150
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,930
well, it's not real, but, you know, there's dirt on it.

1151
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,310
And I even saw it, went to the Walmart and stuff

1152
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,890
and went to the work pants and stuff.

1153
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,470
And now they've got the phony farts.

1154
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:03,270
They've got stains on them.

1155
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,330
And I'm wondering, well,

1156
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,990
were these actually farted on in China?

1157
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,710
Or is it, you know, like...

1158
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,790
Or is it just printed on?

1159
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,610
Yeah.

1160
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,970
Do they have these kids that they force feed beans to

1161
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,750
and then they can put on pants after pants?

1162
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,210
Dave, I think we're approaching the borders of good taste.

1163
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,270
Well, I just, you know...

1164
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,030
Or maybe we passed them a while ago with that kidney stone.

1165
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,970
Oh, God, that still hurts.

1166
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:31,650
Oh, yeah, man.

1167
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:32,630
This hurts for a long time.

1168
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,130
Afterwards, I'm still undergoing a massive extraction

1169
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:41,010
from my comp with it.

1170
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,910
How is your comp, by the way?

1171
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,010
It's going well.

1172
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,530
In the thinking room, there's a dome place in my house

1173
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,050
where there's a thinking room and a map.

1174
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,290
I'm sorry.

1175
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:58,650
No, I think much like yourself and like Princess We,

1176
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,330
we no longer want to rule the world.

1177
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:02,950
No, I don't.

1178
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:06,230
We just want to find a narrow nostril space

1179
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:11,130
where a freaking space alien could conceivably,

1180
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,810
not, you know, superstitiously,

1181
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,710
but really come in there somehow

1182
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:20,930
and make the huge palm trees come back.

1183
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:23,570
Well...

1184
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,950
And so to speak, in life, make the big palm trees come back.

1185
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,730
Wish in one hand and vomit in the other

1186
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,790
and see which one gets full first.

1187
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:32,610
Slap.

1188
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:32,790
Slap.

1189
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,330
I can't quote Bob on that.

1190
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:40,950
That's another radio phrase that can't even be uttered.

1191
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,350
Nope.

1192
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,450
That's what you have to remember, though,

1193
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,610
when you buy into this sport,

1194
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,750
that there's a lot of things that are blanked out

1195
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,350
and you have to fill in the blanks.

1196
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,970
No, I remember Bob's quote.

1197
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,190
I'll try to do it tastefully.

1198
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,950
Extra meditate in one hand and puke in the other

1199
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,750
and wish you had a third hand.

1200
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:07,090
I think Onan may have channeled that.

1201
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,270
Those are words you live by.

1202
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,110
And at least, you know, in a vague proximity.

1203
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,910
You don't want to live right next door to them

1204
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,970
because people who vomit in one hand

1205
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:25,270
and wear their love lust on their tins like another...

1206
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,430
Okay, I'll say it.

1207
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:29,810
What was I?

1208
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,250
I thought I was in the...

1209
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,550
I haven't been in the thinking room,

1210
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,850
and I've been avoiding it.

1211
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:37,730
We went to...

1212
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,770
What did we do yesterday?

1213
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:39,850
We went for a walk.

1214
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:40,950
We went to a movie.

1215
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:42,610
Thinking shots.

1216
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,390
And we went to the Afrofest.

1217
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:49,090
And I played my video game.

1218
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:55,590
I helped Stangor in the deserted island of Moga Woods.

1219
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:01,270
And I've been sparing the radio audience tales of that.

1220
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,610
I don't know how much longer.

1221
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,270
You know, at some point,

1222
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,210
somebody's going to tune into Hour of Slack,

1223
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,190
and it won't be Reverend Stang talking.

1224
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,830
It'll be Stangor,

1225
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,350
who sounds sort of like Tarzan or Tonto

1226
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,230
or Frankenstein's monster.

1227
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:20,870
Why Tarzan or Tonto?

1228
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,170
Does that go back to the old...

1229
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,050
Well, in the game...

1230
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,850
Me say this or something?

1231
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:30,150
My first video game is called Monster Hunter Try.

1232
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,130
And it takes...

1233
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,930
My character is a monster hunter.

1234
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,650
That's Try with an I, not a Y.

1235
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:42,530
Yeah, it's the third version of this game.

1236
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,570
It's the first time I've ever understood

1237
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,710
how people can get so wrapped up in video games,

1238
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,370
but it certainly has happened to me.

1239
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,810
In fact, that's about all I can think about doing

1240
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,070
as soon as we get out of here,

1241
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,750
which will be very soon.

1242
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,270
If we've got three minutes to mention that

1243
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,310
we have three weeks till X day.

1244
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:01,970
And...

1245
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,070
And because of that,

1246
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,750
we should do a live show next week

1247
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:11,130
so that I can play my canned shows here

1248
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,390
while we're gone.

1249
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,890
Although, in theory, Dave,

1250
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,270
the Sunday before X day

1251
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,710
and the Sunday after X day,

1252
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:21,510
I'm hoping, I paid for the plane ticket,

1253
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,530
Dr. Howell will be here.

1254
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:27,270
And us and Dr. Howell can do a show

1255
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,330
and maybe he can come in

1256
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,930
and be on Radio Synesthesia,

1257
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:31,990
which will be on in...

1258
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,690
one minute from now.

1259
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,950
But Princess We won't be there

1260
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,510
because in four weeks,

1261
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,370
it'll be the Starwood Festival.

1262
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:40,110
That's right.

1263
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:40,810
That's right.

1264
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,450
So Princess We will have to miss

1265
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,230
the in-between festival.

1266
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,930
I may have to drive from Wisteria

1267
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,530
back to Cleveland and back to Wisteria,

1268
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,890
but we did that last weekend with no problem,

1269
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,930
aside from our alternator going bad

1270
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:54,770
in Marietta, Ohio.

1271
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,630
But it went bad right in front of an auto zone

1272
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,450
after...

1273
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,730
ten minutes after Pisces said,

1274
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,810
you know, it's unlikely,

1275
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:04,770
but you might,

1276
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,370
if you happen to see an open auto zone

1277
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,530
on the Sunday before Memorial Day,

1278
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,450
they might be able to help you.

1279
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:12,790
And by golly,

1280
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,690
by 11 o'clock the morning of Memorial Day,

1281
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,430
we were back on our way to Cleveland.

1282
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,410
So praise Bob,

1283
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,710
praise Pisces,

1284
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,670
praise auto zones.

1285
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,310
Auto zones, kind, gentle giants.

1286
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,870
This is a call to action,

1287
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,670
but we did have an experience

1288
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,790
that worked out well,

1289
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,750
a particular one.

1290
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,990
Is this Providence?

1291
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,610
Look down with a smiling face.

1292
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,430
Well, this Providence is

1293
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,650
the Church of the Subgenius radio show,

1294
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:45,490
Hour of Slack, number 1363.

1295
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,090
For more information about this crap

1296
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,090
we're talking about,

1297
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,710
you can go to subgenius.com.

1298
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,050
Subgenius does not have an O in it.

1299
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,350
But it's in your mouth.

1300
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:01,730
And I...

1301
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:01,970
I...

1302
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:01,970


1303
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,410
Oh, and thanks to the Flying Ryan Brothers

1304
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,870
for this great background music.

1305
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,910
Especially Jimmy Ryan.

1306
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,970
He's the subgenius of the band.

1307
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,810
Sweet sound carpet.

1308
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,050
Often saw the invisible

1309
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,210
and far, far be fetched.

1310
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:18,650
At least...

1311
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,070
Oh, sorry.

1312
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,130
That guy, I don't know.

1313
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,630
I did that on Hal's show

1314
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,550
and I had to cut it for this show.

1315
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,210
The audience here hasn't heard that yet.

1316
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,930
And they won't.

1317
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,810
Hal kept going,

1318
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,110
if there's no cuss words in it, it's okay.

1319
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,230
It's the words.

1320
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,330
It's not the concepts.

1321
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,630
I was going, no, Hal.

1322
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,630
You misunderstand.

1323
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,770
The words in certain contexts

1324
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,150
are perfectly legal,

1325
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,550
especially in Safe Harbor.

1326
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:50,890
It's the concept.

1327
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,390
If the concept is obscene,

1328
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,950
it doesn't matter whether there's

1329
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,470
bad words used or not.

1330
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:01,250
That's why our toes are tied up like this.

1331
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,810
And we must get off the air.

1332
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:03,730
Exactamundo.

1333
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,710
I tried not to sound like an old guy

1334
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,030
having a sexual condition.

1335
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:09,910
You failed.

1336
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,190
Well, I was doing something else.

1337
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,330
It just sounded the same.

1338
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:17,190
You know, the resonance was a little bit similar.

1339
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,030
There was a vibrational movement in between.

1340
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,390
And that's the way it went.

1341
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,210
We were all experiencing synesthesias

1342
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,750
just a bit early.

1343
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,890
I was going to talk about...

1344
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,230
You're vibrating the hell out of that place right now.

1345
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,830
Vot for you're going to talk about

1346
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:33,630
Reverend Stank?

1347
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,350
I'll do it next week.

1348
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,490
Reverend Just John had this great concept

1349
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,770
that we could have gone on about for an hour.

1350
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:42,990
We'll do it next week.

1351
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,090
There will be another hour next week.

1352
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,770
Until Rob comes over and taps you on the shoulder

1353
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:48,090
and says,

1354
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,650
so, I request that seat.

1355
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:52,990
I see.

1356
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,910
Thank you, and good night, Dave.

1357
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,470
Good night, Princess Marie.

1358
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,650
Good night, radio listeners.

1359
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,030
Good night.

1360
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,290
I hope you have a great day.

1361
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:03,710
Do makes.

1362
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,190
Do makes.

1363
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:06,750
Do makes.

1364
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:09,490
Do makes.

1365
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,310
Do makes.

1366
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:12,510
Do makes.

1367
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,010
Do makes.

1368
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,010


1369
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,030
Do makes.

1370
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,030


1371
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:31,050
a different, modern, and motor übrigens.

1372
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:31,210


1373
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,090
Thank you.

1374
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:06,650
Thank you.

1375
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,830
Thank you.

1376
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,230
Thank you.

1377
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:31,930
Thank you.

1378
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,850
Thank you.

1379
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,090
Thank you.
