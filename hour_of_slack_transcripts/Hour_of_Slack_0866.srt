1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
What is God good for?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,280
Call now and I'll rush you a free tape.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,500
That's what we can count on God for.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,660
A free tape.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,880
No. No.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,100
Yes. He did it.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,100
Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,000
By which we measure

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,580
our pain.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,040
I'll say it again.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,860
God is a concept.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,040
By which we measure

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,420
our pain.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Yeah.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
Yeah.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
I don't believe

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,220
in magic.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
I don't believe

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,980
in itching.

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,980
I don't believe

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,700
in the Bible.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,880
I don't believe

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,340
in talent.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,920
I don't believe

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,420
in Hitler.

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,220
I don't believe

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,700
in Jesus.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,440
I don't believe

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,120
in Kennedy.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700
I don't believe

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,220
in Buddha.

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,880
I don't believe

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,360
in mantra.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,980
I don't believe

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,480
in Gita.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,340
I don't believe

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,780
in yoga.

38
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't believe

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,760
in kings.

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,600
I don't believe

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,100
in Elvis.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,780
I don't believe

43
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,960
in Elvis.

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:39,960


45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,520
in Timberman.

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,800
I don't believe

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
in Beatles.

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,260
I just believe

49
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,740
in me.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
You'll call

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,560
me

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,620
dumb.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
That's reality

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,300
The dream is over

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,700
What can I say?

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,340
The dream is over

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,460
Yesterday

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,800
I was the tree weaver

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,660
But now I'm a bone

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:48,300
I was the walrus

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,400
But now I'm a bone

62
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,580
And so, dear friends

63
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,000
We'll just have to carry on

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,020
The dream is over

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,540
But, dear friends, somebody else is just starting up.

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,440
Look!

67
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,380
I know who it is!

68
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,020
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

69
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,040
I swear, I know who it is!

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,000
It's...

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,700
It's...

72
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,960
The Subgenius Hour of Swag!

73
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh, that's not true!

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,560
S is for the suckers that live all around

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
U is for us, they're always putting us down

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,200
B is for Bob

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,260
He gives us our bread

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,920
G is for the guns they put to your head

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,980
E is for the eunuchs they want you to become

80
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,540
N is for the nuts they wish they had some

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,360
I is for that eye in the back of my head

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,920
U is for you

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,860
They wanna see you dead

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,480
S is for the shit that's all around

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm a subgenius motherfucker

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,180
and I ain't no fucking clown, but...

87
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,180


88
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,940
In order to rule the world, you must first conquer it.

89
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:46,660
Only on those bold terms can this total war result in total victory.

90
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,220
Well, don't you think it's a little late?

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,860
No.

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,240
Well, I do.

93
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,620
I don't give a damn.

94
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,960
Dead center.

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,340
Yes, liberty ring.

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,540
I can't stand things that don't make any sense.

97
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,000
Come on, let's get out of my brain.

98
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,060
Yes, yes, of course you can.

99
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,680
That was actually originated for people who were tired of pointing.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Healy after Jesus was originated for your right brain.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,640
That's true.

102
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,760
He's in a little can and we open him every 45 minutes.

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Now he's just squeaking.

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,300
Be scary, Colin.

105
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,280
Stand back, stand back.

106
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,780
Okay, I'll steer in the ship toward the left.

107
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,880
And you will be able to now look out the window,

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,160
see the light.

109
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,580
See the little people there?

110
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,920
See them?

111
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,380


112
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,000
They're actually not people.

113
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,080
They're not bad Jesus.

114
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
They're there to scare you.

115
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,980
They're in the human scrapyard.

116
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,520
Please, if you're coughing all over your speaker,

117
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
you're saying we've got to clean it up here at the station.

118
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,960
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

119
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,160
There is a pain between my ears.

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
For those who don't understand,

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,080
perhaps they're always on the short poopy,

122
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,960
the end of the stick.

123
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,640
Yes, the short poopy.

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,260
There's a lot of short doggy poop around to put on the stick.

125
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,140
But if you want to live like a real man or woman,

126
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,300
you must, you must, you must.

127
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:15,840
It is later than you think.

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,840
It's later than you think.

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,260
It's later than you think.

130
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,620
It's later than you think.

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,300
It's more hard.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,640
It's more hard.

133
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,200
As chimpanzees are to humans,

134
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,540
humans are to us.

135
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,760
You're improving, Jack.

136
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,940
You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.

137
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,220
The one that ruined you was that damned Indian old teepee.

138
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,220
You know, Laskin.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,840
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe

140
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,660
and there isn't any.

141
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,360
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy,

142
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,000
and the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them all in vain.

143
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,040
All in vain, Jack.

144
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,660
Do you hear anything?

145
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,780
Listen to me.

146
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Two-legged creature won't believe anything.

147
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,720
And the more preposterous, the better.

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.

149
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,160
The horses of Arabia have seen it.

150
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,720
Silver wings.

151
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa.

152
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,160
I have sold all those propositions.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,800
They were all fools and none of it matters.

154
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Ah.

155
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:25,920


156
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,660
I watched a world from an alien place

157
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,060
From a desert plain so far away

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,940
I hear the sound of a starlit night

159
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,680
Of an angel's song in a brilliant light

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,620
Your world of people has no place for me

161
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,480
I've read the flea from an ancient

162
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,120
saying key

163
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,920
Your world of people suffocates me

164
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,000
It prisons me, it drowns me in ice

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,280
I watched a world from an alien place

166
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,200
From the tides of time and the shore

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,460
of the sea

168
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,580
I stumbled on one in a fever dream

169
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,660
In a landscape of lies

170
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,480
Shaking a silent scream

171
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,440
Your world of people has no place for me

172
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,300
I've read the flea from an ancient

173
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
saying key

174
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,600
Awaken world of little men

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,620
Of hateful deeds and evil hands

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,220
You are never amoning our fate

177
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,240
Swallowed away all theisters

178
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,540
Stgotaku with a sword

179
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:12,640
Nos ring, has been broken

180
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,540
Last chorus but never towards the end

181
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,900
No worries, it is not the one

182
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,020
No causality

183
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,740
No whole world

184
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:18,900
Hits a死

185
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:18,900


186
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,180
And God bigger than the all

187
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,180


188
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,040
Steal away the flower九

189
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,500
Money and not break over andadel we've seen

190
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,300
Stillita you left a scarate 방법

BONUS TWARMY 7'0 nedaw proof

192
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,740
I watch the world from an alien place

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,360
From a desert plain until far away

194
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,280
I hear the sound of a starlit night

195
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,180
Of an angel's song and a billion lights

196
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,020
Your world of people has no place for me

197
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,740
I'll forever flee from it, insane king

198
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,300
A wicked world of little men

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,520
Of hateful deeds and evil hands

Friends, we've heard and will hear

218
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Lee Murr and his great audio cut-ups

219
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,260
He's such a cut-up

220
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,780
And puzzling evidence

221
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,180
And Dr. Howell and Dr. Drummond

222
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,260
On recent KPFA Berkeley shows

223
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,980
And the show's title is

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
From the resurrected old subgenius

225
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
Media barrage tape

226
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,340
Bad Doctors

227
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,160
Which I am currently doctoring

228
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,780
And now

229
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,320
With the amino acids

230
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,440
In the background

231
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Back to ESO Radio

232
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,160
On WCSB Cleveland

233
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,580
With this guy

234
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Abortion, the murder of unwanted pregnancies

235
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,120
Produced by immoral lepers

236
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,160
Is also affecting 1 million women annually

237
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
These so-called culture

238
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,980
But barbaric sinners think nothing of it

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,740
Having their little bundles from God

240
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,900
Packed to pieces and flushed

241
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,600
Never mind that God says

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,520
Thou shalt not kill

243
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,460
Exodus 20-13

244
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,660
Sinners have taken the matter into their own hands

245
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,000
But remember God holds the final trump card

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,240
The judgment

247
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
Revelation 20

248
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,480
Verses 11-15

249
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,440
10

250
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Mercy killers are also on the ascendancy in America

251
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,300
They are progressive abortions

252
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,040
Who have become hard to killing

253
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,580
And now wish to include the mommies and daddies

254
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,300
Along with babies

255
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,980
Water my father in the boat

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,240
Who have been bitten

257
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,800
God's commandant

258
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,600
Exodus 20-12

259
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,720
Interferes with her

260
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,300
Her responsibility is so great

261
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
The world comes to her

262
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,560
These sick words must be related to his word

263
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,440
My proclaiming fairy tales are both such thinking and pining exertions

264
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,200
You be the judge

265
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,740
Raj Nadeemul

266
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,960
You be the judge

268
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,540
You be the judge

Raj Nadeemul

270
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,220
You be the judge

271
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,020
So

272
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,620
There you go

273
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,120
There's like

274
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,820
Doctors watching me right now

275
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,600
What does this mean?

276
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,040
Here wait

277
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
You gotta put your headphones on Dave

278
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,660
Raj Nadeemul

279
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,680
That one

280
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,520
No warden it's not in my booty

281
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,900
Raj Nadeemul

282
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,040
Nadeemul

283
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,920
What the hell is that?

284
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,680
You be the judge

285
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,860
No warden

286
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,420
Raj Nadeemul

287
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,740
You be the judge

288
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,540
But nooo

289
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:15,900
Raj Nadeemul

290
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,980
You be the judge

291
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,820
Raj Nadeemul

292
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,720
You be the judge

293
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,620
Raj Nadeemul

294
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,580
You be the judge

295
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,260
You be the judge today

296
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,740
But it's F connaisssss

297
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,540
That's why the J

298
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,340
Oh no

299
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,240
Oh god

300
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,560
Problem with them TV preachers

301
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,820
That's the problem with using your teeth for the needle on the turntable man

302
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,440
One debauchery

303
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,140
What makes people think they can flunk God's rules and end up in eternal bliss?

304
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,140
Flunk God's rules?

305
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,460
What makes people think they can do that Dave?

306
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,320
I dunno

307
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,880
I don't know, flunking is easy, but flapping is harder.

308
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,920
Who do we think we are?

309
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,520
Go!

310
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,280
I got away with it so far.

311
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,160
I got away with it because Bob gave me something to get me off.

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,480
I got away with it.

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,620
Bob got me off, and I got away with it.

314
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,440
I got away with dogs.

315
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,760
I got away with old ladies.

316
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,900
You got away with the bitches.

317
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,040
I got away with barbers with one eye.

318
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,020
I got away with three people's hands.

319
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,420
I got away with men who think they're Jesus Christ.

320
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,720
Then our brazen disregard of God's laws will be judged.

321
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,700
Revelation 22.15 declares,

322
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,340
Outside of heaven are dogs, sorcerers, whoremongers, murderers, idolaters, and whosoever loveth.

323
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,940
These are all the people from the lodge.

324
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
The dogmongers and the whores and stuff.

325
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,200
The day of the Lord is at hand.

326
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,840
And he shall come like a thief in the night.

327
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,320
Or he shall come somewhere or another.

328
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,800
The Lord cometh, and the Lord goeth.

329
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,800
Come unto me, Bud.

330
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,460
This here's your sugar daddy.

331
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,040
From his catty.

332
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,260
In the ever-loving great beyond.

333
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,360


334
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,120
So prick your ears up.

335
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,340
And be quick like to respond.

336
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,240
Cause daddy ain't too happy.

337
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,040
None too happy.

338
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,240
What did I ever create you for?

339
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,640
You ain't done nothing.

340
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,600
But make your daddy so.

341
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,220
It looks like evolution's no solution.

342
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,200
You just keep falling ever further behind.

343
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,260
You may be tanned and clean-shaven.

344
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,840
But ain't with little bit of hair in time.

345
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,180
Big hairy situation.

346
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,900
Every nation.

347
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,660
About to bring your daddy to his knees.

348
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,420
I just keep crying.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
These people bleed.

350
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,040
You damn dirty apes.

351
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,100
What the hell are you doing?

352
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,040
You damn dirty apes.

353
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,580
Look at what you have done.

354
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,720
You damn dirty apes.

355
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,620
Who do you think you have been fooling?

356
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,600
Cause I'm gonna catch you.

357
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,960
Gonna catch you.

358
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
Every one of you.

359
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm gonna catch you.

360
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,020
Gonna catch you.

361
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,020


362
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,020


363
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,020


364
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,020


365
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,340
Look at this dumbass.

366
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,440
You cut it.

367
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,480
Don't snap me and show off.

368
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,540
I'm gonna

369
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,720
get you withgirls.

370
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,500
You take my view?

371
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,760
Well take this girl.

372
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,900
Get her here.

373
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:33,920


374
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,760
Earthquakes, floods, and lightning

375
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,380
Very frightening

376
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,120
Oh, but that's just a little nervous twitch

377
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,700
But I'll be getting medieval

378
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,440
If you can treat me like your bitch

379
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,920
So get yourself together

380
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,860
Now or never

381
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,380
All you need's a little self-esteem

382
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,460
To turn this nightmare

383
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,040
Into a sweet, sweet dream

384
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,820
You damn dirty ape

385
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,360
What the hell are you doing?

386
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,140
You damn dirty ape

387
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,540
Look at what you have done

388
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,260
You damn dirty ape

389
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,880
Who do you think you have been playing?

390
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,720
Cause I'm gonna get you

391
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,940
Gonna get you every one

392
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,940
I'm gonna get you

393
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,080
Get you every one

394
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm gonna get you every one

395
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,680
Gonna get a show

396
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,760
Ohh look at this

397
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,360
And it's gonna make your album day

398
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,980
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh

399
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:07,980


400
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,220
And I hear you say

401
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,320
Muddy on the shoes

402
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,320


403
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,320


404
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,320


405
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,320


406
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,360
Dun- трOLD

407
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,620
Drexelent.com

408
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
Drexelent.com

409
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,560
That's D-R-E-X-E

410
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,060
L-L-E-N-T

411
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,720
And now back to

412
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,640
well, some

413
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,040
Lemur-ish cut-up

414
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,140
collages, puzzling evidences,

415
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,820
howling over men,

416
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,920
lonesome cowboys, and

417
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,140
Chaz right here.

418
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,100
This is the night of the whole hand.

419
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,420
So there's been all this talk

420
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,980
in science.

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
Let's talk science for a minute.

422
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,260
Well, can I ask you one question?

423
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,540
Kind of a scientific question.

424
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,620
Is it true that you've heard

425
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,960
that there is a dangerous sorcerer

426
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
or a demon, perhaps it speaks from

427
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
Dick Cheney's navel?

428
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,620
Really? I don't think that's scientific.

429
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,460
Well, I don't think it is either.

430
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,120
I think it sounds like superstition.

431
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,220
It couldn't possibly be true.

432
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,240
It has nothing to do with it.

433
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,960
That sounds like an urban legend to me.

434
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,180
Oh yeah, that's not science.

435
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,100
That's pseudoscience.

436
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,840
That's false science.

437
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,900
But now, scientists are pretty convinced

438
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,560
that...

439
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,780
We've been talking all about this lately.

440
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,120
The day of the Lord is at hand.

441
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,480
They're pretty convinced that

442
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,700
we need to deprovincialize ourselves

443
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
one step further.

444
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,080
We thought that this universe was the only one

445
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,900
and it turns out that they're pretty convinced

446
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,780
that there's just multitudes

447
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,620
of varied universes all

448
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,600
existing.

449
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,500
They're real convinced of that, huh?

450
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,840
Well, if dogs can have multiple orgasms,

451
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,020
why can't we have multiple orgasms?

452
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,780
Why can't we have multiple universes?

453
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,800
Have you ever done the math

454
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
with your slide rule and your calculator?

455
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,860
No, but I'm open to whatever.

456
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,100
You know, people come up with just as valid

457
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,820
as anything I come across anywhere else.

458
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,260
You know as well as I do

459
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,340
that for all you know, all that math

460
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,760
that they keep talking about

461
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,240
might as well be the same as the totem pole

462
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,880
that some medicine man

463
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,360
tells everybody to worship.

464
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,680
Maybe, but it's the best bet we got.

465
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,720
I mean, it's led us farther

466
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,260
than any of those other things have.

467
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,420
We've been to the moon.

468
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,260
We have probes going all over the universe.

469
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,340
What telephone poles have taken us to the moon, Larry?

470
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,220
I've been to the moon.

471
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,460
Not on a telephone pole.

472
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,380
Not the way you're talking about.

473
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:19,960
Yeah.

474
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,020
And I don't see no weird like eagles

475
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,480
or thunderbirds on top of any ladder of numbers.

476
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,920
We're building a space station that got, you know,

477
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,400
science, you know, we understand a lot about a lot of things, DNA.

478
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,360
Well, Hitler almost built a science station

479
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,620
with the world of fire and ice.

480
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,160
So it's gotten us a lot farther than all the other, you know, religions.

481
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,080
But Hitler built, almost built, a science station with the world of fire and ice.

482
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,180
He actually got things out of it.

483
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,540
He built science with fire and ice.

484
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,240
Science is the most exacting religion.

485
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,780
They don't know what I'm talking about.

486
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,260
The theory of fire and ice, Hitler's theory of science was totally whacked out.

487
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,840
And yet he produced all this weird stuff.

488
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,780
Well, he didn't produce anything.

489
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,780
Well, they had the best Nazi flying saucers in the whole hollow earth.

490
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Well, they believed in all this anti-grav stuff, but you know, it didn't have any...

491
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,060
And they came out with that movie, Ilse, She-Wolf of the SS.

492
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,220
Well, that was pure science right there.

493
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,320
They work for the CIA now.

494
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,460
Who does?

495
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,260
Ilse?

496
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,280
Islan?

497
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,380
Islan.

498
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,920
Islan.

499
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,960
Islan.

500
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,380
Islan.

501
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,540
Islan.

502
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,620
Your island paradise on the moon, attended to your every wish by a Nazi scientist from

503
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,580
the year Zip.

504
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,040
Here's Klaus Freudrich, an early inventor of U2, preparing to offer you a jelly donut.

505
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,060
And here's you spending over log in the hot sun as Ilse, the She-Wolf of the SS, is

506
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,060


507
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,060


508
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,060


509
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,060


510
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,060


511
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,060


512
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,600
handing you her slide roll.

513
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,040
What?

514
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,620
Klaus will make you his jelly donut.

515
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,060
And he has to.

516
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,760
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything

517
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,980
is likely to develop.

518
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,360
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, filling itself as the weirdest cult on earth.

519
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,720
What do they believe in?

520
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,860
Everything.

521
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,000
Everything.

522
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,400
Do they believe in?

523
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,000
A mysterious character named Bob.

524
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,920
Bob.

525
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,780
Bob.

526
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,400
Bob.

527
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,420
Bob.

528
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,720
Bob.

529
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,060
Bob.

530
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,540
Bob.

531
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:27,540


532
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,640
Bob.

533
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:28,640


534
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


535
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


536
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


537
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


538
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


539
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


540
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


541
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:28,920


542
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,400
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless

543
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,800
history.

544
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,560
Bob is what will bring slack to planet earth.

545
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:38,840
Bob.

546
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,580
and to you young man

547
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,940
and to you

548
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,700
if you will send a dollar

549
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,220
for more

550
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,620
this is a church

551
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,200
that does not play games

552
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,940
and join

553
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,960
the church

554
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,180
of the subgenius

555
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,560
genetic engineers

556
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,980
working in secret laboratories

557
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,480
in medieval castles

558
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,540
are now able

559
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,260
to create an onion

560
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,360
that will not make

561
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,480
Mr. and Mrs. Hustlers cry

562
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,520
he doesn't even have a body

563
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,180
he's just a little head

564
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,120
yea verily

565
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,900
for Bob should be praised

566
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,300
he is being praised

567
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
this is how we praise Bob

568
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,520
this is how we polish Bob's mouth

569
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,280
this is the way we worship our Bob

570
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,860
we take care of Bob like no one else

571
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,280
repeat after me

572
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,480
no you repeat after me

573
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,340
Bob is ice

574
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,040
Bob appears

575
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,460
Bob

576
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:36,460


577
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:36,460


578
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,500
Bob is nice

579
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,640
Bob is light

580
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,500
Bob is nice

581
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,160
you know just saying it doesn't make it so

582
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,300
Bob is not nice

583
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,460
yea verily

584
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,100
yea verily

585
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,660
I know if Bob's looking in the window

586
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,000
are you the servant that opens it

587
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,580
so he can piss in

588
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,360
weep no more

589
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
I know about that

590
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,260
onions will no longer provoke tears

591
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
I only know about it

592
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,980
because I had to seek out

593
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,680
the magic towel that night

594
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,220
for Bob has arisen

595
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,400
well you shouldn't have

596
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,680
you should have been able to contain yourself

597
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,500
again and again and again

598
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,300
it makes me want to go to

599
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,100
Grandview Camping Center

600
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,340
Bob never goes down

601
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,600
Bob never goes down

602
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,060
Bob is sitting there

603
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,340
really

604
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,760
Bob is always up

605
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,700

606
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,960
always up dude

607
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,940
he never has to

608
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,540
seek out the adult catalogs

609
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,680
that other subgeniuses do

610
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,740
and you must receive slack in Bob

611
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,580
those subgeniuses too cheap to get on their own computer

612
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,500
must seek out

613
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,580
now you be nice to your little phone people

614
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,160

now let's not get dirty here

621
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,340
massively large huge erect collections

622
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,580
moving toward bridge

623
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,040
oh he's away from the bridge

624
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,700
don't worry about it

625
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,900

626
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,780

James Dean was just a careless driver

Did you honestly think that they would?

706
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,060

Don't tell me you're the future.

719
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,440
You'll be lucky to catch on at the phone company.

720
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,300
You parents up there, you know what I'm talking about.

721
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,420
20, 25 years ago, they were telling us,

722
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
you are the future.

723
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,420
You kids want to see the future?

724
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,260
Look at your folks.

725
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,240
Fat butts, baggy tits, beer, television.

726
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,240
That's the future.

727
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,720
Look at me, I'm supposed to be a big success.

728
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,640
I build taco stands for a living.

729
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,160
What kind of bullshit future is that?

730
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,520
You got any sense?

731
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,940
Give them back their damn diplomas.

732
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,180
Give them back their silly fucking hats

733
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,160
and stay 18 for the rest of your life.

734
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,300
You don't want to be the future.

735
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,340
No, no.

736
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
Forget the future.

737
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,220
Future sucks.

738
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,440
There he was.

739
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,940
Big as life.

740
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,380
Right there at the foot of my bed.

741
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,360
Jesus.

742
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,060
Jesus?

743
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,020
And he looked me straight in the eye

744
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
and he said,

745
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,080
Want a game?

746
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,440
There's more to love

747
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
than just fornicating.

748
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,700
Sure.

749
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,100
That's like eyes in the back of your head.

750
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,960
...into even the purest research.

751
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,640
These mud-gobbling giant worms

752
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680
which live on the edge of volcanic vents...

753
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,120
...gorging themselves on massive, huge piles of mud.

754
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,480
Just like those tremor worms.

755
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,820
Just like the ones in Dune.

756
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,700
Only this mud is wet.

757
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,700
This is truly wet mud.

758
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,760
Not like the kind of mud we used to have back when we were kids.

759
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,740
It was dry mud.

760
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,620
We used to have to make mud pies

761
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,700
and to make them stick together we had to spit on them.

762
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,180
We'd have dirt in one hand and a big pile of spit in the other hand

763
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,480
and we'd...

764
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,720
like...

765
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,920
roll them together until we had us a good mud pie.

766
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,980
And that was the only thing we had for moisture back in those days.

767
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,400
Just spit.

768
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,500
We didn't have candy back then either.

769
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,960
We had to just take a bag of sugar

770
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,240
and carry it around a big old five-pound bag of sugar in our back pocket.

771
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,300
A big old tablespoon.

772
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,520
And when we needed some candy,

773
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,940
we just stuck it into the bag and just took about four or five big tablespoons,

774
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,600
...of the rogue bacteria...

775
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,860
...shoveled it down.

776
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,500
And that was all we had for candy back in those days.

777
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,180
...each one genetically engineered to make a difference in RNA.

778
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,780
Now when a worm dines on one of these babies...

779
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,180
You gotta have...

780
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,900
Those worms have to have limbs to see underground when they're eating through the dirt like that.

781
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,020
They carry little...

782
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,960
little like little miners helmets that let them mine through the dirt.

783
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,780
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.

784
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,220
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

785
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,820
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away.

786
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,480
Oh, I can't see where I'm going, said Mr. Worm.

787
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,620
And he looked ahead and he had his little pointed yellow helmet on,

788
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,120
shining the way into the back of the goose, as it were.

789
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,660
The pteranodon...

790
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,860
The end of the goose...

791
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,440
...was a Cretaceous flying reptile.

792
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,460
Flying...

793
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,980
They thought it was a reptile, but actually it was a bird.

794
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,520
It was a bird.

795
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,560
...wings spread, it heaved more than 27 feet.

796
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,460
They found that it was only a simple bird.

797
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,480
It was a bird like...

798
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,800
...a reptile bird.

799
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,780
...its body was only that, the size of a goose.

800
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,160
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide at their...

801
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,120
Oh, well, it's a...

802
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,100
...widest proportion.

803
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,460
27 feet, or 30 actually.

804
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,240
Where is Bozo?

805
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,500
Larger specimens recently discovered.

806
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,460
What the heck is...

807
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,640
It's the Twinkie bike.

808
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,340
What a wonderful, wonderful Twinkie bike.

809
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,540
And so the Twinkie bike headed out into the desert, carrying the little show people.

810
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,980
They asked me about...

811
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,280
Twinkie bike, Twinkie bike.

812
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,880
They asked me about Twinkies on my show.

813
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,740
And they asked what the ingredients were.

814
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,800
Of course, all I could tell them was...

815
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,500
That's when I got fillings.

816
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,140
...golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.

817
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,060
That's all you need to know.

818
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,060
You don't need to know anything more than...

819
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,960
That is all on Earth ye know and all ye need.

820
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,900
...golden life.

821
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,240
That's good enough for Thor.

822
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,440
The United States of Spawn.

823
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,520
...cold golden...

824
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,520
Yes, little caller, you have won the United States of Spawn.

825
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,320
...going everywhere in the valley...

826
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,520
...as we continue to look for your requested songs...

827
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,840
...from the valley of the sun...

828
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,480
...squeezing the erupting core...

829
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,120
...of the United States of Spawn...

830
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,020
...from within the confines of its donut-like hole.

831
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,660
...from...

832
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,180
Is it a bird?

833
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,480
No!

834
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,820
Is it a plane?

835
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,180
No!

836
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,640
Oh my gosh, it's my name!

837
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,360
I'm...

838
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
...the way I...

839
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,500
...the way I...

840
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,800
...the way I...

841
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,860
...the way I...

842
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,660
...the way I...

843
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,300
...the way I...

844
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,240
...the way I ...

845
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:04,920
...the way I...

846
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,720
...the way I...

847
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:06,720


848
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,020
...the way I...

849
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,180
...the way I ...

850
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,660
...the way I...

851
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:08,880
...the way I ...

852
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:08,880


853
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,360
...the way I...

854
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,360


855
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,540
...the way I...

856
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:09,800
...the way I...

857
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:09,960
...the way I...

858
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:09,960


859
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,720
...the way I...

860
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:10,720


861
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,040
...the way I...

862
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,300
...the way I...

863
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,380
...the way I...

864
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,480
...the way I...

865
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,600
...the way I...

866
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:12,900
...the way I...

867
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,480
...the way I...

868
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,280
The Black Dog Singers and now...

869
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,780
LEMUR!

870
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,980
Now you listen to this!

871
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,120
Can I still have my dog?

872
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,420
NO!

873
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,900
Oh no! Please!

874
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,140
Hey Bugs!

875
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,140
I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education.

876
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,000
For the children.

877
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,740
Teletubby!

878
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,940
You get 152 hits.

879
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,920
It may sound silly to you, but...

880
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,240
Something bothering you, boy?

881
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,680
Nuclear death.

882
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:36,620
Oh. Okay.

883
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,740
I take it this place, this Maple Street, is not unique.

884
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,060
By no means.

885
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,480
But it's still a place where we can all be happy.

886
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


887
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


888
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


889
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


890
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


891
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


892
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


893
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


894
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


895
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


896
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


897
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


898
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


899
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


900
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


901
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


902
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


903
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


904
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


905
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


906
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


907
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


908
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


909
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


910
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


911
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


912
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,880
swat it to the ground and scream, I don't think so.

913
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,300
I'm just trying to take a bite out of crime.

914
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,320
The Lord took the child.

915
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,920
He died a horrible death.

916
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,620
The awfulness of it staggers the imagination.

917
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,560
We're merely using this corpse for demonstration.

918
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,680
And she looked at me and said...

919
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,120
I said, what do you mean?

920
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,780
She said...

921
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:00,060
I said, I went out of my mind.

922
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,700
And she looked at me and said...

923
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,100
I went to see the others.

924
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,420
And she said...

925
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,360
What do you want?

926
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,420
You don't have to.

927
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,220
Don't be afraid of him.

928
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,240
That's all there is to it.

929
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,240
No, I can't take it anymore.

930
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,160
Friends, are you going to let this happen?

931
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,220
Are you just going to sit by and watch this corpse rot?

932
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,340
Are you going to scrub its buttocks with a dog brush?

933
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,020
Are you going to get down and apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

934
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,960
to this rotting corpse in his WCSV college radio?

935
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,540
Which do you want?

936
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,020
I want to prefer.

937
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,040
Don't you want to get down there and apply the kiss of life?

938
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,740
You guys are worthless.

939
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,420
I know we are.

940
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,620
We're totally worthless.

941
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,200
Get out of my radio station.

942
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,880
I'm going home.

943
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,100
Man, we cannot get one love in carnivution.

944
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,820
My friends, I was in the spirit.

945
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,700
And Bob said to me, he said, I'm going to have to call you home, Reverend Stang.

946
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,780
And I don't think he meant home to Texas.

947
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,120
How about...

948
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,620
I think he meant home to heaven.

949
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
A beautiful home away from home.

950
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,680
Home away from home.

951
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,680
Home away from home.

952
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,340
Home away from home.

953
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,340


954
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,340


955
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,340


956
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,340


957
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,340


958
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,340


959
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,540
Home away from home.

960
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,020
I'm going to call a signal to these people because they don't seem to believe.

961
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,360
Look at this.

962
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,680
You can travel there on a signal.

963
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,680
I'm being called home, friends.

964
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,500
A beam of light.

965
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,540
Bob's calling me up.

966
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,600
Now, I see the rocking chair of eternal slack up there on that beautiful cloud.

967
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,720
Oh, yes.

968
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,800
Oh, yes, brother.

969
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,840
Look at how beautiful it is.

970
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:39,020
There's beautiful creatures of the desired sex gyrating around the heavenly excremeditation throne.

971
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,540
And then just when you're in the gate, you thought you were in the gate in the heaven.

972
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,840
You made the ultimate mistake.

973
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,640
You didn't call 68769.

974
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,140
Oh, you could have.

975
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,540
That's the funny thing about it.

976
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,460
Your friend was thinking about it now.

977
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,540
Or if he only would have sent his contribution.

978
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,060
You could have.

979
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,280
It could have had a coffee mug.

980
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,980
A beautiful logo shirt on.

981
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,540
Maybe even a new twinter hat.

982
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,340
You blew it, you fool.

983
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:12,980
You fool.

984
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,320
Yeah, you totally blew it.

985
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,160
You fool.

986
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,120
God, I can't believe what a geek.

987
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,580
How could anybody totally, totally, totally, utterly, utterly.

988
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,280
All I remember was he had a chance to get one of those warm sweatshirts on.

989
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,600
And you were warned.

990
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,920
You were told, don't blow it.

991
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,900
Don't mess up.

992
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:42,460
And you messed up because you didn't call 6900 in the 216 area code.

993
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,920
Oh, man.

994
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,700
Did you blow it, dude?

995
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,800
So that sweatshirt.

996
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,240
No, no, he didn't get that either.

997
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,740
And so he told.

998
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:56,900
Well, you know, and that 6900, the number itself you will get if you're not having sex and you don't have anybody loving you lately.

999
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,700
If you just call that number 6900, 6900, because it's like, that's it.

1000
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,120
It's synergy.

1001
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,160
No, no.

1002
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,940
69 means belly rubbers.

1003
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, 69.

1004
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,320
We each get something out of it.

1005
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:08,940
You know what I mean?

1006
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,920
Oh, there he is again.

1007
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,300
Here they come.

1008
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:12,960
Here they come.

1009
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:12,960


1010
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,380
Here they come again.

1011
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,680
Oh, let's walk us out.

1012
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,000
They never come around for long.

1013
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:19,940
We don't reach out to touch you.

1014
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,360
We want to rub your little round belly, listener.

1015
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,100
We want to reach out with our fingers over these hair waves.

1016
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,060
We don't reach out with our fist and bust you in the face if you don't call.

1017
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,700
And a fist you.

1018
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,740
We're gonna fist you, my dear friend.

1019
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,720
We're gonna fist you right in the face.

1020
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,960
But we can't do it without your help.

1021
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,360
From all the way across the Escaleta.

1022
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,680
Vino, v-v-vino.

1023
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Yes, I believe that Jesus Christ is a succulent dude.

1024
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:42,940


1025
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:42,940


1026
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:42,940


1027
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:42,940


1028
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:42,940


1029
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,040
Delicious, flavorful, juicy, tender son of God, the Messiah.

1030
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,540
And I'll tell you what, because I was that desperate.

1031
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,380
And this other male, he's being stimulated by the mating activity and he wants to have

1032
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:55,780
a go too.

1033
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,320
Oh, that's so sweet.

1034
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,260
And everybody knows that.

1035
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,840
Arusha Control speaking.

1036
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,740
Go ahead.

1037
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,120
We have a rhino.

1038
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,480
Anything else?

1039
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,380
No, that's all.

1040
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,000
I saw these guys at a roller rink.

1041
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,280
I saw the, um, who's this now, the Fletcher and Angels?

1042
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,960
It's, um...

1043
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,260
Andy and the Walls.

1044
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:33,620
Dick Clark.

1045
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,940
Yeah, Andy and the Warhols.

1046
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,920
I saw the plastic exploding bananas at a roller rink in Columbus, Ohio when I was a sparse

1047
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,140
lad of nearly 58 years old.

1048
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,920
And I saw the plastic exploding bananas in Columbus, Ohio when I was a sparse lad of

1049
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,260
nearly 58 years old.

1050
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,460
I had...

1051
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,680
I was wearing chicken shoes at the time and Nico noticed me in the front row.

1052
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,000
She waved and threw some barbiturates to me.

1053
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,020
She also rubbed that hefty groin of hers with a large red Italian scarf.

1054
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,520
I wonder what that meant.

1055
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,160
You think it could mean anything?

1056
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,860
No, right.

1057
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,280
She was...

1058
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,260
Stop trying to see, you know, deep hidden meanings in everything.

1059
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,440
In what she does and everything, I guess.

1060
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:05,580
Yeah.

1061
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,000
Anything.

1062
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,300
I guess you should stop.

1063
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,520
Yeah.

1064
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,000
Reality, you know.

1065
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,020
There is no reality.

1066
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,220
No, I guess there is no...

1067
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:12,680
I thought you were saying...

1068
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:12,920
I thought you were saying...

1069
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:12,920


1070
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:12,920


1071
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:12,920


1072
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:12,920


1073
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,460
I thought you were going to say all reality is interpretive, but you said there is no

1074
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,820
reality.

1075
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,940
No, everything is relative.

1076
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:18,320
Right.

1077
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,140
We're not talking about Homeland Security or the black holes that could envelop us in

1078
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,420
a hundred billion years.

1079
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,760
Who even knows which universe we're in at any given moment?

1080
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:24,780
Right.

1081
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:24,800
Right.

1082
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,440
I mean, that...

1083
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,000
You know, right.

1084
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,680
You know, you're here, you're there, you know.

1085
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,380
Speak for yourself, man.

1086
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,780
I've been stuck in the same one this whole time.

1087
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,780
Yeah, talk about strange.

1088
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,540
I'm pretty sure of it.

1089
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,420
Except for that one time when alternate universe man did his trick just to prove he could do

1090
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:42,640
it.

1091
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,300
Okay.

1092
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,320


1093
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,920
All right.

1094
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,140
Let's go.

1095
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,860
All right.

1096
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,620
All right.

1097
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,340
Okay.

1098
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,340


1099
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,340


1100
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,340


1101
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,340


1102
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,340


1103
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,340


1104
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,640
Our next witness is Paul.

1105
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,120
Oh.

1106
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,060
R-O-T-S.

1107
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,740
Thank you.

1108
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,320
Close.

1109
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,360
We look forward to your testimony, Mr. Miller.

1110
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,300
Today's hearing is important to the office furniture industry for four reasons.

1111
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:12,920
Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying thank you.

1112
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:12,940


1113
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,720
You took a leave of absence with three children and a wife and a girlfriend on the side?

1114
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,800
Bless his little heart.

1115
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,520
How could you afford a leave of absence?

1116
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm pretty drunk.

1117
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,580
Thank you, Minister Donald De Rossi, who was established in 1927.

1118
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,060
Thank you.

1119
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,380
And so there they are.

1120
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,340
Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying...

1121
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,220
Teletubby!

1122
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,800
Oh, no, please!

1123
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,800
Eyes burning like holes.

1124
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,600
The bloodsucker affects him more.

1125
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,280
Holy catfish, that's awful.

1126
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,440
Where would my dad get rid of a body?

1127
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,320
There's just one little thing you're forgetting, college boy.

1128
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,300
You buried him, too.

1129
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,400
That was funny.

1130
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,420
How are you doing on time?

1131
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,160
I will wrap up very quickly.

1132
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,560
Thank you.

1133
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:42,060
The purple dinosaur who has been called everything from refreshingly sweet to nauseatingly nerdy

1134
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:42,280
Stupid old stupid head.

1135
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:48,080
Well, once again, rule toddler TV, menacing the Teletubbies.

1136
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,120
I believe that the Teletubbies are...

1137
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,560
Their time is on this...

1138
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,280
They're definitely...

1139
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,000
Never seen them, actually.

1140
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,260
Their days are numbered.

1141
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,320
They may as well put a fork in the Teletubbies once Barney gets the scene again.

1142
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,320
Did you see this subgenius hooded robe?

1143
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,840
Subgenius hooded robe?

1144
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:12,220
Clearly made to intimidate and impress, and I'm guessing it dates 1980, maybe the beginning of the 60s.

1145
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:12,260
It's all...

1146
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,460
Origin.

1147
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,460
The best item of its kind I've ever encountered.

1148
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,400
Unfortunately, we have no information identifying the subgenius.

1149
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,740
The robe is of excellent quality, in thin black wool, 58 inches long from the neck, nine button front, buttons are silver colored.

1150
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:33,600
Permanently affixed to the neck is a 14-inch tall hood which comes to a point at the top rear and then goes 10 inches forward to its front, which falls the face mask with...

1151
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:33,940
Wow.

1152
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,140
One size fits all, huh?

1153
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,680
For the men that want something extra...

1154
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,920
Which would be at the top of the forehead...

1155
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,200
It's not available in stores.

1156
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,100
Two and a half inch by two and three quarter inch embroidered Dobbs face.

1157
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,700
This is not amazingly boring stuff.

1158
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,960
This is the real thing.

1159
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:49,380
No, this is amazing.

1160
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,840
Has wavy white embroidered edge...

1161
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,520
Yeah, this thing is...

1162
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,060
On the back is a 12-inch high red inverted pipe...

1163
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,620
Does it have the flap in the back?

1164
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,140
How much does it cost?

1165
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,560
That's the important thing.

1166
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,480
How much are they charging?

1167
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,140
It's 475 bucks.

1168
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,020
Does it have the pyroflatulation flap in the back?

1169
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,080
But it may be so aged that it would fall apart.

1170
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,100
It sounds like it's actually real.

1171
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,960
Because if you didn't have that flap...

1172
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,020
And it costs 475 bucks, you could risk actually igniting it if you weren't careful.

1173
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,260
It's a mysterious subgenius robe.

1174
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,420
Yeah, from some secret society or order.

1175
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,820
Look at this piece of hood.

1176
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,700
With a skull and crossbones.

1177
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:31,140
He thinks they like him, but when the UFOs come, the ladies are going to kill everybody but me.

1178
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,360
Well, you know, of course they'll spare the righteous.

1179
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,040
That's what all subgeniuses think.

1180
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,960
I'm helping channel the thoughts of all subgeniuses...

1181
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,220
That means no one will be spared.

1182
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,220
And no one will call.

1183
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,600
They don't need to go to Brushwood.

1184
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,660
The saucers will come and pick them up wherever they are.

1185
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,460
They'll be instantly materialized.

1186
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,500
It'll be like a rapture of subgeni.

1187
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,960
And they'll clap.

1188
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,560
This is...

1189
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:07,220
Right now, we're looking at the picture of all the subgeni sitting in their pretend first-class seats on the space shuttles, ready to leave.

1190
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,100
Mysterious and threatening secret clans.

1191
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,100


1192
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,880
Or society hooded rogues.

1193
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,960
I was just telling you, it's a subgenius robe from the early 70s.

1194
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,100
Well, it certainly looks like a terrifying and intimidating...

1195
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,860
It does, it does.

1196
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,060
That's back when they used to paddle the pledges and all that stuff.

1197
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,440
Yeah, we used to make them run the gauntlet.

1198
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,020
The bobbies?

1199
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,380
We had the famous naked woman gauntlet.

1200
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,300
We used to run them through.

1201
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:30,980
They hated that.

1202
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,000
Those bobbies, they always hate stuff because they're nerds.

1203
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,220
And they're so competitive among themselves.

1204
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,820
That's what's so pathetic about it.

1205
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,880
They fight for it.

1206
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:48,500
Just because the average weight of each of those women was well beyond 300 pounds, that shouldn't have any effect on it if they were, you know...

1207
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,740
Or where Philo has worked for a million years.

1208
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,180
Thinkers.

1209
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,460
Thinkers.

1210
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,100
Thinkers from beyond the sun.

1211
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:54,360
The competitive world.

1212
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,280
On the backside of reality.

1213
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,960
Conspiracy biz.

1214
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,960
Forbidden fantasies that boil up in a drenched sunburst of fun and relaxation.

1215
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,020
Rest and relaxation at last.

1216
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,520
I don't feel relaxed.

1217
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,860
I don't feel relaxed.

1218
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,640
This show makes me all tense and itchy.

1219
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,780
From rest and sleep.

1220
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,140
Which...

1221
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:29,620
Yeah, you can earn money even while you sleep with our custom, sensual, cyber brain pan turnkey operation website.

00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,820
And sooner our best men with thee to go.

You will be on the cutting edge when you process those credit cards with 60% of your money.

1224
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,420
Your prestệnt fulfillment.

1225
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,500
I can start one of those websites with just our own PCDs on them.

1226
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,760
What do I dovere?

1227
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,040
Rastafarian for peace.

1228
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,040


1229
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,040


1230
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,660
Is weapon destroying your eighth sense?

1231
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,460
Yes, that's the way.

1232
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,460


1233
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,460


1234
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,460


1235
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,460


1236
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,460


1237
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,520
â?

1238
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,500
I have that in his house.

1239
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Luci digest� Excellent, guys.

1240
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,620
J Steve Westbrook and Issue.

1241
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,420
I'm the satuor of sciencelu recomp anyhow.

1242
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:09,500
Image 07 They do have planoids.

1243
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:09,840
Lilly boomer is walking down here in Little Bird Point.

1244
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,980
pictures of space or something.

1245
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,280
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

1246
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,140
Here, write this down.

1247
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,340
All right, all life on Earth

1248
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,760
is going to be dead in five years.

1249
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,360
Now, skip over to the other side

1250
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,860
and write this down.

1251
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,560
What's this?

1252
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,960
This is what they want.

1253
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,620
Just write it down.

1254
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,060
All the flowers,

1255
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,800
all the trees,

1256
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,920
all the little birdies.

1257
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,220
Oh, and all the children.

1258
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,540
That's it?

1259
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,060
Yep.

1260
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,900
Yeah, they're not as dedicated

1261
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,760
as we are, Bob.

1262
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,140
You know, they have no incentives,

1263
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,880
no motivation.

1264
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:37,820
What's this?

1265
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
It's the final map

1266
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,660
to show us where we're going

1267
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,180
to pick them up.

1268
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,720
Well, we better not lose this.

1269
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,320
I'd say, Bob.

1270
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,760
I'll turn this story

1271
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,560
into a hurry if you don't mind.

1272
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,060
Stargate.

1273
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,360
One million forgotten B.C.

1274
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,600
Monsters.

1275
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,300
Captain's Lord.

1276
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,340
Monsters have taken over

1277
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,900
the interface once again.

1278
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,120
And I and Mr. Spook

1279
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,400
are helpless to do anything about it.

1280
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Visitors are requested

1281
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,480
not to throw coffee into the basin.

1282
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,200
Irritating, Captain.

1283
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,280
The sensors have eliminated

1284
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,660
all the blue passages

1285
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,960
from my sex novel.

1286
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,540
Still poking that big nose of yours

1287
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,620
in the things that I'm concerned.

1288
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,740
You fly Lutonohuru.

1289
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,800
I fail to see

1290
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,240
what the size of my nose

1291
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,680
has to do with the problem

1292
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,720
that we are facing now.

1293
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,960
You can be like the queen

1294
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,820
on sex planners.

1295
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,500
It makes you constantly comment

1296
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,980
on its prodigious size.

1297
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,840
I forget.

1298
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,460
You know, I never did watch Star Trek,

1299
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,220
so I don't know all the different characters.

1300
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,940
What is it about my nose

1301
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,180
that constantly brings me down?

1302
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,940
It brings great attention.

1303
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,160
Its fader was on Star Trek.

1304
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,100
Blast you, Spook.

1305
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,420
You know that your nose

1306
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,480
is in front to all decent Earth men?

1307
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:43,880
Weird.

1308
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,700
I'm picking up things.

1309
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,460
That's what you keep telling me.

1310
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,360
Are you out of your Vulcan mind, Spook?

1311
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,380
Oh, I get it.

1312
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,280
He doesn't have a mind, right?

1313
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:52,840
Is that the joke?

1314
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,360
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

1315
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,380
When the baby is done drinking,

1316
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,000
it must be unscrewed

1317
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,200
and laid in a cool place

1318
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,000
under a tap.

1319
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,620
This cheesy nut butter

1320
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,000
is the cause of the alien's antagonism.

1321
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm sorry.

1322
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:06,900
I just...

1323
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,560
I think I just sat on the racist peanut butter cups.

1324
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,160
You did that on purpose.

1325
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,000
I saw you.

1326
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,360
Just so I could have them all.

1327
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, he figured out my point.

1328
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,720
To boldly split infinitives

1329
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,940
where no one has done that before.

1330
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,220
Voyage to see what's on the box.

1331
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:32,620
Space.

1332
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,260
The final frontier.

1333
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,900
And then a bunch of old crafty stars.

1334
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,320
Pretending to go like this.

1335
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,260
These are the voyages of the starship KPFA.

1336
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,100
Its continuing mission.

1337
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,100
To boldly explore.

1338
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,620
To smash up the entire...

1339
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,000
It's once.

1340
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,060
To see what's on the bottom.

1341
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,680
Break everything.

1342
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,180
The bottom is erupting.

1343
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,800
The entire studio.

1344
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,300
That's the monster that comes out

1345
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,260
and attacks the whole ship.

1346
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,100
Oh, some monster, didn't they, Kirk?

1347
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:57,780
I've heard that one before.

1348
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,240
What kind of ship is that?

1349
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,940
Every week there's a Kirk out.

1350
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,900
And the ship pitches and rolls.

1351
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,120
Everyone falls out of his seat.

1352
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,040
Here's a harder one.

1353
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:05,440
Ow!

1354
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,140
Oh!

1355
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:06,840
Oh!

1356
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,080
Oh!

1357
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:07,260
Oh!

1358
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,380
Oh!

1359
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:07,980
Oh!

1360
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1361
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,500
Hard is right.

1362
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,760
Oh, my seat!

1363
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,860
Well, friends, Dr. Howell and the show there on KPFA.

1364
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,740
Before that, a clip sent by the bishop.

1365
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,480
And tons of Lemurian collage.

1366
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:34,680
And remember, friends, you can always check out www.subgenius.com.

1367
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,820
Or you can write to...

1368
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:37,400
me!

1369
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,360
At, uh, Post Office Box 181417.

1370
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,480
That's 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1371
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,680
44118.

1372
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,120
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

1373
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,000
And now, uh, Christopher Hyatt

1374
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,660
with the late, uh, occult scholar Israel Rigardi.

1375
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,900
The guru hymn.

1376
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,960
This is a hymn dedicated to the grinning, giggling monkey guru.

1377
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,120
No!

1378
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,360
Now, this is bliss consciousness.

1379
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,580
Now, we have the roots of the tree.

1380
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,600
This is the trunk of the tree.

1381
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,220
These are the branches of the tree with the pretty leaves.

1382
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:27,140
Now, in order to get bliss consciousness, we must water the roots of the tree.

1383
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:37,000
When the roots are watered, the bliss rises up the trunk of the tree into the branches of the tree into the leaves.

1384
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,800
When this happens, we have bliss consciousness.

1385
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,440
Now, bliss consciousness is something that your mother will approve of.

1386
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,260
Unlike sex and other said things, this fits right on in with her.

1387
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,000
She loves bliss consciousness.

1388
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,760
Uh, pig.

1389
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:57,360
Pig.

1390
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:06,560
There is a happy land far, far away where little piggies grow three times a day.

1391
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:17,240
Oh, you should see them run when they see the butcher come to cut slices off their bum three times a day.

1392
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,920
This is dedicated to bliss consciousness.

1393
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,220
Ha!

1394
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,220
Oh, shit, oh, dear...!

1395
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,040
Where you been?

1396
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,940
I been lookin' for you, where you been?

1397
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,980
I been lookin' for you, where you been?

1398
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,120
I been lookin' for you, where you been?

1399
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,640
I been lookin' for you, where you been?

1400
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,440
I been lookin' for you, where you been?

1401
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,300
I been lookin' for you, where you been?

1402
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, there you are!

1403
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,640
Oh, there you are.

1404
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,480
Oh!

1405
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,380
Oh, om, om!

1406
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,040
What do you want?

1407
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:51,920
What do you want?

1408
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,220
I was wondering, where you been?

1409
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,020
desk conversations

1410
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,120
Sm Bag lens

1411
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,100
Thank you.
