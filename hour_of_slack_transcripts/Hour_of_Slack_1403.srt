1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,540
How'd he turn you on?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,100
We were talking about tea.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,940
How the kick wore off.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,300
And he said there was something else.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,100
Something that had a real jolt.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,600
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,460
Never got so sick in my life.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,580
Thought I was gonna die.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,560
You're a big talker, aren't you, son?

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,260
When you're just taking a little drop, kid.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,120
They receive punishment as prescribed by law.

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,180
Putin said PR news would be excessive.

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,160
Putin says he's holding the remains of people earning over a million dollars a year.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,360
A federal judge released dozens of wild animals from his personal menagerie to protect the public.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,080
U.S. District George said there's no constitutional right to own dangerous PR news.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,440
The

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,460
U.S. District George said there's no constitutional right to own dangerous PR news.

18
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,200
I'll try to mile so as not to walk on foot.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,360
I am a human being of the first goddamn order.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,180
I am too intense to die.

21
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,700
For I speak only the fucking truth.

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,080
I am a human being of the first goddamn order.

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,080


24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
My imagination is a fucking cancer.

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,740
And I'll park it before it parks me.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,260
I think backwards.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,740
I do it for fun.

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,460
I cook and eat my dead.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,780
I swam up a human triangle and didn't get wet.

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,160
I swam up a human triangle and didn't get wet.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,080
I kidnap the future.

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,180
I'm ransomed into the past.

33
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
I wait time.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,860
Wait up for me.

35
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,160
I'll live forever and remember it afterwards.

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,240
Yes, I am the power of the future.

37
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,980
I am the flower of hell county.

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,380
Gimme one word.

39
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm a man.

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,900
Man of a million.

41
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,380
Man of a million.

42
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,200
Man of a million.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,660
Man of a million.

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,060
Man of a million.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,400
They say a godzillion is the highest.

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
Well, there is.

47
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,740
Well, by god.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,980
I count to a godzillion and one.

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,580
I weigh six hundred and sixty six pounds.

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,540
Zero gravity

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,480
Come and get me

52
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,060
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church

53
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,020
And he shook my head

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,840
I have my own personal saviors

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,320
I change them every hour

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,480
I don't give a fuck if there's laugh after death

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,440
I don't wanna know if there's even any fucking slack after death

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,980
I am a goddamn visionary

59
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,640
I see the future and the past

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,040
In comic books and wine bottles

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,580
I paint my jeans

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,160
I riddle my DNA

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
With the force of my mighty will

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,920
I steer my own goddamn adventure

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,980
Give me slack

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
Give me slack

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,940
Give me slack

68
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,520
Give me slack

69
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Give me slack

70
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,040
Give me slack

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Give me slack

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Give me slack

73
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,060
That was The Brag of the Subgenius by yours truly

74
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,700
performed by mythical burrowing animals

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,640
who I suspect might go by other names.

76
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,340
They may even be famous.

77
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,060
It's from one of our Bob Songs CDs of yore.

78
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,500
Before that, collages by Mr. Fernandanende.

79
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,520
The more.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,760
And this is Hour of Slack number 1403.

81
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,180
And I'm recording this part of the credits

82
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,980
in my son's garage in Los Angeles.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,140
But, friends, this is an Hour of Slack

84
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,120
that's really a puzzling evidence show.

85
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,540
Yeah, but we're gonna pretend like it's not, right?

86
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,820
No, it's really, it's obviously a puzzling evidence show.

87
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,440
There's no way you could fake that.

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,240
True.

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,440
Except that it's all fake to begin with.

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,940
But, yeah, this is the only part

91
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,400
that's really the Hour of Slack.

92
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,360
This is the intro for the puzzling evidence show

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,640
that's gonna replace some Hour of Slack

94
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,740
somewhere in the...

95
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,620
Hour of Slack number...

96
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,860
Yeah, this is Hour of Slack number 14...

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,780
Brought to you on station...

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,800
We've got unexpected special guest here,

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,960
Pope S. Lilith.

100
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,020
Hi!

101
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
In from Seattle.

102
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:15,920
Yeah.

103
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
And, uh...

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,960
And who else?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,660
Dr. Howland puzzling and...

106
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,700
Dr. Drummond and that's...

107
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,800
And the sound effects and...

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,720
And that old...

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,460
K-Rob, okay, if we...

110
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,200
And if this is the intro for the last week's show...

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,200


112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,040
Oh, no, we can't.

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,300
K-Rob was last week.

114
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,460
Yeah.

115
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,260
So I've already said Lil, so I can't...

116
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,080
420 guy is here, but he's always here.

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,680
It's that 420 guy.

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,520
Yeah, that's him.

119
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,880
I thought 420 guy was just a caller.

120
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,600
No, no.

121
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,300
Oh, okay.

122
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,980
I gotta sit down.

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,880
Okay.

124
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm gonna go sit down.

125
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,880
I gotta get warm.

126
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,460
I'm gonna go get some water first.

127
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,220
Please stand on the retinal scan imaging security pad.

128
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,260
Eyes forward, please.

129
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,040
RSI security scan in progress.

130
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,680
Don't move.

131
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Retinal scan imaging for access.

132
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,140
RSI system engaged.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,260
Scanning.

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,580
Scanning.

135
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,520
Your authorization code...

136
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,520
Verified.

137
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,460
Access granted.

138
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,940
Everything is complete.

139
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,760
There is more than one kind of freedom.

140
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,680
In the days of anarchy, it was freedom.

141
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,920
Now you're being given freedom from...

142
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,680
Bustard!

143
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,480
Whatever you imagined has made Ryu before you.

144
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm going to give you...

145
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,280
All the games that you need.

146
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
One in a million.

147
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,100
Come on.

148
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,920
That's it.

149
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,080
That's it.

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,780
What are you doing here anyway?

151
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,960
What good is all this equipment?

152
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,380
I thought you reported lots of information.

153
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,180
Discretion is advised for this feature presentation.

154
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,640
We are dealing in an area of uncertainty.

155
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,920
An area where there are no rules, contradictory laws, and no clear social conditions.

156
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:21,920


157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:21,920


158
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:21,920


159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,500
There are no common sense as to what should be done.

160
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,820
Decisions about life and death.

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,360
I will kill you now.

162
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,760
Luke, I am your father.

163
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,580
Now!

164
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,800
Luke.

165
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,240
I am your father.

166
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:41,860
I am your father.

167
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,580
Luke, you must join me.

168
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,980
Help me, help me.

169
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,920
What is too bad you can't smoke and hear?

170
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,440
I know good health and insight.

171
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,520
You will die!

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,200
Wanna help me with black chocolate milk resultados?

173
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,200


174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,860
Here we are.

175
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,400
What?

176
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,460
Are you looking at the fire?

177
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,660
Get an amplifier into my car.

178
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,400
I was just losing it.

179
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,660
Need more protection.

180
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,320
From the ꞎz discipline?

181
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes.

182
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,360
I know that Mr. Knifeman.

183
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,480
Yes, That's my man.

184
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,880
Now, I will get this out of the loop.

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,160
Yep. It is the show again.

186
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,020
It's all different this time.

187
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,640
That's how the things used to be in the church in the 70s.

188
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,400
Not anymore. Now that we got Dr. Howell,

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,540
we got the Oberman, we got Ivan Stang,

190
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,620
and we got...

191
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,240
From up in Seattle.

192
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,500
The Popus of Seattle.

193
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,160
Lilith and yourself.

194
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,900
Yes, Lilith is here.

195
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,160
Puzzling evidence.

196
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,600
Did you really just play half an hour

197
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
of some old talk tape from me to you?

198
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,540
Because that's why I don't do Facebook.

199
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,740
I have no idea what that means,

200
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,720
but we're talking about loss of Facebook.

201
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,440
That's what he did on Facebook.

202
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
It won't be on an hour of Slack.

203
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm sorry about that.

204
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,860
It'll be on the larger arc of Puzzling Evidence.

205
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,940
But that's the Puzzling Evidence show archive.

206
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,360
And that's a great piece of history.

207
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,120
That's right.

208
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,560
That's wonderful stuff.

209
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,000
You're not supposed to like it.

210
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,280
Oh, well, good.

211
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
The people who study subgenius.

212
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,600
What was so terrible about it, Reverend Stang?

213
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,360
It was baby Reverend Stang

214
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,100
back when I cared about everything,

215
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,880
back when I cared about Bob.

216
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
I think I heard myself on there.

217
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,220
They don't care about Bob.

218
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,300
Don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care.

219
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
How right they were.

220
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,540
They don't care about Bob.

221
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,320
But Reverend Stang,

222
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,300
all the little secrets,

223
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,080
the little secrets,

224
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,320
Bob, bless him,

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,980
ought to have a chance

226
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,780
to get in touch with the friendly Stang

227
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,240
as well as the scolding, stormy Stang.

228
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,860
Oh, I'm sure I'll go into character at some point.

229
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,400
But by gobs, you know...

230
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,620
You don't have to do it anymore.

231
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,480
Just use these priceless archival tapes.

232
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,980
They'll never know the difference.

233
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,500
That's right.

234
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,640
I went on this vacation

235
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,780
and I was free from Bob, per force,

236
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,980
sort of involuntary slack.

237
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,800
And why it feels good.

238
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,360
Damn it.

239
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,260
Yes, it does.

240
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,280
It feels good to be free of Bob.

241
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,040
Why, I've...

242
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,660
I've been answering...

243
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,340
I've been filling orders dutifully.

244
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,600
Luckily, there've hardly been any at all.

245
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,740
And I even cranked out

246
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,520
an edited all X-rated internet show

247
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,260
earlier today

248
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,140
over the last several weeks.

249
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,260
And really, it went out for broadcast?

250
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,040
No.

251
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,700
No.

252
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,560
It's an internet-only hour of slack

253
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,860
number 1,000, 4,000, 0.5.

254
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,320
Only on the internet.

255
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,780
Only on the internet.

256
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,780


257
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,780


258
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,780


259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,340
X, X, X.

260
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,460
Yes, now that makes it more clear.

261
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,180
It has a lot of dirty words in it.

262
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,420
Thanks to you, Dr. Philodromo.

263
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,560
Seven dirty words.

264
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,000
For man first degree.

265
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,500
The seven deadliest words of Christ,

266
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,660
plus a few more.

267
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,240
It has the seven seals.

268
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
The seals on Dave's car,

269
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,780
that sports team called the seals.

270
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,000
The seals that are brutally murdered.

271
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,980
Oh, that was last week.

272
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,780
The seals that you blew out.

273
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,720
The San Francisco seals

274
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,000
on Seal Rock.

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,660
That wasn't my show.

276
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,780
That was Chaz's show on this show.

277
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,020
It gets confusing.

278
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,760
Have you ever noticed that?

279
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

280
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,140
That it gets confusing?

281
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,660
It does.

282
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,440
Confusion to your enemies.

283
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,240
Confound their politics.

284
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,740
Frustrate their knavish tricks.

285
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,540
It certainly does.

286
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
Yeah, but it's confusing to me.

287
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,220
Not my enemy.

288
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,120
But that's okay.

289
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,960
Well, maybe then they'll be even more confused.

290
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,720
Because you've been

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,820
reacting to that confusion

292
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,160
since about the sixth grade.

293
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,220
His success is passion,

294
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,400
joy, and blowing his own horn.

295
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,960
I haven't forgotten a single slight

296
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
from sixth grade.

297
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,560
All those times your young, proud spirit

298
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,780
was slapped down

299
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,620
by an uncaring world.

300
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,260
Mrs. Reed from first grade?

301
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,020
She'll face me on next day.

302
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,940
Mrs. Darden from fifth grade?

303
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,620
Oh, yeah.

304
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,180
She'll be at the judge's meeting.

305
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,500
What did these women do, Reverend Stang?

306
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,700
Mrs. Reed made me...

307
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,640
made me eat a pimento cheese sandwich

308
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,840
in front of everyone in the cafeteria

309
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,160
because I wasn't eating my government-issued

310
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,300
pimento cheese sandwich.

311
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,280
And to this day, I cannot eat them.

312
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Being forced to eat that jelly donut

313
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,940
while the rest of the platoon exercise.

314
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,020
Mrs. Reed was fired the next year.

315
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,280
Not for that infraction.

316
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,620
And I'm sure she's dead now,

317
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,200
but that won't stop me from resurrecting her

318
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,780
and torturing her and making her eat

319
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,220
something like a pimento cheese sandwich.

320
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,700
Just as in the case of...

321
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,500
Right in front of everybody.

322
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,200
Charlie made her.

323
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,540
I foam.

324
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,000
I certainly would.

325
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,740
Yeah, the foam pimento.

326
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,280
If you can collect all her ashes...

327
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,360
And oddly enough...

328
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,600
...in certain thaumaturgic practices

329
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
affect the palingenesis.

330
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,540
Due to Stockholm syndrome,

331
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,380
I remembered Mrs. Reed as a wonderful teacher.

332
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,300
Restore her from her ashes.

333
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,120
Yeah, she was married to Oliver Reed.

334
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,040
She was...

335
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,420
Well, that was short-lived.

336
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,720
Yeah.

337
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,660
Ran off to England.

338
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,120
She realized...

339
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,340
They went to Reed College.

340
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,180
She realized he liked sex and that was that.

341
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,000
All she likes is pimento.

342
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,640
Reed Richards.

343
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:50,860
Pimento.

344
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,640
That's like the worst thing in the world.

345
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:52,780
Yes, they...

346
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,160
They read Richards, uh, day and night.

347
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,260
Baked the trap with nice cheese.

348
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,980
Only this time, the bait's going to be fat cheese.

349
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,300
Only this time, the bait's going to be gone.

350
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:06,840
Mmm.

351
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,760
We return in just a moment.

352
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,380
A big morning's work in the defense classroom

353
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,740
certainly does whet up a fella's appetite.

354
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Yes, mother, dad, and you young buckaroos,

355
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,600
you'll put your...

356
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,140
party okay on your sandwiches with delicious North Dorf bread.

357
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,220
And on top of that, more delicious North Dorf bread

358
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,700
made with pure dextrous energy foods.

359
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,900
Oh, boy.

360
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,620
Believe me, North Dorf bread has such grand, smooth, delicious nerves

361
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,900
and fresh cornrows.

362
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,780
Yes, North Dorf bread is made with special lunch food.

363
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,500
So, ladies, make North Dorf bread.

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,560
Yes, for goodness sake, make delicious North Dorf bread.

365
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes, make fresh and tasty North Dorf bread.

366
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:48,680
Yes, make fresh and tasty North Dorf bread.

367
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,400
Tomorrow, tomorrow, sure.

368
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,140
Oh, boy, you'll like it.

369
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,480
And don't forget it's been judged by baking experts.

370
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,740
Yes.

371
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,160
I can handle this.

372
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,940
Well, maybe you can handle this too.

373
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,700
Bye, that green-tailed bobcat.

374
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,300
Mmm.

375
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,460
Mmm.

376
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,780
Oh.

377
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,480
Mmm.

378
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, little beaver, I...

379
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh.

380
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't know how to thank you.

381
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,240
Oh.

382
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:24,800
Now, then I've had other teachers that I remember that will be made into queens when X-Day comes.

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,960
Like Mrs. Neendorf, my fourth grade teacher.

384
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,020
Oh, yeah, she was the nice one with hair on her chest.

385
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,920
Man, she was everything a little weirdo could ask for in a teacher.

386
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,340
That's Mrs. Dennis for me.

387
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,580
She had a thatch sweater woven into her chest hair.

388
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,220
Not only did she not take away my comic books,

389
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,580
she encouraged me to draw them,

390
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,760
and she even showed me how to make a ditto copy of them.

391
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,580
The only reason I have any comic books from elementary school

392
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,800
is because Mrs. Neendorf mailed them to me about ten years ago.

393
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,880
She had kept a few.

394
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,580
She wrote to me and said,

395
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,200
I saw you in the newspaper.

396
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm so glad to see that you've done well.

397
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,680
And I'm a crazy weirdo myself.

398
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,860
I'm a big Star Trek nut, and I go to Star Trek conventions all dressed up all the time.

399
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,500
That's very cool.

400
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,120
And she sent you your comic books?

401
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,420
She sent me my comic books.

402
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,200
I have them.

403
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,000
I had not seen any of that derivative crappy artwork since fourth grade.

404
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,540
Wow.

405
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,120
That's a true teacher.

406
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,740
I threw away my own comics when I was 12.

407
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,980
I threw away everything I'd drawn because I had vowed to become normal when we moved to Dallas.

408
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
Boy, did that not work.

409
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,300
Isn't that sad?

410
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,600
Isn't that sad?

411
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,540
I threw away my comics.

412
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,240
I burned them.

413
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,360
I went out in the alley.

414
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,580
As soon as we got to Dallas, the kids here in Dallas,

415
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,120
they don't know I'm a weirdo like the kids in Fort Worth.

416
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,360
So I'm going to burn my comic books symbolically,

417
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,240
and I'm going to be normal and get laid.

418
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,600
I was 12.

419
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,180
I was born in Dallas.

420
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,580
That's cool.

421
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,540
I was born in Dallas.

422
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,960
He was 12 when he started thinking about getting laid.

423
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, but see, you moved to Seattle where you could say,

424
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,480
they don't know me.

425
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,100
In Seattle, I can be normal.

426
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,520
Oh, wait.

427
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,960
No, it's the other way around for you.

428
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,060
More like just to be me, and that was actually kind of awesome.

429
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,360
Because I would have to remain.

430
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,520
I would have to remain Reverend Sheldon if I stayed in Dallas.

431
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,120
Right.

432
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,680
As it appears in the first subgenius video.

433
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,800
My kids.

434
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Reverend Sheldon?

435
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,400
Yeah, with all of the pamphlets filling the house.

436
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,980
By the way, by the way, I found out that 22 years ago,

437
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,640
last Saturday night was the anniversary of me first doing a subgenius revival,

438
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,240
preaching at a subgenius revival.

439
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,080
Where was that?

440
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,360
It was called the Big Slack Attack.

441
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
It was an anniversary.

442
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,780
It was an anti-stang revival.

443
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,200
Really?

444
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,660
Yes.

445
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,200
Yeah.

446
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,000
Actually, it was an intentional anti-stang revival.

447
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,220
No stang, you're not allowed.

448
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,720
Well, I had dumped Buck Naked.

449
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,540
He actually didn't talk that much trash about you or anything like that.

450
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,480
I had dumped Buck.

451
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,000
I told Buck Naked I didn't want to do shows with him.

452
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,980
He could do whatever he wanted.

453
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,800
As far as minus stang divivals, it wasn't all that terrible.

454
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,860
It was probably 1980.

455
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,940
It would have been 86 or so.

456
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,360
Uh-huh.

457
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,580
87 maybe.

458
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,560
When was the Chicago Divival?

459
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,940
Which one?

460
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,560
There was one in 83.

461
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,480
The one where, yeah, where Sternow was bonked in the head.

462
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,440
Oh, are you talking about the World Subgenius Convention?

463
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,120
World Subcon.

464
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,800
Oh, right.

465
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,560
World Subcon.

466
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,720
Yeah, that was 83 in Chicago.

467
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:41,860
The only reason that Pope Florist didn't lose his behind on that was because the Radisson Hotel,

468
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,040
changed owners right after that, and they never billed him.

469
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,360
Wow.

470
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,200
Otherwise, he would have been, you know, financially ruined.

471
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,220
That's how slack works, folks.

472
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,460
Uh-huh.

473
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,160
I drew a drawing of a tree that had faces and hands all over it.

474
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,540
I guess I was influenced by the Poultry Guys series.

475
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,760
Poultry Guys.

476
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,520
Yeah, I remember this.

477
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,460
The second or third one had that tree-looking, weird-looking thing made out of all those people and those arms and whatnot.

478
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,700
So I drew this drawing of a tree with these faces, arms.

479
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:11,840
Philo guys.

480
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,260
Scary one.

481
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,760
Poultry Guys make very good fertilizer for trees.

482
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,140
It's expensive.

483
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,920
Poultry Guys make up the principal type of spontaneous material manifestation.

484
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,320
Wow.

485
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,260
Yes, and it was really cool.

486
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,340
She said, remember this?

487
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,320
And that's all it said.

488
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,760
She died in a car accident, actually.

489
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,260
Just after that?

490
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,040
What's that?

491
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,260
It was nice of her to give you the thing back before that happened.

492
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,060
Yeah, you could say I was a teacher's pet.

493
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,340
I was one of her favorites.

494
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,320
I used to go after long-

495
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,500
Never pet the teacher.

496
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,820
I used to go out of the way to say hi to her and stuff at the school, so.

497
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,780
So the other kids didn't like you?

498
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,140
No, it was all that ectoplasm.

499
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
All that ectoplasm.

500
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,360
Oh, there's that music again.

501
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:50,780
Yeah.

502
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,000
All I can say is, can you guys help me find my scanner?

503
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,580
Although it's awfully dark in here.

504
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,200
Scanner's a living thing.

505
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,360
Nope.

506
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,460
Is it a flatbed or is it for eggs or slides?

507
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:58,660
Nope.

508
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,420
We cannot help you find your scanner.

509
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,660
I just had that, too.

510
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,920
I just had that movie for sound bites and I turned it back in at Netflix.

511
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,320
If you call Homeland Security, they'll be able to help you.

512
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,940
Hey, you guys.

513
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,960
They know where your scanner is.

514
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,820
I think I know where your scanner is.

515
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:19,300
This is kind of a historic show to me because Homeland Security is now all over the station.

516
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,240
Yeah.

517
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,000
Everywhere you go in this station, there's little domes.

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,160
Now, I'm sure they're all props that don't really work.

519
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,840
Yeah, probably so.

520
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,680
Yeah, we went through a sea change of adaptation tonight.

521
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,360
That's right.

522
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,080
Once again.

523
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,560
Yeah.

524
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,420
It happens many times.

525
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,800
Instead of rocking away, we had to shuffle away.

526
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:41,800


527
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,100
Yeah, we shuffled away.

528
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,060
We had to cringe and hide and firmly cringe and hid.

529
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,320
Because we're of the generation now that said, let's be free.

530
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,400
Right.

531
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,580
Then that was that.

532
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, let's be free.

533
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
And then they invented Homeland Security.

534
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,420
Yeah, let's be free, Rose.

535
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,640
Hey, not only that, but international postage rates went up almost 50%.

536
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,180
Yeah, it's 46 cents for a first class stamp now.

537
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
That's not a big deal.

538
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,540
How about U.S. postcard rates?

539
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,000
33 cents.

540
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,640
33 is a postcard now?

541
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:14,840
Yeah.

542
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:28,520
Mailing a Salvation from the United States to anywhere overseas went from $10.14 to $14.90.

543
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,340
$15.

544
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,020
Holy cow.

545
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,820
Alexander the Great had conquered the Nobel world when he was 33.

546
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,180
I've got two orders from Australia.

547
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,540
I'm going to either lose money on or have to beg them to send me another.

548
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
He sat down and wept.

549
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,080
Five bucks.

550
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,520
They're trying to get us to the moon.

551
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,520


552
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,520


553
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,520


554
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,520


555
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,520


556
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,520


557
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,660
I've done it all.

558
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,880
It's a conspiracy.

559
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,040
We'll stop it.

560
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,420
Nothing.

561
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,940
Nothing, I tell you.

562
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,280
They will raise the postage rates just to foil the sub-geniuses.

563
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,600
And then what do they do once you get all smoked out?

564
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,000
What happens?

565
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,640
Well, they don't smoke you out when they throw the smoke bomb in.

566
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,740
Your house catches on fire and you burn up.

567
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,980
That's called Koreshin you.

568
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,020
I mean, if they upped the postal rates, I took a course in that.

569
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,060
Koreshin.

570
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,500
The post office department, which is one of the more abysmal houses in the world, was

571
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,500


572
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,500


573
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,500


574
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,500


575
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,880
functions of the U.S. government,

576
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,780
ups their rates, and that smokes out all the cults?

577
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Well, the cults

578
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,740
can't absorb it, that kind of cost

579
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,340
anymore. They're going to have to cut some workers out.

580
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,520
So the cults become like the little potato people in

581
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,560
dissent? They're little potato

582
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,600
people. Well, a lot of them were already

583
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,880
like the little potato people.

584
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,120
They're little potato families.

585
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,700
They're the

586
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,020
tiny spud men.

587
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,420
We call them tater heads.

588
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,720
Ireland and elves in England.

589
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,320
We call them tater heads.

590
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
They're kids we call tater toms.

591
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,000
Some smirkers in Australia.

592
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,840
When Stang is on the show.

593
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,260
Oh, no!

594
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,440
Why, when Stang

595
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
is on the show, it's just the same

596
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,600
as if some utterly insignificant

597
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
negligible person were on the show.

598
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,940
We're so democratic

599
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,920
that we treat Ivan

600
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,780
Stang like we

601
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,740
treat Joe Lunchpain.

602
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,040
Would you please get some better toilet

603
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,840
paper, boys?

604
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,340
It's really rough.

605
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,220
Right away, Chief.

606
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,360
Wobbly, bring him back.

607
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,600
Yeah, bring Wobbly back.

608
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,040
He's asleep.

609
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,340
You mean the industrial workers of the world, son?

610
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,460
Yeah, these are very, this is KPFA

611
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,420
and they're very, people are very, very,

612
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,780
very, very, very, very...

613
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,840
They're pro-labour.

614
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,300
Why don't you come out and say it?

615
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,680
They support the union.

616
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,460
It gives you two hours...

617
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,240
We taste like blueberry and strawberry.

618
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,400
I'll have a blueberry and strawberry.

619
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,000
...energy suppository,

620
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,840
which will make me fly through the rest

621
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,820
of the evening. That's what they do at the first part

622
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,880
of the show. We're very, very...

623
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,560
They do it on camera now. You have to. They see

624
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,080
everything.

625
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,300
We're all watching you now.

626
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,300
We're doing it now.

627
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,520
Who's this we?

628
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,780
Do you have a mouse in your pocket

629
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,280
or something?

630
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,280
The horrible thing is the new photographer.

631
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,520
What is this we?

632
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,000
We, we.

633
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,140
She's not here right now.

634
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,040
No, no, no.

635
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:09,960
We is me.

636
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,240
We is me.

637
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,280
We is...

638
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,800
We is not thee.

639
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,520
We is Princess We.

640
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,940
We is...

641
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Many moons ago

642
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,980
In a far-off land

643
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,700
In a far-off land

644
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:39,700


645
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,960
Called Ohio

646
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,100
A space princess

647
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,540
Roamed the grounds

648
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,740
Of a campground

649
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,680
Called Wisteria

650
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,600
Spreading light and love

651
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
Wherever she goes

652
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,660
She's the one

653
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,680
Who's going to be

654
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:09,680


655
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,500
The queen of the world

656
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,880
Because everybody knows how

657
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,700
And loves her

658
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,720
Sweetness of night

659
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,600
All that is good

660
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,660
All that is right

661
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,000
A space princess

662
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:38,480
A space princess

663
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,680
A space princess

664
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,680


665
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,680


666
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,680


667
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,140
A space princess

668
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,260
The birds they sang

669
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,080
When she was born

670
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,760
A space princess

671
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
And the fairies rang out

672
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,860
With laughter when she landed

673
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,180
A space princess

674
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,320
A blessing on this planet

675
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,180
A space princess

676
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,060
A space princess

677
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:24,760
A space princess

678
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:35,180
You know, I was wondering, Rev Stang, what happens when all the bobbies go to Ex Day and they go to the Saucers and who gets all their stuff they left behind?

679
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,140
Who cares?

680
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,240
You can get anything.

681
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,000
You might get their stuff.

682
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,680
Their stuff isn't worth a dollar.

683
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,200
The key thing to X-Day is that you don't have to leave it behind.

684
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
You can take it with you.

685
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,300
Not only can you take all your stuff, you can take all the pink stuff.

686
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,220
And, indeed, I say it again, I've got dibs on the Grand Canyon, boys.

687
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,220
But you don't have to take it with you because just think,

688
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,540
when you get on the ships, there'll be comic book collections

689
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,760
that are much better than the one that you had.

690
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,720
Right, you can have your real one and your pink rival's real ones,

691
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,100
plus better ones.

692
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,600
All waiting for you in your cabin when you get on the ship.

693
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,500
Every issue of Famous Monsters, not on disc.

694
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,440
Pristine copies.

695
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,260
Pristine copies.

696
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,440
The smelling like they just came off the rack at Mason's Hobby Lobby.

697
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,520
I've got them, but not in that good condition.

698
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,780
Same here.

699
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,060
Well, you won't need them anymore, Dr. Howell.

700
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,960
You can burn those Famous Monsters.

701
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,360
Never.

702
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,520
You're burned.

703
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,940
You're waiting next to your bed in your pleasure saucer control room.

704
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,560
You'll have your own stack of pristine Famous Monsters of film.

705
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,280
Now, you know, some people would be fantasizing in terms of fast cars

706
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:52,140
and beautiful, beloved things of the other sex or whatever desire.

707
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,700
Don't forget, even though this...

708
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,040
And here we're talking about comic books and monster magazines.

709
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,180
Well, even though the spaceship is large...

710
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,720
But those are wholly object.

711
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,400
There's only a three-quarter mile racetrack inside.

712
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,460
You won't be able to really open up like you would in the NASCAR arena.

713
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,400
Must you really run your infernal internal combustion engines on the spaceship?

714
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,880
The evidence's saucer will be completely filled with battleships and...

715
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh, he's got helicopters and things in there.

716
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,860
Yeah, every kind of military hardware.

717
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,440
That's true.

718
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,140
I'm going to go get Oswald's body, JFK's body, Goldwater's body, Nixon's body, all the presidents from...

719
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,220
What about Mr. Body?

720
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,140
How about Houdini?

721
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,380
Mr. Body's going to fix my UFO, the dents and the paint jobs.

722
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,580
You mean?

723
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,380
Fred Houdini.

724
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,440
Yeah, Mr. Body.

725
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,420
And Mr. Peabody.

726
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:36,780
And Mr. Peabody.

727
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,380
Tink, tink, tink, tink.

728
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,440
And the mermaid.

729
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,760
And Mr. Peabody.

730
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,820
Actually, it's one of the things I'd like to do while I'm here is I've got a UFO that I want to take a picture of.

731
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,760
The queen of UFOs.

732
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,120
UFO.

733
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,720
And the big UFO will be in the foreground in the fake picture.

734
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,360
And the little...

735
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,560
From outer space.

736
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,700
We'll just see about that.

737
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,540
We'll just see about outer space.

738
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,300
Outer space.

739
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,660
We will.

740
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,220
Yeah, we.

741
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:01,960
Sure.

742
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,780
We will.

743
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,220
Did you hear about the big asteroid crash in the Soviet, I mean, in Russia?

744
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,800
No.

745
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,680
It blew it right out of the sky.

746
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
It came in near Moscow.

747
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,640
It was destroyed in an airburst, but it broke windows and knocked down spaces.

748
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,160
It broke wind?

749
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,180
Therefore...

750
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,680
In the sky?

751
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,120
No, it broke windows eight.

752
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,880
Or they shot down the UFO.

753
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,980
Ruined the whole software pattern.

754
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,280
Those are the only two options being given by the news media so far.

755
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,160
And what about that asteroid that's not going to destroy the Earth?

756
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,180
It's coming incredibly.

757
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,780
It's incredibly close.

758
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,120
22,000 kilometers.

759
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,080
It's very, very near.

760
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,500
But it's nothing to worry about.

761
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,160
They just thought they'd mention it.

762
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,580
Just, you know, sniff it.

763
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
I thought you guys were working the line that because people bought enough memberships,

764
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,340
that's why it's not smashing into Earth.

765
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,080
Well, we'll say that right up to the time it does.

766
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,100
No, no.

767
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,580
If they buy enough memberships, it will smash into Earth.

768
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,640
So, spend, spend, spend.

769
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,020
Help bring on the interview.

770
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,320
This is not a call to action.

771
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,180
This is a satirical statement.

772
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,160
Yes, not to be given credence in the final court.

773
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,160


774
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,780
And that phone number we can't bring in is completely fake.

775
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,380
Theoretically, how much money would it take to make the comet hit Earth?

776
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,820
Well, you know, we won't find out until we get there.

777
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,560
Well, no.

778
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,780
We could, theoretically, we could calculate.

779
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,260
Hang on.

780
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm going to get my calculator out.

781
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm going to make some projections.

782
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,260
I'm going to extrapolate some of these algorithms out into the future.

783
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,840
Make sure to carry the one.

784
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm going to carry the one.

785
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,340
I'm going to multiply infinity times this special subgenius algorithm.

786
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,140
And he's going to do it.

787
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,140


788
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,140


789
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,140


790
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,060
To get the answer.

791
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,820
All the way to the other side of the...

792
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,420
Hang on a minute.

793
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,000
I wish I had...

794
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,240
You can't jerry-rig this.

795
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,420
I wish I had my calculator sounds that you could hear right now.

796
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,240
My calculator won't even work.

797
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,480
Instead, you just have to listen to pocket protector sounds.

798
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,360
I'm going to pull...

799
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,580
This calculator is so old, it still has a one-armed bandit on it.

800
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,740
I have to crank the stamp.

801
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,080
He's the operator with his pocket calculator.

802
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,700
To blow up like it's supposed to.

803
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,540
Yes, cramp.

804
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,240
Yes, tramp.

805
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,020
Me, I'm cramping.

806
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,660
Me.

807
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,800
Well, I...

808
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,120
Hang on a minute.

809
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,720
Hang on.

810
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,740
I'm carrying my one.

811
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,240
It's really a heavy one, though.

812
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,540
It's a heavy load.

813
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,060
And listen, we're calculating how much money the church needs to raise

814
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,480
to cause the asteroid to smash into the planet Earth and...

815
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,320
Recalculating.

816
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,140
...replicate what happened.

817
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,100
Okay, just a second.

818
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,180
The answer is going to...

819
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,940
We'll be here in about three...

820
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,200
Less than two minutes now.

821
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,340
Only $35?

822
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,980
We only need one more $35 membership?

823
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,440
Recalculating.

824
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:31,720
Quiet.

825
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,620
That means if one person...

826
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,700
One person out there were to fall for it...

827
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,720
In one half mile.

828
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,660
I'm pushing the button.

829
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,000
My golly, we could destroy the Earth.

830
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,880
I'm pushing the button.

831
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,480
Uh-oh.

832
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,380
The calculator is not responding.

833
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,780
It's not responding to...

834
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,520
Although, if it was one person in China, that doesn't really help you, right?

835
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,440
I think it's going to go...

836
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,920
$150 to send them anything.

837
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,200
The calculator is going into cardiac arrest.

838
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm going to have to perform...

839
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,780
That explains that hostage, right?

840
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,180
I'm going to have to perform cardiac pulmonary resuscitation.

841
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,180
In one quarter mile...

842
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,460
Turn.

843
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,060
Turn left on Red Rock Road.

844
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,560
Uh-oh.

845
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,260
It's flatlining.

846
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,180
The calculator has flatlined.

847
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,480
The calculator is...

848
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,660
Dr. Hal, have you turned?

849
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:12,940
No.

850
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,840
Wait a minute.

851
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,320
Here it is.

852
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,640
Here it is.

853
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,040
No, wait.

854
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,720
It's come back.

855
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,060
It's come back with an answer.

856
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,880
Oh, much better.

857
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,480
Here it is.

858
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:18,960
Here it is.

859
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
At Red Rock Road...

860
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,780
We have the answer.

861
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,560
This is how much money it's going to take to bring about the end of the world.

862
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,860
All we need is a few more contributions to make up the one zillion dollars.

863
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,880
Recalculating.

864
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,940
One zillion.

865
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,800
One zillion is just past a trillion.

866
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,120
One zillion dollars and 53 cents.

867
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,720
That's with inflation?

868
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,200
At Washington Boulevard...

869
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,900
That is with inflation.

870
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,700
I'm going to round up and just say one zillion and one dollars.

871
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,520
And point to the left.

872
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,200
Breakout marker rejoin Red Rock Road and turn left.

873
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,640
And it just pumps it up.

874
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,020
And point to the left.

875
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,160


876
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,820
Yeah, we'll round up that last dollar.

877
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,860
At 53 mile marker.

878
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,440
But I've only got a couple million and I need the world to end.

879
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,300
And now...

880
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,500
Then donate to the...

881
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,940
Are you sad because the world won't end and you only have a couple million to help bring it about?

882
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,320
Well, you should send $35 somewhere fast now.

883
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,220
And just throw it somewhere.

884
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,880
If you can't get it out of your hands, just force it.

885
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,420
Take your pockets off.

886
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,020
Make sure that you don't have a special place to put that $35.

887
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,620
That's all right.

888
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,160
You're going to have some money soon.

889
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,980
Perhaps an envelope would help.

890
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,000
With a stamp.

891
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,900
That big envelope will come.

892
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,580
Just make sure it's a 46 cent stamp now.

893
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,760
Watch for our prize patrol and our annoying flashing neon sign in your neighborhood.

894
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,880
We could have a forever more stamp.

895
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm Ralph Snell of the Super Sweepstakes Prize Patrol.

896
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,620
And this February 28th, I and the rest of the prize patrol goons could be rolling up your driveway

897
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,000
with a bunch of balloons and a giant check that says,

898
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,880
Jane Q. Summers.

899
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:07,820
Somebody, you've just won $500,000 every day for the rest of your life.

900
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,120
How do we do it?

901
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,920
Wait, you know what?

902
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,760
Getting away these valuable magazines and premiums.

903
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,580
Yes, what is it, my boy?

904
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,880
I think Jane Q. Somebody actually is a real person.

905
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,380
Well, I think so.

906
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,960
And she's going to win unless you fill in yours and send it in.

907
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,780
Then you just wouldn't have to taste the bitter cup of reading that Jane Q. Somebody won the fortune.

908
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,300
Which, by rights, should have been yours.

909
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,560
Should have been mine. Was mine.

910
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,400
Yes, it was destined from the beginning of the world.

911
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,840
By God, I'm going to make sure she doesn't get it.

912
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,240
Yes, you can make sure that she spends every day in appalling agony.

913
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,360
I want her to spend the rest of her life in an iron lung.

914
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,180
A red hot iron lung.

915
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,760
A red hot steaming iron lung.

916
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
Yes, all this can be arranged.

917
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,700
But what we're going to do first is give you a full psychiatric and physical examination.

918
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,420
And a rubdown, right?

919
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,900
Make sure you're in fighting trip for subgenius.

920
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,440


921
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,840
Exercise number four.

922
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,780
Big fuzzy postage stamp like the kind a clown wears.

923
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,900
33 cents.

924
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,700
Point those sticking out.

925
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,520
Turn communist.

926
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,760
You lick the fuzzy stamp and you paste it into the...

927
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,280
Great calculating.

928
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,120
Into the stamp calculator where you wash it with gasoline and soap suds.

929
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,520
Foolish humans.

930
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,140
None can go against the might of Calculon.

931
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,700
The shoe starts hopping around and kicks over a large glass bowl filled with goldfish.

932
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,140
These are talented shoes.

933
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Hey, hey, you guys.

934
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,560
I have a new terrorist thing we can do for the church to get a bunch of PR.

935
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,020
A terrorist?

936
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,240
I've just been thinking.

937
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,000
A better one to go.

938
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:50,260
A foolish ranger at Carlsbad Caverns showed Princess Wee and me how to turn the lights off in there from one switch.

939
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,640
We were the last people there and they were shooing us out.

940
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,180
It'll be so dark you'll terrify the people trapped in the cave.

941
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,420
It's the thing.

942
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,880
We could go in there in the middle of the night.

943
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,200
In the middle of the day, plunge the entire two mile...

944
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,160
Well, the whole time it's miles and miles of caverns on a busy holiday.

945
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,680
Plunge it into darkness and then run around in, I don't know, glowing bob masks.

946
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,900
Wait, wait, wait a second.

947
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,640
My pencil broke.

948
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,920
Good rehearsal for when we plunge the entire civilization.

949
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,420
Wait, wait, wait.

950
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,780
I'm an impressionable youth.

951
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,240
Wait, wait, wait.

952
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,960
What's a pencil?

953
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,640
Well, you don't know where the Carlsbad Caverns light switch is.

954
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,820
But I do.

955
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,580
Technically it's not a pencil.

956
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,000
It's just a piece of charcoal.

957
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
It's in Canaan.

958
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,280
Oh, okay.

959
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,860
Wrapped with a tree.

960
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,300
Wrapped with bark.

961
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,540
And you know those caverns communicate with the lost land of Turak, son of stone.

962
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,340
Hey, what if we took these...

963
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,120
Careful, Hal.

964
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,760
These pieces of charcoal wrapped in bark and we actually manufactured them?

965
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,100
They communicate with an Indian that's supposed to be a Mandan but looks like Cochise on a bad TV show?

966
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,680
We could make a zillion dollars.

967
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,660
A zillion and one.

968
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,840
Well, a zillion...

969
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,600
I thought it was a zillion and 53 cents.

970
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,580
Well, I'll round it up.

971
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,680
It's a godzillion.

972
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,700
I don't work for anything less than a zillion.

973
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,560
A zillion and one dollar.

974
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,940
I don't want to deal with these little sins.

975
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,620
Well, aren't you already a zillionaire?

976
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,320
Only in my mind.

977
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,840
But your mind is not your mind.

978
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,260
I know.

979
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:10,700
See, that's the problem.

980
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,560
Your mind...

981
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,660
I don't know where I put it.

982
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,880
I wish I could use it.

983
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,020
But I don't know how to plug it in when it's gone.

984
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,740
Relax.

985
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,300
Unzip your mind and float down the street.

986
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,180
It's not even my mind.

987
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,920
I lost the adapter for mine.

988
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,060
You're on autopilot?

989
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,520
My mind is.

990
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:24,840
Yeah.

991
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,540
Only from the mind of me.

992
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:28,880
I don't know.

993
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,680
I don't know.

994
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:29,780
I don't know.

995
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


996
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


997
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


998
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:29,780


999
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,880
It's the recharger for mine.

1000
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,220
Yeah, that's right.

1001
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,340
The mind of Minolta.

1002
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,020
Like a company can have my mind.

1003
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,500
Get out of my mind.

1004
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,560
Speaking of out of your mind, Dr. Howell, that's a good cue for me to cut to an instrumental

1005
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,180
by the Psychoskeletons called The Space Between Your Ears.

1006
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,960
Because I know your ears need a space break.

1007
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,180
First, I should mention that the song Space...

1008
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:05,920
Space Princess was part of a seven-minute epic jam song from 50 Next Day with Reverend

1009
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,060
Hazel of the Windmills on flute, Reverend Suds Pichon guitar, Princess Pisces singing,

1010
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,300
and I don't know who else, Reverend Angry Larry on bass probably.

1011
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,360
The Dorf Dorf bread commercial preceding my discussion of my great fourth grade teacher,

1012
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,640
Mrs. Anita Neendorf, was by Leemur, as are all of the other collages this show.

1013
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:39,340
Anyway, here's The Space Between Your Ears from the Psychoskeletons, who are on SoundClick.com.

1014
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,100
Thank you.

1015
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,620
Thank you.

1016
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,080
Thank you.

1017
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,400
Thank you.

1018
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,580
Thank you.

1019
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,120
Thank you.

1020
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,880
Thank you, sir.

1021
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:38,880


1022
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,200
Thank you.

1023
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,120
Milo Meillender.

1024
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,040
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1025
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,500
It looks like Michael Pepe's trying to get in.

1026
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,240
What a rowdy fellow he is.

1027
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,500
I don't know why we tolerate this kind of thing.

1028
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,060
Such an unco TVs Joshiwaga- comedy type cookie that doesn't exist anywhere.

1029
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,080
Don't let him eat that burrito.

1030
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,060
He is an oaf.

1031
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,140
Why?

1032
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,920
Why I ought to...

1033
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,620
Swear an oath.

1034
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,420
I'm going to swear an oath.

1035
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,740
Didn't he swear an oath of office?

1036
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,080
We're all going to swear an oath on KPFA 94.1.

1037
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:17,640
Are you planning to release a video of the show last Friday that you sent the still pictures of the...

1038
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,300
Up on YouTube now.

1039
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,880
The bride girl embracing an ecstatic Michael.

1040
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,120
And the end of the fancy space people are already up on YouTube.

1041
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,880
Oh, great.

1042
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,040
The problem is the sound.

1043
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,920
It was so awful.

1044
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:37,520
But I am going to take your three cat poems and mix them with the beautiful little kitties that were running around the edge of the stage.

1045
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,820
Those weren't kitties, Doug.

1046
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,740
Those were young women dressed in cat suits.

1047
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,120
And what they were doing was not just running around.

1048
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,600
Reverend Stang, what did you make of that show?

1049
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,160
Did it seem to be culturally valid to you?

1050
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,060
My favorite part of it was sitting in Philo's car for the last two hours of it.

1051
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,720
Looking at...

1052
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,060
Movies of Harry the Hipster.

1053
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,040
And listening to Acid Car from X-Day 2006.

1054
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,880
Yeah, it's cool when you carry your own videos.

1055
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,160
The sound was better.

1056
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah, the sound was better.

1057
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:15,140
I think if the sound had been better and we'd been sitting down, there was no chairs for people with old bad knees.

1058
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,880
And it was like lounging on the floor was just...

1059
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,300
In Philo's car, there were only two posers.

1060
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:21,980
Yeah.

1061
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,820
I don't know when my X-Day is.

1062
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,720
There were extreme posers.

1063
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,980
July 5th.

1064
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,820
No, that's a subgenius X-Day.

1065
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,000
She's talking about the personal X-Day.

1066
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,160
But isn't your personal X-Day the same as...

1067
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,120
Darling?

1068
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,180
You mean Bob?

1069
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,160
That's between you and Bob.

1070
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,680
Between...

1071
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,920
You can't get to Bob until that X-Day comes.

1072
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,840
It is literally blocking you from Bob.

1073
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,860
And you should thank your lucky stars that that's still true.

1074
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,220
Because you just don't know what's going to happen when X-Day comes down.

1075
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,240
That wall comes down and suddenly there's Bob.

1076
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,540
Rushing towards you.

1077
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,460
Embracing you.

1078
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,680
Enveloping you with that pipe smoke.

1079
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,660
Might be good.

1080
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,320
Might be bad.

1081
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,420
It actually smells good, though.

1082
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,060
But it won't be just a little good.

1083
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,600
Or just a little bad.

1084
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,240
It'll be the extremes of both.

1085
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,540
Or one or the other.

1086
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,100
We just can't know.

1087
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,580
And that's...

1088
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,200
Isn't that the wonderful mystery of it?

1089
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,380
The unknowable...

1090
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,460
That's what keeps us interested.

1091
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,480
Or at least it kept me interested until earlier.

1092
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,460
It's the wonderful mystery of it.

1093
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,720
But what happened a couple of weeks ago to dampen your interest?

1094
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,020
I started...

1095
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,900
I finally got into video games.

1096
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,060
I started playing video games for the first time a few months ago.

1097
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,380
I don't care about Bob or Church's subgenius.

1098
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,180
But you were playing those a year ago.

1099
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,880
No, not really.

1100
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,080
I was just...

1101
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,520
You can play video games and Bob at the same time.

1102
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,500
You know what I did?

1103
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,900
I was so mad because I couldn't play video games,

1104
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,760
I went out and bought a brand new computer.

1105
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
That's actually true.

1106
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,620
Philo...

1107
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,220
Philo...

1108
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,920
Yesterday...

1109
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,580
Was it yesterday?

1110
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,620
Yeah, it was like yesterday.

1111
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,560
It seems like a million years ago.

1112
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,360
It was yesterday.

1113
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,580
I just went out and said,

1114
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,720
I'm going to have that one.

1115
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,500
He had a stack.

1116
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,680
An hour later, I was setting it up.

1117
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,040
He had this giant stack of games

1118
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,000
that he had never really been able to play for years.

1119
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,740
He kept buying them,

1120
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,920
knowing he couldn't play them.

1121
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,240
Finally, he buys the machine that'll play them.

1122
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,280
And for the first time,

1123
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,320
I got to see Dr. Hal's performance in Half-Life.

1124
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,240
Yeah.

1125
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,860
You had lost a lot of weight for that part.

1126
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,900
When you were playing...

1127
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,860
Well, which Half-Life was it?

1128
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,900
Half-Life 2.

1129
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,600
Half-Life 2.

1130
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:28,960
Ah.

1131
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,780
But you're familiar with Half-Life 1, I suppose.

1132
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,360
I never got to play it

1133
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,060
because I never got...

1134
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,760
I never played any video game

1135
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,460
between 1982 or so and this year.

1136
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,240
But I finally discovered why people do that

1137
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,660
because it's extremely addictive escape from the real world.

1138
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,300
In the video game world,

1139
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,960
I'm a rich, rich, powerful,

1140
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,560
powerful, tall, strong warrior.

1141
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,120
I have a question about the Egyptians.

1142
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,440
And Half-Life Hal has a whole giant laboratory in that world.

1143
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,380
Yes, I do.

1144
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,600
And I try to keep it in some order.

1145
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,080
In Grand Theft Auto,

1146
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,140
Philo gets to just run around killing everybody.

1147
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,700
God mode.

1148
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,820
If the...

1149
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,880
I don't think of it as killing, really.

1150
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,820
I think of it as putting them out of their misery.

1151
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,560
You know what's missing from that game,

1152
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,440
Grand Theft Auto,

1153
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,160
this show on the car radio.

1154
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,240
They give you a lot of channels

1155
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,920
that are pretty well put together

1156
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,700
just for the purpose of the game.

1157
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,820
You can make this show be on the radio.

1158
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,260
I've actually done that

1159
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,940
where I've listened to the Puzzling Evidence show

1160
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,600
while playing Grand Theft Auto

1161
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
through the Grand Theft Auto play.

1162
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, that's right.

1163
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,100
You told me you had a mod.

1164
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,660
It was one of those mod...

1165
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,880
No, it comes with the game.

1166
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,580
You can make a reference in the game

1167
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,100
in one of the control files

1168
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,560
so that it will play a directory of MP3 files

1169
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,520
that you've set up.

1170
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,020
That's mysterious.

1171
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,500
The lost children of Babylon.

1172
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,320
What'll they think of next?

1173
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,080
Man, if I was playing Grand Theft Auto

1174
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,400
and listening to this show,

1175
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,760
I'd feel even more like I was on Kweli.

1176
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,480
Would you feel like you were alienated from society

1177
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,420
if you did that?

1178
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,120
No, actually, I'd feel more integrated.

1179
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,840
Like an alien.

1180
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,000
Like I was a normal person.

1181
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,220
I'd be sitting there playing video games

1182
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,900
or watching TV instead of what I normally do.

1183
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,740
Would you hold hands with...

1184
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,760
Which is order padded envelopes

1185
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,400
and compare prices for CDs.

1186
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,760
That's what I do for Bob.

1187
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,100
And that's enough.

1188
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,080
More than anyone should ever be asked to do.

1189
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,200
Yeah, tell me about it.

1190
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,660
Mm-hmm.

1191
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,620
I'm looking at a picture of Bob right now.

1192
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,920
Oh, she's looking at the picture.

1193
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,800
Where's your other hand?

1194
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,060
Are you genuflecting?

1195
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,660
Are you breaking eye contact?

1196
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,740
I hope you genuflect.

1197
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,380
I can't.

1198
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,360
And it's sort of...

1199
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,000
I think it's an overload of being on show

1200
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,980
and looking at Bob.

1201
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,540
You can mentally genuflect.

1202
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,320
Holler, I understand.

1203
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,280
Last time I was on this show,

1204
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,540
I was on a show.

1205
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,840
I did show, too.

1206
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,440
And it was very, very disastrous.

1207
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,720
I'm actually, believe it or not,

1208
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,700
saying no to show this time around.

1209
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,440
At least that particular administration method.

1210
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,420
And hedonic twaddle.

1211
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,540
So, yeah.

1212
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,940
Maybe you just simply need to have it properly injected.

1213
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,840
And that's really between you

1214
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,440
and your version of the deity.

1215
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,420
It needs to be properly packed.

1216
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,400
Maybe your medical professionals...

1217
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,900
The contents may settle.

1218
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,000
It's that old do-do.

1219
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,220
But I'll give you a better dictionary.

1220
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,580
Anyway.

1221
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,900
Should I put down this picture of Bob and inject it?

1222
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,000
Inject an image of Bob?

1223
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,540
There's a good type of people who've injected themselves with Bob.

1224
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,020
Now, you need to be injected by a senior doctor

1225
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,000
in a special fashion, which can be explained by an examination.

1226
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,040
I think you did.

1227
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,900
A caller?

1228
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,700
Do I know you?

1229
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,220
You do know me.

1230
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,720
I've called you many times before.

1231
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,020
Say that again.

1232
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,420
I used to call in all the time.

1233
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,040
Oh.

1234
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,980
I just wondered if I knew you from X days or something.

1235
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,980
Or from another life.

1236
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,740
I thought you might be a friend that I know named Reverend Baby Bear.

1237
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,880
I'm Reverend Baby Bear.

1238
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,720
You are?

1239
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,140
So it is.

1240
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,340
I'm a girl talking.

1241
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,060
Oh, okay.

1242
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,800
There's two girls talking.

1243
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,820
I'm confusing.

1244
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,360
Yeah, this is the show where there's always two girls talking.

1245
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,220
Well, Reverend Baby Bear is often calling.

1246
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,680
Two girls in one show.

1247
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,360
I didn't know that.

1248
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,800
I didn't know that Reverend Baby Bear called and watched.

1249
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,780
She's very active.

1250
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,020
She's active on Scrub Genius.

1251
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,280
I normally don't get up in time to call because it's six in the morning here.

1252
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,240
Yeah, me too.

1253
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,140
That's when I go to bed.

1254
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,540
How do you happen to be up this morning?

1255
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,600
I didn't have to work today, so I decided to wake up and do it.

1256
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,100
That's pretty much my excuse to wake up.

1257
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,900
Wake up and do it.

1258
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,800
That's what we all do here.

1259
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,140
It's hard to stay up.

1260
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,540
Well, do the show.

1261
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,440
It is hard to stay up.

1262
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,920
It's hard to do it.

1263
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,660
It's hard to wake up.

1264
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,660
I literally woke up for a show.

1265
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,380
That's why I haven't called in in a long time.

1266
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,180
I'm sleepy.

1267
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,500
You've got to get some sleep every now and then.

1268
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:57,640
So, wait a minute.

1269
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,160
Are there three girls on the show now?

1270
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,640
Yes.

1271
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,320
Awesome.

1272
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,280
And they're freaking out.

1273
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:07,480
Reverend Baby Bear is heard at the end of almost every, all the new hours of Slack,

1274
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,060
usually right after a cut with G. Gordon Gordon,

1275
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:19,400
because she does the URL and address in this young girl voice.

1276
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,820
And that sounds so nice juxtaposed with G. Gordon Gordon's,

1277
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,620
mechanical, cancer-ravelling.

1278
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,120
Gravelly.

1279
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,600
I agree.

1280
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,500
Haven't you ever heard a man with cancer before?

1281
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,980
I remember that.

1282
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,700
You guys sounded like a...

1283
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,280
Oh, yeah.

1284
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,060
He went around and loaded up the sampler with all these different church slogans.

1285
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,080
The junior sampler.

1286
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,920
Most of the ones that he could think of.

1287
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,940
Some of which, of course, I think quite...

1288
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,720
And then he would lip sync to them, holding the little sampler up to his throat like it was a voice.

1289
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:54,880
Yeah.

1290
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,720
People thought that he really had throat cancer and had to talk through the box.

1291
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,700
Nonsense.

1292
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,960
He just had a case of terminal crustiness.

1293
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,040
One of the precepts he had was his own voice saying,

1294
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,040
What's the matter?

1295
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,280
Haven't you ever heard a man with throat cancer before?

1296
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,940
And he would push the button on the lip sync to it.

1297
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,300
I know.

1298
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,440
It's in a scary place.

1299
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,880
And I later had people say...

1300
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,720
I never saw it before.

1301
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:20,980
What?

1302
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,560
Has G. Gordon Gordon died of his throat cancer yet?

1303
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,440
But it doesn't have a color to it.

1304
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,620
I've read it ten times, but I've died of some kind of cancer.

1305
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,260
Every week I read that I'm dead from some horrible illness.

1306
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,000
Thank God.

1307
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,280
Wishful thinking on an old alt-slack form.

1308
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,540
Yeah, liquids around electronics, not a good idea.

1309
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,820
Try new clean tobacco.

1310
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,460
New because the tobacco is green.

1311
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,980
And the clean tobacco tastes clean.

1312
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,580
Yes, the clean tobacco tastes clean and clean.

1313
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,820
The result is...

1314
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,880
New clean tobacco.

1315
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:04,940
Authorities have exhausted all leads in the apparent heavyset female in western Minnesota.

1316
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:13,840
The Swift County Sheriff's Office says a young heavy female was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and dark pants in an SUV in Appleton about 8 o'clock.

1317
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:20,040
The BCA says a white heavyset female wearing a black hooded sweatshirt got out of the SUV last night.

1318
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,720
Investigators say a heavy female was last seen wearing dark pants on Highway 7.

1319
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,720
The Swift County Sheriff's Office says it has not identified 20-year-old Melvin Jr. of Brooklyn Park.

1320
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,720
Two officers wearing black hooded pants had run out of the store through a rear entrance.

1321
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,360
At least one of the officers shot American Crystal Sugar workers.

1322
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,780
Dan Gunderson reports.

1323
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,440
1,300 workers for about 18 months.

1324
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,300
Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too, though?

1325
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,440
I was a pepper.

1326
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:47,740
I like coffee.

1327
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,000
I was a pepper for the FBI.

1328
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,520
Dr. Pepper.

1329
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,360
Yes.

1330
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,140
I like to chew.

1331
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,760
I was a pepper.

1332
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,380
I'm a pepper.

1333
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,060
You're a pepper.

1334
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,820
If I was a pepper, I'd have a mobile living room that I could drive around in the desert.

1335
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,060
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1336
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:11,100
Actually, Pepper just put up a picture of himself in like 75 or 72 on the mobile living room.

1337
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,480
No, long before that.

1338
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,060
He has some kind of a VW camper.

1339
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,180
And he has very, very long hair.

1340
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,100
I'm figuring the baby Pepper probably had real long hair.

1341
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,260
That's what I figured.

1342
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:23,720
Yeah.

1343
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,900
Now we're swimming around in your mind.

1344
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,980
It feels gross, don't it?

1345
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,520
More of that puzzling evidence show from February 15th next week.

1346
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,140
Thanks, Puz and Hal and Phyla and callers, including Reverend Baby Bear.

1347
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:48,360
What I'm going to play to close out the show may seem old to the young, but it's new to the old.

1348
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,120
A rapper that my son told me about by the name of Macklemore.

1349
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,220


1350
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,080
Macklemore.

1351
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,320


1352
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,820
Macklemore.

1353
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:54,880
Macklemore.

1354
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1355
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1356
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1357
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1358
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1359
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1360
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1361
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1362
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1363
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1364
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1365
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:54,880


1366
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,060
It's really old if you're especially young.

1367
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,260
Obviously, to me, 2001 is still the future.

1368
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,660
Anyway, here's a song by Macklemore called American.

1369
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,060
How y'all doing there, folks?

1370
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,620
My name is Aberdeen, Washington.

1371
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,260
And I'm a proud American and a terrorist fighter.

1372
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:17,920
That's right.

1373
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,760
Hey, give me another beer, bitch.

1374
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,560
Now with the day been light and it comes to town,

1375
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,620
I'ma drop a deuce, wipe it up with this towel

1376
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,540
I'm on my lawn, sit on the couch

1377
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,960
I'ma watch some football

1378
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,420
I pray to the Lord the cowboys win

1379
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,640
Beat the hell out of them damn redskins

1380
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,480
Call up the boys, get drunk as shit

1381
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,060
Goddamn right, I'm American

1382
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,820
That's right, I'm American

1383
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,360
Got a picture of Reagan above my fire

1384
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,380
Next to the deer, I shot with my rifle

1385
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,300
An RA, hell yeah, I support him

1386
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,220
No pro choice, no abortion

1387
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,540
Mexicans, send em back over the border

1388
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,280
Right on home to Samoa

1389
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,120
Wherever they come from, they takin' our jobs

1390
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,300
Eatin' our hamburgers, takin' our jobs

1391
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,200
They takin' our jobs

1392
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,160
I see em in the field, I'm takin' their head off

1393
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,100
I hate my job and I hate my boss

1394
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,180
But I love my country

1395
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,360
And I pray to God that the cowboys win

1396
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,660
Fuck yeah, Romo

1397
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,920
And the cowboys win

1398
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,220
That's right, that's right, that's right, come on

1399
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,260
Everybody, just clap your hands

1400
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,620
If you love our country

1401
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,460
If you love our land, that's right

1402
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,440
And if you're not clapping your hands

1403
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,200
You're a terrorist and you eat sand

1404
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:33,780
Sandwiches

1405
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,940
The day be loud and comes to town

1406
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,960
I'ma drop a deuce, wipe my poop with a staff

1407
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,900
Roll my lawn, sit on the couch

1408
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,300
And I'ma watch some football

1409
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,820
And I pray to the Lord the cowboys win

1410
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,060
And beat the hell out of them damn redskins

1411
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,860
Cause the boys can drunk as shit

1412
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,580
Goddamn right, I'm a marathon

1413
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,180
I'm a can

1414
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,040
I'm a marathon can

1415
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,860
I'm John McCain and Sarah Palin

1416
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,460
I know you lost out there

1417
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,960
It was a tough one

1418
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,200
There's still two Mavericks in my book, don't worry about it

1419
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,980
Now listen, paper

1420
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,480
I heard you like beer

1421
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,420
Me too

1422
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,240
I don't have a six pack, but I got a beer bong on my pants

1423
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,620
What do you say we go get shit-faced in a helicopter and kill a moose?

1424
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,180
America, the chosen

1425
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,840
Guns, explosions

1426
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,020
McDonald's, bowling

1427
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,560
You'll see

1428
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:19,560


1429
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,060
You don't like it?

1430
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,080
We exploit shit

1431
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,920
Pop a pill

1432
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,060
Get a boner

1433
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,900
Hell yeah

1434
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,100
Tony Romo

1435
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,440
And a guy so damn cute

1436
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,580
I wanna sack his boner

1437
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,400
And ride him broke back

1438
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,500
All the way to Wyoming

1439
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,500
No homo

1440
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:33,840
Psych

1441
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,240
Hey, I said no homo

1442
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,600
Hey, fuck terrorists

1443
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,980
I mean like

1444
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,820
I don't wanna fuck a terrorist

1445
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,740
Guys, I'm kidding

1446
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,400
I like Romo

1447
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,980
I don't like Romo

1448
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,560
I said fuck terrorists

1449
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,540
Fuck terrorists

1450
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,800
Not I wanna fuck a terrorist

1451
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,400
You wouldn't

1452
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,600
If you caught Bin Laden

1453
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,200
You wouldn't give him one in the butt

1454
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,360
For America

1455
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,060
If you said no homo

1456
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,260
Right after you did it

1457
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,860
It doesn't count if it's terrorists

1458
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,920
Hey, little Aberdeen

1459
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,620
Come in here

1460
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,760
Hey, come see the National Family Anthem

1461
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,180
Come on

1462
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,760
USA

1463
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,520
USA

1464
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,220
USA

1465
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,280
USA

1466
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,760
USA

1467
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,940
USA

1468
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,140
USA

1469
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,800
USA

1470
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,720
Hey hey

1471
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,480
USA

1472
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,740
USA

1473
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:32,560
Hey hey

1474
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,760
That's right

1475
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,400
I'm an American citizen

1476
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,900
Aberdeen, Washington

1477
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,160
This is my country

1478
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,380
And just because Barack Obama won the presidential election

1479
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,560
Does not mean colors are supposed to be the same

1480
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,120
That half the country doesn't feel the same way I do

1481
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,840
And I came to America, yeah

1482
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,020
And I live in America, come on

1483
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,340
And I live in America

1484
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,520
I did too, Dad, let me get up

1485
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,960
And I live in America, Dad

1486
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,080
And I live in America

1487
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,680
Shut up!

1488
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,280
Little Abbey, shut the fuck up!

1489
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,840
My bad

1490
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,000
Let me tell them

1491
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,760
That's right, I'm American

1492
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:24,700

Praise Bob

1498
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,180
For Sire, there is no more money

1499
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,620
We gotta get some money

1500
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,840
That dirty Turkish harker back

1501
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,800
Flackin' Wharton

1502
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,840
Phillip Buckaburton

1503
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,060
Perkaluma Burton

1504
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,120
Don't you watch tonight

1505
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,340
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1506
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,740
And we're even more glad that some listeners

1507
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,520
Have donated enough to help us

1508
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:15,740
Keep going

1509
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,600
For another couple of months

1510
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,460
Not just this show

1511
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,140
But Subgenius.com

1512
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,780
And all the other archive sites

1513
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,220
But if you truly love Bob

1514
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,100
And want some of that Slack back

1515
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,780
To rebound to you

1516
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,160
You should go to

1517
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,580
Subgenius.com

1518
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,220
Front page, or especially the radio page

1519
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,260
Or the catalog store pages

1520
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,440
And help out financially

1521
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,600
As best you can

1522
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,080
Now, we know what it's like

1523
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,960
To be on the brink of total poverty

1524
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,740
And we don't care about it

1525
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,980
We just want any subgeniuses

1526
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,620
To make their own situations worse

1527
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,560
But some of you still have jobs

1528
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,860
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1529
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,880
Even if it's only once a month

1530
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,460
From enough of you

1531
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,880
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference

1532
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,180
All we're saying is that

1533
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,560
Blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1534
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,680
If you don't pay Dobbs

1535
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,880
We also take checks and money orders

1536
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,140

1537
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:20,460

01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:51,940
It's just five clicks

1544
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,920

But there's more

1549
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,240
And everyone is spending

1550
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:56,460
Quite a little money

1551
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,480
