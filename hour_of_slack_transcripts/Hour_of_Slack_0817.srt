1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
The revolution begins immediately!

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,120
And welcome, dear friends, to the Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,940
Praise Bob!

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,940
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,880
Wake up, puppet boy!

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:48,920
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,720
There is absolutely no other possibility.

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:24,680
The Hour of Slack

9
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, this is a motel.

10
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,080
I'm a cop, you idiot! I'm Detective John Kimball.

11
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,960
Well, if you're a cop, you idiot, come over here and talk to me, okay?

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,740
You son of a bitch!

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,060
And I don't know what he does. This is a switchboard at the Gator Lodge.

14
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,020
Stop it!

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,280
I don't stop nothing, you idiot!

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,240
Stop it!

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:45,980
Hi.

18
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,320
You son of a bitch!

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,440
How are you?

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm alright. Who do you want to speak with?

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,140
I'm Detective John Kimball.

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,620
Charles Kimball?

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,240
Yes.

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,400
This is Cotton's Barbecue.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Ice for Charles Kimball?

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,540
Yeah.

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,680
Ice for somebody named Charles Kimball.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,200
Charles Kimball.

29
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,480
Um, sir, could you describe Charles Kimball?

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,020
Yes.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,200
Could you tell me how Mr. Kimball looks?

32
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm Detective John Kimball.

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,180
Detective?

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,320
Oh, he's a Detective John Kimball.

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,740
Hey, I'm a police officer.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,920
Oh.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm a cop, you idiot!

38
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,280
I'm Detective John Kimball.

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,920
Um, excuse me, um, sir, but this is Cotton's Barbecue.

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,700
This is not a police station.

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,980
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!

42
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:48,780
Well, now, you keep talking about this Bob, and I've seen pictures of him, certainly a lot of drawings of him, and yet I've never heard, you sent me several of the books and the tapes and stuff over the years.

43
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,360
I've never actually heard Bob's voice. I've never seen a photograph of him, as I know.

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:54,920
Well, Bob...

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:03,940
I've seen plenty of photographs of him. You pick up any old, uh, Better Homes and Gardens, Popular Science, from the 50s and early 60s, uh, Bob modeled for ads.

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:17,720
He's that guy with the pipe, the, the grinning, sort of a Ward Cleaver-ish, Dick Van Dyke-looking fellow with this sort of slightly crazed grin, and he's, and he's got a pipe.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,180
You may have seen pictures of him spray-painted on bridge abutments and, and, uh, uh, dumpsters and so forth.

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:33,400
And tattooed on, uh, foreheads and hands, and branded on backs, and in, uh, brain pants.

49
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,040
Ah, yes, we have a theme show tonight.

50
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:48,180
Sex and War are our themes, the scariest things of all in the primate world!

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Ah!

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,860
Ah!

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,760

00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,380
Ah!

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:54,680
Ah!

59
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,940
Ah!

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,520
Ah!

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,960

struggling to keep their self respect in this climate of misogyny,

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
money worship,

68
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,840
and mass production of period.

Your revolution will not involve me

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,680
Filling your nature rise

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,940
Or helping you fantasize

89
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,200
Because that revolution will not happen

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200

Your revolution will not make you feel

94
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,400
Bombastic and really fantastic

95
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,460
And have you groping in the dark

96
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,960
For that rubber wrapped in plastic

97
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,480
You will not be touching your lips

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,940
To my triple dip of French vanilla

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,760
Butter pecan chocolate deluxe

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,480
Or having Aganelli's dream

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,340
A six foot blowjob machine

102
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,940
You wanna subjugate your queen

103
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,260
Think I'ma put it in my mouth

104
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,920
Just cause you made a few bucks

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,420
Please brother please

106
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,800
Your revolution will not be me

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,820
Tossing my weave and making believe

108
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,940
I'm some caviar eating ghetto mafia clown

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Or me giving up my life

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
I'm behind just so I can get signed

111
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,480
And maybe have somebody else write my rhymes

112
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm Sarah Jones not Foxy Brown

113
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,400
You know I'm Sarah Jones

114
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,860
I'm Sarah Jones not Foxy Brown

115
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,720
And your revolution makes me wonder

116
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,100
Where could we go

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,360
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and the ego

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,660
We'd revolt back to our roots

119
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,860
Use a little common sense

120
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,000
On a quest to make love de la soul

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,140
No pretense

122
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,420
But your revolution will not be you

123
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,120
Flexing your little sex

124
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,940
And status

125
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:12,940


126
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:12,940


127
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:12,940


128
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,580
To express what you feel

129
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,640
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs

130
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,220
Will not happen between these thighs

131
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,860
Will not be you shaking and me

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,420
Faking between these thighs

133
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,980
Because the real revolution

134
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,120
That's right

135
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,680
I said the real revolution

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,980
You know I'm talking about the revolution

137
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,940
When it comes

138
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,540
It's gonna be real

139
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,840
It's gonna be real

140
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,200
It's gonna be real

141
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,100
When it finally comes

142
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,800
That's right

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,920
When it finally comes

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,220
It's gonna be real

145
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
Yeah yeah

146
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,120
Yeah yeah

147
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,600
I guess that's what it's like

148
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,620
Ah that was Sarah

149
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:22,020
Jones, Sarah Jones with DJ Vadim, posted to alt.binaries.slack by Sister Deck.

150
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,840
Sexy.

151
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,420
But to counterbalance that with an ode to subgenius-style bonobo yeti sex,

152
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,760
who better than unsaved superstar James Kochalka?

153
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,260
You've got to talk to the wookie, talk to the walking, talk to the wookie.

154
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,480
Talk to her.

Talk to her.

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,820
The wookie is hairy, ugly, and scary, but she is a nice girl.

158
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,680
The wookie is hairy, ugly, and scary, but she will rock your world.

159
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,420
You've got to talk to the wookie, talk to the wookie.

164
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,240


165
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,240


166
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,320
Talk to the Wookie.

167
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,300
She'll never forget you.

168
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,380
You'll never forget her fine.

169
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,260
You gotta talk to the Wookie.

170
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,180
Talk to the Wookie.

171
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,700
Talk to the Wookie.

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,180
You gotta talk to the Wookie.

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,980
Talk to the Wookiee, talk to the Wookiee, talk to her.

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,300
The Wookiee is hairy, ugly, and scary, but she is a nice girl.

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,380
The Wookiee is hairy, ugly, and scary, but she will rock your world.

You got to talk to the Wookiee, talk to the Wookiee, talk to the Wookiee, just talk to her.

179
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,800
Let me give you a hand with that.

180
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, boy. That tickles.

181
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,900
Oh, yeah, right there.

182
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,240
Oh, I say, do that again.

183
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,400
Friends, remember Women of Sodom?

184
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,620
Well, the Countess, formerly of that group, has this concept band,

185
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:08,980
and a new CD with this hate-filled parody rock opera called Shooting Star,

186
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,880
which is great, and I've got bits of it to play here.

187
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,520
So let's, with the Countess and Shooting Star,

188
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,960
let us go behind the glamorous superstar scenes.

189
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,680
16.01.

190
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,100
16.01.

191
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,600
16.01.

192
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,180
You expressly acknowledge that your and the artist's services hereunder

193
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,680
are of a special, unique, intellectual, and extraordinary character,

194
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
which gives them peculiar value,

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,040
and that in the event of a breach by you or the artist of any term hereof,

196
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,840
company will be caused irreparable injury,

197
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,320
which cannot adequately be compensated by money damages.

198
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Accordingly, company shall be entitled to injunctive relief,

199
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,960
in addition to any other rights or remedies which company may have.

200
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,460
Company shall be made happy.

201
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,580
To enforce the terms of this agreement.

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Proceeding sentence shall not be construed.

203
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,380
We will clean the artists from opposing any application from such relief

204
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,480
based upon contest and other facts alleged by company in support of such application.

205
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,360
Please place your order.

206
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,180
We are stretched.

207
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,180


208
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,240


209
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,340


210
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,380


211
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,300
Dr.

212
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,740
Professor Letsits say who you are.

213
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,080
Too much fame without shame.

214
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,700
Everybody knows you're missing.

00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,360

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Thank you.

Thank you.

229
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,300
Thank you.

230
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,340
Thank you.

231
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,180
Thank you.

232
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,980
Thank you.

233
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,560
Thank you all for sitting here tonight.

234
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:57,740
Thank you.

235
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,320
Thank you.

236
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,420
Thank you.

237
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,420


238
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,420


239
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,420


240
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,420


241
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,420


242
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,880
And people who blew their minds.

243
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,840
What is wrong with this picture?

244
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,360
That is crime.

245
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,980
And crime must be dealt with forcefully.

246
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,720
Law and order have broken down.

247
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,060
The CDs are burning.

248
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,660
Burn, baby, burn.

249
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,560
Burn, baby, burn.

250
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,420
Get down and kick out the jams, all the jams.

251
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,620
Remember, once the volume control is set, do not readjust.

252
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,000
It is important that the sound level remain the same

253
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,400
and that the sound level remain the same.

254
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,620
All of the people listening should be seated approximately six to eight feet from the speaker.

255
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,560
If the music you hear sounds a little peculiar, do not readjust.

256
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
It is important that the sound level remain the same.

257
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,880
With this record, I have provided you with a weapon that will destroy the monster.

258
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,300
For the love of God.

259
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,760
For the love of God.

260
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,180
Get a copy of it into every American home.

261
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,860
Service.

262
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,800
Noise.

263
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,860
Is the main weapon of our attack.

264
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,760
Get down and kick out the jams, all the jams.

265
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,140
Get down and get down and get down and kick out the jams.

266
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,520
Rock music just airs us and excites us.

267
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,040
And may I say right at this point,

268
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,060
the same beat produces the same evil inclinations.

269
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,020
Even if we tie the word, kick out the jams to it.

270
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,500
And I can teach it to you.

271
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,860
.

272
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:10,860


273
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,200

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,900

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,500


291
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,500


292
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,580
.

293
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:27,580


294
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:27,820
.

295
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:27,820


296
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:27,820


297
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,800
You really just gotta live on me.

298
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,500
Like a plague, it spreads.

299
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,740
It's an obvious documentation.

300
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,520
It's an obvious documentation.

301
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,700
It's what the newscasts do every night.

302
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,700
It's called a soundbite.

303
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,180
I mean, it's letting people know what happened.

304
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,760
Surface noise.

305
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,920
This powerful process of duplication

306
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,500
can be used to duplicate literally anything

307
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,000
so that you can use those strategies

308
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,340
to create what you want.

309
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,580
Repping off the old masters,

310
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,500
but all in a good cause.

311
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,160
Horror Fu

312
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
Horror Fu

313
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,280
Horror Fu

314
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:16,380
Horror Fu

315
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,180
Horror Fu

316
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,320
Horror Fu

317
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,360
Horror Fu

318
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,400
Horror Fu

319
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,480
Exactly!

320
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,600
Exactly, they're ripping off the fucking people.

321
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,760
And we have a right to fucking appropriate.

322
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
That is fucking bullshit.

323
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,980
You are nothing but a fucking,

324
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,080
wholesome, fucking kleptomania,

325
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,160
fucking moron.

326
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,000
Fuck!

327
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,960
Fuck!

328
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,800
Uh, Surface Noise, friends.

329
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,000
That amazing collage was Surface Noise

330
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,420
from their CD, Copycat Suicide.

331
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,880
Surface Noise is,

332
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
here's their information.

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,540
And the Countess, Shooting Star,

341
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,720
friends, just amazing.

342
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,160
The Countess is Cynthia von Buehler

343
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,240
of Boston,

344
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,620
and there's an order form

345
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,200
for the Shooting Star thing

346
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,840

And now,

355
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,500
a break from the theme, friends,

356
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,100
with a little bit of educational material

357
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,760
from Dr. Howell

358
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,100
of the,

359
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,760
the KPFA

360
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,820
Berkeley subgenius show.

361
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,340
Let us consider the affliction of tarantism,

362
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,660
that mysterious dance

363
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,340
thought to originate in the bite

364
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,940
of a venomous spider.

365
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,700
Legend, if not history,

366
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,480
identifies this spider

367
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,200
as the European tarantula,

368
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Lycosa tarantula.

369
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,740
It was said that after having been bitten,

370
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,380
the only thing the victim could do

371
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,000
would be dance around it.

372
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,300
And soon these dances,

373
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,780
these spider dances,

374
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,820
or the tarantella,

375
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,740
as they were called,

376
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,980
became all the fashion,

377
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,820
and the church had to denounce them

378
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,900
for the lascivious sexual excesses

379
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,540
and groovy raves

380
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,500
that they were having,

381
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,620
flinging their bodies around

382
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,820
in empty mantles,

383
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,500
you know,

384
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,160
to alleviate the spider

385
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,820
tingling.

386
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,700
But,

387
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,540
the fact is the European tarantula

388
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,000
does not cause these symptoms.

389
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,500
However,

390
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,940
people who are stung by scorpions

391
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,020
in the southwest

392
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,140
often are unable to keep still.

393
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,160
They have to fling their bodies

394
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,380
back and forth.

395
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,300
Is this not similar to the

396
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,040
tarantism?

397
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,100
Yes, it is.

398
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,860
And in fact,

399
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,180
the difficulty was

400
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,300
the identification of the wrong spider.

401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,560
The phone only takes messages

402
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,120
which cannot be answered.

403
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,860
Please leave a message.

404
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:21,900
Thank you.

405
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,160
All of northern central California

406
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,440
can now leave a message

407
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,720
by calling 848-4425

408
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,140
and the 510 area code.

409
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,280
Get on the radio with us

410
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,300

411
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,240

because we want you

413
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,100
to call us on the radio.

414
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,600
So you can

415
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,860
read.

416
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,540
Man.

417
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,600
Yeah.

418
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,840
We're walking around.

419
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,000
Hey, you know,

420
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,660
we're really pretty gnarly dudes

421
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,540
but we're

422
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,920
trucking around

423
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,460
the man

424
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,740
reporting on the sites

425
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,960
drinking lemonade

426
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,400
out of a big plastic jar

427
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,600
and eating leaky

428
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,720
fruit gel cups.

429
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,900
And now,

430
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,780
let us speak of a certain spider

431
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,280
which once spun a web

432
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,080
in a garden in Provence

433
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
in 1870.

434
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,240
You don't do that.

435
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,500
This one is a matron.

436
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,600
She dates back to the year before

437
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,740
1869.

438
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,920
Her majestic corpulence,

439
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,160
so exceptional at the season of July,

440
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,020
proclaims the fact.

441
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,580
We know her as the angular epiphyllum

442
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,700
here, Araneus Angulatus.

443
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,120
She has taken up her abode

444
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,480
at a convenient height

445
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,080
for observation

446
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,620
between a row of cypress trees

447
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,060
and a clump of laurels

448
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,560
near the entrance

449
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,480
to an alley haunted

450
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,580
by moths.

451
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,040
The spot appears well chosen

452
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,640
for the epiphyllum does not change

453
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,140
it throughout the season

454
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,560
though she renews her net

455
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,320
almost every night.

456
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,180
Punctually, as darkness

457
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,580
falls,

458
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,700
our whole family

459
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,520
goes and calls upon her.

460
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,180
We stand amazed

461
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,740
at her wealth of belly

462
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,220
and her exuberant somersaults

463
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,860
in the maze of quivering ropes.

464
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,340
We admire the faultless geometry

465
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,360
of the set

466
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,540
as it gradually takes shape.

467
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,220
All agleam in the lantern light

468
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,400
the work becomes a fairy orb

469
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,620
which seems

470
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,020
woven of moonbeams.

471
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,980
What delightful

472
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,880
simple evenings we have spent

473
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,580
looking at the moonbeams.

474
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,400
Looking into the spiders workshop.

475
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,500
The

476
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,580
spirit is so pure

477
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,200
and you are never wrong.

478
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,400
Please sir,

479
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,240
I've got to see the wizard.

480
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,620
The good witch of the north sent me.

481
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,780
Prove it.

482
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,860
You wonderful prat S Around my juniorander I

483
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,220

The book eating öğrenzek

485
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,680
He is a boy

486
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,680


487
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,980
Enthusiastic

488
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:58,980


489
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,080
and my abused

490
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,080

00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,080


492
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,100
famous

493
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,100


494
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,100


495
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,100


496
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:35,520
A treatment of children by yours truly.

497
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:43,460
But now, an example of the weird treats to be found at Dictionariochi.org.

498
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Dictionariochi.org.

499
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,620
This one by someone called Stop the Children.

500
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,420
We don't need no education.

501
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:05,820
Education.

502
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,840
We don't need no thought control.

503
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,080
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.

504
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,280
Teacher, leave them kids alone.

505
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,820
Hey.

506
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,260
Teacher.

507
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,760
Leave them kids alone.

508
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
All in all.

509
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,520
It's just another Britain the wall.

510
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,040
All in all.

511
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,340
You're just another Britain the wall.

512
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,500
All in all.

513
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,500


514
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,500


515
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,500


516
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,500


517
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,700
Five, five, three, two, one.

518
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
This is a world destruction.

519
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,420
Your life ain't nothing.

520
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,660
The human race is becoming a disgrace.

521
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,360
Countries are fighting in chemical warfare.

522
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,740
Giving a damn of the people who live there.

523
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,560
Not your dumbest predicted coming of the Antichrist.

524
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,740
Hey, look out!

525
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,760
The Dalai Lama nations are on the rise.

526
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,220
A democratic communist relationship.

527
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,420
We're standing in the way of the Islamic force.

528
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,760
The CIA.

529
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,040
The CIA is looking for other tactics.

530
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,680
The KGB is swarming.

531
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,000
The brainwashed mentality is to control the system.

532
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,820
Using TV and movies.

533
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,300
Religions and course.

534
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,760
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.

535
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,360
Is it nuclear war?

536
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,300
What are you asking for?

537
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,620
The world is headed for destruction.

538
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:42,620


539
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,880
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

540
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,520
This is a world destruction.

541
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,860
Your life ain't nothing.

542
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,000
The human race is becoming a disgrace.

543
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,820
The rich get richer.

544
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,640
The poor are getting poorer.

545
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,040
Fascist chauvinistic government fools.

546
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,480
People like the Muslims, Christians and Hindus.

547
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,660
Are in a time of suicide.

548
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,980
Searching for the truth.

549
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,960
Who are you to think you're a superior race?

550
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,720
Racing for your everlasting doom.

551
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,820
We are time zone.

552
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,760
We come to take the bomb on you.

553
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,980
Fight for destruction.

554
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,960
Kaboom! Kaboom! Kaboom!

555
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
Come along.

556
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,980
Oh God, I lied.

557
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,320
I have a movements.

558
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,360
Karmoh did you hear someone?

559
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,960
My brain is in battle.

560
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,420
I can't awesome.

561
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,000
My man the revolution is going to be televised.

562
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,520
On the internet man.

563
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,200
Maybe that's what happened convert.

564
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,040
Maybe thats what's finally happening.

565
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,540
They're coming.

566
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,660
They're just zapping cities left and right.

567
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,140
It's like you humans are too damn stupid.

568
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,540
Well, it could be.

569
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,660
There ain't nothing worth saving in that crap.

570
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,220
It's the Harry Potter reference that we were talking about.

571
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,640
It could be Harry Pooper or the Rockefellers of the CFR exploding us with nuclear mushrooms behind our backbones.

572
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,400
You know, the kind we can't see.

573
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,040
It's all of those things and so much, much more, dear friend.

574
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,600
Well, thank goodness that the magic is, you know, keeping the noose at bay.

575
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,400
Did you say Frank goodness or?

576
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,020
Frank goodness.

577
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,500
Yes.

578
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,420
He's the one actually in charge of keeping the nuclear bomb exploding.

579
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,780
I see.

580
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,840
That guy is a jerk.

581
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,460
Have you ever tried to get in touch with him close to anybody's lunch hour?

582
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,140
He's either a jerk or he's goodness personified.

583
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:53,320
If they're not sure if his name was really, you know, goodness because that's what he was or is,

584
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,780
or if that's, you know, a name he just gave himself.

585
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,020
Well, that doesn't explain his rubber pants, you know, or any of those pictures.

586
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,380
Really?

587
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,380
I was wearing those rubber pants for as far back as anybody can remember.

588
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,940
But remember, they're thick, insulating rubber pants.

589
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,760
Well, right.

590
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
Because people are always trying to shock him.

591
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,140
Right.

592
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,620
And he's, yeah.

593
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,940
And, and, and, uh.

594
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,100
Just a self-defense, you know.

595
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,940
I mean, this is, let's face it.

596
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,260
This has never, ever been discussed by anyone ever.

597
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,380
But why, why don't they replace him?

598
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,640
At least he is old, you know.

599
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,540
At least he's, I mean, I think he's at least a thousand years old now.

600
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,240
Well, yeah, yeah.

601
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,000
But, you know, face it.

602
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,420
I mean, we're talking about this, this on the.

603
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,320
On the radio right now for the first time ever.

604
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,720
Uh-huh.

605
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,980
And, and, and, in fact, we're having.

606
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,720
In the words.

607
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,780
I didn't even know you knew about this, right?

608
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,480
In the words, gone as soon as you hear them.

609
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,500
Exactly.

610
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,980
That's the amazing thing about this media.

611
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,560
This is, no, but, you know, I mean.

612
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:48,840
Gone.

613
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,040
You're writing about conspiracies and stuff.

614
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,720
As soon as you hear it.

615
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,280
Right.

616
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,620
This is, this is.

617
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,180
Calhounka County Emergency Services, C-COMS, conducting weekly emergency alert system tests.

618
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,560
Repeating.

619
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,400
Calhounka County Emergency Services, C-COMS, conducting weekly emergency alert system tests.

620
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,740
Tests completed at.

621
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,780
Oh, 100 hours.

622
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,680
December 7th.

623
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,000
What the hell is going on in this?

624
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,660
An alert has been received.

625
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,360
Alert.

626
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,900
The civil authorities have issued a civil emergency.

627
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,560
Message.

628
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,440
But it doesn't say what it is.

629
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,260
You don't need to know.

630
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,520
Are you sure that's not, not just.

631
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,340
Look, turn your lights off.

632
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
Cover your windows.

633
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,000
Everybody, you have to turn your lights off.

634
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,920
I'm not kidding you.

635
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,560
There has been an alert received here.

636
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,100
In your homes.

637
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,000
No, it's probably.

638
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,300
Are we getting some nasty weather?

639
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,860
But I don't know.

640
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,400
If anything else comes through.

641
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,340
This is the only message I've received.

642
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,080
Maybe the people sending this message.

643
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,780
Have been.

644
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,740
They're already gone.

645
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,180
They're gone.

646
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,720
Yeah.

647
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,840
In a matter of moments.

648
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,180
The next war will be fought with sticks.

649
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,640
Oh, Dave.

650
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,800
I forgot about you.

651
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,080
No, I'm just telling you guys.

652
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,560
I had this weird dream last night.

653
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,100
When I got up.

654
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,700
I had this weird dream.

655
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,580
It's a world's ending.

656
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,200
I was not supposed to go to Rhodes Tower tonight.

657
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,040
And that somehow my car would get sick on me.

658
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,880
We should say that.

659
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,540
You should scan this and put it in the.

660
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,220
Put it up on the website.

661
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:28,980
With the big mustache.

662
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,440
Look, it isn't perfect.

663
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,160
How it travels.

664
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,660
Trails off.

665
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,700
Yeah.

666
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,580
That's scary.

667
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,780
On AMWCS.

668
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,520
Is that really happening?

669
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,520
Yes.

670
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,180
This can't do something with it.

671
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,540
Narrow strip of paper.

672
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,280
I missed a very exciting moment.

673
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,520
Came reading out from the machinery here.

674
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,620
That this is, I guess, part of the civil defense alert system.

675
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,880
I mean, I did hear the zipping.

676
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,340
And I wondered where it was coming from.

677
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,480
My forehead or perhaps in the studio there on the other end of your line.

678
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,640
You're just worried the next day may come.

679
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,960
When they least expect it.

680
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,040
So they're trying to get ready.

681
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,940
It will come in an hour that you know not my friend.

682
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,620
Well, I got Chino.

683
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,840
We actually heard it.

684
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,240
Flashing rapists in the night.

685
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,080
You tied your shoes this morning, The Undertaker.

686
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,340
My tie in tonight.

687
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,760
You believe the weapon was effective?

688
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,640
Can't tell there's too much smoke.

689
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,400
Now a new sound drifted in the soft evening sky.

690
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,300
For Colonel Dan Butterfield, a courageous and able soldier, was also a man of music.

691
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,640
To honor his fallen comrades, he had composed a simple and heart-rending melody.

692
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,360
On July 2nd, in the year of 1862,

693
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,120
its strains floated over the graves that scarred the dark Virginia earth.

694
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,880
It has been more than a hundred years since that sound was born,

695
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,280
but those notes have never died away.

696
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,340
Every night of the year, throughout the world,

697
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,940
fighting men of America from the North and the South, East and the West,

698
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,940
close their eyes and sleep to its call.

699
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,920
And in each of their hearts, there glows a fierce surge of pride.

700
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,180
And they beat the poor little warlike people

701
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,280
and bring peace forever and ever, just like real life.

702
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,140
But then the evil art dictators come.

703
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,160
The art bombs have finally taken power in the far future

704
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,880
and they object to the firing of the space gun.

705
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,940
They incite an unruly mob to come forward and smash the space gun.

706
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,580
But it fires anyway,

707
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,520
shooting a young, comely pair of youths into space.

708
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,960
Male and female,

709
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,620
seeding the cosmos,

710
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,300
they seeded earth

711
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,540
to the Indians for $24.

712
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,060
It was a mystery.

713
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,120
A mystery wrapped in an enigma.

714
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,640
Surrounded with creamy milk chocolate

715
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,060
and velvety nougat.

716
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,600
And little rice crispy things.

717
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,820
They didn't actually have a name.

718
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,620
But they called it...

719
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,040
a

720
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:48,380
your safety list please correct all statement and questions to my attorney I request that my attorney he present before any search on this vehicle or my

721
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,060
person is conducted.

722
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,600
Who is arrested?

723
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,280
Do not surrender any of my constitutional rights except on the advice of my attorney.

724
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:54,780
Without

725
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,340
unless everyone sinon fundamentalists share the database It should act.

726
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,600
advise you of that fact. If this is the case, please notify a police supervisor, as I request

727
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,360
his presence at this location. If you give me a lawful order, I will repeat it back to

728
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,840
you before performance, solely to ensure I both understand and fully comply with that

729
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,840
order. Once you have issued me an order, I have repeated it back to you and complied

730
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,260
with it. I will not perform any further action until you have given me a subsequent order,

731
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,440
or released me from your command. If I am, or am becoming, physically incapacitated,

732
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,900
or I am unable to comply with your order for any reason, I will inform you immediately.

733
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,140
If you wish me to repeat these instructions, please ask me now, and I will do so.

734
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:40,700
Lions and tigers and bears! Oh my! Lions and tigers and bears! Oh my!

735
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:53,260
I'll tell you what I think. The future is in the sink.

736
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,300
Don't eat.

737
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,620
No plunger.

738
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,100
Going down.

739
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,060
And under.

740
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,620
Oh my! Me bop.

741
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:20,800
Trip.

742
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,160
My hip hop.

743
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,800
And what not.

744
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,980
Good idea, really!

745
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:33,980


746
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:33,980


747
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:33,980


748
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:33,980


749
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,520
And what you got?

750
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,020
Did you read all the infos?

751
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,760
What love is to me?

752
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,180
Is all of the information you need?

753
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,120
The answer is

754
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,120


755
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,260
Well enjoy the movie.

756
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,080
.

757
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,320
Yes.

758
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,320


759
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,320


760
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,120
that is relevant

761
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,420
to the common man

762
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,860
it's seldom mentioned

763
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,060
of course we're talking about

764
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,440
the missing link

765
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,380
and the alien experimentation

766
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,240
oh my people

767
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,260
I'm not about one night

768
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,140
oh my people

769
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,420
I'm not about one night

770
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,080
talking about

771
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,920
the death of the ape man

772
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,500
the genetic splicing

773
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,880
was so enticing

774
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,280
well what do you think

775
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,700
how do you think it'll work out

776
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,980
shit I don't know

777
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,160
ha ha ha

778
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,420
ha ha ha

779
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,980
fuck it go for it

780
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,560
talking about the time

781
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,120
that is seldom mentioned

782
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,920
talking of course

783
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
about the time

784
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,880
of the alien

785
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,400
experimentation

786
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,980
dig down and use your hate

787
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,780
what?

788
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,360
are you looking down

789
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,420
and using your hate

790
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:55,980
and using your hate

791
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,100
oh do we have to

792
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,000

794
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,260
oh he wants us to

795
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,880
use our hate power again

796
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,260
don't you know

797
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,480
that your head

798
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,460
was transformed

799
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,660
use your hate

800
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,660
so much for your rebellion

801
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,020

804
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,540

some

889
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:00,560
We want you to be ready for the coming ball.

890
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,300
The coming apocalyptic...

891
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,460
Yes, there's a time when all the springs are going to uncoil.

892
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,100
The pendulums will disintegrate.

893
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,460
The hours will bleed upon the floor.

894
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,700
A couple of minesweepers from the U.S. Army.

895
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,060
The minutes and seconds are exsanguinating.

896
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,340
The P.I.A. and the schools and administration,

897
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,160
she's decided to come back and dig some of those up.

898
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,780
And there you go.

899
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,880
It's beautiful floats and costumes,

900
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,980
and just everybody's turned out.

901
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,680
It's wonderful to see the police here in horse today,

902
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,000
and in costume, too.

903
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,480
The police? What are they doing here?

904
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,640
That's right. The police are in costume.

905
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,540
And it's a nice turn of events from that 1986 April Fool's Day massacre.

906
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,080
The martyrdom of Bishop Joey, which...

907
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,620
Sorry.

908
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,880
I'm just imitating...

909
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,020
Hey!

910
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,420
...subgeniuses here in my...

911
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:54,940
I guess...

912
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,940
There they go, and there goes those helicopters.

913
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,940
...live broadcasts of St. Stupas.

914
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,400
And there's St. Stupas on the top of the building,

915
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,640
waving hello to all the parade participants.

916
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,240
They're still up there with their flashing nipples,

917
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,100
throwing us all the way.

918
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,220
Who needs a dipstick when you can have a laser spy tool,

919
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,960
or even better, a laser level that makes leveling any project a snap?

920
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,040
Whether it's laser...

921
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,100
...or lining up pictures on adjacent walls,

922
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,940
laying floor and ceiling tile,

923
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,380
or building a brick wall,

924
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,760
there's just no easy way to know you're working on a straight level line.

925
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,840
Yes, I see.

926
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,160
Yeah.

927
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,180
But the laser-equipped level is much better than the one with the little bubbles.

928
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,620
Oh, yes. Much better with the bubbles.

929
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,320
Once the level is properly aligned,

930
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,620
it projects a sharp, easily seen line

931
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,680
that allows you to work on any flat surface,

932
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,580
even ceilings,

933
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,060
with laser accuracy.

934
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,660
Yeah, that's true.

935
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,400
You could detect electromagnetic fields,

936
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,640
ease shoulder and neck pain,

937
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,160
get jogger's dog protection,

938
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,040
and even have unusual Halloween fun.

939
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,640
There'd be no need to curtail your lifestyle

940
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,700
because of pesky earthquakes and other national disasters.

941
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,180
No.

942
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,440
You could take the easy road to success.

943
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,200
Touch me.

944
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,100
I know what you're after, Dave.

945
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,540
Poltergeist or gas.

946
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,820
Well, put it this way.

947
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,480
If they ever did bottle that really good thing...

948
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,620
I got thrill pills for all the little chickies.

949
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,660
And I got funny cigarettes for all you boys.

950
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,600
And I got dirty pictures for all of you together.

951
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,660
Well, I guess I better go.

952
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,420
I see the campus cops coming.

953
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,780
I better split now.

954
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,800
Remember Leon Trotsky, do you?

955
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,140
You have to put a dropper on it.

956
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,060
Special and tequila.

957
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,880
Clever loser.

958
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,940
Because it's not a problem.

959
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,200
Spandex pants.

960
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,780
In the spandex man.

961
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,600
It's like purple spandex pants.

962
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,300
Exactly.

963
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,000
Can we just swat one dirty old man now?

964
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,480
Swat him.

965
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:10,700
Of course.

966
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:10,980
10 more.

967
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
We love the spandex.

968
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,240
Pop up where that one was.

969
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,680
That's a baby boomers for you.

970
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,400
What, liking to spank old men?

971
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,720
It's a civilization of dirty old men.

972
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,560
And dirty old ladies, man.

973
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:21,560


974
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:21,580


975
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,440
Hail Connie.

976
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,860
Well, they have the public spankings of the dirty old men and ladies now.

977
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,940
I am not technically a baby boomer.

978
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,480
Remember how a lot of the people used to show up for those?

979
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,960
You're just a couple of years behind the baby boomer.

980
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:32,980
Yeah, I'm not.

981
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,240
The people have actually written about me.

982
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,540
And that we're the ones that never got a name.

983
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,780
The baby fizzles.

984
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,920
We never got a name.

985
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,480
That's because they refused to pull your pants down.

986
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,660
Gen X, we weren't part of Gen X either.

987
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,240
Nope.

988
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,020
But we weren't part of the baby boomers.

989
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,180
The baby duds.

990
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,480
So, but the article, one article I read.

991
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,380
It did point out that we will be paying the bills for the baby boomer.

992
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,100
Praise God.

993
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,120
You'll be paying for our diapers.

994
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:57,620
That's true.

995
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,240
I'm only a couple of years older than you, but I'm part of the baby boomer.

996
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:01,660
Mm-hmm.

997
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,560
See, and he'll be wearing diapers at the same time you'll be wearing one of those Speedo

998
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,880
swimsuits for elderly folks.

999
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,540
I think I'm part of the space age, Gen.

1000
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,760
Because that's when, when I was born was the first year that anything went into space.

1001
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:15,900
Sputnik.

1002
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,980
Sputnik went up like two days after I was born.

1003
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,420
It's the first year anybody noticed.

1004
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,040
Oh, that's a sign.

1005
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,940
Anybody who's like 12 years old now.

1006
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,800
It's a space boy.

1007
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,600
Yeah, space boy.

1008
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,700
Anybody who's like 12 years old now is part of the trapper keeper generation.

1009
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,240
Really?

1010
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,800
That's cool.

1011
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,100
Trapper.

1012
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,060
Yeah, we were baby boomers.

1013
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,260
They're the trapper keepers.

1014
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,040
And what a terrible moniker to carry around your whole life too, especially if you have

1015
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,700
to wear those big dog boots.

1016
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,060
But that's what they're going to have to do.

1017
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,500
You know, you get, and people can only pull your earlobe so far before the whole ear falls

1018
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:44,820
off.

1019
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,680
I mean, I'm talking about scarification is not a way to live.

1020
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,020
No.

1021
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,220
No.

1022
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,280
Next will be the hunter gatherer generation.

1023
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,540
Yeah.

1024
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,660
Well, they'll come after the trapper keepers because they're going to realize that, you

1025
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,640
know, then you have to domesticate the food and stuff and everything too.

1026
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,100
So then you'll have the hunter gatherers and you'll have the agrarian farmers.

1027
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,880
Work their way back up.

1028
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,840
The feudal warlords again.

1029
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,460
Yeah.

1030
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,480
For a thousand years again.

1031
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,540
The macro hyper industrial gen will then follow up after that.

1032
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,480
They'll have natural selection stores where you can stock the manager and steal as much

1033
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,100
food as you want.

1034
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,520
The other ones where you cooperatively have to live.

1035
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,140
And what about the hyper industrial postmodernist gen?

1036
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,540
Again.

1037
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,680
Exactly, Jez.

1038
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,960
And how many times can it be modern and postmodern, folks?

1039
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,800
Just think of it.

1040
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,160
Post-postmodern.

1041
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,420
Yeah.

1042
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,720
In your silly Egyptian chairs.

1043
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,460
Right.

1044
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:36,360
You know, wearing your scarabs and looking at a strange glowing box that the Pharaoh

1045
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,660
hath created for thee.

1046
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,660
Come on now.

1047
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,920
Yeah, but the curve's going straight up now almost.

1048
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,460
It's almost the end.

1049
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,760
Of what though?

1050
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,320
About three more minutes, in fact.

1051
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah.

1052
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,620
Oh, the almost the end of this loop.

1053
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,200
Yeah.

1054
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,340
Well, this particular-

1055
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,380
The Mayans knew it.

1056
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,420
I'm going to play that again.

1057
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:51,880
The Aztecs knew it.

1058
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,780
The gypsies.

1059
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,500
That's the same of the-

1060
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,340
The Dobbses.

1061
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,560
The Lovecrafts.

1062
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,020
That's the same of your adults.

1063
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,220
The Lovecrafts knew it.

1064
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,920
I mean, it is exactly the same thing, this thing that they're sinking up.

1065
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,460
The big door is closing.

1066
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,080
No, it's not sinking up.

1067
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,400
We have to eat our tail.

1068
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,560
The sink is over with.

1069
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,620
If you've got a tail, start doing it now.

1070
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,000
Sink is draining.

1071
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,040
You know what I mean?

1072
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,420
Sink is-

1073
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,200
No one told you when to run.

1074
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,420
I forgot that.

1075
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:11,420


1076
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,500
You missed the starting gun.

1077
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,460
If you're a movie, it's about whooping.

1078
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,800
You run and you run to catch up with the sun, Dave, but it's sinking and racing around to

1079
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,520
come up behind you again.

1080
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,280
Behind you again.

1081
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:23,840
I know.

1082
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,280
That is so freaking heavy.

1083
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,060
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older.

1084
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,120
Man.

1085
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,300
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

1086
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,600
I am going to wear a honey truss the rest of my life with those words inscribed in

1087
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,000
the middle and one of those fuzzy little pom-pom things to remind me of that message.

1088
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,500
Man, that colostomy bag will probably help remind you too.

1089
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,480
Yeah, but when you fill it up with wine and drink from it-

1090
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:46,480


1091
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,380
No, they have the colostomy bags now.

1092
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,600
With your favorite 60s band.

1093
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,100
I said, no.

1094
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,660
I think they did have the Pink Floyd colostomy bag.

1095
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,280
I saw it.

1096
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,740
Did you go to the festival though, man?

1097
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,420
In Milwaukee, they had a whole festival, I guess.

1098
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,660
So how's your lumbago lately?

1099
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,100
Sitting at the swag tail of the swag hair.

1100
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,980
How's your rest home lately?

1101
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,260
How's your vertigo?

1102
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,280
I guess.

1103
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,800
How's your bingo?

1104
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,780
How's your bingo?

1105
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,420
Oh, it's fine, but I can't hit portals.

1106
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1107
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1108
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1109
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1110
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1111
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1112
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1113
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1114
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,380
Oh, yeah, everyone has a good postion.

1115
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:19,560
Okay.

1116
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:29,860
Now please don't hurt me.

1117
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:38,880
Need just to go and drink the beer.

1118
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,360
Let me know what you've been drinking.

1119
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,360


1120
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,380
Yeah, I am a זה pussy!

1121
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:47,040
You drunk as F veyaflowing Carolina!

1122
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,200
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1123
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:58,180
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1124
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,160
Got your pencil ready?

1125
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:05,760
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1126

1128
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:30,780
Oh, my friends, I want you to check out www.subgenius.com.

1129
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,980
It's as beautiful as that music.

1130
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,680
And, uh, uh, yes.

1131
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,000
If you don't eat your meat,

1132
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,300
you can't have any pudding.

1133
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,740
How can you have pudding

1134
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:55,140
if you don't eat your meat?

1135
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,380
California oranges, Texas cactus,

1136
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,180
we think you need a little more practice.

1137
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,500
Throw them in the graveyard, cover up their feet.

1138
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,940
J.R. Bob Dobbs can't be beat.

1139
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,340
Yay!

1140
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,160


1141
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,000
Yo, Carson Bratt,

1142
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,980
look what you've done!

1143
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,200
I'm melting!

1144
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,380
Melting!

1145
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,320
Oh, my world, my world!

1146
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,980
Who would have thought I could love her like you

1147
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,400
for destroying my beautiful wickedness?

1148
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,160
Ah!

1149
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,020
The boat!

1150
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,220
The boat!

1151
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,120
I'm going!

1152
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:32,900
Ah!

1153
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:34,920
Ah!

1154
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,120
Ah!

1155
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,860
Ah!

1156
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,680

Ah!

1164
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,480


1165
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,480


1166
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,480


1167
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,560
Ah!

1168
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:42,580
Ah!

1169
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:42,580


1170
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:42,620
Ah!

1171
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1172
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1173
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1174
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620

00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1180
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1181
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1182
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620


1183
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:42,620
