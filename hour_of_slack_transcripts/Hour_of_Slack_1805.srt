1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Listen.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,980
Alright, I'm one.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,160
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,880
The Show Genius Hour of Swag.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,880
We'll meet again at midnight.

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,980
We'll meet again at midnight.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:29,980
We'll meet again at midnight.

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,380
We'll meet again at midnight.

9
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:15,420
We'll meet again at midnight.

10
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:47,040
We'll meet again at midnight.

11
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,120
We'll meet again at midnight.

12
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm alive and well.

13
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm alive and well.

14
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm still alive and well.

15
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,660
Oh, thank you, Johnny Winter.

16
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,600
And thanks to Lee Murr for the titles and other things.

17
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,980
And the Empire Jones.

18
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,180
Jazz Orchestra, symphonies and riffs in the background here.

19
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,920
Oh, yes, dear friends, I ain't dead yet,

20
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,920
which is why I played that Johnny Winter song.

21
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,780
My x-rays came back, and by golly,

22
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,900
I've been hobbling around with old compression fractures

23
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,180
in my neck and back, along with the arthritis.

24
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,300
So I wasn't being a namby-pamby weiner-weiner crybaby after all.

25
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,560
So this show, number 1805,

26
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,880
is part rerun of number 76,

27
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,640
and part new with the rest of the interview with Sandy Boone

28
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,600
and Dr. Philo Drummond about the subgenius movie

29
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,640
on the Film School podcast.

30
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,420
But first, let's go back in time with a media barrage

31
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,060
leading up to G. Gordon Gordon's classic,

32
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
It's Not Just The.

33
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm trying to make believe I'm you

34
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,780
I'm trying to fix

35
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,760
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

36
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,060
People say that life is fun

37
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,620
But I don't know why

38
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,200
As far as I can tell

39
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,820
Life sucks, life sucks, life sucks

40
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,320
Then you die

41
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,020
Within the last 12 hours,

42
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,940
we have received...

43
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,080
a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation

44
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,680
that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomenon.

45
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,600
Bob?

46
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm sick and tired of the rap

47
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,900
Fuckin' shit, don't wait

48
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,840
I'll make sure everything goes right

49
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:13,880
Added a video to his Facebook live chat

50
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,740
I say something here

51
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:14,840
skip to 54.05

52
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,840


53
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,840


54
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,840


55
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,920
I had terrible luck

56
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:16,920


57
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:16,920


58
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,020
Can you hear this beep?

59
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,500
See him going playing the tone?

60
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,900
I'm bread

61
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,480
This has this YAmelin

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,500
This isn't the end

63
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,500


64
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,080
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

65
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,500
We will control the vertical.

66
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
Don't kill them.

67
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,920
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

68
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Enjoy life like Bob.

69
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,380
Get the head, Satan.

70
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,360
Do not be afraid.

71
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,240
I am not here to harm you.

72
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,600
I know you want to destroy me.

73
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,880
But listen.

74
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,440
Please listen.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
I only want to help you.

76
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,880
I've chosen you.

77
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,620
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

78
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,560
I don't love you.

79
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,200
Bob, they don't love you like I do.

80
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,480
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

81
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,760
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

82
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,000
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

83
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,600
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

84
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,700
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,740
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

86
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,860
It's not just those starry old becks on the park benches

87
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,580
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars

88
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,080
of Belsen and Auschwitz.

89
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,980
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Negi.

90
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,440
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

91
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,960
It's not just the diner bones for Wotan.

92
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,100
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae,

93
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,560
and human hair.

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,140
It's not just the man-excrement on your car hood.

95
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not just that the old ways were best.

96
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,520
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

97
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,980
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

98
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,160
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain

99
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
that has defiled the entire planet.

100
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,540
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fire.

101
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,000
It's not just the far-fars the size of basketballs.

102
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,540
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

103
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,300
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a bitch

104
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,840
who thinks workers are property.

105
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,600
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

106
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,400
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,280
that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

108
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,780
It's not just some cunt full of a pipe and a cunt eating I-know-more-than-you-do dog grin

109
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,340
all over his homogenized face.

110
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,960
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,640
that you certainly never made.

112
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,180
It's not just the doorway to doom.

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,980
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

114
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,280
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

115
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,420
No, dear friend.

116
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,380
There is more to it all than that.

117
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,220
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

118
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,460
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

119
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,080
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

120
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,700
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there,

121
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,300
if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

122
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,040
No.

123
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,320
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

124
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,300
In his back pocket.

125
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,900
Just you try it.

126
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
I'll keep it white, primo.

127
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,480
Bob takes you to 신опSure.おい,

128
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:39,500
What do you need?

129
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,560
Er...

130
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,820
Well, I've been searching for you up here in the test Corinth,

131
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:54,760
and you wouldn't, I can see where you're

132
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,340
你 subject為 tap ι

133
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:10,480
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

134
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, I want to ask Sandy in terms of sort of the challenges in sort of telling the story.

135
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,860
As Reverend Drummond has just laid out, there's so much here.

136
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,480
And you could kind of get caught up in a lot of the detail of it.

137
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,180
What was your challenge in trying to tell this story?

138
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,500
Because you had the two principals here, obviously the two people who really made this thing run.

139
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,400
What did you find in terms of storytelling that you wanted to try and accomplish?

140
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:50,220
Well, actually, there's many difficulties in telling this story because, as Dr. Drummond will tell you, there's all these different schisms.

141
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,820
And so though he and Ivan Stang are...

142
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,160
Are supposedly the leaders or the founders.

143
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,880
Yes.

144
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,740
Everybody runs their own show.

145
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
So there's like...

146
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,020
There was an Arkansas group and a San Francisco group.

147
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,300
And there's a group that Dr....

148
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Oh, what was his name?

149
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,920
Oh, I'll think of it in a second.

150
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
Anyway, he was out of Florida.

151
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,300
And they're all doing their own spin on what this is supposed to be.

152
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,760
And they're all claiming that theirs is the most important part of So Genius.

153
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,280
Or...

154
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,820
You know...

155
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,040
The most vital part.

156
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,520
And so it's just having all those different personalities and trying to get a...

157
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,840
You can't ever get everyone in this because there's so many people.

158
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,720
There was a group in Brighton, London.

159
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,200
There's a group in Australia.

160
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,880
There was a group in Canada.

161
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,000
I mean, they're really all over the world.

162
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:53,520
And so one of the issues has been there's too much material to put in an hour and 20-minute movie or under two-hour movie.

163
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,900
And so we had to break it down and try to come up with...

164
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:07,660
To explain what the church was with many definitions that a lot of people have never heard of.

165
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,740
They didn't know what a pink was or a normal.

166
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,400
And then as you're trying to give certain definitions, the church is truly...

167
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,560
The people that are interviewing are saying, well, that's their definition of the same word.

168
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,040
And so you never...

169
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,820
Really.

170
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,420
I mean, they don't want to be defined.

171
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,720
So that made it difficult.

172
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:37,920
So I had to come up with a storyline that would not only explain their history, encompass as much of the church as I could, but also relate to our modern world.

173
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,580
So this wouldn't just be a subgenius movie and use it.

174
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:52,480
So hopefully the church would not only tell their story and we wanted to do what Doug asked, which is they're getting older.

175
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,400
But they're concerned that they would turn into a Scientology or Mormonism if the truth didn't finally come out.

176
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,800
And there were too many people at the time that really wanted this to be a real cult.

177
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,320
So that was an issue.

178
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,520
And then also show how cults and cult practices are used in politics today.

179
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,660
That gave it the world renowned information and connections.

180
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,200
So people wouldn't...

181
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,980
If they weren't even introduced to subgenius, they could see how these...

182
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,100
These guys that were really...

183
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:32,420
I hate to say this, Dr. Drummond, but nobody from Dallas, Texas turned this thing into a worldwide cult.

184
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,500
Whether it's a joke or not, it still was a cult.

185
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,240
Right.

186
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,120
Well, you know, Sandy, I thank you for saying that because that is what the film is.

187
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,380
It is a film that if you hadn't...

188
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,800
And I had no idea that the Church of the Subgenius existed until I saw the film.

189
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
And so...

190
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,920
For me, it was such an enjoyable watch.

191
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,240
And one of the things that I...

192
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,760
Again, I think the Reverend Drummond would echo this.

193
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,280
And that is, this is a church.

194
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,960
And I'm using air quotes here.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,140
Church that promotes schisms.

196
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,280
Which I just...

197
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,240
And there's just so many things.

198
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,460
The devival instead of a revival.

199
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,700
All the things about it are intended, in my opinion, are intended to...

200
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,940
Like flashing red lights to say...

201
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,640
This is what you...

202
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,560
This is the part where you normally...

203
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,640
We would be talking to you about joining and getting your family to join.

204
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,320
We're not here to do that.

205
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,640
In fact, we're here to make sure your family doesn't join the church.

206
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,240
And I mean, there's just so many things about it that are funny, satirical, and true.

207
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,260
And I think that's the subgenius of what their philosophy is.

208
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,380
Is while all of these things on some level are a lot of fun,

209
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:59,040
they're also pointing out some hard truths about social norms.

210
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,260
That's true.

211
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,360
And one of the things that I kept saying through the entire movie, not on screen,

212
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,360
was a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.

213
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,960
How am I going to get the broader audience to be interested, watch this movie,

214
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,720
and actually learn something once they walk away?

215
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,460
Take something with them.

216
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,880
And it's...

217
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,620
The guy's humor.

218
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,680
I mean, they're hilarious.

219
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,300
And a lot of these people...

220
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,600
And they're actually...

221
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,920
In fact, one of the subgenius just accused me of revealing that they are truly teddy bears.

222
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,020
And that was not supposed to what was happening.

223
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,280
Well, you know, when you walk into this hornet's nest of terrible people, Sandy,

224
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,420
this is what's going to happen.

225
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

226
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,080
Yes.

227
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,440
Dear friends, I've got a short sermon to do here.

228
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,120
And this is mostly...

229
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,680
This is going to be mostly for those of you who have been regular listeners of the show.

230
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,120
And the rest of you probably ought to just go away.

231
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,520
Go to the bathroom for about five, ten minutes.

232
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,940
Then come back for more horrible tape.

233
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
Well, I've got a letter here, friends.

234
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,460
A letter from Sister Mandy.

235
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,020
Mandy.

236
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,200
And I'm going to read this letter here.

237
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,960
It's pertinent.

238
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,000
She says,

239
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,500
I hope the show pulls in what was promised.

240
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,920
It would be a cry in shame if you had to die again.

241
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,380
But then again, what was this...

242
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,120
This...

243
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,220
This...

244
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,660
Excrative deleted coming out of my radio last hour of Slack.

245
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,700
Actually, she's talking about two hours of Slack ago.

246
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,360
Two weeks ago.

247
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,640
I can't believe you would rag on native Texans because they're not as rowdy as some chowderhead Yankees.

248
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,220
Now...

249
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,560
Now...

250
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,960
Dear friends, let me intercede here and say that it's not y'all's lack of rowdiness at all,

251
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,680
but the lack of airplane tickets that you would provide to get other subgenius preachers down here for a show.

252
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,560
But Sister Mandy continues,

253
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,400
Now, I don't know if you are a real Texan or just a transplant.

254
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,580
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,800
I know I don't sound like I was raised in North Richland Hills and Fort Worth.

256
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,640
But maybe you like cold winters.

257
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:21,960
She says,

258
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,180
And the way they say,

259
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,440
Maybe now we women of Texas aren't good enough for old Reverend Ivan Stang anymore.

260
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,260
Is that it, huh?

261
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Well, no comment there.

262
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,220
But Texans are Bob's chosen.

263
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,980
It's always been that way.

264
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,700
But that's why it's so disappointing that they don't act like it.

265
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,500
I certainly do.

266
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,640
Mandy continues,

267
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,440
I don't know.

268
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,640
I can't believe that the subgeniuses of Dallas don't have the, say, cojones to manage to put together a,

269
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,800
a butt-kicking, glass-grinding, splendiferous-type devival.

270
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,700
And, friends, it's not the cojones that's needed,

271
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,580
but the energy and the know-how, the art scam expertise.

272
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,980
She goes,

273
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,100
I'd be willing to give myself in every way possible to help,

274
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,460
although I'm a prisoner of the conspiracy's so-called educational system.

275
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,580
Irving, oh, I think, school.

276
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,080
Yeah.

277
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,900
I want to help when I can.

278
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,920
You know, as well as I, that Dallas is capable of it.

279
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,280
So cram this Boston,

280
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,720
B.S., and save your evil fluids for Dallas.

281
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,880
But, friends, is Dallas capable?

282
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,400
For instance, the most high-buck disco club in Dallas,

283
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,580
Mistral, couldn't handle the technical demands of one extra VHS tape deck,

284
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,520
which you operate in your own home.

285
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,660
She goes,

286
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,280
Yeah, I realize that your rant was meant to inflame,

287
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,200
but all it did was,

288
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
uh, well, I can't say this, but anger people.

289
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,580
And, friends, I know that's true, and it's because I delivered it poorly.

290
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,880
She says,

291
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,120
I know you can do better than that.

292
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
And that's true, when I've had enough sleep.

293
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,400
Do something.

294
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,900
I can't read the something to them if they can't take a joke.

295
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,900
Do more than anger them.

296
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,080
Challenge us.

297
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,720
And, friends, some did take it as a challenge, which is how it was meant to be.

298
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,560
She says,

299
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,380
Dallas loves stupid.

300
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,820
Look at some of our swinging singles meat lockers.

301
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,280
Have a national devival or something.

302
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,200
Aim for Dallas's cojones and threaten to have them kicked by San Francisco.

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm not going to do that.

304
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,780
I'm going to go to San Francisco or something.

305
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,480
Make yourself the most hated man in Dallas.

306
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,480
For without hate, there is no love.

307
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,660
And without love, there is no Bob.

308
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,320
Bob equals hate equals love.

309
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,300
Did you say that, or was it me?

310
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,540
It was me, Mandy.

311
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't remember, but do it, Stang.

312
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,200
I know you can.

313
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,160
Well, you know, when I've had enough sleep and had a little bit of slack, usually,

314
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,120
Oh, what did that mean?

315
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,860
The music stopped all of a sudden.

316
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,120
But it's true.

317
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,040
I couldn't agree with you more about that after Boston hour of slack.

318
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,120
Uh, because after I'd finally gotten to bed and slept for 13 hours,

319
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,160
I listened to that tape of the show and went,

320
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,160
Oh my God, I sound almost drunk.

321
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,100
And, but keep in mind that stupidity is certainly no sin in this church.

322
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,140
And I was just plain burned out, tired.

323
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,520
Tired, friends.

324
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,100
And on top of that, I was being facetious.

325
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,040
But I just wasn't being facetious well, so it came off the wrong way.

326
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,100
Now, uh, you know, when you go for four hours of sleep a night,

327
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,020
it happens.

328
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,920
You don't get the slack.

329
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,240
But then when I got to Boston, my buddies, Doctors for Bob and I did get slack.

330
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,980
But, although it was partly slack through overwork, which is an unusual form of slack,

331
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,240
but many of us emergentiles have to get slack that way,

332
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,520
as opposed to you rewardium types of geniuses, who I envy, by the way.

333
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,760
But number one, you gotta remember that by definition,

334
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,780
a subgenius preacher has not only the right, but the obligation, dear friends,

335
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,120
to make severe and even tragic mistakes.

336
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,560
Now, look at the rival cults, uh,

337
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,940
some of your local Christian denominations, let's say,

338
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,620
that preach total goodness and perfection.

339
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,700
They live, friends, in a false, dangerous fantasy world.

340
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,780
And when they show their humanity, as Jim and Tammy Baker did,

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,600
oh, they're castigated by their people.

342
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,440
They're fired off their jobs.

343
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,740
And they sure look stupid.

344
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,420
They make Christianity look even stupider to the average American,

345
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,880
which is okay with me.

346
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,460
But in their smug, self-deluding pride, friends,

347
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
they set goals that are not only impossible,

348
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,260
but actually ridiculously unnecessary.

349
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,920
And when they can't attain those goals, then they just get more fanatical

350
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,980
and can't admit that they couldn't cut the, uh, what they set up for themselves.

351
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,860
And their people are so strung out

352
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,660
between constant states of false happiness or guilt.

353
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,940
I don't know.

354
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,460
Uh, we, we now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years,

355
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,740
were actually only acting happy.

356
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,220
But living that lie just compounded their misery.

357
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,660
And millions of people do this to themselves

358
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,620
because they think God is as ignorant and tolerant and insecure as they are.

359
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,000
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.

360
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Hiding their real feelings.

361
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
Living a lie.

362
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,320
Deliberately short-circuiting their instincts.

363
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Pretending.

364
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,420
They pre-

365
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,280
That's what they do.

366
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,480
They're pretending, friends.

367
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,780
Now, you, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending.

368
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,080
But, you know, in a way, they pretend much, much worse than we do.

369
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,760
So, when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk,

370
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,060
remember that at least I'm being honest.

371
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,140
If I'm beat, worn out,

372
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,780
I don't take speed like Tammy Baker to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.

373
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,720
I act like I feel.

374
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,100
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.

375
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,700
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

376
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,980
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.

377
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,640
He doesn't need to forgive me because I didn't do anything evil.

378
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
I screwed up.

379
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,780
And Bob, Bob loves me for that.

380
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,760
It's the power to fail, friends.

381
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,640
It's the power that the subgenius popes have and these rival popes can't, can't ever have.

382
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,840
And, the irony, friends, the irony.

383
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,480
It's like with the pledge drives.

384
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,140
The hour of slack listeners are 50% paid up right now, or probably more by now.

385
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,960
But yet, now those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged.

386
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,240
They pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith.

387
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,620
And only 10%, at best,

388
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,860
in some cases 6%, bothered to fulfill the commitment.

389
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,160
Because in Christianity, pretending and promising is good enough.

390
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,280
And that's what faith means, friends.

391
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,740
It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter what.

392
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,600
Because you're going to pretend everything's okay.

393
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Oh, it's God's will.

394
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,820
So therefore, you don't have to do anything about it.

395
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,060
Leave it to God, dear friends.

396
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,440
Grace through faith, not works.

397
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,600
Jesus said,

398
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,280
Be like children.

399
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,600
And, you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without taking off,

400
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,860
without keeping her fake eyelashes, her bat-wing size fake eyelashes on.

401
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,000
I read that in the paper today.

402
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,620
That's how you keep your husband.

403
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,180
Wear makeup to bed.

404
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,800
Pretending, friends.

405
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
Yeah, they're like children, all right.

406
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,400
But they're like seventh grade children.

407
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:43,620
Cruel, gossiping liars and bullies that roam in cliques and packs looking for weak, unsuspecting minority victims.

408
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,520
Oh, they have faith, all right.

409
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,180
Faith that any nasty thing they do didn't count if God forgave it in their head.

410
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,880
And if you're having the kind of fun they can't experience, then you must, that must be sin.

411
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,440
Because in their eyes, friends, slack is the ultimate sin.

412
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,500
The devil hates slack, too.

413
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,100
And when you look at the basic beliefs and behavior of a lot of these fundamentalist Christians,

414
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,880
they have a lot in common with the devil, friends.

415
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,440
A whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus.

416
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,860
Now, subgenius is rationalized, too.

417
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:24,940
But our rationalization is so absurd that it allows us, the slack, to remember that it's just a rationalization and there's still work to do.

418
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,260
Praise Bob.

419
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,580
Oh, God.

420
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,100
Here's this Tammy Baker interview.

421
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,400
Yes, she rarely goes to bed without her makeup, swears by her false eyelashes, and wears different wigs for her husband, Jim.

422
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,640
And that still wasn't good enough, was it?

423
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
No, Jessica.

424
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,400
I'd bet.

425
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,200
Now, Jessica Hahn, she didn't have to change wigs every night.

426
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,360
Jim very seldom seen me without makeup and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.

427
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,240
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes.

428
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,200
Yeah, I think natural born eyelashes are kind of good, too.

429
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,280
They keep the water out of your eyes.

430
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,200
The sweat, if you're inhuman enough to sweat, unlike Miss Tammy.

431
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,740
Um, oh, God.

432
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, I've got more of that rant to go on.

433
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,140
But in the meantime, until then.

434
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,760
You heard what she said.

435
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,280
I love you, too, Nicole.

436
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,460
We're really good friends.

437
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,500
Our implicit brotherhood ruins every relationship.

438
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,280
But I know this is wrong.

439
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,280


440
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,440
When Confederate flags flutter and fly

441
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,600
I won't stand back, I won't stand by

442
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,780
When the Proud Boys get a rallying cry

443
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,920
I won't stand back, and I won't stand by

444
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,980
In the face of hate, in the face of a lie

445
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,140
I won't stand back, I won't stand by

446
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,180
I won't watch our freedom die

447
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,360
I won't stand back, I won't stand by

448
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,560
Time is now, time is short

449
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,740
Voting's not a spectator sport

450
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,640
Ask me and I'll reply

451
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,480
I won't stand back and I won't stand by

452
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,180
There's a sickness we can't deny

453
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,380
Don't stand back, don't stand by

454
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,460
You might be scared, but don't be shy

455
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,600
Don't stand back, don't stand by

456
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,760
Time is short, time is now

457
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,740
They get away with what we allow

458
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,160
There's only do, there is no try

459
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,460
Don't stand back, don't stand by

460
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
guitar solo

461
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,740
In the face of hate

462
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,460
In the face of hate

463
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,160
In the face of a lie

464
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,240
Don't stand back, don't stand by

465
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,380
Toe to toe and eye to eye

466
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Don't stand back, don't stand by

467
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,520
Don't stand back, don't stand by

468
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,900
And I won't stand back, I won't stand by

469
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,220
I won't stand back, I won't stand by

470
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,300
That was Stuart Stott's Local 2020,

471
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,920
part of a new huge stack of music recently sent to me by Reverend Velveteen Sly

472
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,460
of beloved Sister Station WORT in Madison.

473
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,880
We have a lot to listen to,

474
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,460
and listening is harder work than some might think for a partially deaf person.

475
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,020
But now, back to our Slight No. 76 from 1986

476
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:08,400
with Sister Chris on her old subgenius show on WFMU in New Jersey.

477
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,080
And let me tell you, friends,

478
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,580
it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

479
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,600
It's not just the truncated detention spans of the conspiracy glorps

480
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,380
scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.

481
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like models posing on cue.

482
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:37,780
It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the hell-spawned image consultants.

483
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,640
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

484
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,000
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

485
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,560
It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, man.

486
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,820
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest.

487
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not just the talentless pinks,

488
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,220
hooked into a groove devoid of style.

489
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,320
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.

490
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,820
It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.

491
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,700
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.

492
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,220
It's not just the frothy mouths of the reactionaries.

493
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,100
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.

494
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,980
It's not just the empty youth culture borrowing from the ABCs,

495
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,200
the computerized format of possible personas.

496
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,320
It's that and a whole lot more.

497
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,120
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

498
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,380
Let's join us now, shall we?

499
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,360
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.

500
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,080
Thank you.

501
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,380
Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.

502
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,120
The Japanese...

503
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,060
Don't you wish you were with us?

504
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,980
Well, send in your money, and maybe some of the money will be worth it.

505
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
But one day, you can.

506
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,120
No, really, we're a fun crowd.

507
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,320
You'd like us to move in next door to you.

508
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,660
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

509
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,040
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye,

510
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,380
or a smile or a leer on our lips,

511
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,800
but otherwise we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale.

512
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,600
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man,

513
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,180
ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring.

514
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,340
How about it, America?

515
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,160
Well, let's try it out, huh?

516
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,320
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be...

517
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,400
What's going on? I feel so spooky.

518
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,300
Disobedient to parents, a subgenius.

519
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,380
Steals, a subgenius.

520
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,960
Lies, a subgenius.

521
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,900
Hater of God, a subgenius.

522
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,720
Whisperer, a subgenius.

523
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,040
Whoremonger, a subgenius.

524
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,580
Envious, a subgenius.

525
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,840
Pride, a subgenius.

526
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,640
A backbiter.

527
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,020
A subgenius.

528
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,560
A deceitful person.

529
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,960
A subgenius.

530
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,540
A hypocrite.

531
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,720
A subgenius.

532
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,980
A merciful.

533
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,620
A subplenius.

534
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,280
A false accuser.

535
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,340
A subpenius.

536
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,440
Come here, you little subgenius.

537
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,740
Well, I guess that about wraps it up.

538
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,620
That's your typical subgenius now.

539
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,580
And, uh...

540
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,780
Monk, I don't need Dobbs.

541
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,840
There's nothing wrong with me.

542
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
I'll make it my way.

543
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,320
Oh, good.

544
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,720
I must have been insane.

545
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,160
What can I say?

546
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,660
I'm lost without Dobbs.

547
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,420
Without Bob.

548
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,440
Bob, I'm guilty.

549
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:32,960
Guilty.

550
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,400
From side sheets.

551
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,400
Be not deceived.

552
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,660
Dobbs is not mocked.

553
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,400
For whosoever a man soeth,

554
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,420
him also shall he reap.

555
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,960
For it is my shepherd,

556
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,420
I shall not want.

557
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,240
That's right, dear friends.

558
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,420
That's right.

559
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,560
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.

560
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,360
I guess he wasn't a doctor yet.

561
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,400
Now, I'm about to play a beloved piece

562
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,700
by our heroes, the Firesign Theater,

563
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,460
from the album and film

564
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,080
Everything.

565
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,380
You Know Is Wrong.

566
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,160
I believe that soon,

567
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,600
that album will be having

568
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,160
its 50th anniversary.

569
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,700
This year is the 50th anniversary

570
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,720
of the previous album,

571
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,200
Don't Crush That Dwarf,

572
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,140
Hand Me The Pliers.

573
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,740
That probably doesn't make you feel old.

574
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,440
If you aren't old.

575
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,680
The Rudey Rotton Film

576
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,620
presents

577
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,420
Ben Franklin,

578
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,160
Hero for Hopping.

579
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,160
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me.

580
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,660
But I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside.

581
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,780
So I never felt the touch of a warm, naked Indian.

582
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,980
Or...

583
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,720
Or in a cold, naked forest.

584
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,000
Ben Franklin.

585
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,840
The only President of the United States.

586
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,160
Who was never President of the United States.

587
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,340
Was he an early drug user?

588
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,860
Let's see.

589
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,260
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761.

590
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,720
While still an apprentice book baker in colonial Philadelphia.

591
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,980
So, I betook me to the Hashfire Inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads.

592
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,780
Rebellious libertines all lusting for life and liberty.

593
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,680
The real George Washington brought to him

594
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,840
Fred Ullrey, the evening clayhurst.

595
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,400
With prickly, prissy, and a little bit of a snuff.

596
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,940
He proceeded to get slurred on the meadows.

597
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,720
And beyond Tom Everson, goodly stretched by the hemp.

598
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,820
Which smoked us all like Boston's scrot.

599
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,400
What a fetid fervor of freedom.

600
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,140
I say, let's have a revolution.

601
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,180
Came up Larry Sam, the tax collector.

602
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,520
To which Big Ben replied,

603
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,700
Fine, Sam.

604
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,820
Then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

605
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,920
Yes, 1761.

606
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,120
Hemp.

607
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,320
Kindle the fire of American history.

608
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,360
Oh, oh.

609
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,140
Never be clockwork villains.

610
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,800
When a little toilet looks like a little toilet's history.

611
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,860
Or a little toilet's poop.

612
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,140
I want to remind our listeners that we're talking with the director, producer, and the writer of this wonderful film.

613
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,980
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

614
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,100
And so that's the story.

615
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,520
This is important.

616
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,100
And I'm going to ask Reverend Drummond here.

617
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,200
And I have to ask you this because I'm a comedy nut.

618
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,820
I go way back with all this stuff.

619
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,940
But were you guys influenced at all by Fireside Theater?

620
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,360
Oh, yeah.

621
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,160
Definitely.

622
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,460
We were big Fireside Theater fans.

623
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:55,560
We, you know, one of the terms early on in the church, one of the terms that Reverend Stang and I developed was the term called macho irony.

624
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,760
Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,100
Is that we wanted this to be as ironic.

626
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,240
As ironic as it could be.

627
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:08,080
So sometimes we would say the most blatant lies, but we try to do it with the straightest face possible.

628
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,560
Make them sound as true as they are.

629
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,180
And people would say, I can't believe you can say that with a straight face.

630
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:23,260
But, I mean, that was part of the whole thing is that, you know, we really enjoyed the whole sense of irony and tried to put it into everything.

631
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,940
And, you know, kind of like nowadays, nobody gets a joke anymore.

632
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,180
It's sort of like we're in a post-irony period.

633
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,820
We are.

634
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,680
People don't even understand it anymore.

635
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,620
You know, you get in trouble for joking around, saying the wrong things.

636
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,960
It's real easy these days.

637
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:47,020
You know, and those were the kind of things that we kind of filled our cart with back in the old days, you know.

638
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:56,980
So it's, and part of that was in that time, making fun of something and showing how ridiculous it was, was a good way to teach people about things.

639
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:04,740
We did over time build a pretty large community of people that even today all communicate with each other.

640
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:21,780
You know, they've got, there's probably 25 different Facebook groups where people are, you know, the Subgenius Film Society, the Subgenius Book Club, and Subgenius Slack Hole, and all these different places that people gather in sort of in the name of Bob.

641
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,220
And they do it.

642
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,000
They do it.

643
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,420
It's just part of their lives.

644
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,780
Yeah.

645
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:38,260
And for some people, it really did fill that void, that sense of community that maybe in the past was filled by a church or some religious organization.

646
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,620
Now it's like, we can get all that same stuff that they used to offer, but we can get it from these guys, you know.

647
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,060
Yeah.

648
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:51,560
And we can sort of make up our own rules and just be people.

649
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,940
And so that's been kind of interesting as the community that has developed over time.

650
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,380
And Sandy said something about it earlier.

651
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:20,400
It's not like we were afraid we're going to pass away tomorrow or anything, but there's a lot of people out there that up until, you know, I would say maybe a year or two years ago, they didn't know that Steve Wilcox and Philo Drummond was the same person because, you know, for 40 years, I never let my guard down.

652
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,160
When I was Philo, I was Philo.

653
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,320
You know, he has a little bit different personality than Steve does.

654
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:39,400
And I think that a lot of subgeniuses who chose their own subgenius name were ready to assume an identity that they felt inside for a long time, but didn't feel comfortable wearing it in public, you know.

655
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,940
And that's when a lot of people uh, you know, decided to role play a brand new character.

656
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,000
They sort of pulled away this one thing as, you know, it's a thing for as long as they can, but ask the right question.

657
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,720
Olive Young Oh, that's great.

658
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,100
I don't know if it's Bon sche pieces.

659
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,100


660
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,960
Not one thing, but I do know is that the one woman you just pointed out through the title, the woman in the red, aért...

661
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,460
And we recently played three of those songs that are still playing today, and we're not even trying to do one of the last two songs on this.

662
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,580
We've done 52, except for the last one, we'll do two or three more.

663
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:22,580


664
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:22,900
We're good hands down.

665
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,140
Jamie Wheälle Could we add in here a award on other things?

666
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:32,100
lines of the church. But this is an era, and I'm going to go back and sort of betray my age here a

667
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,620
little bit, but I mentioned Fireside Theater. There was the National Lampoon Radio Dinner Hour.

668
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,020
There was a lot of humor around during that time that was ironic, that was sardonic, that

669
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:52,800
turned things on its head, took convention and really torqued it, really made it weird, right?

670
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,220
And I think of R. Crum, you mentioned him earlier. There was that late 60s into the 70s,

671
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,440
that sort of mindset. It was about anti-authoritarianism. It was about F the man,

672
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:10,220
he's not going to tell me, all that stuff. And over time, it got a little weird and a little

673
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:17,340
misogynistic over time, but there was a real nice period there where it was genuinely funny,

674
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,600
genuinely heartfelt. And I think for me, that's what you embody.

675
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,920
In the film and in the whole, you captured that sort of zeitgeist. Am I being fair to you and to

676
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,720
the church? Oh, yeah. I think so. And I think that's what Sandy was, she definitely picked

677
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,640
that up in the film. And I don't know that we could have done it because we're just sort of

678
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,540
too close to it. Yeah. I want to ask Sandy, we just got a couple more minutes. Sandy,

679
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,560
you know, there's a lot of fun things about it, but one of the things about

680
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,620
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, it was,

681
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,080
finding the people who are fans and Richard Linklater's in the film, Nick Offerman, Penn

682
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,840
Gillette. There are a number of people that are cool people in the film. What was it like to go

683
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,300
to them and hearing what they had to say about the church? Well, there are so many, but we even

684
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,600
contacted R. Crum, but he was ill at the time and he could not do the interview, but there were

685
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:22,080
several that were willing. And David Byrne was a big part of it. Jonathan Demme had passed. He was a

686
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,780
part of it. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm trying to

687
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,700
do the right thing. I'm trying to do the right thing. And I think that's what I'm trying to do.

688
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,400
Paul Rubens. Yes. That's right. There were all, but these were the

689
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:39,720
guys that not only did Nick Offerman and also Devo, Jerry Casale. But those are the guys that

690
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,720
interviewed were the ones that actually agreed to. I've sent out many requests, you know,

691
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,060
and saying who has time and who can do this and, and the main thing, a lot of people that brought

692
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,360
brought up some issues about why did you have Rick Linklater?

693
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,020
Well, the reason I had Rick is because he named his film Slacker.

694
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,340
And it was all during the subgenius unit that was going on in Austin in the early 80s.

695
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:14,920
And I got him to admit that, yes, in Rick's way, well, yeah, it did come from the term

696
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,940
slack or from the subgenius.

697
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,780
And that was a key point for selling this thing.

698
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,680
I was like, OK, if people go, why Rick?

699
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,340
And I'm going, well, you know, this is why.

700
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,380
And then Nick Offerman, it was really his story is amazing about living on a farm in

701
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,420
this rural area.

702
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,680
And when he didn't get any of the subgenius until he had gone off to school.

703
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,340
And then Penn Jillette was the same situation where his life was blown out of the water

704
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:48,860
by this and how this mentality and this humor, you know, affected his life and helped them

705
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,000
to go beyond there.

706
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,700
You know, visions of what they were brought up with in their childhood.

707
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,760
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

708
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,600
Oh, we're coming down, getting getting sort of close to the end of the hour there.

709
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:14,200
And I'm going to continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy on the radio,

710
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,120
specifically here on the hour of slack a couple of weeks ago.

711
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,400
Now, you have to understand, friends.

712
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,780
Being a jerk, that's my outlet for artistic, I mean, religious expression.

713
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:35,060
After all, most are, I mean, preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness, orneriness,

714
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,400
corniness, and a sort of posed intolerance.

715
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,660
And I also use stupidity and especially cantankerousness.

716
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,860
I can't really, you know, I can't relax unless I'm being cantankerous.

717
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,700
I can't relax unless I'm reflecting my personal bile and spleen on others.

718
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,300
It's hate, dear friends.

719
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,980
And you wouldn't interfere with my right to hate to do my own thing, now would you?

720
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,040
This is a free country.

721
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,460
Besides, how can you since I'm the one that's transmitting and you're only receiving?

722
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,460
Only receiving, friends.

723
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,220
Does that insult you like last time?

724
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:10,780
Well, good!

725
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:19,040
That shows that I'm succeeding in doing Bob's assignment of getting you to stop letting the conspiracy,

726
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,540
or even subgenius preachers, push you around.

727
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:31,020
This obscure church would be the next inquisition where I'm not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness

728
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,420
to be in a continuous state of not merely defensiveness, but outright rebellion.

729
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,220
And if you let me get any more abusive, I'll have to kill you.

730
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,580
Because you'll deserve it.

731
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,980
It's like, I'm like an anti-role model.

732
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,020
That's what most subgenius, all subgeniuses should be anti-role models.

733
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:55,600
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang?

734
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:02,300
You mock my total disregard for the broadcast niceties.

735
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?

736
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,640
Have you even got a girlfriend yet, huh?

737
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,740
Oh, my jives have but barely begun.

738
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:16,860
I could rant a paragraph to you that would have every one of you listeners jumping off a high bridge

739
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,940
to escape the mocking truth.

740
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,920
Wielded by my tongue.

741
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,280
Or Janeer's.

742
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,340
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay.

743
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,780
I was a gentle man at one time.

744
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,740
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.

745
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,840
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon,

746
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,500
then you'd best urinate in fear at the thought of what I could dish out to you on the radio.

747
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,760
To the innocent and guilty alike.

748
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,760
For as my mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me,

749
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,680
none are so blind as those who have no eyes.

750
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:57,980
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyant visions

751
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:07,060
hath played out but the first move in a galactic game on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.

752
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,860
Congratulations, dear friends.

753
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,800
You've now entered kindergarten in the School of Terror.

754
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,800
Oh, don't worry. It won't kill you.

755
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,740
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence up.

756
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,280
It's from decreasing at the same pace as your peers.

757
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,900
But, uh...

758
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,700
But at what cost, dear listener?

759
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,280
At what cost?

760
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,780
At what cost?

761
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,680
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.

762
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,860
Ha! Oh, surprised you, nay.

763
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,540
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.

764
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,120
More than you could ever imagine in your wildest LSD dreams.

765
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,620
Fine! Go ahead! Kill me!

766
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,580
You would-be Judas!

767
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:47,660
Not Judas!

768
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,620
Not Judas!

769
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,920
failure to busted into the publicnahme dep Дажеin

770
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,580
Should the

771
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,760
orders of a

772
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,400
그냥

773
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:15,580
Gü 첨

774
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,580
irable

775
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:23,980
The city's conspiracy is but a high school prank compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang Octopus.

776
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:31,660
Oh, your science fiction has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.

777
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,180
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six

778
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,400
have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens

779
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,240
which will render all your weapons, all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes impotent.

780
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,860
Utterly impotent.

781
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,180
Kill Stang One and the Emperor Xandar is unchained.

782
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:01,880
And at that point, you can kiss your world, your human society, your innocent subgenius church goodbye forever.

783
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,900
Or perhaps, if by some accident of God, the Emperor Xandar were eliminated,

784
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,640
oh, then you would face the Tev One.

785
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,860
And do you think they're my only offspring?

786
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,080
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?

787
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,440
Just as Darth Vader's son Luke?

788
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,100
Was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence?

789
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,300
Do you think that I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?

790
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,500
Oh, no indeed, dear friends.

791
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,520
No indeedy, I say.

792
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,280
But you'll see.

793
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,400
Well, stay tuned for...

794
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,060
He isn't in our...

795
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,780
You've been listening to King Stang,

796
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,420
ultimate stud groupie attractor and mystic psychic power monger,

797
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,320
the very left brain of Dobbs,

798
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,640
the chosen bringer, dear friends of terror and lawsuits,

799
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,320
owner of the trademark of God on Earth,

800
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,140
slayer of would-be scribe ship usurpers,

801
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,280
subjector of all bobbies,

802
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,280
decider of degrees of fame of subgenius mortals,

803
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,460
second chosen of the fishers of wallets,

804
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,220
biggest, organed, and sexiest voiced entrapper of radio groupies,

805
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,300
subduer of hecklers,

806
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,840
butt-splitter of moonies,

807
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,160
exploiter of comedic idiot savants,

808
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,400
master of the saucepans,

809
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,380
sardonic over the cute violator of postal...

810
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh, forget it.

811
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,380
Thank you for bringing up Slack,

812
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,900
because I meant to bring that up with Reverend Drummond.

813
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,300
And that...

814
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,780
I know you're adverse to trying to exactly define Slack,

815
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,180
but I'd just like to hear your take for the uninitiated.

816
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:41,380
For those of us who have not been members of the subgenius church,

817
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,600
how would you describe to an outsider what Slack is?

818
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:45,920
Well...

819
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,080
Let me ask you a question.

820
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,420
In your mind right now,

821
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,180
what do you want Slack to be?

822
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,360
That's what it is.

823
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
You got it.

824
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,980
You got it.

825
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,640
See, I put it right there in your mind,

826
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,940
and you had your mind's eye,

827
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,180
and you looked right at it.

828
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, I did.

829
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,080
Well, that's...

830
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,540
Amen.

831
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,660
Amen, Reverend.

832
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,320
Amen.

833
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm at church today.

834
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,900
I want to thank you for all of that.

835
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,880
Well, this has been a blast.

836
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,960
It's so much fun.

837
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,600
The film is so much fun.

838
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,500
It's called J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

839
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,140
It is in virtual theaters.

840
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,160
Actually, it's been in virtual theaters for a couple of weeks now.

841
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,360
Tell us if we want to see this somewhere down the line,

842
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,860
if we can see it now or if we can see it in the near future.

843
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,840
Sandy K. Boone, how would we do that?

844
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,900
It's on Amazon.

845
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,000
It's on Fandango.

846
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,940
It's on iTunes.

847
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,120
It's on Apple.

848
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,880
And it's on Vudu right now.

849
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,400
It's on Amazon.

850
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,120
Oh, you said Amazon.

851
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:50,620
Okay.

852
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,320
Yeah, that's okay.

853
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:51,500
No.

854
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,640
And you can stream it.

855
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,960
The only way you can do it is rent it or buy it, but it's what?

856
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,720
$4.99?

857
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,580
Yeah, it's like $3.99 to rent and $9.99 to buy.

858
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,360
To buy.

859
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,020
I mean, it's like, go buy it.

860
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,300
I'm never going to make my money back, but at least some money would be great.

861
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,400
Listen, is $9.99 worth changing your life for the better?

862
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,560
Exactly.

863
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,140
It's cheaper than a membership.

864
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,080
That's right.

865
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,600
That's true.

866
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,540
$35 will get you a membership.

867
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,260
Yeah, that's right.

868
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,540
You can start your own church then.

869
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,300
Thank you.

870
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,520
They can go to subgeniusmovie.com.

871
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,540
And Reverend Drummond, if they choose to want to join the church, how would they do that?

872
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,200
Where would they go?

873
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,800
They go to subgenius.com.

874
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,660
There you go.

875
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,140
Look for the link that says new members.

876
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,260
Fantastic.

877
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,380
That's great.

878
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


879
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


885
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


886
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


887
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


888
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


889
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


890
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


891
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,380


892
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:44,660
Fantastic.

893
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,520
Well, I've got my hands in the air raised to the heavens.

894
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,200
And I want to thank both of you very, very much for spending some time with us.

895
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:02,000
Steve Wilcox, Dr. Philo Drummond, and also who is one of the founders of this amazing

institution, as well as director, producer, and writer of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church

of the Subgenius.

898
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,860
And that would be Sandy K. Boone.

899
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,060
Thank you so very much.

900
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,820
Thank you.

901
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,180
All right.

902

From PR News in Washington, I'm a humanitarian catastrophe.

908
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,320
We have a problem.

909
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,700
We don't have a leader in our county.

910
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,320
The person has history with the United States Department.

The State Department is upgrading its assessment of PR News.

913
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,740
It's mostly blank in Washington.

914

And this is your host, a king, pope, killer, Reverend Ivan Stang, arbiter of hitness, down-putter

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,000


924
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,180
It's about family.

Imagine there's no heaven.

937
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,520
It's easy if you try.

938
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,540
Imagine there's no heaven.

939
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,960
No hell below us.

940
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,900
Above us only sky.

941
00:55:53,060 --> 00:56:01,300
Imagine all the people living for today.

942
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,440
Imagine there's no countries.

943
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,580
It isn't hard.

944
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,360
Too.

945
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,220
Too.

946
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,900
Nothing to kill or die for.

947
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,360
And no religion too.

948
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:36,080
Imagine all the people living life in peace.

949
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,980
You may say I'm a dreamer.

950
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,440
But I'm not the only one.

951
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,780
I hope someday you will join us.

952
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,180
And the world will be as one.

953
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,260
Imagine no possessions.

954
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,820
I wonder if you can.

955
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,540
I wonder if you can.

956
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:12,540

975
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,460
And say, Ah..

976
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,040
I'm a dreamer

977
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,400

I'm a dreamer

982
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,240
Imagine all the people

983
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,460
Sharing all the world

984
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,340
You might say

985
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,120
I'm a dreamer

986
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
But I'm not the only one

987
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,800
I hope someday you will join us

And the world will live as one

989
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,900
Ah!

990
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,600
Play on it

991
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,920
Imagine

992
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,240
Live as one, y'all

993
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,920
Everybody say

994
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,440
Imagine

995
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,840
I'm a dreamer but I see it for everybody

996
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,420
Everyday, every day

997
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:27,960
Imagine

998
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,760
Imagine everybody living life

999
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,080
And having fun

1000
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,920
Imagine

1001
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,540
Hey!

1002
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,200
See it in your mind, mind

1003
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:38,800
Imagine

1004
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,560
Woohoo!

1005
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,380
One people, one nation

1006
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,720
Imagine

1007
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,180
Hey!

1008
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,140
Imagin' us living as one

1009
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,160
Mohamed

1010
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,020
Hey!

1011
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,340
John Lennon

1012
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:55,880
Imagine

1013
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,860
Peace of mind

1014
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,520
Imagine

1015
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:11,440
That was Cindy Blackman and her husband Carlos Santana.

1016
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,900
There's a pretty tripped out video of that on YouTube.

1017
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:22,460
This is your host and prayer partner Reverend Ivan Stang signing out and praising that old man Bob.

1018
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,040
Ahimsa!

1019
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,140
Ahoooga!

1020
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,560
Heeyayayayayayayayayayy

1021
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:39,100
But wait there's more, just for the internet version because this song would be illegal as hell to play on most of our real broadcast stations.

1022
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:49,100
Part of that batch that Velveteen Slice sent me, this is a band called The November Third,

1023
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,480
featuring somehow Jello Biafra.

1024
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,980
It's not for the children.

1025
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,160
Seriously.

1026
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,840
I fucked a Republican I thought I never would

1027
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,500
He's full of shit but I admit that it felt pretty good

1028
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,180
I fucked a Republican I fucked him in the ass

1029
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,960
He never knew how bad he'd lose until the votes were cast

1030
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:28,880
I fucked a Republican I fucked a Republican

1031
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,820
I fucked a Republican

1032
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,780
I fucked him in the face

1033
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,420
